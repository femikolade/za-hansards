<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>This is the first of a series of clauses in this Bill which vests very great powers in the hon. the Minister. In some of the clauses there are also certain powers provided for which are vested in officials. We <span class="col_7979-7980" refersTo="page_0324"/>know that this is an agreed measure. It is based on the experience of almost 100 years and it replaces measures which go back for almost a century. As the years have passed I think experience has shown that it is better to place these very great powers in the hands of the Minister concerned rather than in the hands of boards and other bodies, except in certain special circumstances where technical questions are involved and where these powers are left in the hands of officials. We do not contest that it is necessary in this Bill to vest these very great powers in the hands of the Minister, because if we had a law which was hide-bound it would simply mean that it would constantly be necessary to come back to Parliament in order to be able to get on with the job of developing the mineral resources of this country. We concede all that, but I think the hon. the Minister will agree that the powers which are provided for here are very far-reaching indeed. The amounts which may be involved in the exercise of these powers may be very considerable. These powers affect the rights of individuals in certain cases and they cover the widest possible field. We feel that this House, which in the last resort is the final authority in the country, should at least have an opportunity of intervening, if necessary. Many of these powers are powers which will be exercised without any publicity. I propose at a later stage to move an amendment which will provide for an annual report to be submitted by the Minister in respect of the exercise of these powers. If that is done, then there will be publicity, and there will be a ready opportunity for these matters to be raised in this House by any member who wishes to raise them. We do not propose to take up the time of the House by dealing with this question in each of the clauses in which it crops up. I am raising the matter under this clause therefore, the first clause in which these powers are granted, and when we come to the last of the clauses in which these powers are vested in the Minister, we will propose the insertion of a new clause which will provide a general umbrella cover. I can only express the hope that, when that time comes, we will have the support of the hon. the Minister for our amendment.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Tucker) has correctly indicated, this is a principle which is embodied in a large number of clauses. I think it may perhaps be better for us to discuss this principle when we deal with the amendment of the hon. member to the last clause.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I beg to move the amendment as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the following be a new clause to follow Clause 126:</p>

<block name="quote">127. The Minister shall once during every ordinary session of Parliament lay upon the Tables of the Senate and of the House of Assembly a report of the decisions taken by him, in pursuance of the powers vested in him by this Act, during the preceding calendar year.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister will notice that I have not sought to introduce a complicated provision or one which will give rise to technical difficulties. This is a very simple amendment which requires the Minister to lay on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament a report of the decisions taken by him under the powers which this Bill will give to him. Sir, I do not think it is necessary to debate this amendment at length. It is perfectly clear that very, very important matters are in the discretion of the Minister; there is no check whatsoever. We have conceded that it is necessary that the Minister should have these powers, but I think it is in the public interest and in the interest of this country that publicity should be given to the decisions taken, and in the simple form in which I have put the amendment I cannot see that there can be any objection to the inclusion of this new clause. I sincerely hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to accept it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>In terms of this Bill there are 45 matters in connection with which the Minister has the power to make decisions and in all of those cases he has to use his own discretion. These matters vary from important questions such as prospecting and digging agreements in terms of Clause 20 and mining leases under Clause 52 to less important decisions such as the approval of diggers&#x2019; certificates or the issuing of prospecting permits to companies or other corporate bodies. Literally hundreds or perhaps even thousands of these various things have to be done by the Minister annually. These matters include the issuing of diggers&#x2019; certificates or the issuing of a residential and work certificate. These certificates are sometimes refused either because of the fact that the applicant has in the past been found guilty of an offence under the Diamond Act or because strong suspicion exists against such a person, or sometimes because of the fact that he does not need a certificate of this nature.</p>

<p><span class="col_7981-7982" refersTo="page_0325"/>Hon. members will realize that it would be an impossible task to table a report containing the reasons why certificates had been refused to certain persons or companies. I do not think it is desirable to table a report of this nature because action is taken on police reports which are confidential. The Minister only takes action on certain grounds. He cannot summarily grant a prospecting right to anyone. The owner of private land has the right to the precious stones that might be found on that land and he nominates the person to whom he wants to give digging rights if that person has a certificate. The Bill also provides what has to be done if precious stones are discovered. In terms of this Bill, 50 claims have to be granted to the discoverer and the owner; there is no discretion in this regard. Mining leases are also granted to those persons in the normal course of events. I do not know of cases in which these have been granted to any other persons. They are the persons who are entitled to them. As far as State land is concerned they can of course peg freely, except in Namaqualand; this was later extended so as to include the Cape west coast area as well. The rest of the State land is available for those purposes. But the hon. member himself will know that as far as State land is concerned, although it is in the discretion of the Minister to make allocations, the Minister cannot make the allocations himself; provision is now made in the Bill&#x2014;and this is simply a repetition of the existing provision&#x2014;that the matter must be referred to the Diamond Advisory Committee. That committee is sitting at the moment and must make recommendations to the Minister. I mention this for the information of the hon. member because it is clear that the discretion of the Minister to grant mining leases is extremely limited. The same right exists in respect of gold, base minerals and oil. If all these documents have to be tabled they will eventually run into thousands. This Bill only deals with precious stones but the same principle is contained in the Base Minerals Act and the Natural Oil Act. If this principle is accepted here, therefore, it is logical to expect it to be extended to the other Acts as well. Hon. members are at all times at liberty to obtain information regarding prospecting leases and so forth which are granted but there has never been a request for this information in the past because the same principle has held good over the years in regard to the granting of mining leases. I think therefore that it is really not necessary to insert a clause such as that proposed by the hon. member. As far as the terms of mining leases are concerned I can say that all the terms laid down for mining leases or prospecting leases or prospecting and digging agreements, both in the case of precious stones and base minerals, are referred to the committee appointed in terms of the Gold Act. That committee lays down the terms of the leases, not the Minister. That committee consists of the Government Mining Engineer, the Commissioner for Inland Revenue, the Registrar of Mining Titles and two other persons. It is a committee of five members; it is a technical committee which inquires into mining leases and makes recommendations. The Minister himself makes no decision in this connection until such time as this technical committee has considered the matter. In the light of these facts, therefore, I hope that the hon. member will not insist upon his amendment. I want to give him the assurance that if hon. members want details in connection with any particular group of allocations, that information will always be made available to them.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate the hon. the Deputy Ministers statement that we can always ask for this information. What we are seeking to achieve is that there should be publicity in respect of these matters. I am not concerned with the particulars of every case where a digger certificate is granted. Obviously all that would be necessary in those cases would be to indicate in general the number of certificates granted and the number refused. That is not the sort of thing which I have in mind in moving this amendment. We know that there are committees which have to investigate these matters; we know that the Department goes into these matters and advises the Minister, and we are not suggesting that there would be arbitrary action. But, Sir, one cannot get away from the fact that very considerable powers are vested in the Minister under this Bill. We know that there have been occasions when it has been necessary in the interest of the economy of this country to refuse to grant further certificates or to enter into further mining leases, but I am quite convinced by what the hon. the Deputy Minister said. I believe that it is right that a report on these matters should be Tabled in both Houses of Parliament. I can see no difficulty in the preparation of such a report, and I think that only good could result from it if the Minister agreed to accept this amendment. If such a report were laid on the Table and there was no objection to it, that in itself would indicate approval of the Minister&#x2019;s administration of the Department. Sir, there is no point in arguing this matter at great length; what is important is the principle that is involved here, and I appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to accept the principle involved here. If he wishes to recast the amendment to meet the difficulty mentioned by him, we would readily agree to it. It seems to us that a simple clause of this sort could only do good. We believe that it would lead to sound administration and I hoped that the hon. the Deputy Minister would be prepared to accept the insertion of this new clause in spite of what he said here this morning.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>This clause provides for the discharge of the Group Areas Development Board in respect of an amount of R 1,649,847. Will the Minister give us the reason for the write-off of this amount?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that there were two different bodies in the past&#x2014;the Group Areas Development Board and the Group Areas Board. The administrative expenses of the Group Areas Board were voted while the administrative expenses of the Group Areas Development Board were met from loan funds. In 1962 these two bodies were incorporated in the Department of Community Development. All these administrative expenses are now of course voted. This amount represents the administrative expenditure incurred prior to 1962. It will, after all, have to be written off at some stage or other and because the interest will merely mount up, it may as well be written off now. These are the ordinary administrative expenses incurred on Loan Account in terms of the Group Areas Development Act. Now that that particular set-up has disappeared, we are following the normal procedure in that an amount will be voted under the Vote of my colleague each year.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 5,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This clause provides that guarantees may be furnished in respect of certain hotels. I want to ask&#x2014;I do not know whether I must ask the hon. the Minister of Finance who is introducing this measure or the Minister of Tourism&#x2014;what the requirements are which are referred to in this Bill. As the clause is worded now&#x2014;and I hope that is the intention&#x2014; it gives the Minister of Tourism the power to give financial guarantees in respect of a wide range of hotels. When the Minister announced that he would give assistance to three prestige hotels he specially stated at the time that that assistance was in regard to prestige hotels, but the Bill does not say that. I should like to know&#x2014;and I hope that it is the position&#x2014; whether similar assistance will later be offered to other hotels even though it is only in respect of prestige hotels at this stage. All tourists are not rich. We hope to bring many hundreds of thousands of people to South Africa and they are not all going to be millionaires. They are not all going to be able to afford to pay the prices these prestige hotels will charge. We must therefore provide lower-priced accommodation but of a decent standard and those hotels will require some sort of financial assistance. I hope that the wide terms of this clause, terms which provide for assistance to any hotel meeting the requirements of the Minister of Tourism, will not only apply to prestige hotels but to other hotels as well. Not only is this a wide clause but I hope it will be widely applied to the benefit of the hotel industry as a whole.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. member that the clause is basically general in its terms. The reason for <span class="col_7985-7986" refersTo="page_0327"/>that this is the legal terminology which I as the Minister require at this stage. In regard to his question whether this would only apply to prestige hotels and not to other hotels, I want to tell him that this is entirely intended as a measure to enable the Government to carry out its undertaking in respect of prestige hotels in Johannesburg. Basically the hotel industry is in the hands of the private sector. The Government decided to afford some financial assistance, in certain circumstances, to international prestige hotels in Johannesburg. The intention is not to apply it generally. The hon. member will notice in the Bill that there are conditions which I as Minister can lay down. These here are that they should comply with the standard of international prestige hotels. In certain other countries in the world they may assist international hotels but it does not apply to the hotel industry as a whole. In some countries they don&#x2019;t even assist international prestige hotels. But this Government decided to assist international hotels to raise certain finance. I also lay down the condition that they should be at an international terminal like Johannesburg The member will notice that the clause provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, may, if in any particular case, he deems it expedient&#x2026;</block>

<p>The Minister deemed it expedient in Johannesburg because of the fact that the Carlton Hotel had closed down and that there was very little accommodation of the type necessary for an international centre like Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Yes, in consultation with the Minister of Finance. May I also add that the Minister of Finance laid down certain conditions with which we agreed. Conditions under which finance could be guaranteed provided the local authority was also prepared to accept its share of the responsibility.

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) will appreciate that when it comes to the question of finance in any legislation it is always done in consultation with the Minister of Finance. I am quite happy to accept the over-riding decision of the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>The hon. member will also see that reference is made to 1 January 1964. It is retrospective to that date; it is not retrospective further back than that date. The rest of the Bill does leave certain decisions to the Minister of Tourism and others to the Minister in Consultation with the Minister of Finance. It also refers to erection and alteration and it is in that respect that this clause will operate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Of course this clause says nothing about prestige hotels. We who represent constituencies in Johannesburg welcome this step because if there is any city which needs first-class hotel accommodation of a prestige character it is certainly the city of Johannesburg. I think the Minister will agree with me that the class of hotel which is contemplated to be assisted is not generally the class of hotel which is occupied by all classes of tourists. The bulk of the tourists who come to our country do not occupy accommodation of this class. The people who will occupy this high class of accommodation will be those who operate executive accounts, as they are known, or company accounts. That is, they do not pay themselves but the organizations on whose behalf they have come here pay their accounts. Very few tourists occupy these right-rates prestige hotels.</p>

<p>The clause does not only provide for assistance in the erection of the hotel from 1 January 1964, but it also provides that this type of assistance can be given in respect of the alteration of an hotel establishment from 1 January 1964. That is why the requirements of the Minister are so pertinent to the issue. Before proprietors of existing hotel premises alter their premises to meet the requirements of the Minister they would like clarity in regard to the conditions with which they have to comply before they make application. The Minister has given us no clarity in that respect. The explanatory memorandum gives us only a glimpse at that aspect of the commission&#x2019;s work which the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs has appointed to go into the whole question of the hotel industry and its rating. If it is the Minister&#x2019;s intention to lay down conditions on which existing establishments can approach him for financial assistance in order to effect alterations to their premises so that they come up to the required standard for tourists. I think the Minister must be a little more specific. If he is unable to state now what those requirements are and if he is waiting on the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s report I think he should say so quite clearly so that there can be a clearer understanding of the position as far as the hotel industry is concerned. I ask the Minister whether he can give us clarification.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>It was considered expedient for certain international hotels to be erected in Johannesburg. The expediency was in relation to a particular place and a particular type of hotel. Those were the conditions which were accepted. I have made the point quite clear. There has been no statement by the Government that this will apply to all classes of hotels.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>The clause says so.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<from><span class="col_7987-7988" refersTo="page_0328"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>I said the I clause was general and that was why I described the details and the implications of it. The mere fact that the clause is general is a legal necessity. As far as the Government and the Minister of Finance are concerned and the Minister of Tourism this applies to a restricted type of hotel. That is the condition that has been laid down at this stage. The hon. member says these high-class hotels are only occupied by tourists with a great deal of money and by people who run executive accounts. That may be so but I nevertheless consider it necessary that those kind of hotels should be established in Johannesburg. When it comes to the general run of hotels for tourists this clause does not apply; it only applies to the type of hotel I have mentioned.</p>

<p>As far as the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s report is concerned I have not got that report. I see its terms of reference are: (a) Whether the hotel industry serves its purpose and providing in the needs of tourism and, if not, what are the shortcomings of the industry; (b) what are the factors impeding the healthy development of the industry; and (c) what measures are necessary and justified to enable the hotel industry to serve its purpose. Those are matters the Hotel Commission is inquiring into. But the Government did not wait for the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s report to act as far as these prestige hotels were concerned. This is the power which is required to enable the Government to carry out the assurance it has given to the international prestige hotels. No assurances have been given in respect of any other type of hotel whatsoever.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would ask the hon. the Minister to explain the circumstances which gave rise to this power being taken. I am well aware that there is an explantion in the White Paper that the intention is to give regulations the force of law whereas ever since Union they have always worked very well as a non-statutory administrative type of direction. I ask this question because it seems to me that powers are going to be taken, as the White Paper says, to empower the Board to impose penalties. Normally that is a contractual matter. Seeing that the Tender Board is only going to deal with contractual matters, will it now have power to impose penalties or to predetermine damages over and above any contractual undertakings to which a tenderer might have committed himself?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The reason for this clause is very fully set out in the explanatory memorandum. The Chairman of the Tender Board has met with this difficulty that there are certain irregularities; people furnish wrong information on the basis of which they are given the ordinary preferential right in terms of the regulations. If they give the wrong information the position is that nothing can be done about it. If their tender was the lowest tender, even on the correct information, nothing can be done about it. In sub-section (2) we now give these regulations the force of law. The Tender Board can now impose a penalty in all cases. Penalties are already imposed in cases where tenderers have profited by their iniquity but penalties will also now be imposed in even those cases where there is no direct profit to ensure that we get the utmost good faith at all times in a matter in which really the State iself is vulnerable. I move this at the request of the Chairman of the Tender Board.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 18,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As was pointed out during the second-reading debate, this provision introduces a new principle into public finance. The powers under the Loan Act have thus far been used entirely for fiscal purposes. Once this provision goes through, the Act extends authority to the Government to use the provisions of the Act as a means of controlling the monetary market or &#x201C;for the proper regulation of internal monetary conditions&#x201D;, as the clause puts it. As the hon. the Minister himself pointed out during the second-reading debate, this additional power is being taken over and above the excess borrowing powers already vested in the Government for fiscal purposes. Those excess borrowing powers which for many years stood at R6,000,000 were first increased to R30,000,000 and last year they were increased to R60,000,000. All that is subject to a form of control both by the Controller and Auditor-General and by Parliament itself. But these additional powers, as far as I can determine, are not going to be kept within the maximum limit to which the Controller and Auditor-General is obliged to give a certificate from time to time. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is now taking power to invest abroad&#x2014;something which is denied the South African citizen&#x2014;there is no opposition in principle on the part of this side of the House to the extension of the Government&#x2019;s borrowing powers for the purposes set out in this clause. Since normal methods of keeping Parliament informed are not likely to operate, it does seem that some additional provision should be made for Parliament to be informed as to how these powers are being used. I have handed to the Minister a proposed amendment to add another sub-section which provides that information should be tabled in this House at regular intervals so as to keep Parliament informed. In a very brief discussion I was able to have with the Minister, he indicated that he was not unfavourably disposed to some provision of this kind. What is really needed, Sir, is that Parliament should be kept informed as to what happened during the preceding year. I am not so sure that it <span class="col_7989-7990" refersTo="page_0329"/>should be tied to a financial year so long as information is tabled covering a period of 12 months. I think it would be preferable if it covered the period till the end of December. In that case the information will be available early in the session and before the financial proposals come before the House. That is the type of information that is needed. I do not propose moving the amendment I have handed to the Minister; I prefer him to deal with the matter as he sees fit at this stage, and I shall then decide whether or not to move my amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) gave me a copy of his amendment just before proceedings commenced this morning. I have not had much time to consider it, but I am quite prepared to give effect in the Bill itself to the undertaking I gave him yesterday in the course of the second-reading debate, that I would lay before Parliament once a year the information in relation to all borrowings under Clause 18. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is rather unnecessary in certain respects and falls short in other respects. It is unnecessary in the sense that he wants monthly returns, but there are monthly returns of all exchequer receipts and issues. That is purely an administrative measure, and I am prepared in those particular returns to show as a separate item any borrowings in terms of Clause 18. I think that will meet most of the requirements of the hon. member in regard to a monthly statement. As far as the annual statement is concerned, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following sub-section at the end of the proposed new Section 3bis:<br/>(6) The Minister shall as soon as possible after the thirty-first day of March in each year lay on the Table of the Senate and of the House of Assembly a statement showing the amounts borrowed under sub-section (1) during the year ending on that date and the manner in which the said amounts were invested under subsection (3).</block>

<p>I think that meets the requirements of the hon. member, and I therefore move accordingly.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a second time.</p>

<p>As I foreshadowed last year in the course of the debate on my Vote, a Select Committee was appointed at the beginning of this Session to investigate the proposals relating to the contemplated changes in our coinage. The Select Committee has now submitted a report in which the unanimous conclusions arrived at by the Committee are set out.</p>

<p>The Select Committee is convinced that these changes in our coinage are necessary and essential at this stage, and in the main the effect of its recommendations is that our coins will be smaller, lighter and more durable. The weight of the whole series will be more than twice as light as that of our present currency, and the most important single factor is that the &#x201C;white" coins will now be made of nickel instead of silver. Our silver coins, of course, are made of 500 standard silver. Next to silver nickel is the most attractive and most serviceable bullion, and it is used a great deal in various parts of the world. Our future coins, made of silver, will be able to remain in circulation for a very long period without becoming unsightly, as happens only too frequently in the case of our present coins.</p>

<p>The second important idea is to convert the 50c-piece, which is 39 m.m. in diameter and which weighs more than 28 grammes, into a much smaller practical coin. In its new form the 50c-piece will be only 28 m.m. in diameter and its weight will be about one-third of the weight of the old coin, and it is hoped that this will result in its being circulated more freely, which in turn may possibly have a salutary effect on the change pattern as we know it.</p>

<p>The Select Committee further recommended that the tickey should not be withdrawn from circulation, and in terms of a further recommendation of the committee a new 2c piece will be brought into circulation with a view to testing its popularity and serviceability. It was also recommended that a silver R1 piece be minted but naturally of a higher standard than the present one&#x2014;I think it is to be 800 standard silver&#x2014;a R1 piece which will not become as unsightly as our present silver coins; which will possibly prove very <span class="col_7991-7992" refersTo="page_0330"/>popular with many members of the public and which will possibly relieve the pressure on the circulation of R1 notes.</p>

<p>Amongst other things the committee also recommended the issue of two new gold pieces, that is to say, a R5 piece and one which contains precisely one ounce troy-weight of gold.</p>

<p>So much with regard to the recommendations of the committee with regard to these matters. The Government is prepared to accept all these recommendations subject to one proviso. The Government has not had an opportunity of properly considering the practical effect of the recommendations in respect of the R5 gold coin and the so-called Trojan. The Government has certain misgivings with regard to these two items but is nevertheless prepared to include both these coins in the series subject to the understanding that if it considers it to be necessary it will introduce an amendment next session to withdraw them from the new series. In view of the fact that the relevant coins would not have been minted in the near future in any event, this proviso will not really cause any dislocation therefore.</p>

<p>The entire series of coins will therefore consist of the following denominations: R1, 50c, 20c. 10c, 5c, 2&#x00BD;c, 2c, lc and &#x00BD;c.</p>

<p>The proposed switch-over has been devised in such a way that it will cause the minimum of confusion with the present series of coins as well as the least possible disruption of commercial transactions. It is felt that it will be possible to make a start with the switch-over in about nine months and that it should be possible to complete the whole process within about two or three years. An Advisory Council will be appointed in the near future to deal with all aspects of the contemplated switchover.</p>

<p>As far as the designs on the proposed series of coins are concerned, this change offers an ideal opportunity for the introduction of really attractive coins with a South African character. The Government will come to a decision in this regard in due course.</p>

<p>The Bill, which defines the activities of the Mint, and which is now before the House, is a new one but in actual fact it merely consolidates the existing laws and brings about necessary amendments which have been recommended by the Select Committee. For procedural reasons, however, it is being presented to the House in the form of a new Bill. Clauses 11. 12 (2), 16 and 25 relate to the change in our coinage. Provision is also being made for the abolition of the Coinage Fund which the Select Committee on Public Accounts recommended a few years ago (Clause 8) and for steps to be taken against persons who fraudulently use slugs in slot-machines (Clause 19). For the rest the Bill is purely a consolidating measure.</p>

<p>I think it is clear that our new coins have been designed with an eye on the future. They will be lighter, smaller and more attractive than the present series. In this respect they take into account the experience gained in other countries as well as world tendencies. The series is perhaps a little overloaded but it looks as though the Select Committee is of the opinion that at least one of the series will disappear eventually. I think we will have cause to be proud of our new coins. I therefore move the second reading with confidence.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>In so far as this Bill embodies the unanimous findings of the Select Committee, it can be considered as being an agreed measure, and enjoying the support of all sections of the House. The handy little note which embodies the views of the Select Committee and all the evidence that was heard only came into the hands of members yesterday, and therefore one has to assume that hon. members on both sides of the House have implicit confidence in their colleagues that they put on the Select Committee and are prepared to accept their findings, which are embodied in this Bill. If that is so, this Bill will have a quick and smooth passage, as certainly it will from this side of the House.</p>

<p>The Select Committee, as you will see, Mr. Speaker, heard a great deal of evidence from all sections of the people. It heard a great number of different views and different viewpoints, that is to say, from different aspects. For instance, I personally found it a most interesting committee to sit on for that very reason that aspects were put before the Committee which perhaps most people had not considered before in thinking about this question of our coins. For instance, one thing to which the committee had to give very serious consideration was the position of blind people, and the difficulties experienced by people who have to handle large number of coins in very bad light. Take, for instance, bus conductors. In considering the form which our new coinage should take, one has to take into consideration the large class of people who are blind and the large class of people who have to handle coins in bad light, so as to try and ensure that the sizes were reasonably easily distinguishable and that not only in size but in texture they could not easily be confused. If you multiply that particular aspect by a good many times, you will see that the Select Committee really did have a good many interests to reconcile, and that is perhaps why, as the Minister said, the list of coins proposed in the new Bill is slightly longer than might have been expected.</p>

<p>I think that this Bill embodies modern practice as it is found all over the world, both in regard to the texture and the size and the weight and the cleanliness of the coinage, and I think, as the hon. Minister has said, that sufficient tolerance is provided in the Bill for the public needs to show themselves in practice. There were very many opinions expressed before the Select Committee as to what was likely to happen in future. Some people said one thing would happen, some people said another thing would happen. Some people said <span class="col_7993-7994" refersTo="page_0331"/>that one coin would disappear, some people said that another coin was essential. They were all matters of opinion upon which no one can pronounce a definite judgment. That is why the Select Committee found it advisable to say, Well, let us have a system of coins where practical experience can tell us just what is the public need, what is the demand and what serves the public requirements, which is the main function of coinage. I think that that is a wise and a sensible way to look at the problems. The hon. Minister has pointed out that provision is made for the change-over, which of course from the public point of view is a very important aspect indeed because inevitably some of the new coins will be rather like some of the older coins in size and could easily be confused. Therefore the change-over will have to be done systematically, and it will be under the control of a committee on which the commercial banks and the Reserve Bank will largely be represented, because they are the people who will have to put the thing into force from the practical point of view, and I am quite certain they will do it systematically. Provided the change-over is not rushed, I am of the opinion, Sir, that the change-over will be made with little or no public inconvenience, and I believe that we will have a set of coins which is an improvement on the present coins which are clean, which are light and easily handled, and once the people get used to them, which they will do without difficulty if the change-over is done systematically, will be accepted by everybody. We support the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>I also want to say a few words about this Bill. Let me say immediately that it was a privilege and a pleasure for me to be chairman of this Select Committee. We obtained a great deal of very useful information and there was wonderful co-operation on the part of all members who were determined to co-operate with one another as much as possible. If we had not had this determination to co-operate, I doubt whether we would ever have been able to bring up a unanimous report in connection with this matter. My thanks to the hon. members of the Select Committee for the manner in which this matter was dealt with.</p>

<p>When we look at the evidence which we now have before us in book form, we see that a number of memoranda in connection with which we did not call for supporting evidence were submitted to the Committee. In these cases the memoranda made the intentions of these persons very clear to us and every word of evidence placed before us was considered before our eventual decision was arrived at I want to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) in connection more specifically with the people who have to identify our coins by the sense of touch. In this regard, the task of the Committee was actually different to that of the Department. The Department went more by what they considered would be an ideal coinage system but we also had to consider the happenings in every-day life and the views of practical people in regard to the matter. In this regard we had before us every possible opinion on this matter and we gave our attention to these views. We found that there were certain shortcomings in the proposals which were originally made, for example, the differences between various coins and the possibility that people could become confused as far as the coins were concerned. There was also the question of the value of these coins, the value that each coin should have. These were all factors which were put forward in the evidence submitted. The evidence contained in this report is very interesting and persons who like interesting and at the same time informative reading, will find this report almost more absorbing than a thriller with four murders on page 1.</p>

<p>I also want to mention, as did the hon. member for Constantia, the problem of blind people, as well as the problem in regard to other people who have to handle money quickly and people who have to handle money in a poor light. This is a very important factor and it was for these reasons that the Committee deemed fit to have no two coins of the old series or of the new series more or less the same size. Although they are similar to one another, they are so different in use that people will have become completely used to the new coin before the old coin of more or less the same size is withdrawn. No real confusion can arise in this regard. The difficulty is, of course, that a person will now be able to read that the diameter of a coin will be a certain figure, although he will not see the coin himself. When one compares the patterns and the feel of the various coins with one another&#x2014;those which have smooth edges and those which have milled edges&#x2014;one realizes that the whole matter has been co-ordinated in order to eliminate confusion. We considered this to be one of our most important tasks.</p>

<p>I want to conclude but I feel that I cannot do so without referring back to the Decimalization Commission which was appointed in 1958 and of which I also had the privilege to be a member. There are certain ideas in circulation which I feel should be placed on record, ideas in connection with the activities of that Commission which have never been placed on record in this House in the proper way. The first point that I want to mention without becoming involved in any argument is that the Decimalization Commission found that the lc piece was a too large unit of currency for the price shades in the country and that accordingly there had to be fractions of cents. Since 1958 the cost of living has risen by 8 per cent. This does not make a very great impression upon the question of coins, nor does it double the value of the smaller unit of currency. It took two world wars and the Anglo-Boer War and 100 years and more of inflation to remove the farthing from the market, so nobody can say that the &#x00BD;c will disappear from circulation <span class="col_7995-7996" refersTo="page_0332"/>within the foreseeable future. But this is something which the future will have to show. I just want to make it very clear that the Decimalization Commission felt that one could not have a decimal system without fractions, having in mind our price shades. The second thing in connection with which there appeared from the evidence submitted to us to be some misunderstanding was in regard to the 2s. piece and the half-crown of the old coinage series. There were many members of the Decimalization Commission who felt that we should retain the half-crown. It was eventually decided to retain the 2s. piece. The reason for this is my difficulty. The reason was not that the 2s. piece fitted in well with a decimal system. We accepted the position at the time that one had halves and quarters and so forth in a decimal system. As soon as one divides, one has fractions, and as soon as one multiplies, it works out to ten. That is more or less how the public works with money in everyday life. The reason why the 2s. piece was chosen as a unit and not the half-crown was because of a specific request from the Department of Native Affairs at the time&#x2014;this is now the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. They based their request on these grounds: They said: The two most important coins as far as the Bantu are concerned, are the tickey and the shilling. The Bantu know that there are four tickeys in a shilling and that there are two shillings in a 2s. piece, but they do not like the sixpence and the half-crown. For this reason they always prefer to take the 2s. piece as a unit of currency instead of the half-crown. They do not like the half-crown. I mention this merely to indicate why it was decided at the time to have a 20c piece and not a 25c piece. There is some confusion in connection with this matter to-day. It is argued that this was done because the 2s. piece fits better into the decimal series better than the half-crown does. I just want to emphasize the fact that this fact had nothing to do with the case.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that I am pleased that the Government has accepted the report of the Select Committee. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that we are not wedded to the question of the R5 gold piece. But I think that the committee was quite unanimous as far as the desirability of having the Trojan was concerned. One may give it another name, but it is certainly a wonderful thing to have. We had in mind a coin which complies more or less with what is proposed here. It is really a coin which, apart from its market value, everyone will be proud to own and to be able to say it is something which we make in South Africa. I also want to say the same of the proposed R1 piece. When one compares this attractive coin, which is 80 per cent silver, with the dirty ten-shilling notes that we have to carry around with us, one wonders whether anyone will still want to carry a ten-shilling note about with him once that coin is available. I hope that that coin will come into circulation soon and that it will enjoy the popularity which I think everyone will be convinced it will enjoy after they have seen it. I think that these two coins of which South Africa will be proud. Numismatists will also be proud to have these coins in their collection.</p>

<p>Like the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever), I was also a member of the Decimal Coinage Commission, but he that puts his hand to the plough should not look back. I think we should look forward. To-day we have reached a new stage in our progress towards finality, but finality is always something which is a long way off. It is better to journey hopefully than to arrive; and we on this Select Committee did journey hopefully. We journeyed and felt that we could reach unanimity on the next stage towards a perfect coinage system. I hope some day it will be perfect.</p>

<p>Whenever one discusses coins and decimalization, one appreciates the truth of the old Latin tag, <i>quat homines tot sententiae&#x2014;</i>so many men, so many minds. However many men you have on a Select Committee, that number of opinions you will have. I think the achievement of the Select Committee was a great achievement, to achieve unanimity, even though it did not please every individual entirely. In the light of our experience, I think we have made great progress. If we compare our experience with that of Australia, New Zealand and Britain, countries which have embarked on a similar enterprise, we see that we have made much greater progress. I sincerely hope that when this report is in its final form&#x2014;and by the way, I should like to congratulate the members of the staff for getting it into this form so quickly; I think it is a splendid piece of work&#x2014;I should like certain people in Australia and New Zealand to receive copies, because they are concerned with similar problems. They have not yet been able to achieve unanimity about the names of their major coins. It is a very difficult problem and, because of that, I think the chairman of the Select Committee deserves great praise for having persuaded his Committee to come to a unanimous decision. I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill.</p>

<p>All that remains for me to do now is to express my gratitude in the first place to hon. members who have given this Bill such a good reception and, secondly, to the Select Committee which devoted many hours of work to this subject and really made a great effort to reach as much agreement in this regard as possible. My hearty thanks to them. I think that they realized that we had to put our coinage system in order for the next 50 or 100 years. They showed sufficient imagination not to shrink from the task imposed upon them. In the third place I also want to direct a word of thanks to my Department, particularly to the Director of the Mint, who has been particularly <span class="col_7997-7998" refersTo="page_0333"/>zealous in making himself acquainted with the position. He and the Fact-finding Committee which I appointed during the recess contributed largely towards increasing our knowledge of the subject in general, and we are very grateful to him for having acquired that knowledge, and for having made a special study to these problems.</p>

<p>I am very pleased that things have gone so well, because there is need for haste as far as this Bill is concerned. In the first place, hon. members know that the price of silver continues to rise, and it will eventually be completely uneconomic, even at the 500 standard, to mint coins of the present size. In the second place, the owners of slot machines have stopped importing these machines until such time as there is certainty in regard to the coinage system, and they have started worrying us in this regard. I am very pleased that we have been able to dispose of the matter this Session. In the third place, if we had to leave this matter standing over until next year, it would simply have meant that the change-over would have been delayed for a year. We wanted the change-over to take place as soon as possible. I am very pleased that things have gone so smoothly. I also want to agree with the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) that this is in effect the second instalment of our Decimalization Act of a few years ago. This is the rounding off of that Act. Now we have a new system and we will also have new coins. I think, too, that the designs on the coins will also be completely new.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>In this Bill we are asked to approve of the use by the Government for the administration of the country&#x2019;s three accounts amounting to almost R1,400,000,000; and I believe that entitles the Opposition finally to state its misgivings about the policy of the Minister and of the Government as reflected in the financial measures introduced by the Minister. To make the attitude of the Opposition clear, I think I should start by moving the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That" and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the second reading of the Appropriation Bill <i>inter alia</i> because the Government have shown themselves in the policies they seek to apply to be collectively and individually incompetent and unfit to govern South Africa as a modem and developing state and to lead South Africa through the difficulties that beset us both internally and externally.&#x201D;</block>

<p>We believe, and we know, that that amendment reflects the opinion of growing numbers of people in South Africa. It is, of course, an accurate assessment of the opinion of the official Opposition, but it also reflects in growing measure the temper of the people of South Africa. We know that members opposite like to pretend that things politically are going remarkably well with the Government. They even, for instance, speak of a breakthrough to the people of Natal, a claim they could not substantiate at the Ixopo by-election, and a claim which at best can be founded only on the disillusionment of some of the new immigrants who come to South Africa from other African territories, and who come here embittered by their experience of governments in Europe and in Africa, and who therefore, one can understand, think that the Nationalist Party may offer some better prospects for them; but our experience is that they do not stay here long before they appreciate the differences between the situation in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa, and it does not take long before certainly they come to appreciate the incompetence and inadequacy of this Government in South Africa. But what is more interesting, and this can be substantiated by the experience of every member of this House, is that there are signs of disillusionment among Government members. If we look at the debates of the last month or two, it is surprising that those members who in the past made a contribution&#x2014;I am talking about ordinary members and not members of the Cabinet&#x2014;to the discussions in this House which was constructive, and who could bring reasoned arguments to bear in support of the policies of the Government, have been singularly silent. The Government has apparently had to rely on the support of hon. members like the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman), the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) and the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling), distinguished members of this House, who are better known for bluster than for argument. When the Government comes to the stage where it has to rely for support in this House on bluster rather than argument, then indeed it is clearly evidence of a decline of enthusiasm in its own ranks for the policy and the administration of the Government.</p>

<p>The amendment we have moved is based on the general administration of South Africa by this Government. It applies in some measure, to a smaller or to a greater extent, to the manner in which every member of the Cabinet conducts his business. We have no sympathy for the fact that their policies and administrations are leading South Africa into a state of disillusion with them as a Government. We have some small measure of sympathy only with the hon. the Minister of Finance. It is his duty to reflect in the financial affairs of <span class="col_7999-8000" refersTo="page_0334"/>the country the consequences of Government policy as a whole. Therefore he has to come to this House and accept responsibility and to face the consequences of the policy of all the members of the Government. Any man who finds himself in that unhappy position deserves a measure of sympathy, even from the Opposition.</p>

<p>We see some of the difficulties the hon. the Minister finds himself in in the fact that he sits to-day with a surplus of R 128,000,000. The interesting thing about that is that that surplus was announced in his Budget speech as being R80,000,000. That in itself was a gross miscalculation; yet, within a fortnight, the Minister had to come back to us and admit that he had made a further mistake of 50 per cent. He was out by R40,000,000, in a fortnight. The most striking of it all is that, owing to the policies of the Government and its incompetence, the Minister, with a windfall like that, with a blessing from Providence like that, R128,000,000, cannot give necessary relief to the taxpayers and to the middle and lower income groups. To understand the enormity of this omission and of this unfair extraction from the pockets of the people of South Africa, I would remind you, Sir, of two facts.</p>

<p>The one is that this surplus, which the Minister cannot use to give the people relief, is 50 per cent more than the total sum of money asked for on Revenue Account by Mr. Havenga in 1938, the last Budget before the war, which was about &#x00A3;40,000,000. The same Mr. Havenga came to this House in August 1948, just after the present Government came into power, and announced it as his intention and his policy that he would strive to introduce a Budget of less than &#x00A3;100,000,000. The surplus now is 50 per cent more than Mr. Havenga hoped to make the total Budget then. I am not criticizing that, but what I am criticizing is that where this enormous surplus is available there is nothing in it for the man who pays the taxes. This Minister of Finance used to support statements made by Mr. Havenga and Mr. Hofmeyr on what a Minister of Finance is entitled to demand from the taxpayer. Both those hon. gentlemen used to state again and again that a government is entitled to take from the taxpayers in any one year more money than it needs for the administration of the country, and the Minister of Finance supported that. But look at the position to-day. He is taking from the taxpayers R 128,000,000 more than he needs for the administration of South Africa, and he cannot give a penny back to the taxpayers. For that he has an excuse, which is that it is his duty to combat inflation. Without further analysis it sounds good. Possibly it is the duty of a Minister of Finance to combat inflation, but what is inflation? I am not a great expert, but from my reading I learnt that inflation simply means that you have a situation where too much money is chasing too few goods. You have a situation where the capacity of the nation to consume outstrips its capacity to produce. But that does not mean that that is an excuse which exonerates the Government. It may be typical of the blame that attaches to the Government. Other countries in a similar situation can give their people spectacular tax relief. The latest example is the U.S.A., where the Johnson administration is giving tax relief in pursuance of the policy announced by him to eliminate poverty in the U.S.A. What would it not mean to South Africa if we had a Government which also tried to eliminate poverty? Why cannot this Government do so? There is greater government spending in the U.S.A. than there is proportionately in South Africa, and there is a larger income <i>per capita</i> than here, yet they have inflation under control. Only yesterday the Minister told us that the dollar is still one of the most stable currencies in the world, in spite of this vast spending and tax relief. Why cannot this Government do the same? I will tell you why, Sir, by telling you why the American Government can do it. The American Government had the imagination even in the previous century and up to 1922 to bring in immigrants in large numbers to help them to increase the productivity of the nation. This Government, from 1948 to 1960, refused to carry out an immigration policy for which the foundations had been laid by the previous United Party Government. It shows incompetence, lack of vision and foresight. Secondly, in the U.S.A, it is one of their great sources of pride that they use the skills of their people in the interests of the entire community. Under this Government I believe that South Africa is one of the few countries where, as a matter of general policy, the Government sets about excluding the skills of the people from service to the people and denies the people the opportunity to add to the productivity of their country by the talents God has given them. It denies it by legislation and administrative action. That is the main reason why there are inflationary tendencies in South Africa and why we cannot get tax relief. It is due to incompetence and short-sightedness on the part of the Government. When the Minister of Finance says he cannot give tax relief because of his fear of inflation, he means that this is the penalty South Africans have to pay for a government which fails to raise the productivity of the nation. That is the Government&#x2019;s fault. To state that it is an effort to combat inflation without defining the causes of inflation is to state a half-truth and to make an invalid excuse.</p>

<p>We feel that in this Appropriation Bill the money available to the Government is not being appropriated for some of the most essential purposes. I do not want to go into that again because we had a discussion on it yesterday and we then moved an amendment expressing our view. [Interjection.] The point is that we are being criticized because we ask that this surplus should be used in the true interests of the ordinary people of South Africa. We are told that the Minister is in the position of a man who has won a big prize <span class="col_8001-8002" refersTo="page_0335"/>and everybody wants to advise him how to spend his money. What a simile to use! What sort of a lottery is this, where people are compelled to take a ticket whether they trust the administration of the lottery or not and where the prizewinner is determined in advance, and can be only one person, the Minister of Finance? But that is the sort of argument with which we are answered when we plead in the interests of the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>While the policy of the Minister of Finance, forced upon him by the circumstances caused by Government policy, forces all the people of South Africa to make unnecessary sacrifices, I believe there is not a single productive sector of the population which suffers more under this Government than the farmers. There are thousands of farmers who hear about the boom but do not experience it. The farmers of South Africa are having a difficult time because in many ways the Government has abandoned the main principle of the United Party&#x2019;s Marketing Act, which was that the farmer should be entitled to a fair reward for his enterprise over and above the cost of production. We have the situation in South Africa where farming is becoming unproductive to most farmers, except for the land barons who are so adequately represented by the so-called farmers&#x2019; group of the Nationalist Party. Sir, if you want substantiation for that, I will call a witness who is in the House now, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, who on 4 September last year made a very interesting point and a very honest point when he pointed out that in 1936 we had 179,000 White farmers, that by 1960 the number had been reduced to 118,000, and that by 1963 it had been further reduced. And then he expected the decline in the number of farmers to continue at the rate of 2,400 a year and said that by 1968 we would have fewer than 100,000 farmers; 93,000 was the figure quoted. At the same time he made the point with great emphasis that the number of Black people on the farms in South Africa was increasing quite spectacularly. The point I want to make is this. One would expect that where this is the position there would be on the part of our two Ministers of Agriculture and the Government a bold and imaginative policy for the farmers of South Africa, because the situation is serious. We recently had a commission investigating the depopulation of the platteland. This commission reported that at the present rate of decrease in our farming population there would only be 420,000 people, White people, dependent on farming by 1970, but if the rate of increase of Black people on the farms is maintained there will be 4,000,000 Black people dependent on agriculture by 1970. By then only one out of 11 people dependent on agriculture would be White. Most interesting of all, in paragraphs 167 to 173 of the report, a sample analysis was done of the farms in Natal and the Free State, and what was found? Already by then 25 per cent of the farms in the Free State were occupied by Bantu alone and in Natal it was 85 per cent.</p>

<p>One must be fair. The tendency for the number of farmers to be reduced is worldwide. You find it in Britain and Europe and the U.S.A. If you read the publications, especially the Monthly Bulletin of the Food and Agricultural Organization, you find that in Europe from 1950 to 1960 industrial production increased by 65 per cent, but agricultural production only by 25 per cent. Changes in the composition of the farms are encouraged in Europe, but not so in South Africa under the present Government by negative methods, through forcing farmers off the land by foreclosing on them after having given them too easy credit for many years. We should note, in passing, that for many years the Government&#x2019;s answer to the problems of the farmers was to lend them money on easy terms, encumbering their land and branding their livestock. But now that very generosity of the past is being used in a negative way to reduce the number of farmers.</p>

<p>But just think how different the policy is in most European countries. There we find that changes are encouraged. In Germany, from 1949 to 1960, farms smaller than 10 hectares were reduced by 300,000; 20 per cent of the total farms of that size have been enlarged, but they did it in an imaginative way. For example, they gave special pensions to farmers to enable them to exist while they changed their vocations. They gave them incomes to support them while they were changing their vocations. They bought their land on an annuity system, so that for the rest of their lives they would have an adequate income in order to make these adjustments. They did not do what is done in South Africa, to force farmers off the land, without making any provision for the adaptation these unfortunate people have to make when they are moved rrom one type of life to another. And for the man who has grown up and become middle-aged on a farm, it is a cruel revolution, to which the Government is utterly indifferent. In Europe you find that although they admit that in some cases the small farmer has to disappear, they nevertheless follow a vigorous policy and a bold policy of supporting those small, marginal farmers who have some hope of survival. They do it by giving them a supplementary income. The Food and Agricultural Organization tell us that in Austria there are 105,000 non-viable farms, seen purely as agricultural units; but 70,000 of them can continue as farms because their occupants have supplementary incomes. By the decentralization of industry and the diversification of the economic activity in the rural areas, they make it possible for 70,000 out of the 105,000 on non-viable farms to continue to exist by giving those farmers supplementary incomes. In Denmark during the last few years 10 per cent of the farmers have been given supplementary incomes which were made possible by vigorous, imaginative government policy. What is interesting is that during the discussion of the policy of our two Ministers of Agriculture, there was not the slightest <span class="col_8003-8004" refersTo="page_0336"/>indication that things like this were receiving their attention or that they were interested.</p>

<p>What are we doing for the vocational training of farmers who have to leave the land? What are we doing to follow the example of European countries and of the United States of America to investigate and to apply income support for marginal farmers rather than merely price support, because price support, as the hon. the Minister has complained before to-day, is more to the advantage of the already wealthy farmer who does not need help. The poor farmer, the marginal farmer, will benefit more by a form of income support. Do you know, Sir, that in Sweden, according to the latest figures that I could find, small farmers, all those with land smaller than 10 hectare, get a cash subsidy varying from 200 to 400 kroner a year?</p>

<p>Why did the Ministers of Agriculture not tell us something about the process known as vertical integration which is taking place among many farmers in Europe? Of course, they will not talk about that because integration to them has a sinister meaning. By &#x201C;vertical integration" in Europe they mean a system and organization of agriculture whereby major undertakings assist the farmers with their raw materials, with their seed, with labour, buy their products at guaranteed prices and assist them with marketing. It is done by private enterprise with spectacular results. In France, for example, in the poultry industry the number of broilers produced under such a system was only 117,000 in 1954 but by 1960 the number had increased to 24,000,000. I do not say that that is the total increase in the production of France, but the producers of 24,000,000 broilers were having the advantage of this highly organized organization and efficiency, which is described there as vertical integration. Then there is also what they describe in Europe as horizontal integration, a division of labour, a creation of central services. For example, one reads that in the Netherlands they have organizations to enable small farmers to hire labour in groups. They keep down the cost of labour; they make the use of labour more permanent and more efficient. Sir, is their any indication that the two Ministers of Agriculture in South Africa had any idea that such things could be investigated in South Africa? No, all we are told is that the farming population of South Africa will have to decrease at the alarming rate of 2,400 a year for the next five years. Sir, I think one finds the key to the situation in the Treaty of Rome, to which I referred, where it is clearly stated that the agricultural policy of the governments concerned can only succeed if it is supported by a general economic policy of progress, a general policy which would include the vigorous and imaginative decentralization of industry. But the question remains what is to become of the dispossessed farmers of South Africa? The hon. the Prime Minister had a suggestion to make in the Other Place on 5 or 6 June. I will not quote from it, but he will agree that he made a very interesting suggestion there, that many of these farmers of South Africa should eventually be given plots on schemes like the Pongola Scheme or the Orange River Scheme but on a different basis, as peasant farmers, where each farm will be farmed not by an entrepreneur with employees but by a family, by a husband and wife and their children, a retrogressive step, Sir. In most parts of the world people are trying to get away from that particular type of social and economic organization because it leads to a blunting of the initiative of the human being, to reduced opportunities for self-realization and development. But in the Senate of South Africa the Prime Minister comes along and seriously suggests such a plan as one of the solutions of the problems of the farmers of South Africa. The alternative is that our farmers will have to become&#x2014;because that is all they can do&#x2014; semi-skilled workers in our industries. At the same time it is the policy of this Government to decrease the opportunities for White people to find work in our industries in semi-skilled occupations. The policy of the present Government is to decentralize industry, to encourage new industries and, I want to emphasize, existing industries to go to the borders of the Bantustans, to make semi-skilled and unskilled occupations available to the Bantu. Sir, it will be nice for the Bantu, but if that is the policy of the Government, what is going to happen to the large number of farmers who have to leave the land as the result of Government policy?</p>

<p>If Government policy is really analysed, it boils down fundamentally only to one thing, and that is an attitude&#x2014;not a policy, but an attitude&#x2014;to the non-White people of South Africa. That, Sir, brings one to the failure of the Government&#x2019;s basic and fundamental policy, the policy which aims at the solution of Bantu problems especially, but in general all non-White problems in South Africa. We have the Bantu Affairs Department; we have the Bantu Education Department; we have the Indian Affairs Department; we have the Coloured Affairs Department; all struggling to apply and to administer a policy which it is impossible to implement, all battling with an impossible situation and an impossible ideal, something which is fundamentally impossible. Because what is this policy? It is based upon the statement that we have heard from the Prime Minister this Session that a multi-racial state cannot exist; indeed the Prime Minister said that a multi-racial state does not exist anywhere in the world. I am sure that that was a mistake, an oversight on the part of the Prime Minister; so I will not go into it, but he did say that. And, because he believes that a multi-racial state cannot exist, South Africa&#x2019;s races must be separated, as far as the Bantu are concerned into separate states, to which they will all have to look for the achievement of their political aspirations; many of them will still have to work in the rest of South Africa, but will have no permanent <span class="col_8005-8006" refersTo="page_0337"/>rights there. That, basically, is the Government&#x2019;s policy, but immediately the Government frustrates its own policy by saying that it will not allow White skill, White enterprise or White capital to enter the Bantu homelands and to develop them to attract labour there. Instead they come with the cumbersome, and in many ways, uneconomic suggestion that industries must now be started on the borders of the reserves, the theory being that the industries will always be on the White man&#x2019;s side of the reserves. The Blacks who live in their own country must come out and work in the White man&#x2019;s industry. That is the theory, Sir, and, as a result of the economic activity of residents of the reserves or Bantu homelands in these border industries, each Black worker, according to the Prime Minister, will create economic activities to support 25 other people. That is the theory, but what does it mean in practice? What does it mean if you are serious about the policy of separate development, as apartheid is now euphemistically called? It means only one thing, and that is that, in order to draw the Black people out of the existing so-called White areas of South Africa into the Black areas, you have to create more jobs in the Native homelands than in the rest of South Africa. Not even this Government will force people to go into an area to starve as unemployeds, with no hope whatsoever for their future. They must go to jobs. I think that is common cause. And if they inust go to jobs, then those jobs must be created within the Bantu homelands, and those areas must therefore be developed faster than the White areas of South Africa. If you want to reverse the trend of population movement by 1978, the magical date that we have been given, then, Sir, you must now begin to develop those areas faster than the White areas of South Africa; and if you want to develop them faster than the White areas of South Africa the consequence is inescapable; then you must invest more capital in the Bantu areas of South Africa than in the White areas of South Africa; otherwise the policy of separate development becomes meaningless. Sir, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development is not here, but his deputy is. I want to ask him to give us some clarity on this issue. I do not ask difficult questions across the floor of the House to embarrass him, but we are interested in this, the people of South Africa are interested and the people of the world are interested in this. I want the hon. the Minister, if possible, to take part in this debate and to tell us how the Government proposes by 1978 to reverse the flow of population in South Africa so that, instead of coming into the White areas, the Bantu will go into the Black areas; to tell us how they are going to develop those areas, what amount of money they will invest. Sir, this is a friendly challenge because, if the hon. the Minister says &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, he will make it possible for us, not to support his policy, but to defend it, then at least the policy will have a moral basis, and we shall be able to defend it in the world outside. Is there any member of the Nationalist Party who is willing to face the inescapable consequences of their own theory, and advocate the investment of more capital in the Bantu homelands than in the rest of South Africa?</p>

<p>I need not waste much time on Bantu education, but let us look at the Bantu education policy of the Government. Sir, never let us be chary in giving credit where credit is due. Great work is being done to-day to educate more Bantu than ever before in South Africa and to combat illiteracy among them. There are good features of the policy. But there are also most unfortunate features, for example, the fact that there is a differentiation between the education given to the Bantu who come and work for the White man in the White man&#x2019;s cities and the education which is given to those Bantu who stay in their own homelands. The policy is to limit educational facilities for Bantu children in the White cities and to extend educational opportunities rapidly and greatly in the Bantu homelands. But, Sir, the test is what do the Bantu think of this policy? That is the test to a large extent. Already in the Transkei there is tremendous pressure, to which the Government there is yielding, to abandon the policy of the present Minister and to revert to the previous policy of education which obtained in the Transkei before this Government got there; for example, to get away from the attempts through education to make tribal institutions and the tribal way of life inescapable parts of the Black man&#x2019;s life. They want to re-introduce English and Afrikaans, civilized Western languages, as the official languages of education in that area, against the desire of this Minister. But, of course, they will not do that, because the Minister is compelled to carry out an impracticable, unjust, impossible policy. We are sorry for him, but that does not mean that we want him to stay there, so that we can exhibit our grief; we want to get rid of him, so that we can get decent policies in South Africa.</p>

<p>The point is that, if you want any Native policy, whether it is the Government&#x2019;s Native policy or our Native policy, to succeed in South Africa, the key is economic development in every part of South Africa, unshackled by stupid ideologies, but encouraged by vision and confidence and faith in the future of South Africa, and in the common sense of the people of South Africa to make adjustments from time to time as they become necessary.</p>

<p>That, Sir, brings one to the Minister who is chiefly responsible for the economic development of South Africa. I am sorry that the Minister of Economic Affairs is not here. I do not want to attack him personally; I only want to deal with his policy in so far as it reflects the general policy of an incompetent Government, of which he is unlucky enough to be a member. I do not think that anybody who takes an interest in the affairs of South Africa will deny that there is much dissatisfaction <span class="col_8007-8008" refersTo="page_0338"/>in South Africa amongst all the people WHO nave fixed incomes, especially people who are wage earners and smaller salary earners. One need only read the statements by trade union leaders in the country to appreciate that. This chiefly derives from the fact, as I shall show in a minute, that the Government have no policy for bold and imaginative industrial development in South Africa, except in the border areas. I want to say at once that it would be wonderful if the border areas developed industrially, just as wonderful as it would be if the Native homelands in the reserves were to be developed industrially. We, on this side of the House, would like to see industrial development to the advantage of all the people of South Africa, everywhere in South Africa. That, of course, is the major difference in approach and attitude between the Government and this side of the House. Look what is happening after 16 years of Nationalist Party government. To illustrate my point, I want to talk for a moment about what is happening on the West Rand, that part of the Witwatersrand which has been represented by hon. members opposite longer than any other part of the Witwatersrand. The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) has been the member for Krugersdorp under a Nationalist Government and as a member of the Nationalist Party for 17 or 18 years. Let us look at the West Rand. Sir, the area of Krugersdorp, Oberholzer, Randfontein and Roodepoort comprises 1,300 square miles, twice the size of the East Rand from Alberton to Springs, the rest of the Witwatersrand, excluding Johannesburg. It is in the heart of one of the richest developing areas of South Africa, between magnificent Johannesburg on the one side and the tremendous surge of activity on the Far West Rand and in the Orange Free State goldfields. It has a White population of 130,000, one-third of the population of Johannesburg. The White population there has an income of only R90,000,000, one-half of the income of the Whites on the East Rand, one-fifth of the income of the Whites in Johannesburg. These facts are based upon a new series of researches done by the University of South Africa&#x2019;s Bureau of Market Research.</p>

<p>What is your point?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>My point firstly is that poor Krugersdorp has a Member of Parliament who is not interested in Krugersdorp. I am amazed to see that he registers surprise when I tell him what is happening in his own constituency. He should know what is happening there. Sir, the gross manufacturing output of Johannesburg is more than R600,000,000; the gross manufacturing output of the East Rand approaches R400,000,000; the total manufacturing output of this vast area on the West Rand is R60,000,000. The reason why there are problems and difficulties in that area is that the West Rand lacks industrial development, in spite of its strategic situation, in spite of its wonderful people, in spite of their ability and in spite of the resources which are available there. Sir, if Krugersdorp was ten miles away from a Native homeland it would be encouraged to develop and the people there would achieve a higher standard of living, but, because it is far from a Native territory, it has to face this situation after 16 years of Nationalist Party rule, that it is the poorest area on the Witwatersrand, an area where mines are closing down, where the problems will increase. Look at Germiston. On 10 May of this year Dr. J. D. van der Merwe did a sociological review based on the experiences of 1,200 families in Germiston. What did he find? It is unbelievable. He found that 5.38 per cent of these 1,200 White families, 70 of them, had an income of less than R50 per month; that 11 per cent of them had an income of less than R70 per month. I am glad, Sir, that for a moment there is silence. We are all shocked to think that White families, not individuals, but White families, in South Africa are expected to live on incomes of less than R50 per month, and on incomes of less than R70 per month. But, Sir there is no encouragement for Germiston to raise the standard of living of these people. On the contrary, experience has shown that it is the policy of this Government to discourage the establishment of industries in that area. In 1953 2,000 White people were employed in the clothing factories of Germiston, but under the policy of permitting industries to pay lower wages in areas near to the Bantustans, that number has been reduced from 2,000 in 1953 to only 500 odd to-day; in this area where White families have to live on R50 per month. Now you will understand, Sir, why we are constrained to say that this Government is unfit and incompetent to govern a developing country. Sir, the Government was warned. In August of 1958, six years ago, the Germiston Chamber of Commerce expressed the fear that Germiston would become a ghost town as a result of the threat to the clothing factories. They said that more factories should be attracted to the town and that the factories already there should be retained if disaster was to be avoided. These, Sir, the the consequences of Government policy. But I wish you would come with me to the platteland of the Transvaal, to the Western Transvaal. I will take you to towns in the platteland where, under this Government, some years ago beautiful hostels were built to accommodate hundreds of children, and to-day they stand empty. They cost hundreds of thousands of rand, and to-day there is not a single child in them, because of the lack of social attraction and the lack of economic activity in these areas. Those areas have water, they have railways, and they have fine roads; they are ideally situated for the decentralization of industry, but, Sir, they are not ten miles from a Native reserve! Let me go to quite another area of South Africa. In Grahamstown there are Whites who are unemployed and more Coloureds who are unemployed. Grahamstown is in the Ciskei, and <span class="col_8009-8010" refersTo="page_0339"/>it applied to the Government to be given the status of a border area so as to be able to attract industry; and the reply came from Prof. Rautenbach, the chairman of the Special Committee for the Location of Industry, that Grahamstown was 35 miles from the nearest Bantustan; if it would move to ten miles from the Bantustan, then apparently it would get new industries. How ridiculous can a policy be, how callous can a policy be! Sir, these are people who need work in order to be able to live, but, because they are 25 miles too far from a Native area, they cannot be given the opportunity to become employed in industry.</p>

<p>My time unfortunately is running out. There are so many members of the Cabinet left to whom I have not come yet. I would hate to do any of them an injustice by ignoring them, but I take it that they will accept that the only reason why I cannot deal with them is lack of time. Sir, this is the policy which the hon. the Minister of Information has to defend. He spends most of his energies and most of his time upon the people of South Africa, preying upon prejudice and fear and exploiting a sense of insecurity in order to frighten people with this &#x201C;Black bogey" in South Africa. But he also tries to justify such a policy to the great world outside and he fails, to our distress. I would say that the hon. the Prime Minister should have appointed his most efficient, his most competent Minister to this job.</p>

<p>Sir, this is also the policy against the background of which the hon. the Minister of Justice has to maintain law and order in South Africa. I like the hon. the Minister of Justice; I think he is an able man. He is certainly the best debater I have heard from that side of the House for many years and we respect him for that, but look at the unfortunate position in which he finds himself. Owing to the fact that this Government is denying a political outlet in this House, through limited representation, to a large section of our people; owing to the fact that opportunities for legitimate political expression have been removed, there is a growing tendency in South Africa for political expression in South Africa to find illegal outlets, and the only way in which the Minister of Justice can contain the situation in South Africa is by putting more and more people into gaol. We have been told, in reply to a question, that almost 1,000 people are held for what can be termed political offences.</p>

The Government can shout at me and accuse me of whatever they like, but that truth cannot be avoided. No responsible South African dare seek to escape that truth.

Sir, we have the situation in South Africa that the Government cannot afford to let the people of South Africa share, as they should share, to the full extent in the prosperity of South Africa. The Minister has an over-inflated surplus; he cannot give it back to the people from whom, according to his predecessors, he had no right to take it.

<p>I am amazed that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) should come forward this afternoon as the United Party&#x2019;s new expert on heaven alone knows what. There are about 51 Departments in the country and he has taken a peep at each one of them. He also referred to Europe to see what he could tell us of Europe instead of telling us about South Africa. I think that it was very reprehensible of the hon. member to make the remarks he did in connection with the hon. the Minister of Information. There is not one member of the United Party who can take over any of the duties of the hon. the Minister 6f Information, not one of them. They think they are wonderful but the public do not share that feeling and we in this House know that they are not what they think they are. As I have already said, the hon. member for Yeoville is always brought into a debate when the United Party think that they have a very weak case and want somebody to lay a smokescreen. He spoke so quickly and made such a hullabaloo towards the end of his speech that one could hardly hear what he was saying.</p>

<p>He referred to people who are in gaol for political crimes. He was undoubtedly referring to yesterday&#x2019;s court judgment. I want to remind him that the judge in the case said that even if there was not one National Party Act on the Statute Book to prohibit political or other crimes, those people would still have been guilty of high treason. This is an old law which exists in all countries.</p>

<p>Why then were they not accused of high treason?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The judge said quite clearly that the State did not accuse them of high treason but of other crimes. He also said that in effect they were guilty of nothing but high treason. Our reply to the world is that we have these people here who commit crimes which would not be permitted in any country in the world, not because of the laws of to-day, not because of the National Party laws but because of laws which are centuries old, laws against high treason. Because of this fact no country can make any accusations against us in regard to what has taken place in connection with the Rivonia trial.</p>

<p>The hon. member went from point to point but he did not analyse any one point properly except to tell us what somebody else had told him had happened in Holland, in Austria, in Germany and in similar countries in connection with agriculture. That hon. member and I became members of this House at the same time. I still represent my old constituency; we Nationalist members still represent the constituencies which we represented then but he is already representing his third one. He runs from one constituency to another. Because he has done this the voters will not be so foolish as to believe everything that the hon. member for Yeoville tells them. He has so much to say about agriculture and about the fact that the farmers no longer have confidence in the Government. Other hon. members of the agriculture group will deal further with this matter but I want to say this to him: South Africa still remembers the soya-bean bread; South Africa still remembers how the United Party Government fell because of its agricultural policy; South Africa still remembers the failures of the United Party Government. How many rural seats do the United Party hold in this House? They hold no rural seats at all. Their leader was formerly the representative of Hottentots-Holland. What seat does he represent to-day? He is the member for the Nusas people at Rondebosch; he represents those noise-makers and liberalists. We have here the hon. member for Yeoville, the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl), the hon. member for Rondebosch (Sir De Villiers Graaff) and the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan). They represent urban seats. They can no longer win rural seats because their agricultural policy is too weak.</p>

<p>The hon. member told us how ineffective our Bantu policy was and how good theirs was. But since when have the United Party had a Bantu policy? I understand that the United Party have a policy of allowing eight Bantu representatives to take their seats in this House. That is true, is it not? I want to ask the hon. member for Yeoville why this number should be eight and not one or 80?</p>

<p>The Coloureds&#x2019; Representatives are not under discussion now. I am speaking about the Bantu policy of the United Party. I want to ask the United Party why this number should be eight and not one or 80? Mr. Speaker, this is a purely opportunistic figure on which they have decided; <span class="col_8013-8014" refersTo="page_0341"/>it does not mislead anyone who uses his own common sense because the point is not how many representatives one gives the Bantu in this House; the principle at stake is whether one will give them representation or not. Once they have been given representation in this House the same thing will happen to us as happened in the countries to the north of us. I think it was ten or 12 years ago that Northern Rhodesia gave the Bantu one representative and to-day the Bantu are governing that country. We do not believe that story of theirs of eight representatives. Nothing of that nature exists. They themselves do not know what they want to do with the Bantu because they have no Bantu policy.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the other stories which the hon. member has told us here.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the trouble. He made so many allegations that it is not possible to reply to all of them.</p>

<p>In connection with our economic policy the hon. member took the hon. the Minister to task for having a surplus of R 120,000,000; he wanted to know how much of that money the people were going to receive. We heard the same story yesterday. It is nothing but cheap politics with a view to the provincial council elections next year. Hon. members must not think that we have forgotten their history. We know what they did when they were in power. Let us take the question of old age and war veterans&#x2019; pensions; this is a matter which was discussed at length yesterday. Hon. members must not think that we have forgotten what they did in this connection. In 1939, when war broke out, Mr. Madeley, who was a member of the Labour Party, became Minister of Labour. When the cost of living rose during the war years, he introduced a cost-of-living allowance for workers. In 1945, the cost of living rose by 125 or 126 points. Mr. Madeley then left the Cabinet. We had a United Party Minister of Labour from that time until 1948 when we took over. During that period the cost of living again rose by 25 per cent but notwithstanding all the representations we made, the United Party refused to increase the cost-of-living allowance by one penny.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>It rose automatically.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>It did not; it was pegged. It could only be increased by the Minister by way of proclamation and the United Party Minister of Labour refused to issue a proclamation to have it increased. This was one of the points we made during the election. When we came into power the present Minister of Transport who was then Minister of Labour increased the cost-of-living allowance in proportion to the rise in the cost of living.</p>

<p>He adjusted it from time to time as the cost of living rose. That allowance has already been consolidated in basic salaries.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at the other matter about which the hon. member had so much to say yesterday. This is the question of social I tell you that when we came into power the pensions. Mr. Speaker, will you believe it when means test stood at &#x00A3;30 per annum? The means test was &#x00A3;2 10s. per month. The maximum pension paid to a White person in the city was &#x00A3;5 per month. Since we came into power in 1948 the cost of living has risen by 59 per cent but that rise is not the increase reflected in the adjustment of social pensions. Those pensions have increased far more than the cost of living has. In the last few years of their term of office the United Party refused to adjust pensions in proportion to the increase in the cost of living which took place at the time. In 1948 the means test was &#x00A3;30 per annum. It is not 59 per cent higher now, which has been the increase in the cost of living, but 300 per cent higher; it is now R180. A person whose income is less than R180 per annum can now be paid the full pension. In 1948 the maximum pension paid to an urban pensioner was &#x00A3;5 per month and it was even less in the case of the rural pensioner. That pensioner now receives R27 per month. His pension has been increased by 270 per cent, not simply by 59 per cent which is the extent to which the cost of living has risen. A person earning more than &#x00A3;84 per annum in 1948 was not entitled to a pension at all. Even if he has an income of R310 to-day, he still receives a pension. Moreover, he is paid a considerable bonus which gives him a pension in excess of R100 per annum. In 1948, war veterans received &#x00A3;5 per month; to-day they receive R420 per annum, that is to say, an increase of 350 per cent, not simply of 59 per cent which has been the increase in the cost of living. The maximum pension for old-age pensioners was &#x00A3;84 plus their own income in 1948. To-day it is R598 together with own income for war veterans and R502 for old-age pensioners.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was discussing the question of old age and war veterans&#x2019; pensions. I gave figures to indicate that there has been a tremendous increase in these pensions since the National Party came into power. I also pointed out how badly these pensioners were treated under the United Party Government. The actual position is that the National Party has increased benefits to these people by about 300 per cent while the cost of living has only risen by 59 per cent. We have greatly increased the standard of living of these old people in that their incomes have increased far more than the cost of living has risen. Accordingly, it does not behove the United Party to pretend <span class="col_8015-8016" refersTo="page_0342"/>that they are the protectors of the workers and the aged. They are not and have never been. Their own party admitted as much in 1948. Since that time, of course, they have had second thoughts. Mr. Speaker, you will remember that in 1948 the United Party gave the Labour Party a few constituencies to contest. They issued pamphlets in which they made an appeal to their supporters to vote for those Labour Party candidates. What did they have to say in those pamphlets? I should just like to quote a few sentences from the pamphlet issued by Mr. Okkie Oosthuizen, their principal secretary, in order to show you, Sir, that they did not consider themselves capable of representing the workers. Just listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Large numbers of the voters in the Wonderboom constituency were artisans and industrial workers and it was felt that it was only fair to give them an opportunity to vote for a Labour candidate who would be able more accurately to interpret their needs and aspirations.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>It may be an old argument but it is still an effective one and we will use it in the provincial elections which lies ahead.</p>

<p>This brings me to another important point made by the hon. member for Yeoville. When he made this point he became so excited and emotional that he began to foam at the mouth just like an epileptic. But he did not make any impression upon people who know what is going on. I refer to what he said in regard to the industries in this country. He told us that the government was leading our industrial development in the wrong direction. He said: Just imagine an amount of R400,000,000 is invested in industries on the East Rand and only R60,000,000 is invested in industries on the West Rand! He then told us that there was no industrial development on the West Rand. But when he quoted statistics in order to prove how badly things were going, he gave us the figures for the East Rand with its R400,000,000 and not those for R60,000,000 area of the West Rand, where, apparently, the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) does his work so badly! I want to ask the hon. member when this Government has ever prevented anybody from establishing an industry where he has wanted to establish it. He knows that the Government does not do that sort of thing. A few weeks ago I said in this House that our industries should be licensed so that we could determine where they should be established and so that the State could have control over them, and the United Party were unanimous in their protests against this point of view. When the hon. the Minister said that he did not see his way clear to introduce a provision of that nature, they cried out &#x201C;Hear, hear!" The hon. member now wants the Government to have these industries established at Krugersdorp, at Roodepoort and at Germiston and similar places. Where is the logic in his attitude? No, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member must not try to make us believe these things by telling us these wild tales. I want to tell him that if he is going to fight the provincial council election on the basis of stories of that nature&#x2014;the speech which he made here this morning was nothing less than an introductory speech as far as that election campaign was concerned &#x2014;we will give them such a thrashing that there will be very few of them left in South Africa.</p>

<p>Our policy is very clear as far as industrial development is concerned. Our policy is that labour-intensive industries must be established close to the large sources of labour&#x2014;the borders of the Bantu areas. Capitally-intensive industries can be established in the cities. But we do not force them; we can only influence them by giving them special concessions. They can still be established at Johannesburg if they want to. Notwithstanding the fact that the position on the Rand is that the East Rand and West Rand attract few industries but that the Central Rand area attracts many industries, the hon. member has told us that the Government should move some of these industries. But when we suggest ways and means of doing so, his Party opposes those suggestions.</p>

<p>The other day I quoted statistics to show that 89 per cent of the new industries erected on the Rand preferred to be in the central area, in Johannesburg. Three per cent preferred to go to the East Rand and eight per cent to the West Rand, or vice versa; I am not too sure about this. It was not the Government which instructed them to go there; they went there of their own volition. If we want a sound industrial policy we must have a starting point. The hon. member spoke about decentralization and said that it was a good thing. But every step that this Government has taken to decentralize industries has been opposed by the United Party. I think that the hon. member for Yeoville must concentrate <span class="col_8017-8018" refersTo="page_0343"/>upon matters about which he knows something but if he does so, I am afraid he will be concentrating upon nothing. I also want to tell him that certain basic factors have to be taken into consideration when industries are established. One cannot establish an industry at a place where the necessary raw materials are not available, where the necessary labour is not available, where the necessary water is not available and where one is not within reach of the necessary markets. With this as a foundation one has then to build one&#x2019;s industrial policy on a long-term basis; only then can one determine what is scientifically sound as far as the establishment of industries is concerned. That is what the Government is doing. The entire planning section of the Department of Economic Affairs is concentrating on this matter. The advice that one obtains from them is excellent advice. If industrialists listen to them they will not only do themselves a great deal of good but they will do a great deal of good for the country as well and then we will have the necessary decentralization.</p>

<p>I must hurry on. Before I conclude I just want to bring one matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister&#x2014;the Usury Act and its application. During the course of this Session we have passed a few very important financial measures. Amongst others, we have passed the Banking Amendment Act, the Building Societies Amendment Act and other similar measures. There remains one important matter which to my mind is economically unsound and that is the Usury Act. You know, our Usury Act provides that a person can, I think, make a profit of 12 per cent on money which he lends. We find that some of our large financial institutions and some of our small deposit-receiving financial institutions hire-purchase contracts. They do so on this basis; they say that one can borrow the money at eight per cent or nine per cent on an instalment system, but then they calculate that interest on the total amount for the full period, while, on the average, one should only have to pay on half the total amount for the full period. They go further and they add a raising fee for money which they do not raise but which has been invested with them by depositors. They go even further and they add finance charges. When one adds all these amounts together one finds that these people are receiving a rate of interest of from 20 per cent to 22 per cent. I contend that this is an exploitation of the people who borrow from them. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether we cannot amend the Usury Act so as to define what is meant by &#x201C;12&#x00BD; per cent interest&#x201D;. We cannot allow the position to remain as it is now.</p>

<p>My time is also up. I just want to tell the hon. member that he has accused other people of incompetence. For example, he has accused the hon. the Minister of Information of being incompetent. He has accused the hon. the Prime Minister of having appointed the hon. the Minister of Information as such. I want to ask him what he has already achieved except to run from one constituency to another. I think that the hon. member for Yeoville should try to see himself as others see him. I am afraid that if he does this and sees himself as really he is, he will ask the voters of Yeoville to send another representative to Parliament because he will realize that he is not capable of representing them properly.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down chose to say of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) that he did not know what he was talking about. Well, let us have a few examples of the type of argument that the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) has advanced in his speech here. First of all he tried to ridicule the United Party&#x2019;s policy of group representation for Natives here in Parliament. He said: What policy is this of putting eight Native Representatives here in Parliament? Surely he should be aware of the fact that people like General Hertzog and General Smuts had accepted that as policy that Natives should be represented here on a group basis. But the funniest thing of all is: What did his own Government do, what did his Prime Minister do when he removed the Coloureds from the Common Roll? What else but to give them group representation here. If our policy as far as the Natives are concerned in giving them group representation is stupid, then surely their policy as far as the Coloureds are concerned, is just as stupid.</p>

<p>That is one example to show the logic of the hon. member. Take another instance. He quotes figures here to show that the real standard of living of the old-age pensioners has risen over the last 16 years. Is he surprised if anybody&#x2019;s standard of living does rise when the country becomes much wealthier? Or does he think it is a miracle under the Nationalist Government if anybody&#x2019;s standard of living does rise? Surely it would have been most shocking if the standard of living has not risen. Our quarrel with the Government is that it does not rise fast enough, taking into consideration how much wealthier the country has become. Surely it is the duty of any government of a civilized country that the wealthier a country gets the more attention it should pay to its under-privileged classes.</p>

<p>Really, I think one does not need to spend much time on his arguments. He challenged me and he challenged the hon. member for Yeoville to say where industries were stopped from going to the West Rand or to the East Rand. I would like to draw the <span class="col_8019-8020" refersTo="page_0344"/>hon. member&#x2019;s attention to a statement made by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration (Mr. M. C. Botha), who addressed the Municipal Congress in November last year, and who told his audience that it was the responsibility of every municipality to acquaint itself with the factual position of the presence of Africans in its area and to take the necessary steps to stop urbanization. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The process of urbanization of the Bantu in the European areas must clearly be stopped, and you already have the means at your disposal.</block>

<p>Then he ended his warning and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He warned employers that if they did not co-operate wholeheartedly with the authorities in their efforts to restrict the number of Africans to a minimum, it might be necessary to make provision for more strict action against employers.</block>

<p>In other words, Mr. Speaker, he does not stop industry, but he stops their labour. Because in South Africa industrial development, as every statistic shows is synonymous with an increase in your Native labour force. There is simply not enough White labour and other forms of labour, certainly not in the Transvaal, for industrial development. In any case, I think I have shown that really it is not worthwhile to analyse the arguments used by the hon. member. These three examples show how illogical the hon. member himself is who accuses the hon. member for Yeoville of being illogical and of not knowing what he is talking about.</p>

<p>I wonder if in the whole history, any government has ever had a policy that has so little hope of solving the fundamental problems facing it as this Government has with its so-called policy of separate development for the different racial groups. I say this for the simple reason that it is incapable of being carried out in practice. For that reason it is a dead-end policy. What the Government is really doing with the nation is to lead it up the National garden path of which the end is a dead-end. It is a cul-de-sac, it is &#x201C; &#x2019;n straat loop dood" policy. I will prove to the hon. Minister why I say this. I do not like to say things that I cannot prove. (Laughter.) Mr. Speaker, the Government promised the electorate that if only they accepted apartheid, or separate development, they would keep the Republic White. I hope the hon. Minister will admit that that is the whole basis of their policy. This is a very attractive bait. I might call it &#x201C;White" bait that the hon. the Prime Minister, a great fisherman, holds out to the White electorate in this multiracial State that is South Africa. No wonder they had such electoral successes as the hon. member who has now left the Chamber told us. It is because of this bait of saying &#x201C;We will keen the Republic White&#x201D;. Now who of us in all honesty if we had the choice would not rather live and hope that our children and grandchildren will be able to live in an allWhite society. Not because we regard the non-Whites as inferior, not for one moment. But we realize how difficult it is to maintain Western democracy in a multi-racial society, how difficult it is to maintain Western values and traditions in a multi-racial society in Africa, of course we realize also how readily one gets political grouping in a multi-racial society and what a paradise it becomes for the political agitator, whether he be White or Black. Now what the Government in effect is therefore saying to the White minority in this multiracial Republic, which we in fact are is, &#x201C;If you vote for us, you will not have to live in a multi-racial Republic any more&#x201D;. That is in fact what they are saying to the people. The hon. the Prime Minister is honest enough to admit that. He says &#x201C;of course to bring about this White Republic, we will have to establish independent Black republics in our midst, and there are attendant dangers, but that is your choice&#x201D;. And faced with that choice, there js no doubt that if the White electorate believes that, they would take this bait. They are told of course that the only alternative is that the political power will pass from the hands of the White man. Now for the past 16 years we have heard this story, and for the past 16 years, as every population statistic shows, we have remained very much a multi-racial society, very much a multi-racial state. In fact in every economic activity in our national life, from agriculture to industry, we find that the percentages of non-Whites involved have increased steadily over the past 16 years. What in fact we have had in the past 16 years is on the one hand increasing apartheid, or separate development, as far as leval and civil rights are concerned for the different races, but on the other hand increasing economic integration. What has really happened is that Nationalist policy has gone one way and the reality of South African life has gone the other way. In short the myth of a White Republic has become much smaller. The White Republic has a rainbow quality about it: The nearer you get, the further it recedes. Of course as children we were always told that if we would only run fast enough, we could catch up with the rainbow. This is exactly what the Government is telling the electorate to-day: Just run fast enough after apartheid, and you will catch up with it. Alas, for the same reason, because of reality, they will never catch up with it. What are these basic realities? I would like to try to put them as simply as possible in this House. Our official statistics show for instance that if we look at our population increases in recent years, and if we just look at the non-Bantu section, that is to say the population groups comprising the Coloureds, the Whites and the Indians, those who do not belong to the Bantu section, we find that the Whites are increasing at a rate of nearly 50,000 a year, and if we look at the Coloureds we find that they are also increasing at a rate of nearly 50,000 a year. If you look at the <span class="col_8021-8022" refersTo="page_0345"/>Asiatics you find that they are increasing at a rate of 15,000 a year. The net result is of course, Mr. Speaker, that all demographists are agreed that in the absence of sustained massive White immigration, the Coloured and the Asian population will within one or two generations exceed the White population. Now the Government admits that they are permanent residents in the so-called White Republic. How on earth then, I think one is entitled to ask the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, can they go on claiming that apartheid will keep the Republic White, when it is only a question of time when the Coloureds and Asians alone will outnumber the Whites in the Republic? How can the hon. Prime Minister possibly claim that Coloureds will never sit in this Parliament and that Asians will never be able to sit in this Parliament, and at the same time say that apartheid does not discriminate? Those are questions of fact, not political statements or anything like that, and in the end these questions will have to be answered. One can postpone the answers, but one cannot delay it for ever. Even if one accepts all the Prime Minister&#x2019;s and the Government&#x2019;s expectations about what will happen to the Black man under separate development, it is still totally misleading to claim that apartheid will keep the Republic White. For even then the Republic&#x2019;s population will ultimately consist of a majority of Coloureds and Asiatics. Or is the hon. the Prime Minister simply going to get round this little problem by ultimately declaring them White? That is the only way in which I can see that he will in the end be able to claim that apartheid leads to a White Republic.</p>

<p>So far I have only argued on the basis that even if all Black men could be kept out of the White Republic in figure, we will still not have the promised White Republic of the Government and the Prime Minister because of the population realities in respect of the Coloureds and Asiatics. But of course it is an impossibility to keep out the Black man from the so-called White man&#x2019;s economy, both from the point of view of the White man and from the point of view of the Black man.</p>

<p>Let us first of all deal with it from the point of view of the White man. The White man in South Africa is very largely responsible for the savings and investments of the order of very nearly R 1,000,000,000 a year. This figure of investment, which of course will grow in future, makes the growth of our economy possible by establishing new and expanding existing industries, mines, farms and commercial enterprises. The White man in fact can be proud of the fact that he is the main innovator of all progress, creating new jobs for all races and raising the living standard. That is the actuality of South Africa. Now investment of this order year after year of course requires a rapidly expanding labour force, tens of thousands extra workers every year. Investment and expansion of this order, it has been calculated, requires at least 100,000 new workers every year. Where are these new workers to come from? If we look at the supply of labour that comes into the labour market every year&#x2014; certain figures have been calculated and published in the &#x201C;S.A. Journal of Economics" in June 1963, page 146&#x2014;then we find that the increase in the male labour force for the periol 1961-6 and 1966-71 would be as follows. If we take the first period 1961 to 1966, we find that the increase every year of the male labour force in South Africa every year was about 87,000 per annum, of all races, and I have already said that our economy probably requires some 100,000 extra workers every year. From this figure the Whites accounted for only 17,500 or 20 per cent, the Coloureds plus/ minus 10,000 and the Asiatics plus/minus 4,500. In <i>toto</i> all the non-Bantu races therefore provided only 32,000 per annum. This is a figure totally inadequate for the investment requirements of the order of about R 1,000,000,000 a year. But if we look at the increase in the Bantu male labour force, we find it is about 55,000 per annum, nearly one-and-two-third times as big as all the other races put together, and it is only because the South African economy could draw on this Bantu labour in the past, that we have been able to extend at the rate that we have. How on earth is the Republic going to have the rapid economic growth which government spokesmen promised us and of which the economy is capable if we do not have the Natives, the rapidly expanding Bantu labour force? The point of the matter is that the degree to which government promises will be fulfilled, will really depend on the degree to which apartheid fails. That is really the formula. The greater the failure of apartheid, the greater the expansion of South Africa will be. That has been the case in the past and it is inevitable because one is dealing with realities and not political myths. This must be the pattern of the future.</p>

<p>But what of the Black man himself? His numbers are increasing at the rate of about 250,000 per year. Jobs and increasing standards of living can only be found for them because of the vast capital investment of the White man. Without the economic progress brought about by the White man, the Black man will have to starve. That is the simple reality. For generations to come it is inconceivable that their own homelands can have a capital investment and a rate of economic growth to provide them with jobs, to provide them with sustenance&#x2014;a population increasing at the rate of nearly 250,000 a year. The simple truth is that for the foreseeable future the White man cannot do without the labour of the Black man and the Black man cannot subsist without the work provided by the White man. That is the simple reality of South Africa. In other words, the Republic will remain a multi-racial state, whether the White man or the Black man like it or not. We will just have to face up to the political problems of a multiracial state, whether we like it or not. To pretend that we are a multi-racial state, as the <span class="col_8023-8024" refersTo="page_0346"/>Government is trying to do, does not solve a single national or international problem. The evasion of realities never solves anything. It simply aggravates all problems because it simply postpones them. And that is precisely what the apartheid policy is doing in South Africa. It is not solving a single fundamental problem. It is simply damming them up and postponing them. We only have to look at what has happened in the past 16 years to realize the truth of this. Thus despite the efforts of the Prime Minister in the past few years to give more content to apartheid, the Republic is more isolated than ever internationally, for no great Western power has been convinced that his Bantustan policy for instance justifies apartheid as far as it applies to the Coloureds and Indians. Nor do they believe that Bantustan is an answer to the political problems created by the permanently urbanized African. And of course this theoretical de-urbanization that we have had this Session with the passing of the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill does not take anyone in either. On paper you can deurbanize people who live in urban areas, but nobody is going to believe that except hon. members on the other side. Nobody is going to believe that they are really permanently deurbanized as the result of a passing of a law. Internally the legal and the civil separation of the races, which apartheid largely amounts to, once the races become more integrated economically, cannot lead to an improvement of race relations. It can only lead to increased racial friction. For all it does is to destroy bridges between the races living in the same economic communities and day after day working together on the same farms, in the same factories and in the same mines. Until the Government accepts the realities of multiracialism, it will make no progress towards a solution of the problems of a multi-racial society. It is because its policy and plans rest on a state of affairs that never existed and will never exist, that its policy is a dead-end policy, as I called it before. When you come to the end of the road, it can go no further. How is the Government for instance going to win allies amongst the Great Western democratic powers in the world if they regard discrimination in the name of apartheid not as a temporary phenomena, as hon. members on the other side like to make out, but as something permanent for the simple reason that they do not believe in the feasibility of separate development, because they do not believe it is practical? How is the Government going to relieve racial tension in South Africa by refusing political rights to non-Europeans on the basis of pretending that they are only temporary sojourners in the White Republic? The Government&#x2019;s policy can never solve the problems of a multi-racial society, because they simply shut their eyes to the fact of multi-racialism. They deny the fact that we are a multi-racial state. They seem to believe that if you shut your eyes to an unpleasant phenomenon, that phenomenon simply disappears. That is really the whole philosophy of the Government. Whatever the Government members might say to ridicule our race federation policy, at least it faces up to the reality of the fact that we are a multi-racial state and that we will always have different races living together in the same political entity. We squarely face the fact of multi-racialism and we are trying to make the necessary adaptations so that our multi-racial society&#x2014;that is what we are aiming at&#x2014;can remain a democratic society which upholds the great Wesern moral and legal principles which our forefathers brought to this country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppe (Dr. Cronje) has repeated the old story his Party has told us here so often, the old story of the increase in the numbers of nonWhites amongst the Whites. I think that that story has been analysed so often and by so many people, including the hon. the Prime Minister, that the hon. member should leave the matter at that. Hon. members in this House have been shown a graph indicating the stage at which this increase will stop and at which the number of these non-Whites will start decreasing. The hon. member has tried to justify his argument of integration on the grounds of the increase in the Coloured population and the Asiatic population and that is why he is resigned to intergration and accepts it as the only policy. But I do not rise to reply to what the hon. member has said here.</p>

<p>I want to refer to what the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has said. Unfortunately, he is not here now. I think that this House deprecates the frothy sentimental way in which the hon. member has tried to tell us that the hon. the Minister of Information is an insult to the English-speaking people of South Africa. I think that this House deprecates that statement. I want to know whether the hon. member is himself an example of an Afrikaner who is allowing himself to be used to try to foster a wrong English sentiment who is allowing himself to be used as a floormat for a race-dividing policy of that nature. That is all that the hon. member has done. It is strange that it should be that hon. member who should have taken it upon himself to attack the Government on its agricultural policy and to tell this House how badly things are going with agriculture in South Africa. Is it perhaps because a few days ago we had the spectacle, when the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing introduced the Marketing Amendment Bill, of seeing that the speakers on agricultural matters in this House in the United Party camp were those persons precisely who had repudiated the farmers and agriculture when they opposed the Co-operatives Act? Is it for that reason that the hon. member for Yeoville has suddenly been required to discuss agricultural matters?</p>

<p>Because he has said that things are going so badly with agriculture, it is necessary for us to place a few facts on record. I want to analyse the position as far as agriculture is concerned, not on the basis of what politicians <span class="col_8025-8026" refersTo="page_0347"/>have to say in this regard but on the basis of a few reports that have appeared. Firstly, there is the Annual Report of the Board of the Land and Agricultural Bank. If there is one organization which is outside the party-political arena and which has to deal with agricultural matters every day, which has therefore to act objectively, it is the Board of the Land Bank. What do they say in their Annual Report? They say this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Matters proceeded normally in the sphere of Land Bank financing during 1963. There was no marked fluctuation in the demand for agricultural credit and it was possible to meet the requirements of the industry through the existing channels in the usual way.</block>

<p>In other words, things were completely normal. But they do make an admission, and this is the point seized upon by the hon. member and his party. They say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unfortunately, drought conditions continued in the Northern Transvaal and the financial position of many farmers there deteriorated.</block>

<p>This happened because of natural conditions in the drought-stricken areas but the hon. member and his Party try to make use of this fact for their own gain. I think that it is a sad day for agriculture in South Africa when agricultural matters are dealt with in this way. I want to give another example. In the same report there is a table indicating the amount of loans given to farmers. I am not going to analyse the table point for point. I just want to mention two examples and this is the yardstick that we must use. It is stated in this report that from 1912 when the Bank came into being, up to the end of 1963, the number of properties sold&#x2014; 1,998 of them&#x2014;amounted to only 1.586 per cent of the total: that is to say 1.586 per cent of the total of 125.920 mortgage loans granted throughout this whole period.</p>

<p>What do you think of Table 7?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to ask hon. members to mention a comparative table in any one of the facets of our economy in which there have been fewer failures than in this regard. There are certain branches of our economy in which failures result because of poor management or as a result of other circumstances. I am reminded of a recent case during the past 18 months in which an amount of R 10.000.000 disappeared because of the failure of certain financial institutions. How does this compare with agriculture? But we do not say that things are going badly with our economy. No, agriculture is selected precisely because we have a few places in South Africa which are experiencing drought conditions. When hon. members discuss agriculture I should like them to try to see the agricultural economy in the same perspective as they see the rest of the economy of South Africa. They must not be guilty of misrepresentation. I want to take another yardstick because hon. members may say that it is only the wealthy farmers who are assisted by the Land Bank. Let us see how the less wealthy farmers are faring, the farmers who cannot be assisted by the Land Bank but who have to be helped by State Advances. Let us take the yardstick of State Advances, according to their report. I want to congratulate them on this fine report. They say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Accordingly it can be stated that the activities of State Advances are usually a reflection of general farming conditions.</block>

<p>And this is true because they are the people who have to carry the less-privileged farmers. They go on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reasonably stable wheat and dairy prices and increasing meat and wool prices have enabled farmers generally to fulfil their financial obligations satisfactorily and have kept the need for further financial assistance within reasonable limits.</block>

<p>What now of the statement of the hon. member who had so much to say and who told us that things were going badly with the farmers? But this is the point that I want to make. They give us reasons why certain specific assistance was given. They say that farmers in the drought-stricken areas have been assisted and that those who already owe money to the Office have also been given every assistance. What has happened in this case? The hon. member has said that the farmers in the drought-stricken areas are sold up, that they then have nowhere to go and so disappear. I am not going to waste the time of the House by analysing the assistance that has been given in this regard but I want to analyse the districts in which the hon. member says these people are sold out. At Kenhardt assistance was given in eight cases; at Maclear, five. Those are the only cases in the Cape. In Natal the district having the highest number of cases was Est-court with five. Let us look at the Transvaal. At Brits. 22 farmers had to be assisted; at Letaba. 26 at Lichtenburg, nine. Let us compare these figures with Volksrust where four farmers were assisted and Wakkerstroom where only two were assisted. We find that assistance has to be given throughout South Africa in certain circumstances. If things are going so badly with the farmers, why is it that only two farmers had to be given assistance at Wakkerstroom, which is a large district, only four in the whole area of Volksrust, only one at Witbank and only two at Wolmaransstad? The drought conditions there are not so severe, but at Warmbaths or Waterberg where the drought is bad, there were 19 farmers who needed assistance. The hon. member for Yeoville is trying like a vulture to prey on the misfortune and difficulties of that group of people stricken by the drought. I think he ought to be ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>He is asking for assistance from the Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think that there has ever been a Government since 1910 which has given as much assistance to the farmers as this Government has. The hon. member is not asking for assistance. He is trying to win a few votes as an agitator. The hon. member says that the Government assists these people by selling them up and that they are then uprooted. He has told us that the Government must not tell the world that it is going to rehabilitate the farmer who has an uneconomic unit and settle him under the Orange River Scheme or under the Pongola Scheme. He told us that these would only be &#x201C;peasant farmers" or bywoners. In order to strengthen his case he tried to compare the position here with that in Europe. Let us analyse this position. This Government established the Pongola Scheme which the previous Government neglected and wanted to sell to the Hulett company. Some of the most progressive farmers in the whole of the Transvaal are there to-day. That scheme has ensured that every settler has an average income of R9,000 per annum. This is the bywoner class of farmer whom he has been discussing and whom the Government has on its settlements! What right does he have to say that the Orange River Scheme will make bywoners of these people and that there will be bywoners at Pongola? Has he said this to make these people suspicious and to angle for votes or has he done so because he knows that the settlement scheme which they had under the old Conroy system made bywoners of these people? They did not allow a child to stay on the farm with his parents and they carried out raids on these farms. But this Government has established one of the finest settlements in the whole world there in order to assist the farmer. If a holding is advertised there, between 400 and 500 people apply for it. Are there so many people who want to apply to become bywoners? This proves how groundless his arguments are.</p>

<p>Was it not this Government which last year and this year passed legislation to make it possible for farmers farming on uneconomic units to obtain more land? What right has the hon. member to angle for a few votes in this cheap way, on arguments based on the drought-stricken areas? It is an evil day for the United Party when they get their speakers on agricultural matters to attack the Co-operative Societies Act and their speakers on industrial matters to plead the case of the farmers.</p>

<p>I want to mention another example. The hon. member has told us that things are going so badly with the farmers. Let us look again at the report of State Advances. State Advances lent an amount of R37,700,000 to the farmers. This is a large amount. This amount was lent to the less-privileged farmers about whom those hon. members are so concerned. How much of this amount is irrecoverable? Only R 114,318. This is less than .3 per cent. The farmers were even assisted to enable them to feed their labourers. Of this tremendous amount advanced to them an amount of only R114,000 cannot be recovered. Is this not adequate proof that the position of the farmers is sound, except for those in the drought-stricken areas? I come now to the assistance given to them. The economy of South Africa has never been as prosperous as it is to-day. The hon. member for Jeppe quoted from the report of the Netherlands Bank. Why did he not read what the Trust Bank has to say? They say this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The standard of living of our White population is amongst the five highest in the world. The standard of living of our nonWhites is higher than that of any non-White State in the world and compares very favourably with that of many European nations. The new development and expansion projects amount to more than R3,000,000,000 to which a further R1,000,000 is being added daily.</block>

<p>This is not a party document; it is a Bank Report. They go on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From 1948 to 1961 our industrial production trebled itself to R3,175,000,000.</block>

<p>But I want to come back to agriculture. Hon. members tell us that agriculture is not enjoying its rightful share of this tremendous economic upsurge. We can analyse this statement through the medium of a few figures. I want firstly to compare agriculture&#x2019;s contribution to the net geographical income of South Africa. In 1947 it was 14 per cent and it is now 9.8 per cent, and for that reason hon. members try to tell us that things are going badly with agriculture. But what do world economics prove? They prove that if the contribution of agriculture is larger than that of industry in any country, that country is an underdeveloped country. In other words, the larger the percentage outside agriculture and the smaller the percentage of agricultural income, the more developed is that country. This is the position throughout Europe and America. One finds that that scale changes in regard to every industrial country. One finds in countries which are very underdeveloped that agricultural income forms a high percentage of national income. This is a good sign.</p>

<p>But I want to mention another example. If I take the increase in agricultural production, if I take the index figure of 100 for 1947-50, and I compare it with the figure for 1962-3, I find that agriculture increased from 100 to 192; horticulture to 207 and animal husbandry to 147. Does this indicate a static position or does it indicate a sound growth in agriculture? But what do we have as one of our most important examples? The hon. member speaks about debt. It is true that if a man owes R10 and he does not have the R10, he is bankrupt, but if he owes R15 and he has R20, he is in a better position. In other words, one has to consider capital investment before one starts talking <span class="col_8029-8030" refersTo="page_0349"/>about agricultural debts. Let us compare these debts with capital investment in agriculture. I want to take the figures for 1948-50 and compare them with those of 1963. I find that the increase in capital investments in land was 128 per cent. As far as permanent improvements are concerned, the increase was 104 per cent; in the case of livestock it was 111 per cent and for machinery and equipment, 114 per cent. In other words, the increase in capital investment in agriculture was 120 per cent. When we compare the increase in mortgage loans and State advances with this figure, we find that it is far below 100 per cent as against the 120 per cent increase in capital. On what does the hon. member for Yeoville base his argument that things are going so badly with agriculture? Let him refute these figures if he can.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>Do we look concerned? We are simply refuting the wrong statements of the United Party. Is that why he is concerned? No, the hon. member is only mumbling to himself.</p>

<p>I have just indicated what the position is in regard to agricultural debts, but all those hon. members ask is that assistance be given to the farmers. Are they strangers in Jerusalem? Do they not know of the assistance that is being given? It is common knowledge. The hon. the Minister made a Press statement a short while ago in regard to the rebate schemes for transport services on the Railways in all the drought-stricken areas, rebates of 75 per cent on railage and road motor services in respect of the transport of stock and stock feed. What better assistance can one find? In the case of private transport, the State has gone so far as to put a rebate scheme into operation in order to subsidize private transport in the drought-stricken areas so that the farmers who cannot obtain sufficient state transport can make use of private transport. Let us look at the rebates in regard to private transport in the drought-stricken areas in the Northern Transvaal. For a distance of 20 miles, it is 15 cents per lb.; For 40 miles, 30 cents; for 60 miles, 50 cents and for 80 miles, 70 cents. Rebates ere given on all these amounts. Let us take the transport of stock feed. There is a rebate of 10 cents for a distance of 40 miles, a rebate of 10 cents for a distance of 70 miles and a rebate of 20 cents for a distance of 120 miles. The assistance is being given but it is not the only assistance that is being given. Because the hon. the Minister has his finger on the pulse of agriculture and because he wants those farmers to keep their stock alive, because he wants to make it possible for those farmers to remain on their farms, he has made special loans available for the retention of stock. These loans are as follows: Purchase of stock feed to a maximum of R20 for 10 head of large stock and R40 for 100 head of small stock per month. He has gone further and is paying for the transport of stock and stockfeed by private contractors and the purchase of fuel for the farmers&#x2019; own vehicles and so forth. He is financing the entire farming operations of those people. There is also the payment of rent for grazing to a maximum of 25 cents per head of large stock per month and the purchase of cattle licks to a maximum of 75 cents per head per month. In other words, the Government which is accused by the hon. member for Yeoville of not giving assistance to the farmers is financing the entire farming operations of the farmers in those areas in which the drought is at its worst and is keeping them on the land. There are loans for the purchase of necessities for farm labourers. Even the farm labourers are fed when the farmers are no longer in a position to feed their labourers themselves. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>While that hon. member says we must refute the figures, I should like to tell the hon. member for Wakkerstroom that he went on record this afternoon not as the champion of the cause of the farmer, but as that of the Government, and he says the farmers are doing so well that they need nothing, and he confirms it with figures. He criticizes the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) and says he dealt with agriculture as if he is a layman as regards agricultural matters. It does not require an expert on agriculture to show that the farmers are not getting their legitimate share of the prosperity. If the hon. member for Wakkerstroom wants to show that the farmers are doing so well that they are getting their legitimate share of the prosperity, he may go on record for that, but let us analyse the figures for a moment.</p>

<p>He says this body which is non-political, namely the Land Bank, is a mirror and reflects how things are going in agriculture, but like the good economist he is, he of course only quotes those figures he likes to quote, and any monkey can juggle with figures, [nterjections.] But what does the latest edition of <i>Agricon</i>say? It says the mortgage liabilities of the farmers to the Land Bank in 1948, when this Government took over when the farmers were having such a lean time, was R39,000,000, and in 1958 it was R54,000,000, and in 1962 when that terrible drought had not yet come along, it was R 126,000,000, but in December 1963, the commitments of the farmers in respect of private mortgages amounted to R 133,000,000 That shows how well things are going in agriculture! But he uses another argument. He uses the childish argument of comparing the farmers&#x2019; indebtedness with the capital investment, and what does he use? He uses State <span class="col_8031-8032" refersTo="page_0350"/>advances and the Land Bank as if these are the only commitments the farmers have against their investments of R5,000,000,000. Now the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, the expert on agriculture, says the criterion whereby you have to gauge the position, is the commitments of the farmers to the Land Bank and State Advances and you must compare that with his investment. Does he not know that the overwhelming majority of agricultural debts, the mortgage bonds, are held by financial institutions other than the Land Bank?</p>

<p>While I am dealing with the Land Bank. I should like to deal also with the system of financing available to agriculture and I am glad the Minister of Finance is here. I am very sorry that while the Ministers of Agriculture knew that agriculture was going to be discussed, they are conspicuous by their absence and that they are not here to refute the statements made. I should like to dwell upon the system of agricultural financing and I do not wish to be misunderstood. The farmers in South Africa are thankful that the Land Bank is there to take their bonds. I should like us to deal with this matter objectively when I make the point that the financing of the farmer is not looked after, while he is engaged in a risky undertaking which is greater than any other undertaking in the country. While I am referring to the Land Bank, let us talk through the mouth of the agriculturist who was above politics when he made the following statement at the Congress of the South-Western Districts according to a report in the Press, that a deputation should go to the Prime Minister to ask for the establishment of a special emergency aid fund for grain farmers so that they may be enabled to borrow money at one per cent interest. That proposal was made by Mr. Robertson. While I am on this point, let us analyse that position as regards the Land Bank and its financing of the farmer, and having done that, I should like to deal with the kind of financing the agricultural industry will have to have before it can be rehabilitated. The liabilities of the farmer to the Land Bank in the form of mortgage bonds and loans, and the liabilities of agricultural cooperatives in aid of agriculture by way of mortgage bonds and short term loans, are common knowledge and I shall not dwell upon that too long. At the end of last year these amounted to R313,000.000, and that is a shocking and colossal amount. Nor do I wish to dwell long on arrear interest. Hon. members Opposite say it is due to the drought, but the fact remains that the financial position of the farmer has deteriorated to a marked degree during the last two years, and that in proportion to the rest of the economy he cannot keep his head above water at all, and I should like to analyse the reasons, and if we can agree on that we shall reach a stage where we can tell the Government and the Minister of Finance that we require a different kind of financing for agriculture.</p>

<p>Let us take a mortgage bond for R 1,000 and see what it costs the farmer. At six per cent interest, he has to pay R60 per annum and then he must pay the redemption on the bond. I take a bond with a redemption period of 25 years, for 25 years is virtually the longest period for which he can get the loan.</p>

<p>You know 25 years is not the longest period.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>If I were to take a shorter period the rates will be higher and the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) ought to know that. So I take a redemption period of 25 years, and I take a bond for R 1,000. The interest on that will be R60 per annum, and the redemption together with, the interest will amount to R87.23; the insurance premium is R17, a total annual commitment therefore of R95.23; which means an interest rate of 9.6 per cent the farmer has to pay on his loan at the Land Bank if one takes into account the last payment. If the farmer had been able to take up that same loan for the same period with a building society, there would be a difference of only .2 per cent. It is as clear as a pikestaff, therefore, that the finance facilities available to the agriculturist at the present time are of such a nature that it does not enable him to carry on his industry in such a way that he can make a decent living out of it, and then still be able to compete on the world market. I am making this submission, Mr. Speaker, because the man, the firm or the industry taking up a loan with a building society can insure every item in respect of which he takes the loan. He can insure his building; he can insure his furniture; and the business man can insure his stock-in-trade. What is the position of the agriculturist? Is he in a position to take out insurance against every risk in the agricultural industry?</p>

<p>Can he insure his land? Can he take out insurance against the vagaries of the climate, against floods, against the exhaustion of his soil? Can he insure his stock, or can he insure his crops unless he is prepared to pay a premium which he simply cannot afford? It is as plain as a pikestaff that the risks in agriculture are greater than in any other industry in the country and yet the agriculturist is not in a position to take out insurance to cover these risks. So it obviously is necessary that a different form of financing should be made available to the farmer. The young farmer especially cannot risk taking up a loan with the Land Bank. The risk involved in a mortgage bond granted to a young man of 25 years running for the period up to his 50th year, is so much smaller than in the case of the older farmer. Therefore the young farmer tries to obtain finance facilities from other sources, sources which are unsympathetic to agriculture; they regard it simply as a financial investment. The young farmer therefore <span class="col_8033-8034" refersTo="page_0351"/>runs the risk that the institution with which he takes up his bond, is wholly unsympathetic to the agricultural industry and that that institution may ruin him by calling up the bond at a time when he is unable to make other arrangements to insure his investments. One of the great problems is that the farmer is unable to insure against these kinds of risks. We have never thought of establishing a scheme of insurance for this purpose, such as there is in many other countries of the world. The hon. member for Somerset East has mentioned that the farmer can insure his life also. Of course he can; he can even insure his children and even his servants, but he is unable to insure his capital assets, and that is why I say that it is extremely essential that some finance scheme should be established under which the farmer can obtain loans at a much lower rate of interest than that at which people in other industries involving less or virtually no risks, can obtain loans. Where a person has taken up a building society loan on immovable property, he can insure his immovable property for the amount at which he purchased it, and he therefore runs no risk; he merely has to pay the premium. Sir, if we were to establish such a finance scheme, we shall not be the first country in the world to do so. There are numerous other countries with similar schemes. In America for instance there is the Agricultural Credit Corporation which grants loans to agriculturists. The rates of interest vary, according to the security the farmer can provide, from 3 per cent to 6 per cent, and in some cases it is even less than 3 per cent. I should like to say here that in South Africa no steps at all were taken during the good years from 1950 to 1953 when agriculture flourished, to establish a finance scheme under which the agriculturist could borrow money at a lower and more reasonable rate of interest. When all is said and done, surely it is one of the methods of keeping costs of production down, and there is a host of other methods whereby it can be done. We have already mentioned that the cost of production of the agriculturist can be kept low by way of exemption from or reduction of customs dues, by way of cheaper power, cheaper equipment, cheaper spares, cheaper containers, cheaper bags. If you can keep the costs of production of the agriculturist down, you enable him to make a living even at the present prices. The burning question when all is said and done, is whether the man can make a living or not. If he can borrow his money at lower rates of interest and still obtain the present price for his products, you are at the same time solving to a large extent the problems of the small farmer and the uneconomic unit, because he will then be able to produce more cheaply and make a living. It is no good arguing about it; it is an economic fact which is as plain as a pikestaff. If you can assist these people to produce more cheaply, a much greater percentage of them will be able to make a living even at the present prices.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to proceed to other aspects of agriculture and say a word or two on storage facilities and cold storage facilities for which organized agriculture has always been pleading. During all the years I have been concerned with organized agriculture, since the year 1928, and during the 20 years I served as Chairman of various agricultural organizations, the agriculturist has always been pleading for the establishment of storage facilities to enable him to store his dairy produce, his meat and his perishable products in times of surplus production. Right up to this late stage in the year 1964 there is not nearly sufficient facilities for the storage of our surplus supplies of perishable products. I say it is a disgrace that this Government has refused through all the years to make the requisite provision for storage facilities to take agricultural products in times of surpluses, with the result that farmers are compelled to export their surplus products, frequently at uneconomic prices. I do not have enough time left to deal with all the products, but I should like to mention one, namely dairy products. According to the latest report of the Dairy Board the transactions in connection with the 1962-3 season have not yet been finalized but the report indicates that during that year 15,000,000 pounds of butter had to be imported, and 3,000,000 pounds of cheese. We had to import into this country 15,000,000 pounds of butter. While we had to export large quantities of butter and subsidize the exports, we now again have to import dairy products and subsidize the imports. The Dairy Board says that the 1962-3 transactions have not been finalized as yet, but the loss on the imno-ts of butter was R200,000 and the loss on cheese R96,000.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In this one year alone we suffered a loss of R296,000 on the importation of dairy products because we did not have the necessary storage facilities; because we did not have the necessary vision and because the two absent Ministers of Agriculture would not listen to the advice of organized agriculture. Against this loss of R296,000 there must be written off a sum of R124,000 in respect of customs duties. The Government in the first instance subsidizes the export of products, then again it subsidizes the importation of the same products, for which the consumer then has to pay a higher price because he has to pay customs duties on that imported butter and cheese.</p>

<p>Now I should like to say a word or two on the neglect of our soil by this Government, and in this connection I should like to quote what was said by Dr. S. J. du Plessis, Chief Director of Agricultural Research, at this same conference&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About 85 per cent of the grazing of South Africa is menaced by poisonous plants and <span class="col_8035-8036" refersTo="page_0352"/>other useless shrubs, Dr. Du Plessis, Chief Director of Agricultural Research, said at the Conference of the S.W.D. Agricultural Union yesterday. &#x201C;I am concerned about our grazing. There is something wrong with our pattern of utilization which does not suit nature. It is nature&#x2019;s way of retaliating.&#x201D; (Translated).</block>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Dr. Du Plessis did not refer to the vegetation only. Every farmer sitting opposite who knows the coastal area and I am now referring to the area from Uitenhage as far as Queenstown, the part where the Karroo thorn is taking up the whole area&#x2014; will know that the farmers are doing everything in their power to combat the problem. They keep goats&#x2014;not even the kinds of goats that pay, but just any kind of goat&#x2014;in a attempt to have the Karroo thorn grazed off. What has this Government ever done to help the farmers in the way farmers are helped in New Zealand, in America and in Australia to obtain spraying material to eradicate this weed; by making aeroplanes available for this purpose and to make this area suitable for animal husbandry once again?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the farmers of South Africa, in spite of what the hon. member for Wakkerstroom has said, are not getting their legitimate share of the prosperity we are enjoying in this country, and I wish to blame the Government for that. The agriculturist of South Africa put this Government in power because he thought the National Party is sympathetically disposed to him. Now the farmer is discovering that it is a Government which is not worried about the farming community; which is not concerned about the fact that the rural areas are being depopulated. It will really suit the Government much better if the rural areas were to be depopulated, for then there will not be so many farmers in the rural areas to unseat them. But the same agriculturists who put this Government in power will in the near future settle accounts with them.</p>

The hon. member referred to the 16 years during which this Government has been in power.

<p>Mr. Speaker, throughout the years the tendency has always been that the longer a Government remains in power the more by-elections it loses; but what is the record of this Government? Not only is it still continuing to win by-elections but its ranks are being strengthened by members of the United Party who cross the floor of this House to join the National Party. Over the past few years something like 22 prominent members of the United Party have resigned, as the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) pointed out here the other day. The membership of the National Party, however, has increased year by year as the result of by-elections which the party has won and as the result of resignations from the United Party.</p>

<p>If the results of by-elections are any guide as to the incompetence or competence of this Government, then it is as clear as a pikestaff that this Government is an extremely capable Government because it continues to win more and more seats from the United Party at by-elections. The United Party no longer have the courage to contest by-elections.</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members of the Opposition had a great deal to say here with regard to agriculture. If they are in earnest in saying that he agriculturist is faring so badly, then surely one would have expected them to nominate a candidate to contest the recent by-election at Beaufort West, which is a rural constituency, but they made no attempt to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member need not talk about Natal because they are also in the process of losing their Natal seats. There was also a by-election recently in an industrial centre like Vanderbijlpark. The United Party dare not contest a by-election in a rural constituency but one would have expected them to nominate a candidate to contest the byelection in an industrial centre like Vanderbijlpark but again they did not have the courage to do so. There will be another by-election shortly at Mossel Bay and we are waiting to see whether they are going to nominate a candidate. Since the National Party have come into power the United Party have not won a single National Party seat at any by-election or any general election.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Session is almost over. Nearly a hundred Bills have been introduced so far, a large number of which have already been passed. Apart from Bills which have been introduced, there are two important reports which have been submitted to the House, the report of the Press Commission and the report of the Odendaal Commission on South West Africa. I think the Opposition agree that the Government acted wisely in the case of both those reports.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from><span class="col_8037-8038" refersTo="page_0353"/>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>By ignoring the reports.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>No, the Opposition said that the Government had acted wisely, as far as the Odendaal Report is concerned, in accepting only those recommendations which it did accept. As far as the report of the Press Commission is concerned, the report still has to be studied by both that side and by the Government, and that is why the Government has not yet reacted to the report.</p>

<p>The second matter, Mr. Speaker, that I should like to touch upon is the economic position of this country and to whom the credit is due for our flourishing economy. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Government would naturally claim all the credit for itself but he went on to say that our economy was flourishing not as the result of Government action but in spite of the Government. Well, if the Opposition refuse to give the Government credit for our flourishing economy, let us see what the opinion is of other bodies and persons in this connection. I refer in the first place to the report of the Standard Bank for October last year, in which the position of industry, the banks, the wholesale trade and the retail trade is dealt with. The report specifically refers to the progress in all these sectors of our economy and then refers to the position in other Africa countries such as Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Portuguese East Africa and Kenya. What is the position in those countries in contrast with the prosperity that we are experiencing in all sectors of our economy? I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Retailers have been experiencing slack to oppressed conditions and have found it difficult to collect outstanding debts. Dealers report that they have had a poor month.</block>

<p>But if the Opposition refuse to accept what the Standard Bank says, let me quote the view of somebody to whose opinion they probably attach more importance, that of Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, with regard to our financial position. In his recent address as chairman at the annual meeting of Anglo-American Corporation Mr. Oppenheimer said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In these circumstances the risk of inflation must be carefully watched. Hitherto, however, South Africa&#x2019;s control over her economy has been excellent. Over the past five years the price level has risen at an average rate of only 1.5 per cent per annum. The Government must certainly be given credit for this.</block>

<p>Although the Opposition refuse to give any credit to the Government in this connection Mr. Oppenheimer at least is prepared to admit that the Government has carried out its task well.</p>

<p>Let us come back now to legislation which the House has passed up to the present moment. Quite a number of Bills have been passed this Session dealing with agricultural matters, and I think I am correct in saying that with one single exception all those measures were accepted by the Opposition without the slightest opposition. In one single case only, in the case of the Co-operative Societies Amendment Bill, the Opposition moved an amendment, and that amendment was in direct conflict with the inerests of the farming community. The people who strongly objected to this extension of the activities of the co-operative societies were the businessmen and the back-benchers of the United Party who asked that the Bill be held back pending the submission of certain reports. In other words, the United Party has shown clearly during this Session which interests they represent in this House. They are not concerned about the interests of the agricultural industry; they are only interested in legislation affecting the Coloureds and the Bantu and legislation dealing with the colour problem. They allowed Bills dealing with agriculture to go through practically unopposed but they kept us busy for weeks in opposing Bills affecting the Coloureds and the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville made reference here to the depopulation of the platteland and then referred to certain hostels which were allegedly empty in an attempt to show that the rural areas were becoming depopulated. Let me tell the hon. member that there is only one hostel which is empty and that is the one at Aanster on the macadamized road between Sweizer Reineke and Christiana. That is the only hostel which is standing empty, but according to the hon. member the fact that that hostel is empty is supposed o prove that the platteland is becoming depopulated. Sir, if there is one hostel which stands there to-day as a monument to the waste of money by the United Party it is that specific hostel which was built in 1944 on the instructions of an Executive Committee which consisted entirely of United Party members.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall rather not go into the details of this matter. I may just say that it was passed without the approval of the School Board. I shall rather not go further into that otherwise I may only tread on the toes of certain persons, and they will be United Party people. That hostel was not justified then, and is not justified now. It cost R250.000 and then they did not have children to fill it. That is one of the examples of how the United Party squandered money. If ever there has been a scandal, then it was the building of that hostel at Aandster. The Provincial Administration tried to fill the hostel by introducing various schemes, but they did not succeed in doing so. It consists of the most modern building, but it should never have been built there. It has never been full from the beginning, <span class="col_8039-8040" refersTo="page_0354"/>and it will never be filled either. That is the deed of the four executive committee members of the United Party put there by the United Party, together with the United Party government of 1945. The hon. member for Yeoville should rather not mention that hostel as an example of the depopulation of the rural areas. I am sorry he did so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, all of us accept that there is a migration from the rural areas to the cities. We are sorry about that; various circumstances are the cause of it. That migration has not been of recent date only. It has been going on since the country began to develop. We must remember, Mr. Speaker, that we have already surrendered 14 per cent of the land of South Africa to the urban population and we shall have to continue surrendering more land. In other words, our land is becoming smaller in extent. There are other factors too which cause this migration, however, Both the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville referred to the figure mentioned by the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, namely that from 2,000 to 2,400 leave the rural areas annually. I am not prepared to say that this figure is greater than it was during the years 1932-3-4; nor do I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition or the hon. member for Yeoville is prepared to say that. What happened to those people during those years? They had to go and work on the roads and on the Railways at 4s. per day. The position is considerably better at the present time. What the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville wish to do with those people to-day is to have them employed in factories. Is that the way to treat those people now? No, Mr. Speaker, the Government settles those people on Vaalharts and on other schemes where they rehabilitate themselves wi-thin a few years under supervision and guidance. So I hope the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Yeoville will stop trying to frighten the people away from these schemes where we are trying to help those people who did not make the grade. I hope they will stop belittling those schemes.</p>

<p>All of us are concerned and sorry about the conditions prevailing in the Northern Transvaal at the present time. All efforts are being made to bring relief. How are you going to improve the position through the price of a product? Is it possible to put right the conditions which have been prevailing in the Northern Transvaal for the last four years already, by any possible price determination?</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville referred the other day to the handling of the Marketing Act, which is merely an empowering act. The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) last year said our acts constitute a violation of the Marketing Act. But the Marketing Act is merely an empowering Act which authorizes the Minister to do certain things, i.e. to appoint boards. Seventeen boards have already been appointed under the Marketing Act. Through these boards he gives the farmers themselves control over the products. However, that power was used by the United Party in their day to force down the prices. The Minister of Agriculture of the United Party constantly reduced prices under the power conferred upon him by the Marketing Act. This Government, on the other hand, has always used those powers under that Marketing Act to fix prices internally as high as possible within the capacity of the consumer of the country. Hon. members opposite cannot deny that under any circumstances. This Government has used the powers conferred upon it by the Marketing Act in precisely the opposite way to the way in which the United Party used them in their t-irne.</p>

<p>I should like to refer briefly to one small point raised by the hon. member for East London City (Dr. Moolman) who is not here unfortunately. He referred to butter prices and the losses suffered on butter. He ought to be aware of the fact that there is a shortage of high grade butter, and because the control board took certain steps to encourage domestic consumption, butter has to be imported now. Then we should not lose sight of droughts either, that has contributed to a reduction of production. We also have certain overseas contracts which we do not wish to lapse. In these circumstances we are obliged to use emergency measures in order to tide over the difficult times, and not to make a fiasco of the butter position like that made by the United Party in their time in connection with the importation of mealies. They at the time gave away our mealies to Rhodesia at a lower price than our own farmers were receiving. I should like to point out to the hon. member for East London (City) that no loss is being suffered. The purchase price is 31.87 cent per pound; the import duties 1.65 cent. This means the landed price is 33.52 cent. That will be our domestic market price. So the hon. member for East London (City) has put his foot into it in this respect also.</p>

<p>I do not wish to elaborate on the facilities provided by the Land Bank. However, I hope somebody on that side of the House will explain to us that statement by the hon. member for Yeoville, namely that cheap loans are given by the State. Is he opposed to such loans? Must we discontinue the Land Bank loans? The hon. member for East London (City) says the rates of interest are too high but he added the insurance premiums and then his calculation still is wrong. The hon. member should check those figures again and he will then find that it is not 9 per cent. He added the insurance. Where can a loan be had in the private sector without taking out insurance? When it is considered that the Land Bank went out of its way to obtain cheap insurance premiums for the farmers, then the farmers are already benefited to the extent of some millions of rands.</p>

They will pray for a depression if it will put them in power.

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>That is the sole interpretation one can place on the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks. If that is so, I want to ask the hon. member why the Secretary of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing states in his current report where he sums up the agricultural position in South Africa over the past 10 years, that production has increased by 137 per cent, that the value of the farmer&#x2019;s products has only increased by 71 per cent while the cost of production has increased by 93 per cent, with a declining tendency as far as producer prices are concerned. If the hon. member interprets these figures as a sign of prosperity as far as the farming community is concerned then I think he is stretching things very far indeed.</p>

<p>The hon. member also gave us a summary of the work done during this Session by indicating that about 100 pieces of legislation have been introduced; that we have had debates on two important commissions of the Government&#x2019;s. But he failed to mention that we have also had other debates. We have debates dealing with the policies of hon. Ministers. It has been apparent in all those discussions that a sort of malaise or political sickness seems to be spreading through the ranks of hon. members on the Government benches. There has certainly not been any enthusiasm to take part in debates. My observation has been that less than one quarter of the benches opposite have been full during these discussions. As the hon. membef for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) pointed out whenever they were in difficulty or stuck for speakers, because of the lack of desire on the part of many Government members to speak, we inevitably had to face either the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins), or the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman), or the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), or the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) or, as a stand-in, the hon. member for Innesdal (Mr. J. A. Marais). Let me also say this that the performance of certain Ministers in handling their portfolios has been pitiful in the extreme. During the course of these discussions we have seen incredible incompetence on the part of some hon. Ministers and a lack of knowledge of the workings of the Departments they are expected to administer. If that is true, Sir, as I believe it to be and as any hon. member honestly knows it to be, then the obvious question arises what is the reason? Why this lack of enthusiasm to present the interests of their constituents and the cause for which the Nationalist Party professes to stand? Why have they failed to fight for that cause as we who have sat in this house over many years have known them to fight? They do not fight like they used to fight. Throughout the discussions on every single Vote, instead of facing up to the realities of the situation, we have had the tactic of looking for scapegoats and blaming everything possible except themselves for the shortcomings in ministerial policies. When we ask for tax relief in view of the vast surpluses declared by the Minister, what is South Africa told, Sir? They are told that they must be grateful for a Government which can declare such enormous surpluses by over-taxation! When we plead for the plight of the small farmer, the Minister says they are a lot of incompetents and potential falsifiers of census returns. That is the attitude of the hon. the Minister towards the plight of the small farmer in South Africa. When we plead for relief for our aged and for the right of able-bodied to work with Government assistance to provide for the future, our pleas fall on completely deaf ears as far as the Minister of Pensions is concerned. Everytime we ask for relief to the aged and the pensioners we are told that they must be grateful for the largesse that falls from the hands of this Government by way of bonuses. When we ask for a dynamic foreign policy to lift our country out of its isolated position, what is the reply? A completely negative reply and the admission that no foreign policy exists. So I can go on and on listing the shortcomings of this Government; all South Africa&#x2019;s difficulties. [Interjections.] Must all these defects be blamed on saboteurs, on liars, on traitors, on the English-language Press, on the Liberals and on the Progressives? In nearly every single debate in this House these words have been bandied across the floor by such hon. members as the member for Vereeniging and others.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I honestly cannot recall one single constructive positive idea presented, by way of policy and by way of new thinking, with the new vistas of economic potential and creative human relations that lie before us, by any single Minister throughout this Session. I again ask myself the reason why? Is the reason perhaps to be found in the correspondence that was very prominent in the columns <span class="col_8043-8044" refersTo="page_0356"/>of the Afrikaans Press recently? That correspondence was sparked off by the hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha). That correspondence was very lengthy. That hon. member wrote a letter to the <i>Transvaler</i>in which he said he accepted that South Africa was already united in a single nation of Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking citizens. That was not accepted by other members on the Government benches, such as the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) who took part in that correspondence. When the hon. member for Soutpansberg wrote this letter to the <i>Transvaler</i>&#x2014;he has not been evident in the debates in this House during this Session&#x2014;what was he knowledging, Sir? When he said he accepted that South Africa was already united in a single nation of Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking citizens what did he accept when he made that statement? He acknowledged that there was no longer room for the sectional approach of the Nationalist Party in the Government of South Africa. What else did he acknowledge, Sir? He acknowledged that the only way in which South Africans could grow to fulfilment as a nation was on the principle of one people, a principle for which the United Party, as represented by this side of the House, has always stood. I believe that not only the member for Soutpansberg, but other of his colleagues sitting on the Government benches hold that view. But even more important is the fact that leaders in commerce and industry and agriculture, men who have voted for his Government and have supported the Nationalist Party, have come to the realization that to-day there is a new and a catching spirit in the air which springs from a fresh reappraisal by the people of South Africa of South Africa&#x2019;s potentials, both human and material. Sir, we as South Africans are at last coming to see what South Africa can really be. This new enthusiasm which is very evident among the people outside is not based on the old fears and prejudices of Nationalist Party political preaching but it is based on the prospect of new vistas, on economic potential and on creative human relations. Sir, this excitement about a new South Africa is particularly evident amongst South Africa&#x2019;s two most forward-looking classes, the younger generation and the younger people of South Africa and the businessmen and industrialists who are largely responsible for our present economic explosion. Mr. Speaker, I am convinced that the people are tired of the old political dogmas of the Government and of the Nationalist Party. It has become apparent to many hon. members on the Government benches that the Government has now reached the stage of diminishing returns. In the field of foreign affairs and our external relations it is clear that they have reached zero. That has resulted in a mounting wave of outside pressure to intervene in our internal affairs by countries overseas. As a result of this outside pressure we have had to spend millions in order that South Africa should be able to show its teeth.</p>

<p>The final crisis of all these developments still has to come according to speeches from public platforms over the last couple of months by Ministers on the Government benches. We are entitled to ask what this crisis is which the Government anticipates in the next two or three years. One may ask what is the main spring of this feeling of insecurity and uncertainty that Government members and Ministers feel about their party affairs and their party leadership in particular? I believe it is because they see that South Africans are changing; because hon. members opposite realize that the changes in our economy are having an effect on the people outside; because it is clear that South Africa is becoming weary of the old ideas; because I believe South Africans are seeking something which will grant them greater fulfilment. The other reason, I believe, is because of the possibilities of new abilities, as have been evidenced in the recent new scientic and technological developments in our own industries and our own capacity to develop in that regard. I believe it is also because of the threatening pressures from beyond our borders. It is also because important Afrikaansspeaking South Africans see their self-interest and the only salvation for South Africa in co-operation between all the races in his country. But I think there is an even more important reason and that is because we as a South African people are weary of being walled up in our legislative groupings. We have a desire, as a people, to be accepted by others. But the most important reason of all is that under the impact of our prosperity our racial fears as a people are tending to dissipate. White South Africa is seeking to take non-White South Africa into a greatness and a better life with it and not to begrudge the non-White races what is their rightful due. But also because there is a growing realization that a joint pride in achievement for our country will be the best safeguard for all of us irrespective of the race group to which you belong. In such a new atmosphere it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is no room for a political party with outdated ideas such as evidenced by the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the Government benches may well tell me that is all very well; I am judging the situation on what is said in this House and apparent lack of interest of Government members. Is here any evidence outside of what is happening in the country to-day? Is there any outside evidence of what I have just said in regard to this political sickness that is apparent among many members on the Government benches? In order to find this out I must be able to answer the question: What is the cause of this apparent lack of interest on the part of reasonably-minded members on the Government benches, like the hon. member for Soutpansberg and, I think, many other hon. members? [Interjections.] Obviously I exclude the hon. member for Heilbron. I think this evidence is to be found <span class="col_8045-8046" refersTo="page_0357"/>in the increasing opposition in those who belong to the Nationalist Party ranks to the South African Foundation. It is clear that there is a growing animosity amongst Nationalist Party members to the South African Foundation, an organization which was established with the object of presenting a better image of South Africa overseas based on the co-operative effort of South African irrespective of the language group to which they belong. It is also an organization which has been able to amass many millions of rand and to spend many millions of rand. It is also an organization in control of which sit some of the most important and influential South Africans in our business, financial and industrial circles, men belonging to both language groups, and in the Afrikaans-language group such important personalities as Mr. Jan S. Marais, Dr. Anton Rupert, Dr. M. S. Louw, Mr. W. B. Coetzer, Mr. I. D. du Plessis and others. I am mentioning their names here because I do not think they will look upon it as an insult. The mere fact that this organization was brought into existence to accomplish abroad that which this Government with all its resources could not achieve and obtained the full co-operation and assistance of leading citizens, numbers of whom had supported the National Party is sufficient evidence of a lack of faith in the Government&#x2019;s ability to adapt itself and to revise its policies to meet the needs of modern South Africa in keeping with Western thought. I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the Foundation has done a far better job of work than the Minister of Information could ever hope to achieve. Basically, Sir, because they have presented South Africa and its people as opposed to the tactics of the Minister of Information who has followed the approach of spending millions of the taxpayers&#x2019; money in trying to sell Government race policy, an unsaleable commodity as far as the rest of the world is concerned. What now concerns Government members and the Nationalist Party organizers is the campaign launched by the Foundation for mass membership for the reason that where the Foundation strove to eliminate animosities abroad, Government members view this new drive of the Fundation as having as its objective the elimination of internal animosities revolving around primarily the racial issue. In other words, the removal of the racial issues from the political arena. Nationalist Party politicians and members like the hon. member for Heilbron, the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, the hon. member for Vereeniging and the hon. member for Wolmaransstad know only too well, Mr. Speaker, that if they cannot play on the racial fears of White South Africa by playing the racial tom-tom, they have nothing else to sell today. And what concerns Government members most is the growing realization that more and more South Africans are beginning to recognize this very fundamental fact of the political tactics of the Nationalist Party. The South African people are beginning to realize that we cannot in the face of world animosity afford to play race politics if we hope to survive as a White group and as a nation on the African continent.</p>

<p>We on these benches recognize that with this new phase in our economic expansion, at one of the highest rates in the world, that given civil peace in South Africa, given freedom from outside interference, with the natural ability of our country&#x2019;s people, of all races, to meet the needs of a forward marching civilization in the twentieth century, we are able as a party to devise policies, to make plans for the greater future and the greater happiness of our people in this country. Because, we have what hon. members opposite have lost. We on these benches have what hon. members opposite have lost&#x2014;they have lost it in professing to represent the people that they do represent. We believe that there exists a mass of goodwill amongst the people of all races in South Africa to make of South Africa an example to the world of what mankind can achieve by working in co-operation.</p>

<p>That hon. member is so afraid of isolation. He is obsessed with isolation. That is why he talks such a tremendous lot about isolation. But do you know why he is afraid of isolation? Because the English-speaking people are busy isolating the narrow-minded little group of persons like him. The English-speaking people are walking over to the National Party because they see there is a future for them in the National Party. In the National Party there is a future to-day, and the National Party is not the party that wants to isolate the people. It is the United Party which wants to isolate them. That is why the hon. member comes along with all these scare stories of isolation, but they are not believed and will not count. But now I also would like to ask the hon. member for Turffontein: How far and how <span class="col_8047-8048" refersTo="page_0358"/>long does he think will his party exist with its &#x201C;all races&#x201D;? How long does he think he will remain in Parliament, and how long does any of the members opposite think he will sit in Parliament with their &#x201C;all races&#x201D;?

<p>I blew up the United Party in Brakpan. I gladly return to the hon. member for Yeoville. I feel the way they carry on against the Minister of Information is scandalous. The Minister of Information is an English-speaking person, a person who has gained much fame on our rugby fields, a person who held high the name of the Republic of South Africa and a man who has acquired a great reputation in the business world. Because he is not prepared to-day to play the game of members opposite, namely to plough under the Whites in the Republic, now they besmirch him at every opportunity that offers. I think it is unjust and deplorable to act in this manner against a Minister holding one of the most difficult portfolios in the Republic of South Africa at this very moment when we should like to see that information is disseminated in such a manner that it will penetrate to the world. I hope and trust it is the last time we shall hear such sneering remarks in this House in respect of the Minister.</p>

<p>We are now nearing the end of a very successful session, very successful for the National Party, but destructive for the United Party which achieved nothing. When we cast our minds back to the past, to the year 1960 and the preceding years, when we cast back our minds to the history of the Republic during the past 300 years, we can say to-day that the past six months and this Session, politically speaking, have been one of the most tranquil sessions. The United Party had nothing to attack us about, and the Government simply continued to govern the country well and properly. We are very thankful for the peace and tranquillity prevailing in our country. It is due to the National Party that has been governing the country for 16 years already. Now the question arises: Why do we have peace and tranquillity here? Why have we achieved peace and tranquillity in our country? Now I shall say that the main reason is because our State satisfies all the highest requirements for a modern Western state. In the first place, the Government has had good planning. It has built up a powerful Defence Force, to repulse any attack. We are grateful to be able to say that we have a powerful Police Force to maintain law and order. One of the most important is that we also can say that the administration of our country is free of corruption. In spite of the peace and tranquillity we have in the country, we find that the United Party is still busy sowing suspicion among our people by saying that there is no progress and that there has been no industrial development, and they are busy SDreading wild stories of isolation and of bad times and low wages here. I should like to put it this way, that I am convinced that basically there is nothing wrong with the Republic of South Africa. No country in the world can say to-day that it enjoys absolute security, and there are few countries, if any, which have such a potential for vigorous growth as the Republic has. In spite of our international unpopularity, especially with the overseas politicians and the unenlightened masses and the inciters and instigators and the publicity seekers, we have developed into a truly great nation and a jewel among the Western nations. We are a well-developed, highly civilized country. We have modern factories, we have modern institutions and we are a modern state. In our primary schools and high schools we are giving our children the best education, and as regards university training, probably only America can surpass us in this respect. As regards our White people, they surely are enjoying the highest standard of living in the world and our non-Whites compare very favourably with any non-Whites in the whole <span class="col_8049-8050" refersTo="page_0359"/>world. We are richly endowed with natural resources, much more so than any other country. We are producing at present 70 per cent of the gold in the Western world and 36 per cent of the total value of diamonds. We are in the unique position to-day that we have iron ore and coal in unlimited quantities in South Africa, and we are on the threshold of great developments in every possible respect. We have one of the most beautiful countries in the world, which has the greatest tourist potential, and the Minister of Information is attracting tourists to our country and we shall one day become the playground of the world, in spite of the Opposition. We also have people who are prepared to use their energy, their drive and their ambition here to preserve what we have achieved thus far. In spite of all the beautiful things we have in the Republic and which the National Party developed for us during the past 16 years, beacons on the road of the National Party, beacons of which all of us may be proud &#x2026;</p>

<p>On the road of South Africa. The hon. member is not on that road. We are amazed when we look at the tremendous growth of the past period in the Republic of South Africa, when we have regard to the phenomenal growth which is reflected in our population increase, our colossal industrial development and the increase in our national income, when we have regard to our agricultural output, although the Opposition have had so much to say about it to-day, and when we have regard to the tremendous constitutional changes that have taken place. It fills us with gratitude and we are amazed at it. And while all these things have taken place under the policy of the National Party, we find that we are again on the point of pushing further ahead. We find that the Republic still has enormous possibilities. But if we cast our mind back to the past 300 years, when we think of the dissension there was between the White races in this self-same Republic of our&#x2019;s &#x2026;</p>

<p>We cast our minds back on the insults we had to endure, the abuse and the misunderstandings that prevailed between me and my other countrymen, even the hon. member there, and when we think of the degree of suspicion and jealousy there is at the present day even, the hatred, and when we have regard to the disrespect of each other&#x2019;s morals, when we have regard to all those things, the contempt for each other&#x2019;s culture in the past, then we stand amazed this evening at what we have achieved during the past few years since we became a Republic, and hon. members opposite are similarly amazed. We can only regard it as a miracle that the two White groups are beginning to draw closer together.</p>

<p>Economically and technologically we have attained great achievements. But if I cherish one hope, like all White inhabitants of the Republic of South Africa, then it is that we, the White people should come closer to one another, that we should learn to understand one another still better, and that we should try to solve our problems together. There is one hope we cherish, and that is that we should build a nation which is woven together by one national allegiance and with one national pride. If there is one thing we should like to see, then it is that when our National Anthem is sung and played, all of us should get up and stand at attention and sing it at the top of our voices, not as we experience it to-day at our rugby matches or on other occasions where there is some indolence. If there is one thing we should like to see in this country, then it is that we should accept our flag when it flutters, and that we should look proudly upon it when it flutters in the air. But there is something else the Republic has brought us, and which the National Party is busy bringing about for us, and that is that we should build up a great nation with national pride. But hon. members opposite see we are busy building up a nation and now they want to break down the nation and refuse to cooperate. You are the people who say we are driving sections into kraals, but it is the United Party actually which is herding people together in kraals. I want to tell the United Party this evening that the game they are playing, where the Whites are fighting each other in midfield while the non-Whites are interested spectators watching us from the touch-line, must come to an end. That game will not get us anywhere.</p>

Now there is a splendid opportunity in this Republic for us to be bound together in an alliance of unity so that nobody will ever be able to drive us apart as a White nation. There was a time in our national life when the Afrikaners were tom asunder and divided. They have found one another. They are bound together, and the members of the Opposition know to-day that the Afrikaners have rejected the United Party. There remains only a person like the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) whom they are keeping because he can get another seat for them, but for the rest he also means nothing to them. Now the English-speaking people are walking over to the Afrikaners, and we are busy building up a nation together &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to say this to hon. members: We are a young country; we have tremendous possibilities; let us to-day act like worthy citizens and let us show the outside world that we are prepared to face up to our problems here in the Republic and to solve those problems ourselves. If we can stand together as a White nation, and show the world that we are not divided, our battle will have been won, and if we can manage to get the non-Whites to accept our policy&#x2014;and the non-Whites are already to a large extent prepared to live with us in the Republic in the way the National Party has provided for them, we shall realize our ideal. For the nonWhites also know that there is only one way out and one future, and that is if they accept racial separation. They are prepared to do so, but it depends on us as the Whites who unfortunately are still fighting one another in every possible way, and who are splitting apart, in the same way that that hon. member wants to grasp at an utterance and a remark made by a city councillor of Johannesburg and inflate it into something colossal. I want to ask hon. members: Come let us accept the challenge issued to us by the world, and I tell you that if you fall in behind the National Party together with us, and accept our policy &#x2014;because it is the only policy which offers a solution to our problems&#x2014;then we shall come out on top. There is no other policy we can pursue. As we have reached this stage to-day, and as we have made tremendous progress and reached great heights, as we have procured accord among the Whites of the Republic to a great extent, as there is peace and quiet among the non-Whites, as we do not know strikes in this country, as the workers are contented, there are two things which are as plain as a pikestaff, and there are two things about which we can feel very happy, namely that the Republic has brought the Whites together in harmony. But the Republic has also brought us two very important persons, two persons who mean a tremendous lot to our country, and two persons who will still be accepted by the world as the leaders in statesmanship, two persons whom we shall accept here in South Africa one day, and for whom we shall erect great monuments&#x2014;I see the hon. member is curious. I shall tell him that the two persons we have procured to get us out of this morass and conflict, are a Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of racial peace, and a John Vorster, the guardian of racial peace in the Republic of South Africa, the multi-racial country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) has made a speech here in the House to-day which will apparently be the speech which he will make to a meeting of his constituents when he returns to Brakpan after the Session. Of course, the hon. member was sensible enough to make the speech in this House because he was sure of an audience here but the hon. member will not be so sure of an audience when he returns to his constituency.</p>

<p>What did the hon. member say? Towards the end of his speech he told us about all the wonderful things the Nationalist Party is doing to-day to promote national unity and that it is the party which stands for the building up of a united South Africa. He asked us on this side of the House to assist them in that regard. The hon. member for Brakpan must not ask us to help him. The United Party has been trying for years, for generations and generations, to build up national unity between the Afrikaans and English-speaking people. We have been trying over the years to bring about a sound spirit of South Africanism between Afrikaans and English-speaking people. Has the hon. member for Brakpan forgotten the struggle which this party waged in the Provincial Council of his province in 1949 when the National Party tried to drive a wedge between Afrikaans and English-speaking people? Has the hon. member forgotten that it has been this party which has always objected to regiments, one for English-speaking people and one for Afrikaans-speaking people? Where was that hon. member and his South Africanism and the South Africanism of his party in 1940 when General Hertzog left that party because the National Party was not prepared to acknowledge the equal rights of English and Afrikaans-speaking people? Has the hon. member forgotten about that? And at the same time, the hon. the present Prime Minister wrote a leading article in which he said that it surprised him that a man like General Hertzog should have had to quarrel with and leave the National Party on a matter like the rights of the English-speaking people. Has the hon. member for Brakpan forgotten these things? No, we in South Africa would by this time have progressed much further along the road of South Africanism if hon. members opposite had been prepared 15 or 20 years ago to say what the hon. present Minister of Lands said a few weeks ago at Piketberg&#x2014;that the National <span class="col_8053-8054" refersTo="page_0361"/>Party should become like the old South African Party was in 1920 and before that. The hon. member for Brakpan knows that there was the greatest exploitation of sentiment when the Nationalist Party insisted that what it wished to do was to bring about Afrikaner unity, but while they were trying to bring about Afrikaner unity, we on tljiis side of the House were fighting for South Africanism. We were already starting to forget the differences between Afrikaans- and English-speaking people. Now, at this late stage in the history of this country, the hon. member for Brakpan has made a plea for co-operation between English and Afrikaans-speaking people. But allow me to congratulate the hon. member in at last having seen the light, which this party has being seeing now for the past 50 years.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that he was proud of all the natural resources in this country. But of course! Who is not proud of what we in South Africa have at our disposal? Who is not proud of our diamonds? Who is not proud of our gold? And who is not proud of the human material we have at our disposal in this country? Was the point made by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) earlier in this debate not that we do not overlook these things or miss seeing them but that we want to see a Government in power which will have the necessary vision, courage and energy to develop these advantages for the good of our country? That is what we want. The hon. member for Brakpan knows that during this Session one motion after another has been moved by hon. members on this side of the House with the idea of improving the position of the ordinary man in South Africa. He says that they are proud of this Session. He says he is proud of the contribution which they have made during this Session. But can he honestly return to his constituency and tell his constituents there that there has never been a Government which has done more for the education of our young boys and girls than this Government has done?</p>

Does he not know of the thousands and thousands of people, both in his and in other hon. members&#x2019; constituencies, who are to-day living dangerously close to the breadline? Does he not know of the thousands and thousands who cannot come out on their incomes? The hon. member says he is proud of the assistance which they have obtained for the farmers. He says that the contention of the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) is wrong and that our agriculture has never been in as favourable a position as it is to-day. Does the hon. member know of the White Paper which was published in connection with the Budget? He should see what appears on page two of that Paper in regard to the contribution which agriculture is making to the national income of our country. What is the position in that respect? In 1951-2 the contribution of our agricultural industry to the national income was 13.6 per cent; in 1956-7, it was 14.2 per cent but in 1962-3, it fell to 10.4 per cent. But then hon. members opposite say that we are wrong when we point out to them that agriculture is not enjoying its rightful share of the prosperity in this country! And that while we have here a document drawn up by the Government itself, a document which indicates that the contribution of agriculture to our national income has fallen sharply!</p>

<p>If things are going as well with the farming population of this country as hon. members contend, why is it then that every year proves that hundreds of farmers are not able to make a living on the land? If it is true that our farming position is so sound, they ought to stay on the land and not move to the cities. Why, if the position is so sound, is it necessary for us to make so many loans to the farmers each year with the purpose of keeping them on the land? The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) has said that we do not know what we are talking about. He said that only a small number of loans were issued and that the farmers were not in difficulty at all. The farmers are able to pay all their debts or so he has told us. Apparently he is quite satisfied in regard to the debts which the farmers have had to incur because, he said, there is nothing wrong with that. But let us also look at the report from which he quoted, the report of the State Advances Recoveries Office. Let us look at page 9 and see what the position is in regard to the recovery of loans. On 31 March 1960 the total number of loans issued by the State to assist farmers numbered 42,271 and the amount in this regard was R23,500,000. On 31 March 1961 the number of loans had fallen while the amount involved had risen to R33,000,000. As at 31 March 1963 the number of loans had dropped further&#x2014;by more than 1,000 since 31.3.1960 &#x2014;but the amount involved had risen to R37,000,000.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that State Advances does not assist a man to purchase land. That is the function of the Land and Agricultural Bank. State Advances are there to assist people who are already in difficulty. We find that over this three-year period there has been an increase in the amount of these loans from R23,000,000 to R37,000,000, an increase of R14,000,000 in the amount loaned to farmers.</p>

<p>But let us also look at page 15 of the latest report of the Land and Agricultural Bank, and more specifically at the table dealing with medium-term loans made available to farmers. As at 31 December 1962 the capital amount owing was R9,000,000. One year later, this amount was R7,000,000. Arrear interest amounted to almost R500,000 in comparison with R 1,600,000 in the next year. These figures show that the arrear interest and capital amounted to 15.449 per cent in 1962 and to 21.566 per cent at the end of 1963.</p>

<p>This is the only salvation of these people and this is so because the Government refused to give its attention to the crux of the problem. That is the reason. The hon. member knows that the drought assistance which is voted on the Estimates each year will not assist the farmers out of their difficulties. This is merely piece-work, piecework which the Government will be compelled to do every year because it refused, definitely refuses to recognize the fundamental difficulties of the farmers.</p>

<p>It is an accomplished fact to my mind and as clear as daylight that the farmers in our country are not sharing in our country&#x2019;s prosperity. Moreover, we find nothing in these Estimates to generate confidence in us as far as the future of agriculture in our country is concerned. As far as I am concerned, it is clear that the farming population of our country is being treated shabbily by the Government, except in regard to the piecework which is done, as is the case in connection with drought assistance. It is clear to my mind that the farming population of South Africa are not being protected by this Government. What do the farmers of our country ask for? They only ask for a few things. They ask that they be given the chance to make a reasonable living. Just as the Government is prepared to admit that the income of the salaried man and of the wage-earner must be increased from time to time, so the farmer also feels that from time to time he should be enabled to enjoy a higher standard of living. The fact is that the farming industry is that branch of our economy which still produces the lowest dividend. But what do we find now? We find that as soon as we encourage our farmers to produce more and they do so&#x2014;it is due to the farmers of South Africa that we can boast to-day of the fantastic volume of production which has been achieved over the past ten to 15 years&#x2014;prices to the farmer are reduced. As soon as he produces well and surpluses arise, there is only one way out and that is to reduce the prices paid to the farmer. Because of this fact the farmer is forced to leave his industry. That is what is happening in our dairy industry to our cream and milk farmers. When this happens, we find that shortages arise, and as soon as shortages arise, prices are raised slightly.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) had only listened to the theme of the speeches that have been made on this side of the House for the past six years he would know that we ask for stability, stability in the agricultural industry; we do not want a continual fluctuation in prices. We ask for stability so that the farmer can be assured of a reasonable entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage plus production costs. That is all we ask for. The solution to this does not lie in reducing the prices at one stage and then raising them at the next as soon as a little difficulty is experienced. Besides the fact that we do not satisfy the farmer thereby there is also the fact that by doing this we dissatisfy another group&#x2014;the consumers, simply because of the fact that this Government refuses to follow a policy which aims at stability for the producer as well as the consumer.</p>

<p>Under circumstances such as this, no farmer, whether he is a stock farmer or a crop farmer, or whatever the case may be, can look forward to a rosy future. And yet the whole world, including our own people in this country, needs more food. We ought not to find ourselves saddled with surpluses when there are many thousands of mouths that have to <span class="col_8057-8058" refersTo="page_0363"/>be fed. There are millions and millions of people needing food and clothing every day. I am convinced of the fact that with a view to the population explosion which the world is heading for, not fewer but more farmers will be needed to produce the necessary food. Here I am reminded of a report by the Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services which was tabled a year or two ago and in which he pointed out that we would experience a food catastrophe if we did not ensure that we had a sufficient number of farmers for the future, farmers who could produce the food for the increasing population of the world.</p>

<p>But what I cannot understand is that hon. members cannot appreciate this fact. Why then are they prepared to tackle a scheme like the Orange River scheme? It is the intention of the Government to enable about 10,000 farmers to keep going by means of this scheme. If they do not admit that more farmers are necessary, then they must say that this scheme is a white elephant. But about 2,400 farmers are leaving the land every year. As a result of the circumstances prevailing today, agricultural leaders are worried about the future. Indeed, they see no future because they realize that this Government cannot plan for the future. And so the farmer does not know when he will be forced off the land because of surpluses and low prices. That is why I find that farmers are now advocating the establishment of a central planning board. Why should a central planning board of this nature be established? Why is it that the farmers ask for this sort of thing? It is because they feel that something must be done to frame projects for the future, such as the various commodities to be produced, what the food requirements of our country will be and so forth. Then it will no longer be necessary for us to operate in this erratic way; we will then not find ourselves saddled with surpluses at one stage and with shortages at the next. It is for this reason that the farmers ask for a planning board of this nature&#x2014;because they have no confidence in the fast and loose agricultural policy being followed in this country. And in this respect the farmers are quite right. We ask the Government whether it intends complying with this request of the farming community. Is it going to comply with this request so that we can have better planning for the future and, because of this fact, greater confidence in the future? No farmer can continue if he has to contend with increased prices at one stage and decreased prices at the next. This undermines confidence in the industry. The farmers ask for the establishment of a central planning body of this nature and we want to know what the Government&#x2019;s intentions in this regard are. The Government ought to say whether it has something of this nature in mind in order by so doing to make the farmers feel more confident in the knowledge that their future will be in good hands. I hope therefore that the hon. the Minister of Finance, after consultation with the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and with the hon. the Minister Agricultural Technical Services &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In the beginning of his speech the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) who has just resumed his seat blamed the National Party for the fact that while they were fighting for a larger South Africanism, we were fighting for Afrikaner unity. He referred to the struggle of 50 years ago. But what the hon. member forgets is that when the National Party 50 years ago called for Afrikaner unity, his party found it impossible even to accept the principle of South Africa first. But now they imagine that they are the advocates of a wider South Africanism. Where were they when the National Party, during the past 50 years, were busy laying the foundations for such a wider South Africanism? Where were they when we fought for the principle of remaining neutral in a war and for the principle of our independence? Then that party would have nothing to do with those things! When we fought for symbols to represent our South Africanism, that party was opposed to it. Where were they in the battle for the flag? Where were they when we fought for our own South African citizenship? No, it was always too much for that party that we should have our own flag. Therefore we still had to have the flag of another country as well. We could not be citizens of our own country alone. No, we also had to be citizens of another country. Even a few years ago when we wanted to abolish appeals to the Privy Council, they were not in favour of that. And what happened when we fought for the principle of having our own Head of State? Then they were not in favour of that either. The fact is that when this party fought to lay the foundations for a larger South Africanism, that party was not in favour of it. But now that we have laid these foundations, now that we have become a Republic and the struggle is past, now that we have various symbols to give expression to our wider South Africanism, that party opposite contends that it pleaded for it! But these things were made possible only by the foundations laid throughout the years by the National Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member pleaded for the farmers. The hon. member is a farmer himself, a progressive farmer in one of our Karoo districts. But with the policy he has propounded here <span class="col_8059-8060" refersTo="page_0364"/>to-day he will not be able to gain a seat in the Karoo. That is why he represents an urban constituency! He says the farmer is without protection to-day, and he says it is the farmer who is responsible for the fantastic production of our factories. In other words, therefore, things are going well. I agree that our industries are also dependent on the farmers, but the farmers are dependent on the industries too. I can wholeheartedly support the principle he stated here, and I shall tell him why I support him.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in the years 1956-7 agricultural production amounted to R895,000,000, of which R314,000,000 or 41 per cent was bought by our factories. That was the position even in those years. To-day I am convinced that this percentage is much higher. But when I say that our farmers are dependent on the purchases made by industry, I am also prepared to state the opposite, namely that the industries need the farmers because of the total purchases of R842,000,000 by the farmers in that year, R 125,000,000 in respect of purchases from our industries. I therefore quite agree when it is said that the industries and the farmers mutually help each other. That is also why we can say that the tremendous industrial expansion we have today also benefits the farmer, and where steps are taken to stimulate industry, agriculture is also stimulated indirectly and the farmers also derive benefit from it.</p>

<p>But the hon. member says things are going so badly with the farmers that agriculture contributed only 10 per cent to our national income. But the contribution to our national income is surely not the only yardstick by which progress can be measured. If we look at the volume of production, we find that while the contribution made by agriculture to our national income from 1919 to 1961 decreased from 25 per cent to 11 per cent, the production of agriculture increased in value from R101,000,000 to R535,000,000&#x2014;in other words, it increased five-fold. If one calculates that as a percentage of the national income, one will also find that the contribution made by mining in those years was also higher than it is now. But our mining production has also increased in volume. The decrease in the percentage contribution to our national income is particularly to be ascribed to the development of our industries. Surely it is essential that there should be industries. We cannot remain merely an agricultural country. Nor can we remain merely a mining country or produce only raw materials. And thanks to the policy of the Nationalist Government we are not to-day an agricultural country only, or a country which just produces raw materials from its mines. As the result of the protective tariffs the Nationalist Government introduced in 1924, our industries started developing. Iscor was established and it was followed by one industry after another. Since then it has always been the policy of this Government to stimulate industrial development, and with the increasing industrial production the percentage contributed to our national income by agriculture and mining decreased. But that does not mean that things are going so much worse with agriculture or the miningindustry. On the contrary, even in the ten years up to 1961, our agricultural production increased by 60 per cent. Even last year it still increased by 5 per cent. Therefore it cannot be said that there is a standstill in the agricultural sector; on the contrary, there is progress. It is as the result of the policy of the Nationalist Government over the years of stimulating industrial development that there has been a shift of population from the platteland to the cities. It is a natural process which has inevitably followed on the industrial expansion. That happens everywhere in the world where there is industrial development, and also in this country. <i>I am</i> not sure of the percentage, but I think that whereas in 1910 about 60 per cent of the White population still lived on the platteland, to-day it is less than 20 per cent. The growth of the cities has resulted in that. It is also this process which has brought about the decrease in the number of people engaged in the agricultural sector of our economy.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the figure the hon. member quoted in regard to the number of farmers who leave the rural areas every year. He said it was a figure I had mentioned, but I want to point out how wrongly it is being interpreted. It is now said that it is our policy to force the farmers off the land. The fact is that the number of farmers have decreased. There has not been a decrease only during the last year or two. Here I have the <i>Monthly Bulletin of Statistics.</i> That is where I got the figures which are being quoted, and it shows that in 1936 there were 181,000 active White farmers, and in 1946 there were only 167,000, and in 1951 there were 145,000, and in 1960 there were 117,000. But if we analyse the figures for industry, we see that in 1936 there were 90,000 Whites in the industrial sector, precisely half the number in the agricultural sector, but in 1960 that increased to 230,000, whereas in agriculture there were 117,000. Where there was therefore a decrease in the number of farmers, there was a very large increase in the number of Whites in industry, and it is in that regard that I mentioned the figures which were quoted here. I want to mention this because it was referred to once again. I pointed that out on the occasion of <span class="col_8061-8062" refersTo="page_0365"/>a function in Paarl. After I pointed out how there was an increase in the production in the industrial sector, I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is, however, significant that the number of Whites engaged in agriculture has consistently decreased since 1936, viz. from 179,000 to 118,000 in 1960. Nevertheless approximately 18 per cent of the total White population still lives on the platteland today. According to the tendency between the population census of 1951 and that of 1960, it is accepted that the number of Whites engaged in agriculture will continue to decrease gradually during the period 1963 to 1968. On the basis of this, it is estimated that the number of White farmers economically active in the agricultural sector will decrease from 106,147 in 1963 to 93,919 in 1968, i.e. by approximately 2,400 per annum.</block>

<p>Then I gave the reasons for this and said, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">There are many uneconomic farming units which result in some farmers being in financial difficulties. That is one of the reasons for the declining tendency in the number of farmers, as indicated by me. The solution to this problem does not lie in assisting these people who are already unable to make a living under generally favourable circumstances, to make some sort of living as farmers. In the case of most of these people, any assistance given to them to carry on their farming operations will not solve their problems. Such assistance will only make further assistance necessary. The Orange River scheme and the other irrigation schemes do not provide the full solution either. The assistance these people require is to change over from agriculture to another form of living, apart from agriculture. In the past it has been proved that it is not always easy to absorb farmers in other vocations. In the years that lie ahead it will be one of our problems to decide how to give suitable assistance to change this group over from agriculture to an active and proper existence outside agriculture. The shortage of Whites in the industrial and professional sectors will be an attraction for farmers in the agricultural sector where there is over-employment, but I should like to see them being absorbed effectively.</block>

<p>That is what I said in this connection. This is now being interpreted as if it is our policy that it must happen and that we favour it.</p>

<p>There are other reasons for it also. We find that this smaller number of farmers still achieved an increased production. There are other reasons, such as mechanization and better technical methods, scientific research, fertilizers and other technical reasons, why fewer farmers have achieved this greater production; and things are not going so badly with the farmers. The mere fact that there is such a rise in land prices is one of the indications that things cannot be going so badly, and many of the people who buy land are not people outside the agricultural sector, but people within that sector. But when the hon. member for Yeoville tried to indicate how badly things were going for the farmers, he advised us to look at Germany where the small farms were reduced by 300,000, and 20 per cent of the area was enlarged. Steps were taken here also to prevent the cutting up of farms, and here also our Minister of Agriculture is in favour of economic units, but that is one of the very things which result in the decline in the number of farmers. The fact that units are enlarged results in there being fewer farmers. The hon. member for Yeoville blames us for the fact that the number of farmers is decreasing, but one of the solutions he suggests to improve the position of the farmers has the very result that their numbers decrease.</p>

<p>Another objection the hon. member has is that we do not do enough for the people in the rural areas. He says that one of the ways in which the position has improved in other countries is by decentralization of industry and by diversification of the economic activities in the rural areas. He says we must have more decentralization, but the moment we take steps to decentralize they say we want to take industries away from the Rand. He even went so far as to say: &#x201C;The Government has no policy for a bold and imaginative industrial development of South Africa except in border areas&#x201D;. All those hon. members who say that have not the least idea of what is going on on the Rand. In no other centre is there such fast industrial expansion as on the Central Rand. No other place in South Africa can compare with it. It is our policy to decentralize, and even the hon. member for Yeoville has now advocated it, but when it comes to putting it into practice he says we want to harm the Rand. When we make an analysis of the industrial expansion of 1963, we see that 55 per cent of the industries which needed import permits, i.e. mainly new industries, were in the Southern Transvaal, and of that 55 per cent, 82 per cent was on the Central Rand. That proves what expansion there was, but the hon. member says we want to kill the Central Rand by decentralization.</p>

<p><span class="col_8063-8064" refersTo="page_0366"/>But we need not stop there. We can go further. He referred to the West Rand and said things were difficult there. He said the industrial production on the West Rand was R60,000,000, and on the Central Rand it is R600,000,000 and on the East Rand it was R200,000,000, but that is meaningless because mining production is not included in those figures. To say that that is the income of those areas is a half-truth. The fact is that there is more industrial concentration on the East Rand. They have been at it longer than on the West Rand. There are more industries, but that does not mean to say that there is no progress. On the contrary. He refers to Randfontein and Roodepoort and Krugersdorp, but there is no stagnation there either. I have the latest building figures for those areas. If we analyse them, we see that in Krugersdorp in 1963 building plans were approved amounting to over R2,000,000, including industries. Four new industries were established and there were 30 extensions only last year. The year before there were three new industries and 52 extensions. In the first three months of this year it was almost R 1,000,000. In Randfontein we find the same expansion. I also have the figures for Roodepoort here. Last year there was an increase of over R3,000,000 in Roodepoort. The hon. member for Yeoville asked how that compared with Johannesburg and the East Rand. In Johannesburg building plans amounting to R7,700,000 were approved. That was just for the three months. The expansion for Johannesburg itself was R30,000,000, and the industrial section of it amounted to R6,700,000. Is that stagnation? The industrial plans approved for Johannesburg amounted to 137. Look at Germiston. There plans amounting to R6,500,000 were approved, including nine new industries, but I do not want to deal with this further. I think I have proved it convincingly. I see in the latest issue of the <i>West Rand Times</i> of April: &#x201C;Housing shortage now critical at all points along the West Rand&#x201D;. Therefore there is no stagnation. [Interjections.] It is clear that South Africa is now experiencing its longest continuous period of economic growth, and there are no signs of it declining; rather, there is every indication that it will still continue. Here again, I can refer to the latest analysis. I refer to a return dated 20 May. When we compare the total industrial production with that of the first three months of last year, we find that there was an increase of 14.8 per cent on an average. We find that in sectors like paper and paper products there is an increase of 20 per cent; the production of petrol from coal, 80 per cent; non-ferrous mineral products, 26 per cent; metal products, 17 per cent: electrical machinery, 23 per cent. That shows what tremendous activity there has been in the industrial sector. But it is not only in that sector. If we compare the building plans approved during the first three months with he corresponding period last year, we see that in regard to dwelling-houses there is an increase of 45 per cent and in regard to flats of 80 per cent, and in regard to business buildings and factories there is an increase of 108 per cent. The average total increase over last year is 69 per cent. There are other indications that the same expansion is still in progress. Just in April, in secondary industry, 155 new companies were registered, with a capital amounting to R900,000, and the authorized capital of 25 companies was increased by a total of R3,600,000. That gives an indication of what is still in progress. We are having unprecedented economic expansion. Small wonder that only last week I still read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Industrial expansion causes order book indigestion.</block>

<p>When we compare our industrial expansion with that of other countries, it is a striking comparison. That of Italy, from 1953 until now, has increased by 11 per cent, and that of France has increased by 6 per cent, but ours has increased by 14 per cent over the past year. That is an indication of how strong our economy is. No wonder that even the London <i>Financial Times</i> recently said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa can now claim to be the current holder of the world&#x2019;s economic miracle.</block>

<p>That is an indication that South Africa is complying with the basic requirements. South African can supply the capital it needs; we have the natural resources, we have the technology and we have the initiative, but apart from that we have a Government which ensures industrial peace and stability.</p>

<p>I can understand the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs rising and diverting the debate from a discussion on the Government&#x2019;s shortcomings in agricultural administration. A strange feature of the debate has been that, although for the last four hours discussion has been directed at agricultural matters and that comment has been made on the fact that the agricultural population has not had its fair share in the current upsurge of the economy, neither of the two Ministers of Agriculture have been present in the House and no reason or excuse has been given for their absence. So I can understand the hon. the Deputy Minister rising and diverting the discussion.</p>

<p><span class="col_8065-8066" refersTo="page_0367"/>The hon. the Deputy Minister, in trying to reply to some of the arguments advanced from this side of the House as to the depopulation of the rural areas, has chosen to say that it is a normal and natural phenomenon. I certainly agree with him that population drifts from country to town are natural phenomena in all countries in which industrial development is forging ahead. If that were the only answer here it would apply to all sections of the population. What the hon. the Deputy Minister did not explain to us was why it was taking place only in regard to the one race and not in regard to the other groups. Why is it the White population which is drifting to the town and not the non-White population? Why is the White population drifting away from the rural areas whereas the non-White population is drifting in? That is the criticism which has been raised from this side of the House to which no answer has been given.</p>

<p>Although the hon. the Deputy Minister entered into the economic and industrial field in this debate I found it strange that he disregarded entirely the arguments advanced by my hon. colleague the member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje). The hon. member for Jeppes dealt with some of the aspects of this matter. He pointed out in particular that decentralization was not taking place in accordance with normal economic trends. He indicated that decentralization was being carried out for political ends and not for economic ends. In doing so, he said, we had reached the stage where there was a theoretical de-urbanization of the Bantu in the country whereas in practice the very opposite was taking place. None of those aspects were dealt with by the hon. the Deputy Minister as one would have expected him to do.</p>

<p>I want to deal, however, with a different phase of administrative deficiencies on the part of the Government. According to the latest report of the Controller and Auditor-General 18 commissions of inquiry and 28 special departmental committees were actively engaged during 1962-3 in aiding or advising the Government how to set about its business of administering the country. These bodies were not minor or insignificant bodies of little consequence because the cost involved to the public purse up to 31 March 1963 was nearly R640,000. That was more than a year ago. Since that time, as everybody knows, a number of new commissions and new committees have been added to the list. All in all they must make quite a formidable list of extraordinary aids and in some cases, such as the abortive Press Commission, also costly aids, which have been set up by this Government to smoothe out the many snags both administratively and economically that have come into being during the five years of executive rule under the present hon. Prime Minister. Such an array of <i>ad hoc</i> aids to Government is evidence, I believe, not of success but rather of failure in the exercise of sound public administration. That, I believe, is the true significance of this large-scale effort on the part of the Government to seek advice in administering the country. What alarms me is not so much the number of commissions or committees appointed by the Government or the amount which has been defrayed from the public purse in meeting the direct costs of these extraordinary aids to administration, but the amount of waste that is involved in the process. A list of the reports of bodies of this kind that have been shelved by the Government in the last few years, either temporarily or for all time, must by now also have reached quite formidable proportions. To give an accurate summary in that regard could involve far more time than I can devote to that exercise.</p>

<p>The two most recent reports, i.e. the hefty Odendaal Report on South West Africa and the lamentable Press Commission Report, clearly come within that category. The waste of time, the waste of energy and the waste of words involved in the preparation and the compilation of those two reports alone must be quite staggering in proportion to the results achieved. As I have indicated it is not so much the waste of money but this other waste which I find quite alarming. All this misdirection of man hours, if not in every case manpower, and all this waste of energy and effort has occurred at the very time when industry and business in general are in danger of slowing down from want of a sufficiency of human endeavour and human skill. It has also taken place at a time when the Public Service itself is desperately short of personnel.</p>

<p>Whether the Government&#x2019;s intense and costly, if not extravagant, planning at the present time on the military war front is well directed or not, I certainly do not profess to know. But I do know this that the Government would do well to plan a war against waste in public administration. One of the noticeable features of the current parliamentary Session has been that throughout the whole of the Session members on this side of the House have drawn attention to inefficiency and sometimes to incompetence in the railway administration, in health services, in postal and radio services, in police and defence operations and in the administration of several other Departments such as the Labour Department and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. It is not necessary for me to try to recapitulate all the incidences referred to from this side of the House during Committee of Supply or by means of questions to Ministers.</p>

<p>I would remind the hon. the Minister of Finance that even his Department was subject to criticism in that regard. The administration in an important branch of his Department has also been openly criticized in the public Press and the disturbing circumstances referred to in the Press and in this House are still unresolved.</p>

<p><span class="col_8067-8068" refersTo="page_0368"/>I believe that one of the most effective ways of waging war against administrative waste, whether that waste be due to extravagance or inefficiency or both, is for the hon. the Minister of Finance to budget for a deficit. Had the hon. the Minister been willing to make that change from his present budgetary habit and had he for the current year presented the House with a deficit budget I think he would have revealed both initiative and enterprise, something which is very necessary at this stage. Had he done that himself, he might also have inspired initiative and enterprise in all others concerned in public administration. But the budgetry habits of the Minister have apparently become too deeply rooted to make such a change. The Minister&#x2019;s budget surplus on Revenue Account for the current year, 1964-5, is likely to be a substantial one once again.</p>

<p>I do not want to repeat the argument which was used yesterday that this has been an extraordinary Session in two directions, firstly, in that the Minister was out with his budgeting to such an extent in regard to his surplus for the last year, i.e. 1963-4, that he had to revise it and bring it up by something like another 50 per cent. Secondly, he also took the extraordinary course during the current year of revising revenue estimates for 1964-5 within a matter of weeks after having delivered his Budget speech on 16 March this year. Needless to say, the revision was in an upward direction&#x2014;more tax revenue for 1964-5, not less. I am not at the present moment concerned with details but with the fact that surplus budgeting tends to aggravate and not to lessen waste. It provides the Government wih money for jam, as the saying goes. Consequently, most taxpayers to-day will appreciate the words of A. P. Herbert who said&#x2014;</p>

<p>Well, if he had, I think he could have improved on this! In any event, that sets out precisely how the taxpaying public in this country feel about the situation which has developed. That is why I say that the time has obviously come where if you are going to wage war against waste, the way in which this should start is for the Minister to change his budgetary habits and to budget for a deficit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile gold and foreign reserves have continued to pile up and the danger of inflation draws nearer almost every day. Surplus budgeting does not lessen this danger of inflation but, if anything, it accentuates the danger because the whole process is simply one of transferring spending power from the private to the public sector of our economy. I do not want to develop this argument now, because it was discussed yesterday, but I think the doggerel of A. P. Herbert does go to show how necessary it is to bear in mind that once the money goes to the Government, &#x201C;nobody will see the stuff again&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it seems to me to be necessary to reiterate once again that the case the hon. the Minister has put up ever since 1960, and rejected more than once during the current Session, for retaining the arbitrary and artificial devices of import and exchange control has grown very thin indeed. May I in this connection remind the Minister of the words of Mr. Peter Runge, president of the Federation of British Industries who visited this country some time last year. His name, incidentally, appears in Her Majesty the Queen&#x2019;s honour list yesterday.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>So does the name of Billy Butlin.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not at present concerned with Mr. Billy Butlin although I might also quote him later. At present I wish to quote for the benefit of the hon. the Minister what Mr. Peter Runge said because this is germane to what we are discussing. During his visit to South Africa, this is what he had to say about import control&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your continued use of this method of controlling imports is, to say the least, unpopular &#x2026; To interfere with the customer&#x2019;s freedom of choice by detailed administrative control, is bad and is much more rigid than a tariff.</block>

<p>I quote this because it does emphasize the fact that to prolong this artificial method of control, or rather the case for prolonging it, is growing very thin indeed. The same applies to the continued use of exchange control. In that regard the present situation of control shows that it has now become a matter of being &#x201C;cent wise and rand foolish&#x201D;. This very day we dealt with a provision in the Finance Bill giving the Government power to borrow money to regulate the internal monetary conditions. To take these powers might be a novel manoeuver on the part of the Government but it certainly does not surprise me that the Minister is now taking special powers to borrow internally for the specific purpose of lending abroad. As I say, this step may be a necessary step for purposes of the Government particularly as the loan account during the current year is likely to be very much over-endowed, to put it midly, with too much money. It will not only have to accommodate a substantial portion of the surplus of nearly R 130,000,000, but in addition it has to absorb other trust funds which will come into the hands of the Government during the year. I do not intend giving any figures in this respect, but it does seem to me that, <span class="col_8069-8070" refersTo="page_0369"/>as I already put it, the loan account during the current year is going to be over-endowed with cash. I can see therefore that this method of trying to regulate internal monetary conditions has now become a necessity. But the necessity for this step is also clear evidence that the case which the Minister tries to make for the continued application of exchange control has now virtually come to an end. The State is now assuming for itself the right to invest abroad whilst that right is denied to private enterprise and private capital. Now, I know the hon. the Minister will say that he wants to control the outflow of money and direct it for the specific purpose, as he says, of regulating internal monetary conditions. But here again he wants to do it by artificial and arbitrary methods instead of leaving it to private enterprise. Efforts of this nature usually also lead to administrative waste.</p>

<p>I started off by saying that the system of exchange control had now reached a stage where it was cent wise and rand foolish. If ever evidence was needed in this regard, it is to be found in the restrictions on travel allowances which the Minister imposed during the current Session by cutting down to R20 the amount which may be taken out of the country in Reserve Bank notes. In this connection I want to quote the following Press comment which appeared as recently as 11 June&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bankers and currency dealers abroad will not buy South African Reserve Bank notes because after 30 June the Reserve Bank will not accept notes repatriated from overseas &#x2026; The result has been that travellers at present overseas are finding that there is no market abroad for the South African notes.</block>

<p>Sir, surely this is not the best way to advertise South Africa. It shows that the need for this system of control has become trivial, if we can come down to a stage where a statement of this kind is made in the Press, i.e. that the banks will no longer accept our bank notes because the Reserve Bank will not accept notes repatriated from oveseas. But quite apart from the control aspect, it is a very seious statement to have been made in the Press and I hope that if this statement does not set the position out correctly, the Minister will make a statement saying precisely what the position is, because let me say again that it is a strange way of advertising South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I am quite prepared to follow up what was said by the hon. member but let me add that there are certain matters in connection with which there are some hon. members opposite, particularly the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes), who will not be able to follow up what I say. I am certain of that. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) complained about the lage number of commissions appointed and about the waste of money apparently involved in this regard. It is a strange thing to my mind that during this Session&#x2014;I do not think that my memory is playing me false in this connection&#x2014;repeated requests were made by hon. members opposite for the appointment of certain commissions. Less than a week ago the Opposition complained that no commission had been appointed to investigate the actions of the police in the Bultfontein case! Unless I am mistaken, the request was also forthcoming from hon. members opposite that a commission of inquiry be appointed to inquire into the Broederbond. I can also mention a number of other commissions which were asked for by hon. members opposite. But now this hon. member has told us that a great deal of money is wasted by the appointment of these commissions. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) would have said if he had been here this afternoon?</p>

<p>No, he would have said: &#x201C;Stupid official&#x201D; (dom amptenaar). The hon. member also said that the danger of inflation was increasing by the day. Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to discuss yesterday&#x2019;s debate because you have already prevented me from referring to a speech that was made yesterday. But we remember that yesterday, and today as well, one speaker after the other on the other side stood up and asked that the surplus should be shared out. They said that the argument of the hon. the Minister that this would encourage inflation did not hold water. When they made this suggestion they gave no thought to the danger of inflation. But the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) has told us here to-day that the danger of inflation is increasing by the day. To his way of thinking, even the fact that, in his opinion, too much has been voted to Loan Account, holds the danger of inflation. The hon. member for Cradock would also have made an interjection in this regard! The hon. member quoted a certain Mr. Herbert as saying that once the Government got its hands on this money, we would never see it again. Does the hon. member believe that? Does the hon. member believe that no benefit is obtained from capital payments? Does the hon. member believe that when the Government spends money, whether on pensions or the development of social services, no one ever sees that money again?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not find it too difficult to reply to the arguments of the hon. member. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories <span class="col_8071-8072" refersTo="page_0370"/>is now silent. I should have liked to have followed up the hon. member further in his arguments but he talked so much nonsense that it is not necessary for me to devote more time to him.</p>

<p>I want to come to what was said by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher). He told us at the start of his speech what the hon. the Minister of Lands had apparently said. Mr. Speaker, it was then that I became a trifle disturbed. We have had good leaders on the National Party side over the years, but as soon as our leaders have left politics, the United Party have appropriated those leaders and have then told the public that their policy is based on the policy of our retired leaders. They appropriated General Hertzog in this way. Later, when the late Mr. Strijdom was Prime Minister, they said that Dr. Malan was the right man. Now that Mr. Strijdom is no longer here they say that in many respects they are following the policy of the late Mr. Strijdom.</p>

Mr. Sauer became ill the other day; he has in the meantime become engaged and married and we are expecting him to retire as Minister. I predict that one of these days they will also appropriate him as being one of the people on whose policy their policy is based.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) told us in the first instance how the farmers&#x2019; debts with the Land Bank have increased and he then said that this great burden of debt of the farmers with the Land Bank proved how badly things were going with the farmers. If the hon. member had mentioned the indebtedness of the farmers to the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board or to State Advances, he could possibly have proved something. Is the hon. member aware of the fact that money which is advanced to the farmers by the Land Bank is advanced against very good security? Is the hon. member aware of the fact that the Land Bank only advances up to 80 per cent of that security on its own valuation? Is the hon. member aware of the fact that the farmers are now making far more use of the Land Bank for financing purposes than ever before? No, the hon. member has proved absolutely nothing. There are adequate funds available in the Land Bank to-day and the farmers are able to enjoy financing facilities there on a far sounder basis than they can enjoy those same facilities in the private sector or with commercial banks. Because the farmers make use of the facilities, the hon. member tries to suggest that this is a proof that the farmers are bankrupt.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>There are farmers who are in difficulty. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has already made his speech. I am dealing now with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West). If I have the opportunity at a later stage I shall do him the honour of addressing myself to him, although I do not think that one should do so on a Saturday afternoon. There is another proof which the hon. member tried to give us. He referred here to the White Paper issued by the hon. the Minister when he made his Budget statement. He referred us to page 2 and asked us whether we had noticed from this White Paper how badly things were going with the farmers; whether we had noticed that the White Paper stated that the farmers were not receiving their rightful share of the prosperity of the country. He said, moreover, that in 1951-2 agriculture&#x2019;s share of the national income was 13.6 per cent and that it had risen to 14.2 per cent in 1957. He said: &#x201C;Just imagine! It is now only 10.4 per cent.&#x201D; That was his argument. I want to ask him whether he has noticed that commerce&#x2019;s share of the national income in 1951 was 14.8 per cent; that it fell in 1956-7 to 13.6 per cent and that in 1963 it was 12.8 per cent? Therefore, we find the same falling tendency in this regard as is the case in connection with farming but has anyone ever said that things are going so badly with commerce that the Government should step in and subsidize commerce and start granting pensions? Is commerce just as bankrupt? The hon. member only quoted figures in connection with agriculture because he noticed that they showed a falling tendency. But I want to ask the hon. member whether he has noticed that during this period, in 1951-2, the gross national income was only about R4,000,000,000, while in 1957 it amounted to R5,000,000,000? And has he noticed <span class="col_8073-8074" refersTo="page_0371"/>that it now stands between R6,000,000,000 and R7,000,000,000? Or should I rather give him the actual total figures? Perhaps it is not even necessary to give them to him because he has all the figures before him. What is of importance is this: When the contribution of agriculture, forestry and fisheries to the gross national income was 13.6 per cent, this contribution amounted to only R352,000,000 but has he noticed that in 1963, when their contribution only formed 10.4 per cent of the national income, the figure was R568,000,000? Did the hon. member also notice that the income from factories was only R618,000,000 in 1951-2 and that in 1963 it was R 1,399,000,000? This supports the argument which I have advanced here previously&#x2014;that if our factories had not expanded to such a great extent, the percentage contribution of agriculture to our national income would have been far more favourable than he tries to make it out to be here. But, Mr. Speaker, it does not help to explain all those things to those hon. members because they are not interested. They are trying to win the votes of a small number of farmers who find themselves in difficulty, mainly as a result of climatic conditions. They are trying to make political capital out of the difficulties of those farmers. Hon. members are trying to step into the breach for those farmers. Who are the members who have made a plea for the farmers here? Do they represent rural constituencies? No, the hon. members who have made speeches here in support of the famers are members like the hon. members for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) and Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Connan).</p>

<p>Yes, they were chased away because of their past record. Sir, the memories of the voters are not that short. The voters have not forgotten their record. They still remember very well the prices they obtained for their products when the United Party was in Government. They still well remember that slaughter stock were commandeered and that when we wanted to sell our stock on the open market one of their officials approached us, clad in a varigated coat, and simply told us: &#x201C;We are taking your stock to the controlled market&#x201D;. The farmers well remember the price basis that was fixed by the United Party Government at the time. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Orange Grove has no idea of what a tractor cost at that time. I wonder whether he knows that one could not obtain a tractor in those days. No, hon. members of the Opposition think that the memories of the voters are just as short as theirs are.</p>

<p>I think that I have devoted sufficient time to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West). I want now to come to the hon. member for Yeoville who spoke this morning. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told the hon. the Minister of Justice the other day that he could see by the expression on his face that he was amused when the Bultfontein case was being discussed here. Now, I cannot claim to be able to read people&#x2019;s thoughts by their expressions but, Mr. Speaker, if you had looked at the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this morning you would have seen a rather anxious expression on his face when the hon. member for Yeoville started discussing agricultural matters. I have never seen anyone act as recklessly as the hon. member for Yeoville did this morning. One sympathizes with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Over the years that I have been a member of this House I have noticed that originally he himself dealt with agricultural matters. Of course, he could not continue to do so and he then appointed the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) to handle agricultural matters. He also got the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) to handle agricultural matters for him occasionally. Then the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) became a member of this House and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition pinned his hopes on him. The hon. member for East London (City) was also the main speaker on the other side on agricultural matters on one occasion but after that they never ever gave him the opportunity of handling this subject again. Since that time the hon. member for Gardens has handled agricultural matters. What have we had from him? Every now and again, the hon. member moves a motion which is diametrically opposed to the interests of co-operatives, and the cooperatives still feel hurt in this regard.</p>

<p>It is not as shameful as it is ridiculous and stupid. Because sufficient money is made available by the Land Bank to assist the farmers and because they lend this money to farmers at a very low rate of interest, it is said that we enable the farmers to incur heavy debts and that we then sell them out. Strangely enough, shortly after the hon. member said this, the hon. member for East London (City) stood up and gave us an analysis of the rates of interest of the Land Bank. He then came to the conclusion that these rates of interest were far too high. The hon. member then said that if they came into power&#x2014;and heaven help us if this ever happens&#x2014;they will embark upon a bold and imaginative policy for the farmers. When the hon. member said this, I pricked up my ears because I am very interested in a policy which will be acceptable to the farmers. He said that they would follow this important policy for the sake of the farmers. He then said that they would pay a pension to farmers having less than a certain income. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) can apparently not even remember his own speech, so how in heaven&#x2019;s name can he remember anybody else&#x2019;s? I want him to remain quiet. He then added that this would be the bold and imaginative policy of the United Party for the farmers.</p>

He should have reacted then, but he did not. He now wants to argue with me because I ascribe this policy to them. Let me ask them now how many farmers they think they will be able to persuade to vote for them because they are going to pay farmers a pension? How ridiculous! But we must tell this story to the taxpayer because this money will not fall like manna from heaven. We are already hearing so much about the poor and unfortunate taxpayers but these poor and unfortunate taxpayers will certainly have a burden to carry when this United Party comes into power! They may succeed in getting a farmer or two to vote for them in recognition for the pensions to be paid to certain farmers, but because of all the promises that they have already made there will be nothing left of the great surplus which the Government has built up. There will be nothing left after they have fulfilled all those promises and before they have paid farmers their pensions. No, Mr. Speaker, I think that the taxpayer will keep a long way from them! The hon. member told us that only 78,000 broiler chickens were produced in France over the years but that with the encouragement of the Government this production had been increased to 24,000,000 broilers. Yes, we may also be able to produce 24,000,000 broilers in South Africa but I should very much like to know who is going to eat them! No. I am sure that the United Party will not impress the voters by means of broilers and pensions for the farmers.</p>

<p>There is only one further remark made by hon. members opposite this morning to which I want to reply. It was stated that it was the policy of this Government to drive the farmers from their farms. It was contended that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs had apparently said that 2,400 farmers had to leave their farms annually. In association with this there is the misrepresentation that it is apparently the policy of this Government for the small-scale farmers to disappear. Hon. members know that when they make statements of this nature they only make them for political gain and for no other purpose. What this side of the House has said is that uneconomic units must be done away with. But we all hold this view. On the other hand, hon. members opposite want to retain uneconomic units and then pay pensions to those farmers! But we do not want to pay pensions. We want to help the farmer, if his unit can be farmed economically, by means of extension services, by assuring him of a reasonable price level and by assisting him to produce the correct product&#x2014;to make his unit economic. If, on the other hand, his unit is so uneconomic that no matter what methods are used to make that unit economic it is not possible to do so, it is possible for us in terms of the Land Settlement Amendment Act which we passed here recently as well as through the medium of other measures and large irrigation schemes to make the position of that man economic so that he can make a reasonable living. At the same time we will ensure that we do not waste valuable labour forces by keeping a man on an uneconomic unit when his services can be utilized for economic production.</p>

<p>This Government has an agricultural policy which means a great deal to the farmer. Unfortunately, our farmers have to contend with climatic conditions. It is admitted that our country has a hard climate. Unfortunately, many parts of our country are at the moment experiencing a drought. It is also a fact that there are many farmers whose properties are not large enough for the farming operations they are practising&#x2014;like a cattle farmer who tries to make a living on a thousand morgen. But it is the policy of this Government to ensure by way of irrigation schemes that sufficient fodder is produced and also to assist farmers to build up their own fodder banks. It is also the policy of this Government to ensure that farmers have sufficient land on which to produce. The farmers are grateful in this regard. The farmers want to retain their feeling of freedom and for that reason they will certainly not allow a United Party to pay pensions to them. The farming population of South Africa will feel very insulted indeed if they have to approach the Government for a pension.</p>

<from><span class="col_8077-8078" refersTo="page_0373"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) has tried to show that the points made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) in regard to the proposition of the share the farmers have in the economy of this country, were not correct. We accept, of course, that industry has advanced faster than the other sectors, but despite that the other sectors have reaped more benefits than agriculture has. Agriculture has been the worse off of the whole lot. It has been stated that the United Party has lost contact with the farmers. But there is no such thing, because members on this side who are farmers are in very close touch with the farming community of this country. We are in just as close a contact with the farmers as members on the opposite side are. But we at least represent their interests and see what can be done for them. The question of pensions for farmers was not the point which was made by the hon. member for Yeoville. This Government is always telling us that agriculture in other countries is also experiencing difficult times. What the hon. member for Yeoville did was to show how those countries are coming to the aid of the farming community, <i>inter alia,</i> by assisting the small farmer who is struggling to make an existence.</p>

<p>In connection with the question of the elimination of uneconomic units, I think he (the Minister) actually did say that the small farmer must go. But we shall not argue that point. Let us accept then that the Minister said that all farmers who had uneconomic units must go. The extraordinary position is that what is to-day an uneconomic unit was not such in 1948 and prior to that, i.e., under the United Party. But these units have become uneconomic on account of the policies of the Nationalist Party. The net income of farmers has become less and less. That is why units which previously were economic have now become uneconomic. And that is why these have got to go. In our time, I want to repeat, these units were not uneconomic.</p>

<p>In the past we, on many occasions, dew the attention of the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services to soil erosion in this country. Only recently we pointed again to the destruction that was taking place and that it was on the increase. As a matter of fact, the destruction of our soil through soil erosion is taking place at a faster rate than is reclamation. We find that at a congress of the South Western Districts Agricultural Union. Dr. Du Plessis, the Chief Director of Agricultural Scientific Research said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sowat 85 persent van die weiveld van Suid-Afrika word deur gifplante en ander onbruikbare bosse bedreig &#x2026; Ek is be-kommerd oor ons weiveld. Daar is iets met ons benuttingspatroon verkeerd wat nie by die natuur pas nie. Dit is die natuur se manier om terug te slaan. Sowat 5,000,000 morge grond in die Kalahari word deur swarthaak ingeneem.</block>

<p>Here again there is proof that the Government is not taking the necessary steps to preserve our country for the future. Because of the ineptitude of the hon. the Minister in this matter, we have to appeal to the Government direct for steps in this connection. Last year we called for the resignation of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services because we felt he was incompetent to discharge his functions properly. We feel that this Government has this problem not sufficiently at heart, and there has been no signs here of &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D; of which we hear so often.</p>

<p>But this hon. Minister is not the only one who is to blame for the slow rate of reclamation of our soil. The Minister for Agricultural Economics and Marketing also is to blame for that and that because of the low prices fixed by him for the farmers&#x2019; products. Consequently farmers are compelled to take more out of the soil than what they can possible put back. In this connection I want to refer to the latest report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. On page 1, the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The high yields obtained as a result of the use of hybrid seed, heavy fertilizer applications, effective weed and insect control, more thorough cultivation of the soil and other improved techniques frequently disguise the accelerating process of soil depletion and create a false sense of security with respect to the fertility of our arable soils. The erosion occurring on many maize lands in the early summer as a result of heavy thunder showers is resulting in extensive and alarming soil losses. This loss of soil, which is irreplaceable will in the long run seriously affect the production potential of our cropfarming regions and it is in the national interest that this erosion should be checked.</block>

<p>I blame the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing for paying such low prices to farmers that they are compelled to apply methods damaging to the soil.</p>

<p>We have shown how the position of the farmers have deteriorated in this country. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) quoted figures in this connection of monetary aid given by the Land Bank and to show that the arrears in respect of interest and capital payments are on the increase. I do not want to go over this again. There is, however, another figure I wish to mention and that is in respect of seasonal loans made last year. In 1963-4 seasonal loans in respect of mealies amounted to R 122,000,000. In other words, farmers had to borrow money on the crops which they still had to reap to the tune of something like R2 per bag.</p>

<p>The fact that farmers are leaving their farms more and more has been stated over and over again. Let me in this connection quote what Mr. Fick, the chairman of the South Western Districts Agricultural Union said quite recently&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8079-8080" refersTo="page_0374"/>Die landboubedryf is nou baie meer kwesbaar vir ekonomiese en natuurterugslae as voorheen. Die totale landbouproduksie van 1947 tot 1963 het met 72 persent gestyg, terwyl die aantal blankes op plase met 18 persent afgeneem het.</block>

<p>This shows that these people are going backwards all the time. We have more bankruptcies, the Land Bank loans are higher and it was mentioned that in the South Western Districts 60 per cent of the farmers have a nett-income of less than R 1,200 per annum. This is what Mr. Fick said in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Byna 60 persent van alle boere in die distrik Calitzdorp het &#x2019;n jaarlikse inkomste van minder as R 1,200.</block>

<p>This shows that if 60 per cent of the farmers earn less than R 1,200, i.e. R100 per month, the position they find themselves in is bad. Costs of production are rising steadily. I have here the cost of production for wheat comparing the years 1948 and 1963. Grain bags have risen in price from 20c to 341c; Binding twine from R5.76 to R 10.55; petrol from R7.32 to R13.20; batteries from R11.50 to R18.90; tractor tyres from R66.28 to R107.53; Caterpillar tractors from R3,070 to R8,764; etc. On an average this increase has been 154 per cent, in comparison with the rise in the price of wheat during that period from R4.22 to R5.47, i.e. 30 per cent. I am of course quite prepared to admit that the figure of 154 per cent would be lower if all items were included but the fact remains that the cost of the items I have specified above increased (labour by 183 per cent) and that the farmers&#x2019; administrative costs are to-day three to four times as high as the increase in prices. Let us look at the Department&#x2019;s own figures. According to these the price of wheat increased from 220c to 300c, i.e. an increase of 37 per cent, over a period of 15 years. At the same time the increase in costs rose from 312c to 453c, i.e. nearly 50 per cent. This means that the increase in the cost of production has been far more rapid than the increase in the price of the product. Let us also look at dairy prices. According to the Department the price of fresh milk increased by 15 per cent over the period 1952 to 1964, that of butter fat by 25 per cent, of cheese milk 13 per cent and condensed milk 12 per cent. In comparison with these increases the increase in the cost of production of these items has been out of all proportion. As a result dairy farmers have in many instances gone out of production. We find that large and established herds have had to be sold because they could not be fed as they should have been. As a matter of fact, the dairy farmer is to-day in a shocking position. Production has decreased, partly to drought but mainly on account of the economic position in which the dairy farmer finds himself, with the result that we have now to import something like 10,000,000 lbs. of butter.</p>

<p>Industrial production is protected. Any industrial undertaking gets a good return on its investments. It is being protected by tariffs. To that we have no objection. But as regards the farmer, the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing recently said in the Other Place that the capital return the farmers received was less than 3 per cent.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister gave that figure in the Other Place. This figure is actually under 3 per cent. So we can go on to show that the position of the farmer is very much worse than that of any other community. We believe that the Government does not work out the production costs of the farmer correctly. Capital investments should be on the basis of present market values. A fair value must be placed on the farmer&#x2019;s land. Those farmers who are reasonable efficient should be taken into consideration. We do not expect the Minister to take into account the production costs of an inefficient farmer. We expect him to take into account the farmer who employs his capital efficiently.</p>

<p>My point is that in calculating the costs of production of the farmer, these factors should be considered. A fair value should be put on the farmer&#x2019;s land in the first instance. Secondly, the production potential of the reasonably efficient farmer should be taken as a basis. These factors should be taken account of and the farmer must be given a fair return. [Interjections.] The Wheat Board places too low a value on the farmer&#x2019;s property. It does not take a fair value. [Interjections.] The Government is running away from the principles of the Marketing Act and is not giving the farmer a fair return on his venture.</p>

<p>When we adjourned on Saturday, I made the point that this Government was not applying the Marketing Act in the spirit in which it was intended to be done. I quoted some figures which we got from the Department with regard to the production costs of certain commodities and the selling prices, to show how it varied over a certain period. In regard to production costs, the Department states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Vergelykende produksiekoste: Gegewens slegs beskikbaar vir koring, wat trouens ook al produk is waar die prys wat aan die boer betaal word tans nog vasgestel word met gemiddelde produksiekoste as uitgangspunt.</block>

<p>From that I deduce that in the fixing of prices for the different commodities, it is only in the case of wheat that the terms of the Marketing Act are applied, and in regard to the other commodities no notice is taken of that and an arbitrary price is fixed which I presume they do, especially in the case of products like maize, by determining what the export will be and what the loss will be on it, and on that they determine the price to the farmer, and they have got away from the principle of the Marketing Act that the producer&#x2019;s price should be fixed on the basis of his production costs.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>From what the Department says, it would appear that I am correct. The Minister does not appear to be a strong supporter of one-channel marketing at all, and I again want to refer to the marketing of onions. The scheme was introduced some four years ago for one-channel marketing, but it was a half-baked scheme, which only applied to a portion of the producers, with the result that it could never work, and that was the reason why it failed, and not because the United Party organizer, as we were told, went around among the &#x2019; onion producers and agitated among them for the abandonment of the scheme. I spoke to him, and he said he had never agitated and had nothing to do with the matter. If, on the other hand, it is right that he had so much influence in getting the onion producers to go against the scheme, he must be very influential, and in that case I think we wifi put him up as a candidate in the False Bay constituency at the next general election.</p>

<p>What are we going to have in the place of the old scheme? Must the onion growers continue day after day producing onions at completely uneconomic prices? The Minister replied the other day, and from his reply it would appear that he is not over keen on ever having another scheme, because this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<p>Hulle moet onthou dat as die skema ooit weer ingestel word, sal hy daar bly, en hy sal alleenlik ingestel word as ek oortuig daarvan is dat ten minste 90 persent van die boere in daardie produksie-area daardie skema wil he.</p>

<p>I think it is a shocking state of affairs, to say that the onion growers are not finding things difficult enough yet, that they are not suffering enough. They already find it extremly difficult to make ends meet, and the Minister is not prepared to help them until such time as they suffer much more. Sir, it is peculiar that whenever we have, a Nationalist Government, the farmers are in trouble. At the end of the previous Nationalist regime in 1933, the farmers were on the brink of destruction. They passed through the most difficult time that this country had ever had, due partly to general economic conditions, to the depression, but largely on account of the fact that the Nationalist Government stuck to the gold standard policy which almost completely ruined the farmers in this country. This Nationalist Government is again reducing the farmers to a similar state. Whenever we have a Nationalist Government, the farmer finds himself in extreme difficulties. Therefore, I say that we are completely correct in saying in our amendment that this Government is unfit and incompetent to govern the country, and especially the two Ministers of Agriculture.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) is not here at the moment. When he spoke on Saturday he made an oblique reference to the Rivonia case and said a number of things which deserve to be discussed, I think. He made four submissions. He referred to those people who were described by the Public Prosecutor as persons who had pre-eminently committed high treason as &#x201C;political offenders&#x201D;. He referred to them as political offenders and said the policy of the Government was &#x201C;fundamentally unjust&#x201D;, that there was no way in which to give political expression, that the Minister of Justice could only maintain order in one way and that was to put more and more people in gaol. Sir, when you consider everything the hon. member has said it actually amounts to two basic submissions. He exculpates those people he calls &#x201C;political offenders&#x201D;; he exculpates those people who were found guilty and in the same breath he lays the charge at the door of the Government that its policy is responsible for the fact that those people have committed the offences which he calls &#x201C;political offences&#x201D;. In the second place the hon. member suggests that the United Party has a policy which will satisfy these people and that that will prevent them from committing the offences of which they have been found guilty. I think that is the conclusion one is forced to come to. I now wish to ask the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) this: Is the policy of the United Party of such a nature that it will satisfy these people who have been found guilty to such an extent that they will not commit these offences? Is it true that the United Party has a policy which is of such a nature that it will prevent these people from committing the offences they have committed?</p>

<p>I think we can easily put that to the test. Albert Luthuli is the leader of the A.N.C. and in terms of the judgment of the Judge in the Rivonia case the A.N.C. has launched the movement known as Umkonto we Sizwe with the full knowledge of Luthuli and after he was consulted. I just want to read to the hon. member what Luthuli said in 1960 when he gave evidence in the treason case&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Albert Luthuli said at the treason trial to-day that a return to the system of parliamentary representation of the Natives by a limited number of Whites would be a waste of time &#x2026; White politicians, for example, advocated a return to the legislation of 1936.<span class="col_8085-8086" refersTo="page_0377"/>which would entail the representation of Africans in Parliament by a limited number of Whites. &#x201C;In my view, this does not meet the situation. Small concessions do not in fact take you anywhere. It would be a waste of time.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was said by the leader of A.N.C. who is still the leader with reference to the policy of the United Party. I want to know from the hon. member for Germiston (District) what the United Party&#x2019;s party contains which entitles the hon. member for Yeoville to claim that the United Party has a policy which will prevent these people from committing the offences of which they were found guilty in the Rivonia case?</p>

<p>Another question is coupled to that. If what the hon. member for Yeoville says is true namely that the system in South Africa is &#x201C;a fundamentally unjust&#x201D; system and that that is the reason why these offences are being committed, I want to know this from the hon. member for Germiston (District): If the United Party comes into power will Oliver Tambo, Resha, Matthews, Kotane who are to-day in London and who gave evidence before the apartheid committee of UNO return to South Africa and sit here quietly and be satisfied with the policy of the United Party? They are members of the A.N.C. which is the body which is responsible for this unrest in South Africa and which wanted to start a revolution. I do not want to blame the hon. member for Germiston (District) for all the sins of the hon. member for Yeoville but when a responsible front-bencher says these people only acted the way they did because our policy is fundamentally unjust and implies that the policy of the United Party will prevent that, somebody must tell us on the strength of what that claim is made. Othewise we can only come to one conclusion and that is that once again, as has often happened in the past, the United Party is only associating themselves with the propagandists outside. Because I cannot imagine that he intends these things for the ears of South Africa seeing that everybody in South Africa knows that the policy of the United Party does not satisfy the demands of those people. Surely we know what we are dealing with. This is not only a case of &#x201C;political offences&#x201D;, a case of people acting simply because they are against the policy of the Government. It has long since been clear that that is not the case. Why should the charge so often be laid at the door of the Government in this irresponsible manner that it is because of its policy that these people act the way they do? Why should we tolerate that in South Africa when the true facts contradict that? Surely we know what the Judge said in his judgement in the treason trial in regard to Communist influence in the A.N.C. Surely we know the court found that the A.N.C. stood for a Communist State in South Africa. The people concerned in the Rivonia trial were surely not all non-Whites; surely a number of Whites were also concerned. It is really so obvious that these things have to be accepted that one is all the more surprised that the United Party is continually losing sight of them and trying to accuse us and telling us that this is a spontaneous protest against the policy of the Government. I want to read to the hon. member what appeared in a Communist paper published in France as recently as last year. This quotation is from a Communist paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Communist Party in South Africa is the faithful ally of the A.N.C., the Indian Congress, the Coloured People&#x2019;s Organization, the Congress of Democrats and the Trade Union Congress subscribe to the aims of those organizations unconditionally.<br/>Together with these organizations the Communist Party aims at overthrowing the Government &#x2026;</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am quoting from <i>Dagbreek</i> of December last year, and <i>Dagbreek</i>in turn is quoting from the French paper <i>La Novelle.</i> Mr. Speaker, a few years ago an American, Mr. Stevens, of the U.S. News and World Report, a very prominent American weekly, come to South Africa. Mr. Stevens was here in 1960 and he said the following to <i>Die Vaderland-.</i> &#x201C;You must be careful of incitement amongst the masses of Natives you have in this country; it was only necessary for me to attend the treason trial for two days in Pretoria to realize that Communism was the only driving force behind the dissatisfaction on the part of the Natives.&#x201D; It is not we who are saying that; it was said by Mr. Stevens who came to Africa to study the position here and a person who can speak with authority on such phenomena. I want to put this question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes): Will the policy of the United Party satisfy people like that? Is the United Party fair when it makes that claim? Can they satisfy them? Are they pretending to South Africa and the world outside that they can satisfy those people? No, they pretend to have a policy which will satisfy those people just to be able to lay the charge at the door of the Government that its policy is fundamentally unjust. That is the only reason why they pretend they can satisfy those people, because they know those people reject the policy of the United Party. Mr. Speaker. I am glad the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is present. He will remember that he stated in South West, for example, that as a result of Bantu Amendment Act the position of the Bantu workers in South Africa was as bad as that of the Russian workers in Russia under the Stalin regime. He said that it was only the workers under the Stalin regime who would be able to appreciate how bad the position of of the workers in South Africa was. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether he still stands by that statement?</p>

<from><span class="col_8087-8088" refersTo="page_0378"/><person refersTo="hansard_za">*HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>Answer! It is a very reasonable question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>He was so kind the other day as to tell us that South Africa was not a police state. Did he think he was doing South Africa a favour when he said, as he did on that occasion at Windhoek, that the position of the workers in South Africa was as bad as that of the workers in Russia under the Stalin regime? Sir, that is the sort of statement that is made, statements which cannot be accounted for whatsoever but which are made for one specific purpose only and that is to imply that the policy of the United Party is different from that of the Government and that their policy will enable them to bring about peace and happiness and prosperity in South Africa, a state of affairs which will prevent any rebelliousness. Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not reply. I shall ask him another question. When I say the policy of the United Party will not satisfy these people I base that statement on what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said. I should be pleased if he would listen for a moment. I wish to quote what he said on 10 April 1962 according to a report which appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i>of a speech he made at the Cape Town University. On that occasion he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was a simple answer to the question why he equated White survival in South Africa with White domination, Sir de Villiers Graaff, Leader of the Opposition, said at a lunch-hour forum at the University of Cape Town this afternoon.</block>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition says it is very simple to equate White survival in South Africa with White domination. In answer to a question he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If my friend can point out to me one emergent African State which has had freedom for more than five years in which Western democracy has been maintained, I am prepared to admit I am wrong.</block>

<p>As the hon. the Prime Minister has so often stated in debates in this House, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition clearly stated here that the essence of United Party policy was White domination. I do not think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has ever repudiated this report. I do not think he has ever denied what is contained in this statement. If we accept that the essence of United Party policy is White domination I put this question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: By virtue of what fact is it stated or is the impression created in the world outside that the United Party has a policy which will satisfy people like those who were found guilty at the Rivonia trial? If the United Party know that they cannot make that claim, by virtue of what fact do they accuse this Government of having a policy which is fundamentally unjust and imply that this policy forces people to commit treason? By virtue of what fact does he say that? I maintain that the United Party cannot make such a claim in South Africa because they know that if they held out such a policy to those people they must be prepared to say that they are relinquishing their authority in the Government of South Africa and that they are abandoning the idea of the continued existence of the White man in South Africa. However, it often happens that the United Party blow both hot and cold; that they pretend in the one breath that they will satisfy these people and in the next breath that they will safeguard the future of the Whites in South Africa and maintain the authority of the State. We have also had the case of Nusas. According to the reports of Jonty Driver&#x2019;s speech Nusas associates itself with the aims of the A.N.C. Nusas accepts communists as members like the A.N.C. does. Nusas says it is not opposed to Communism; it is only &#x201C;non-commuriistic&#x201D; like the A.N.C. says it is &#x201C;neutral&#x201D;, that it is &#x201C;non-aligned&#x201D;. The A.N.C. is part of the Liberation Movement; Nusas says it is also part of the Liberation Movement. I can quote to the hon. member from the Botha Hill document if he wants me to do so. As far as the Liberation Movement is concerned, I just want to mention something &#x2026;</p>

<p>While I am on the subject of the Liberation Movement which is such an acceptable idea to-day within the ranks of Nusas and the Liberal Party and the A.N.C., I just want to quote to the hon. member what Edward Roux, a listed communist, says in his book about S. P. Bunting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Soviet, through the Comintern was trying to hamstring the British Empire by organizing liberation movements in the British colonies, of which South Africa was one.</block>

<p>The Liberation Movement we have in South Africa to-day has its origin in the Soviet, that movement with whose aims Nusas so boldly associates itself and then says: &#x201C;We are not anti-communistic; as a matter of fact we dare not express ourselves against Communism in the world otherwise there would be serious repercussions&#x201D; as the hon. the Minister of Justice has revealed. I say Nusas and the A.N.C. have precisely the same aims and adopt the same attitude as far as both Communism and the Liberation Movement are concerned. Both also advocate revolution and both are in favour of violent revolution, as I indicated the other <span class="col_8089-8090" refersTo="page_0379"/>evening when I read a quotation. Sir, I do not want to read to you what was revealed at the Rivonia trial as far as the A.N.C. is concerned but, for the edification of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), I just once again wish to read what Mr. Jonty Driver has said about &#x201C;revolution&#x201D;. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The term is used to refer to change, political, social or economic, coming about in South Africa; it is not used only to refer to violent (i.e. armed) revolution.</block>

<p>When he talks about revolution&#x2014;and he does so often in this document&#x2014;he means in the first place &#x201C;armed revolution&#x201D;, but not only &#x201C;armed revolution&#x201D;; he at least includes the other meaning as well.</p>

<p>No, but seeing that the hon. member has referred to that I just wish to show him how far Mr. Driver has already led Nusas. This is a statement which only emanates from him. He spoke in Durban in May and said the following according to the <i>Sunday Times&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Speaking to students in Durban early this week, Mr. Driver called on members of Nusas who believed in the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy to resign.</block>

<p>Those are the people he wants out of Nusas; there is no room in Nusas for people who believe in the policy of this party, but there is room for the communists; they are protected; the members of Nusas are instructed not to express themselves against Communism.</p>

<p>I withdraw it, Sir. I say Nusas and the A.N.C. are in complete agreement with each other in regard to Communism, the Liberation Movement and revolution in South Africa. But there are other things too on which they agree. We know Mr. Driver places great emphasis in this document of his on the fact that Nusas is &#x201C;non-racial&#x201D; and on the fact that during the past few years the leadership of Nusas has changed from Cape Town and Wits to Fort Hare. I am not saying it will change over. Here are his words on page 4&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, during the last five years there has been a change in this power-centre, since UN. NE.P and Fort Hare could now be called the real leaders of Nusas policy; it is they who provide the leadership in policydevelopment.</block>

<p>(&#x201C;UN. NE.P&#x201D; refer to the non-White section of the Natal University.) This is what Mr. Driver says &#x201C;during the last five years&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Yes, he is the leader; he knows what is happening. Is the hon. member for Durba (Point) suggesting that he knows better than Mr. Jonty Driver what is happening in Nusas? There is something else I should like to quote to the hon. member because he says there is a difference between Nusas and Driver. I shall read the whole paragraph to the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must move towards a new definition of non-racialism. There are two attitudes towards non-racialism; one is the attitude which says &#x201C;we must disregard a man&#x2019;s race and judge him on merit&#x201D;. The other is the attitude which says, &#x201C;The ideal situation is where one can disregard a man&#x2019;s race and judge him on merit alone&#x201D;. However, in the situation of this country everything is determined by race and those who are most oppressed must therefore lead the liberation movement.</block>

<p>Then Mr. Driver says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The attitude in Nusas has always been the former.&#x201D;</block>

<p><span class="col_8091-8092" refersTo="page_0380"/>In other words, &#x201C;we must disregard a man&#x2019;s race and judge him on merit&#x201D;. What does the hon. member for Durban (Point) say to that? The hon. member for Yeoville referred to Nusas the other day and the only good thing he could say about it was that it was such a &#x201C;fine and noble&#x201D; institution. Why? Because the hon. member for Yeoville said, it was multiracial; because it was one of the few institutions in South Africa which was still multiracial. The hon. member preferred to call it multi-racial. Nusas itself says that over the past number of years it has only adopted one attitude and that is that a man should be judged on merit irrespective of his race, and that is the policy of the Progressive Party and the policy of the Liberal Party; and in criticizing Nusas the United Party says that the great merit of Nusas lies in the fact that its policy is one of &#x201C;non-racialism&#x201D;. Because there is no &#x201C;multi-racialism&#x201D; in Nusas. Or is there? Does the hon. member for Durban (Point) again know better than Mr. Driver? I wish to say this to the hon. member for Durban (Point): I am quite happy to rely on Mr. Jonty Driver for my knowledge of Nusas and my evidence on Nusas. Just as I accept that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition can speak most authoritatively on the attitude of that side of the House because he is informed, I take it that Mr. Jonty Driver can speak most authoritatively on Nusas. I am quite happy to rely on him without any further knowledge of the matter. But if the hon. member for Durban (Point) rejects his evidence as president of Nusas I want to know on what grounds he does so. Does he know better than Mr. Driver? I repeat that in essence the A.N.C. and Nusas have the same aims in respect of this question of &#x201C;non-racialism&#x201D;; they have the same values; they accept the same basic axioms and principles; they harbour the same sentiments, as is also reflected in the election of Luthuli as their honorary president. Luthuli, the president of the A.N.C., is the honorary president of Nusas. Let me just read to the hon. member for Durban (Point) what resolution Nusas passed when they re-elected him as their honorary president on the last occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in view of the outstanding service which captain Luthuli has rendered to South Africa in the form of statesmanship and selfsacrifice, and in view of the fact that he symbolizes every ideal this society stands for in its belief in a non-racial South Africa, Captain Luthuli be re-elected as its honorary president.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is not Driver talking here; I am reading to the hon. member for Durban (Point) the resolution passed by Nusas at their congress, a resolution in which Nusas says that Luthuli is the embodiment of all the ideals Nusas strives for. What does the hon. member for Point say about that? I want to know from the hon. member for Durban (Point) why the United Party remains quiet about these things in this House? The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) flies to Durban to address the students, but the United Party remains silent about the revolutionary aims of Nusas; they remain silent on the fact that it associates itself with Communism; they remain silent on the fact that it represents itself as a non-racial society which aims at a non-racial South Africa. They elect Luthuli as their honorary president and say that Luthuli symbolizes every ideal of theirs. Why does the United Party remain silent on that?</p>

That is why I am positive I can accept that the United Party supports it because what else can a sensible person accept?

He does not want Nusas to disappear, unlike the hon. member for Innesdale. If the Minister of Justice wanted Nusas to disappear, why does he not ban them? Why did he make this appeal? He went further. The Minister of Justice said that he would be honoured to accept the presidentship of the conservative organization and he said that he could not see why the Leader of the Opposition had not accepted the presidentship of Nusas. He thought that the Leader of the Opposition had been invited to accept the presidentship and he was admonishing the Leader of the Opposition.

The hon. member for Innesdale should not take exception to the fact that the hon. member for Yeoville raises this question because the fundamental difference between the two parties is simply that the policy of the United Party is that every section of the population should have some representation in the Central Government, some way of expressing its political views, and the policy of the Nationalist Government is to deny them those political rights. The Bantu have no political rights except in the Transkei, and the majority of them do not accept that.

<p>I am not interested in what Luthuli says. The hon. member for Innesdale keeps on quoting Luthuli and organizations which support the Communist Party. Sir, we have made it quite clear in setting forth our race federation policy that we do not attempt to satisfy the communists; we do not hope to satisfy the communists, but what worries us is this, that under the policy of this Government, with all the apartheid legislation and the minor apartheid legislation that it passes and with all the pin-pricks caused by the Government&#x2019;s policy, the Coloureds and the Bantu and the Indians are left with the impression that the only people who can help them are the communists. That is what worries us. We are worried that they may be driven into the hands of the communists. Sir, we have always said&#x2014;and as one who lives in the Transkei I know that this is correct&#x2014;that the African is not a communist. He believes in a communal form of life but he is not a communist. A few of the leaders may be communists but the ordinary African is not a communist. Sir, why are we having trouble in this country? We are enjoying a boom. We are not the only country enjoying a boom, as the S.A.B.C. and Government speakers would like the public to believe. Practically every country in the world is enjoying a boom. I think Australia is enjoying an even bigger boom than we are. We are enjoying a boom but what is troubling us; why are we not all happy under these boom conditions? It is simply the fact that we are faced with the difficult problem of finding a way for our different race groups to live in amity in this country. The country does not close its eyes to the fact, as the Prime Minister tries to do, that we are a multi-racial state. What <span class="col_8095-8096" refersTo="page_0382"/>worries this country is the fact that we with all our wealth and all our minerals are faced with the problem of how we can solve our race problems. Sir, the Government has brought forth the policy of apartheid as the solution. The Prime Minister and Chief Matanzima prefer to call it a policy of separate development. Sir, that policy offers the impracticable ideal of complete separation. Dr; Malan once referred to &#x201C;algehele territoriale apartheid&#x201D; as an ideal, but he said that it was only an ideal, just as it is everybody&#x2019;s ideal to go to heaven, although we know that we may not get there.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Oh yes, but the Republic was a practical ideal. (Laughter.) Are hon. members opposite suggesting that it was not a practical ideal? I know the Prime Minister still believes, or he tells the country he still believes at any rate, that this ideal of complete separation is practical. He admits that the position in regard to integration is getting worse and worse at the moment and he says by the year 1978 the Bantu will start leaving the White areas. Even the Prime Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who is not here at the moment unfortunately, must admit that no matter how energetic the Government is in establishing the reserves we will always have at least 6,000,000 Bantu in the so-called White areas. How can the Prime Minister pretend that the policy of complete separation is a practical ideal? The policy of Bantustans and complete separation does not only mean the establishment of African states in this country it also involves the political and other rights of the Coloureds and the Indians; it affects all the race groups in the country. When we discuss the Bantustan policy we must not only discuss it as appertaining to the Bantu; we have to discuss it as it appertains to the Coloureds and the Indians as well. I am not going to talk about the inconsistencies in the statements made by the Prime Minister as far as the Coloured people are concerned or the Indians. I want to deal mainly with the Bantu to-day.</p>

<p>The impression has been given by the Prime Minister and the Nationalist Government, not only to people in this country but to people abroad, particularly to the White people in the north, that this Government stands for the protection of White interests. Particularly the people in the north have come to believe that this Prime Minister is the only man in the world who is prepared to protect the White man. Why this country must be led to believe that the Nationalist Party Government is the only Government which can act powerfully in a time of crisis. I do not know. The hon. member for Innesdale wanted to know whether the United Party would submit to the actions of Mandela and those people who were tried at the Rivonia trial recently. I want to remind hon. members opposite that neither the United Party nor the old South African Party were ever weak in a time of crisis. There is no justification for any member on that side pretending to the public that the United Party will not use force to repel force or that the United Party will not maintain law and order. I want to remind them what one of their Leaders, Dr. Malan, once said; he accused General Smuts of being too strong in exercising force. I say there is no justification for members of this Government to make the people believe that the United Party will not maintain law and order.</p>

<p>As far as the White people are concerned a false impression has been given abroad that the Prime Minister is a man of granite who will protect the White people. The first step he took in carrying out the practical side of his policy of Bantustans was to establish self-government in the Transkei. And there the Prime Minister was faced with the same problems as those which confronted Britain and other metropolitan powers in Africa. One of the problems which faced the British Government was what to do with the White people in Kenya. I said the other day that the Prime Minister had done a Kenya on the White people in the Transkei. The Commissioner-General in Umtata said that was balderdash because there were two important differences according to him. The one difference, he said, was that the White people in Kenya could not influence an election in Britain and sceondly, that no White man would be forced out of the Transkei. As far as influencing an election is concerned, the Transkei has always voted against the Government and will continue to do so. The Transkei has done its best to bring about a change in Government but so far it has failed. As far as the White people not having to leave the Transkei is concerned, the White people were not asked to leave Kenya. In fact appeals were made to them to remain there. The Kenya Government is doing everything in its power to keep the White people there. In order to help those who want to leave the British Government has given a loan to the Kenya Government to enable it to buy the farms of those who want to leave. So there is no difference as far as the two points mentioned by the Commissioner-General are concerned.</p>

<p>What is the position of the White people in the Transkei? After the Prime Minister had announced his policy insistence came not only from the United Party, but also from the Nationalists at their congress at East London, that the Prime Minister tell the country what he intended to do with the White people in the Transkei. Mr. Speaker, you will remember that the Prime Minister appointed the Heckroodt Commission. The accusation we level at the Prime Minister is that he should have known what he was going to do with the Whites before he embarked on the scheme. But he did not know what he was going to do with them. It was only when pressure was applied to him that he decided to appoint a commission to help him decide. The Heckroodt <span class="col_8097-8098" refersTo="page_0383"/>Commission sat in 1962. It went through the Transkei, gave everybody hope, promised them that the Government would look after them and after a year we heard that they had submitted their recommendations to the Government. We were given to understand that the recommendations would be Tabled early in this Session and that a White Paper would be issued giving the Government&#x2019;s decisions on those recommendations. When we asked at the beginning of the Session when the recommendations would be Tabled we were told soon. The Liaison Committee in the Transkei got in touch with the Minister of Bantu Administration and asked him what he was doing about those recommendations and when they would be Tabled. According to the chairman of the Liaison Committee they were eventually promised that the recommendations would be Tabled on 20 or 27 May. But they were not Tabled then, Sir. Eventually ten day ago we got those recommendations.</p>

<p>We were entitled to expect, after that length of time, to get substantial recommendations, but what did we get? We got two pages, not of recommendations, but two pages of recommendations and decisions, and the White Paper says that these are the important recommendations of the commission&#x2014;there are five. The Government has accepted two of the recommendations, one with a proviso, and the others are rejected. I cannot believe that the recommendations contained in this page can be the only recommendations made by that commission. The Government says these are the important recommendations, but I say we should have been given all the recommendations so that we could have decided which were the important ones and which not. I do not think it is for the Prime Minister to select those he thinks are important. We have not had an opportunity of discussing those recommendations; we do not know what they are except for these mentioned here. How do these recommendations and decisions help the White and Coloured people in the Transkei? The first is that in principle compensation must be paid for every loss resulting directly from the change in the constitutional status of the territory. The Government accepts that principle, Sir, provided the trader proves that his losses are not imaginary, but are directly because of the change in the status. How does a trader prove that? The only way he can do it is by getting some person to come along and to say: &#x201C;I am prepared to buy this station; I am prepared to pay such and such a price, but no building society or bank or anybody else will lend me the money to raise the purchase price because of Government policy.&#x201D; How else is he going to prove it? I hope a statement will be made as soon as possible by the Department telling the traders how they must set about proving that the loss is directly due to Government policy.</p>

<p>The Government does not accept the recommendation of an Adjustment Corporation to carry out the valuations. The Government says it will appoint an Advisory Committee to do the adjustment. This committee will value the stations, the land and the improvements which existed on 30 June 1963 and the goodwill &#x201C;being the profits for three years calculated retrospectively from 30 June 1963.&#x201D; Well, the method of calculating the goodwill may be a good one; I am not going to quarrel with that. But I want to know on what basis the land is going to be valued? There is no market value for trading stations and properties in villages to-day. We have not been told on what basis land will be valued. We know this that a Valuation Committee was appointed in South West Africa. According to the Burger the values placed on farms in South West Africa, which had to be taken over in terms of the Odendaal Commission recommendations, were as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die grond van boere in dele wat ingevolge die aanbevelings van die Odendaalkommissie Bantoe-tuislande moet word is vandeesweek hier gewaardeer op presies tweekeer soveel as wat dit op die eiendomsmark werd is. Dit is gewaardeer tussen R13 en R15 per hektaar. Dit is presies tweekeer soveel as hierdie grond se markwaarde. Hierdie boere het maar R6 per hektaar verwag. Verlede jaar nog het &#x2019;n Pretoria maatskappy daar opsies geneem vir R4 per hektaar.</block>

<p>Of course you realize that is only a newspaper report.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Is this not true? Are you not going to compensate these farmers on a fair basis? This comes from the correspondent of the Burger there. All I can say is this, that when the Government does appoint a committee to make the valuations in the Transkei, I hope they will send down those valuators they had in South West Africa. I should also like to point out that when the Government buys farms for the Native Trust, a generous valuation is placed on the farms and, in addition, 20 per cent is added to compensate the farmer for the inconvenience he is caused in having to move from the farm. I want to know why the same consideration is not given to the trader. Why is there no provision in this White Paper for 20 per cent to be given to the trader as well for any inconvenience caused him?</p>

<p>As for the zoning of the villages, according to the White Paper, once a village is zoned the property zoned for Black occupation will be valued. Luckily the Government has not accepted the recommendation that the Group Areas Development Board provisions be applied. I am thankful for that. But I want to point out that those people who fall in the zoned area will probably be the only people who can sell their property. I am worried about the White or Coloured people who fall outside the zoned area, because they will never be able to sell their property until it is zoned Black. Nothing is done to help these people. I want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;unfortunately the Minister of Bantu <span class="col_8099-8100" refersTo="page_0384"/>Administration is not here&#x2014;whether every trader will now have to offer his property to the Trust; will that property then be valued, and will the Minister of Bantu Administration buy every property that is offered? In terms of the White Paper he may buy it. There is no compulsion on him to buy the property. What is the policy going to be in regard to those properties? Are they going to buy every property which is offered? Sir, the White and Coloured people in the Transkei deserve better of this Government than they have received from it I hope the White people in the rest of the country will now realize that this Government is not a Government to protect the White people. It is a Government which is fumbling in trying to find a solution. The Government is battling away; the Prime Minister is making inconsistent statements and the country is becoming more and more worried about them. Not only the United Party supporters are becoming worried about those inconsistencies, but Nationalist Party supporters as well. That was why it was necessary for the <i>Burger</i> to write that leading article on 3 June. They wrote a leading article on &#x201C;Aan-passing&#x201D; (adaptation), and what did they point out, Sir? They said there had been two different statements by the Prime Minister with regard to his policy. They said the Prime Minister said in 1951&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit spreek vanself dat blanke Suid-Afrika die voog oor hulle (i.e. die Naturelle) moet bly. Dit speek vanself dat wanneer ons praat van die selfbestuursregte van die Naturelle in daardie gebiede, ons nie daarmee kan bedoel dat Suid-Afrika hele lappe landsgebied gaan uitsny en daarvan losstaande onafhanklike state maak nie.</block>

<p>The <i>Burger</i> then goes on to quote the 1961 statement&#x2014;ten years later&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek voorsien die ontwikkeling van &#x2019;n statebond van Suid-Afrika, waarin die blanke staat en die swart state met mekaar kan saamwerk, sonder om in &#x2019;n federasie op te gaan en daarom sonder om onder &#x2019;n sentrale regering te wees, maar as aparte en onafhanklike state sal saamwerk. In so &#x2019;n assosiasie sal geen staat oor enige ander baasspeel nie. Hulle sal eerder as goeie bure saamwerk.</block>

<p>The Prime Minister has not replied to these inconsistencies as pointed out by the <i>Burger.</i> The <i>Burger</i> went on to say that circumstances have forced this upon the Prime Minister and they pay tribute to the Prime Minister for being able to change his mind. They point out that the leaders in the country should realize that they can change their minds and the people will still follow them and that therefore they must give more leadership. What I think they were getting at, Sir, was that the Prime Minister and the Transvalers must change their mind in regard to the Coloureds and see that the Coloureds are given direct representation in this House. I think that was what they were getting at.</p>

<p>But the Prime Minister attacked the United Party Senators in the Other Place. He accused them of building up distrust. He did not refer to his own supporters or to the leading article in the <i>Burger</i> which had taken the same line as the Opposition had in the Other Place. He said he wished to deal with historical events. He said there was nothing inconsistent with what he had done because he had merely said in 1951 what everybody else was saying. He traced the growth of the Native policy in this country and referred to the policies of General Smuts and General Hertzog. He said the policy he was carrying out was the traditional policy. He said that there was a movement afoot in 1951 by the metropolitan powers to give their colonies in the north greater self-government but under the control of the Central Power. He made that quite clear. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit was in die lig van die hele situasie van daardie tyd dat ek duidelik die beleid gestel het wat ons gehad het, nl. om die Bantoe al meer en meer seggenskap oor hulle eie mense en in hulle eie gebiede te gee, maar soos dit was in die hele w&#x00EA;reld en van Afrika daardie tyd, het ons ges&#x00EA; maar die mense sal onder one beheer moet bly. Ek het dit so gestel. Dit is heeltemal in die gees en in die omstandighede van daardie tyd.</block>

<p>And then the Prime Minister went on to say that thinking had changed throughout the world in the next decade. That is quite right. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In daardie dekade het al die lande wat koloniale besittings hier gehad het. van standpunt en van uitkyk nie net verander nie, maar druk op mekaar op andere probeer uitoefen om dit ook te doen en so het hulle een na die ander state in Afrika geskep, hulle verlaat, hulle vrygemaak.</block>

<p>The point is this: The Prime Minister had referred to the policies of General Hertzog and General Smuts as justification for the statement he had made in 1951. He was probably right. But I want to point out to the Prime Minister that when General Smuts formulated his Native policy he never intended depriving the Bantu of all their political rights; nor did General Hertzog. Although General Smuts had promised to give the old Bunga of the Transkei more executive power I want to remind the Prime Minister too that before the 1948 election General Smuts said he was also going to give the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council executive power. This is the point the hon. member for Innesdal overlooks: General Smuts warned at all times that the Bantu and all other sections of the community must have some political platform. That was why he supported the idea of the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council being elected by the Bantu throughout the country and he was going to give them executive <span class="col_8101-8102" refersTo="page_0385"/>power. He said it had failed as an advisory body and therefore they had to be given executive power to control their own affairs. That was the start of the idea of race federation. It all fits into our policy of a race federation of every community, each one dealing with its own affairs. In justifying his policy of giving the Bantu states independence the hon. the Prime Minister says he was compelled in 1961 to make that speech because of what had happened abroad. That shows that this Prime Minister is continually making concessions. He does what world opinion wants of him. I ask the Prime Minister this: If he was compelled in 1961 to change his policy from the policy he had in 1951, because of what was happening up North, if he was compelled to give the Transkei self-government before the time, as he himself said in this House, because of world opinion&#x2014;He did not want to do it but he did so because of world opinion,&#x2014;how does he think will he able to control that stage when they get independence? [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to reply to a few important points raised by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). I want to begin with his reference to the words of the hon. the Prime Minister in 1951 and in 1961, as quoted by him. Together with that, I want to deal with his allegation that General Hertzog in his time never foresaw and never alleged that Natives would be deprived of their political rights which they enjoyed in those years. The hon. member should realize that if ever there was an example of how the policy of a political party in regard to the independence of the Bantu in South Africa has developed evolutionarily, it is to be seen in the policy of this party as expressed by, <i>inter alia,</i> the Prime Minister in both those statements he quoted here. Those two statements do not contradict each other. Those two statements follow on each other, just as the policy of General Hertzog in 1924 and later that of Dr. Malan and of Mr. Strijdom was followed by the policy which we apply to-day. When the Prime Minister used those words in 1951, they were, as he correctly said, used in the spirit of those times. Nobody else but the Prime Minister and the present Government were the first who, in view of the evolution at that time, as the nations demanded independence, were able to adapt their policy to it.</p>

<p>We say very clearly to-day that as it became clear right throughout the world, particularly after the Second World War, that nations, whether they were able to do so or not, wanted to become independent, we accepted that principle. This Nationalist Government gives effect to that principle. That is why in recent years, from 1952 with the Bantu Authorities Act and thereafter with the Bantu Self-Government Act, and after that with Transkei Act and other measures which will come at the right time, we took the Bantu to an increasing extent, one step after another, to further forms of self-government, which is not only according to the fashion of the time but which is the natural result of present-day developments. In other words, the policies which the Prime Minister set out in 1951 and in 1961 follow logically on each other. According to the requirements of the time, and according to how the desires of particular peoples are justified, they get further forms of self-government in their own area as a nation on their own, and not mixed up with any other nations in the same geographic area. That is where the policy of hon. members opposite is absolutely static and rather goes back than forward in the spirit of these modem times. Because what is the policy of the United Party? It is a policy which, as the hon. member for Innesdale (Mr. J. A. Marais) correctly stated here to-day and as was also stated on previous occasions, is nothing else but a policy of utter domination in one integrated geographic area. The policy of the United Party is &#x201C;White leadership with justice&#x201D;, a system of race federation with the Whites always in the lead. It is nothing else but a naked policy of domination of the White man over all the other races in one integrated geographic area. That is quite behind the times; it is in conflict with the spirit of the peoples of the world and even with UNO, for which they have so much respect. Sir, the words of the Prime Minister, as contrasted with the policy of the United Party, clearly show that we can honestly say we are complying with the demands of the times. We do so not according to their yardstick but according to our yardstick.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also spoke about the Whites in the Transkei. I should like to talk to him about that, but it seems to me he does not want to listen to me, unless his colleague over there will give him the opportunity to listen to me. The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) should really allow the hon. member for Transkeian Territories to display some good manners, if he cannot do so himself. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories said that with reference to what the Government had announced in the White Paper, the Government is now doing with the Whites in the Transkei what the British Government did with the Whites in Kenya. If ever there was a stupid allegation, it is that one. If what the hon. member for Transkeian Territories said to-day is all the criticism the United Party can voice on our announced guarantees to the Whites in the Transkei in so far as their properties there are concerned, then the United Party has failed miserably to point but any shortcomings.</p>

<p>What is the position of the Whites in the Transkei as compared with the position of the Whites in Kenya? Their position is quite different in every respect. What happened in Kenya? The White authority in Kenya withdrew itself completely; it left those Whites completely in the lurch. It gave them no guarantees. It handed <span class="col_8103-8104" refersTo="page_0386"/>them over to the Bantu Government. The result is that they left. What did that White Government of Kenya do further? It did not bring any prosperity to Kenya; it started no economic development there; it did not even help Kenya to keep order by putting people there. The position in the Transkei is in every respect just the opposite of the position in Kenya. The White guardian Government of the Republic of South Africa, which for all these years had Kenya directly under it and which now has Kenya under it less directly, is not withdrawing from the Transkei at all. As the hon. member knows, there are still many matters in the Transkei which are being directly administered and developed by this Government. In regard to the matters which were handed over to the Transkei, the hon. member ought to know that that was done with the approval of this Parliament. It cannot happen without the approval of this Parliament, because where will their supplementary funds come from? Those funds are voted here. This Government gives the Transkeian Government financial assistance. In other words, the White guardianship of this Government over the Transkei has not been withdrawn but has rather been strengthened, and the Whites who are there now also benefit from it.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I shall reply on that point if the hon. member will just be a little more patient. As I said, the Whites benefit from the development which is being stimulated in that area, not only the administrative development, but also in other spheres. The development we set afoot in terms of the five-year plan continues. Money is flowing into the Transkei as the result of the actions and the co-responsibility of this Government, and that is why in the Transkei we see just the opposite of what happened in Kenya. The Whites, of course, fled out of Kenya, as many as possibly could. What do we see in the Transkei? The White people in the Transkei who told me two years ago at Umtata that a dark future was awaiting them, supporters of the United Party and not of our party, now do not want to leave the Transkei at all. The Whites in the Transkei are in no hurry to leave.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>What about the trading stations?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I shall reply to the hon. member in a moment. The Whites in the Transkei have been experiencing for two years already that more development has been set on foot by this Government, that more money has been brought in and that there are greater prospects for prosperity. That is why they do not want to leave at all now, whereas two years ago they pretended that they would all leave the Transkei. They do not want to leave because they see the prosperity and are experiencing it and because they know that it will increase.</p>

<p>I now want to go into more detail in regard to a few of the points raised by the hon. member. He spoke about the basis mentioned in the White Paper. In the White Paper we give the details, and in the first recommendation the Government gives the basic assurance that it guarantees that the people there will not suffer actual loss. I am not talking now about imaginary losses. Then follow the second group of decisions, and the basis is given on broad lines. Now the hon. member must understand that we cannot now give in detail here the value of every trading station and of every dwellinghouse in that area. But here the broad basis is given. And the hon. member, as somebody who has experience of business and who is an attorney, ought to know that this is an honest and fair basis. I make bold to say that the hon. member knows that it is a fair basis. That is why his criticism was so weak, so pointless and so unconvincing to-day. What do we say here? It is said that in the Transkei the following will serve as the basis for the taking over of trading stations; the value of the land, if the land belongs to the person. How will the value of the land be determined? By this committee appointed by the Government. It is not necessary to establish a permanent corporation, as is recommended here, and the hon. member agrees with me that it is not necessary.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Then I need not deal with it further. We therefore say that a temporary committee will be appointed which can deal with all the cases that occur. How is the land value ascertained? By way of a proper valuation. And the advantage of it is that the land value will be determined at that stage in the future when the sale takes place, and judging from the enthusiasm of the Whites to stay there, they do not want to leave soon. In other words, it boils down to this, that as the land values increase, they will derive the benefit, because that valuation will always be made in future not on a static level, but to the extent that land values increase, as they must increase in a time of prosperity.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Have you taken every trading station which was offered to you? Will you buy every station which is offered.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Theoretically the possibility is stated in this White Paper that every owner of a trading station can offer it for sale to the Government to-day, and if the Government has the valuation made and is convinced that he should sell his station, then those stations can all be bought to-day. But they will not be offered <span class="col_8105-8106" refersTo="page_0387"/>because those people want to have it both ways. The Whites want to share in that prosperity as much as possible, and I do not begrudge it to them.</p>

<p>The second point mentioned here is in regard to the value of the improvements, and it will be the value of the improvements as they existed on 30 June 1963. Some date had to be fixed. The end of the financial year was taken in which notice was given that the Transkei would become increasingly Black and less White, and I think that is a very fair and reasonable date, and I did not even hear the hon. member criticizing it. As a Department, we will ensure that we have a proper inventory in regard to the improvements at those places which existed at this date, so that we will have it available if it is needed in future. The third poin mentioned here was not even mentioned by the hon. member.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I refer to the goodwill, and I did not hear the hon. member say a single word about that. But here also a very fair basis has been laid down, and I see that the hon. member nods his head affirmatively. He agrees. I made some inquiries as to what the practice is in the business world, and to determine the goodwill in terms of the profits over three years retrospectively is a very fair basis. Therefore what has the hon. member proved? He asked whether the 20 per cent would be added. Sir, that is a detail in connection with the land valuation. Is the Government compelled always to give the 20 per cent on all land it buys?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>But the Government has not bought a single trading station yet. Surely the hon. member should wait to see how the Minister determines the price. This White Paper surely does not say that these three people will determine the price. It says that they can make recommendations to the Minister. Then the Minister can determine that that will be the value plus somehing or plus nothing; and the hon. member ought to know from the long experience of purchases of land by the Trust, i.e. by the Minister, that the Whites have always been treated very fairly. What is the great advantage derived by the Whites in the Transkei from this? That it is not an external adaptation corporation which supplies its own yardsticks without having a record of the past. No, it will be the Trust which throughout the years has bought much land in the whole of South Africa and also in the Eastern Province, and which has developed a pattern for the purchasing of land for Bantu, and does the hon. member now think that it will go against that tradation of land purchases in the past in the cases which may come up in the future?</p>

<p>What is going to happen in the future? It has not happened yet because the whole stimulus to the Bantu community has not been there yet. That stimulus is now coming in regard to Bantu life in the Eastern Cape, in the Transkei, and many of those trading stations may perhaps be bought by the Bantu themselves. The hon. member now wants details because he wants to hawk with them. I think I have now replied to all the points raised by the hon. member, except in regard to the zoned and the unzoned area. Now the hon. member should know that Section 60 of the Transkei Constitution Act says that the Minister must appoint a zoning commission, and the names of the members of that commission have appeared in the Press recently. Therefore a commission has been appointed to zone the whole of the White towns in the Transkei. The hon. member surely knows that in the past we also had a zoning system which worked voluntarily. That is why certain local authorities did not want to indicate areas to be zoned, but in many towns there was zoning. Now the hon. member need not be afraid at all that an injustice will be done to the people in those White towns. It is stated very clearly that the purchases can take place in the area to be; oned. That can easily be done because such an area which is zoned, whether it is a quarter of the town or half of the town or the whole of a small town&#x2014;we do not know what the commission will recommend&#x2014;may easily be declared to be a released area, and then the Trust can buy land on the same basis that we have just discussed here and as stated in the White Paper. What is unfair about that? And if outside the zoned area it so happens that land is offered, there is still the provision in the Urban Areas Act whereby the State President can grant approval if the circumstances justify it. But if it takes place under the zoning system, precisely the same procedure can be followed which we have hitherto followed, namely that the zoning of a town can be done gradually. Supposing it is recommended that one-third of the town be zoned as an area to be taken over by the Bantu. Then a further one-third or other percentage of the town can <span class="col_8107-8108" refersTo="page_0388"/>again be added as the zoned area becomes occupied fully. Less than a year ago I personally had to deal with a case, I think in Cala, where a White man found himself in a very bad position. He had to sell. But unfortunately his property lay outside the area which was zoned. We wanted to keep our word vis-&#x00E0;-vis the Municipality by not allowing a sale to be authorized by the State President outside the zoned area. We then approached the local authority, which went into the merits of the case and agreed to enlarge the zoned area in order to include that property in the new zoned area. The man sold his land and everybody was satisfied. If there is goodwill, there is enough elasticity in this scheme, and the hon. member for Transkeian Territories should really look for something else than this White Paper with which to frighten the White people of the Transkei. There is nothing contained in this which need make them afraid. It is a fair basis and the details set out in it offer a guarantee to the White man that if there are <i>bona fide</i> reasons for leaving the place, and he cannot sell to a Bantu, then the assistance of the Trust can be invoked.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) referred the day before yesterday to the West Rand and the East Rand and compared them with each other, and he stated that the West Rand area was being greatly neglected by the Government as compared with the East Rand. Then he quoted certain statistics. My colleague dealt with him very effectively from the industrial point of view and from the angle of building plans approved. But what is the real meaning of the figures he himself quoted? In the past, in so far as that hon. member is concerned, I have repeatedly learnt that if he quotes figures it pays one to scrutinize his figures, because he juggles with figures to such an extent that anyone who is not a magician cannot follow his tricks. I saw at first glance what he is. The hon. member said: There is the West Rand area, half as big geographically as the East Rand area. He described it from Roodepoort right to Oberholzer, and the East Rand right to Springs. I then went into the matter. Then the hon. member said it was half as big and the income of the public there was half that of the people on the East Rand. But what did the hon. member do when he made this comparison? The hon. member compared the bare veld of the West Rand area down to Carletonville with the industrialized area of the East Rand. This argument of the hon. member in regard to the size of the area is therefore of no value, because he compared bare veld with the factories on the East Rand.</p>

<p>Let us now discuss the industries. In that regard my colleague has already said enough, but I still want to say this: It is well known, and all of us who live in the Transvaal know, that the East Rand started developing industrially much earlier&#x2014;Benoni, Brakpan, Springs, Germiston. Germiston, one of the financial giants among our cities in South Africa, was an industrial area right from the very beginning, but not the West Rand. The industrialization of the West Rand only started in recent times. It is an area which is now beginning to develop industrially, but the hon. member compares it with a fully industrialized area on the East Rand.</p>

<p>Two months ago my colleague, the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) and the hon. the Minister of Transport and I were present at the opening of a very large industrial township on the West Rand. These things are only starting there now. Now I just want to mention one statistic in regard to the West Rand, and I know that the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) will again jump up and talk about that cement factory. Then it will be the seventh time that he talks that nonsense here. But I just want tomention something in regard to the population, because the hon. member for Yeoville also referred to the population. What is the position in regard to the population on the East Rand and on the West Rand? I studied the statistics carefully, and I obtained these figures from the Bulletin of the Bureau. From 1951 to 1960 the increase in the population, in so far as Whites are concerned (the hon. member also spoke about Whites only) in the East Rand area was 16.1 per cent.</p>

<p>The hon. member must give me a chance now. My time has practically expired. The same area of the West Rand mentioned by the hon. member, for the same period of 1951 to I960, had a population increase of 37.5 per cent. Now what is the inference? The hon. member says that the West Rand area is being neglected by the Government. But in the same period the White population on the West Rand increased by twice as high a percentage as was the case on the East Rand. Can that be called neglect? No, the hon. member for Yeoville can juggle with figures, as I said. I want to go further and say that the hon. member evidently has an inborn tendency to dishonour figures and statistics.</p>

<p>My time is up, but I should very much like to react to a refrain which I have heard right throughout this Session, viz. the allegation made to-day again by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories that the Government, with its policy of apartheid or separate development, is busy with an impracticable policy, that we are inefficient, and as I have also heard on various occasions this Session particularly also from the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman), that it is a policy which has failed and is still failing. Now I want to say that if ever there was a policy in regard to which we are achieving increasing success, it is in the implementation of separate development. I should like to afford the proof for this in respect of four forms of the policy of separate development, although I will probably not have enough time to do so. Firstly, I say that in respect of the geographic aspect of the population groups we have achieved great success, and that in fact we have already made so much progress that we practically have complete separation in regard to the geographical application of separate development. Also, in regard to the political separation we have already achieved total separation, and all this was done during the regime of the present Government, from 1948. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I listened very attentively to the political lesson which the hon. The Deputy Minister tried to teach us in regard to the evolutionary development of the policy of separate freedom. Of course, the hon. the Deputy Minister tried again, as he has always done, to contend that this policy is nothing more than the natural result or continuation of the traditional policy of South Africa. I understand the eagerness of the hon. the Deputy Minister and hon. members opposite to do this because if there is one party which is as afraid of breaking away from tradition as the devil is of holy water, it is the Nationalist Party. That party is so afraid that the public may gain the impression that they have broken with the tradition of South Africa as far as race relationships are concerned that they make use of every opportunity to try to convince the public that they are really trying to maintain that tradition.</p>

<p>I want to put this question to the hon. the Deputy Minister: He says that this policy is a continuation of the tradition of this country. When in the past has there ever been an indication by any other leader of the Nationalist Party that they were following a policy which would eventually give full independence to the Black man?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think that the hon. the Deputy Minister would do well to brush up on his history in this regard. If there was one principle to which General Hertzog remained faithful throughout it was that there should be political unity in South Africa. The races could live apart but political unity had to be given effect to by this House. Every leader of the United Party and of the Nationalist Party has always believed in that political unity, the tradition of South Africa, hoping that at a later stage this House will reveal that political unity in respect of the White man only and that the Black man can rule himself. This is a complete rejection of the traditional policy of South Africa and the sooner the Nationalist Party realizes this, the better.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has told us that wonderful success has been achieved with this policy of separate freedom. He says that geographically it has been very successful. I want to ask the hon. the Minister why they can give us no definite information in regard to this crucial problem of boundaries. Why do we have to struggle to obtain information in this connection?</p>

I want to come back to this point and then we shall judge total apartheid <span class="col_8111-8112" refersTo="page_0390"/>using the norm with which the hon. the Minister has provided us.</p>

<p>Before I leave the point in connection with the South African tradition and how they have clung to it, I also want to ask the hon. the Minister when he discovered that a change had taken place in the world? The hon. the Minister has told us that the Nationalist Party is only keeping abreast of the changes in the world. Only eight years ago, as is recorded in Hansard, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development told us that it had never been the policy of the Nationalist Party to guide the Bantu in the direction of independent states. Does the hon. Deputy Minister admit that? If he does admit it, I want to ask him when this change of heart took place, when this basic revolutionary change of heart took place in the ranks of the Nationalist Party. When did he discover that the world was changing? The fact of the matter is that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has been caught, just like the hon. the Minister, in the web of thought of the hon. the Prime Minister, and to-day they have to stand or fall by it. I want to place this on record. I refer here to Col. 5364 of Hansard of 14 May 1956&#x2014;not donkey&#x2019;s years ago.</p>

<p>I can continue quoting until to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>This Session is almost at its end and, like previous sessions, it has left us with certain impressions. The matter which has made the greatest impression on me during this Session is the two lines of thought, the double-barrelled policy which is being revealed by the Nationalist Party more and more in connection with race relationships in South Africa. It has never been so clear to me that the Nationalist Party is blatantly showing off the fruits of economic integration while completely deny that integration as far as their policy is concerned. It has never been so clear to me that while the Nationalist Party is squeezing the last drop of propaganda value out of the policy of total apartheid, they are in effect showing that policy nothing but lip-service. It has never been as clear to me as it has become during this Session that although hon. members opposite make their policy out to be the only salvation for the White man, this Government has set a process in motion in South Africa which can lead to only one thing and that is the destruction of the White man and his way of life in South Africa.</p>

<p>They boast with the fruits of economic integration but who can stand up in this House and say that he is not proud of our economic prosperity? Who on the other hand can stand up and deny that if it were not for our integrated Bantu labour, that prosperity would not be as great as it is? Another fact is this. Who can stand up and deny that unless we are prepared to make more and more use of Bantu labour, we shall not be able to maintain our economic prosperity or our standard of living? But when we tell hon. members that this is economic integration they say: It is not economic integration because the Bantu are only here temporarily; we control every movement of the Bantu; we make them citizens of another state and that is why they are not economically integrated here.</p>

<p>But it is clear to me that no matter what the Government may say, as long as Bantu labour is required in our economic structure, so long will the Bantu remain economically integrated with us: and even if Jafta does that work one year and September does it the next, the fact remains that the Bantu are needed. As long as they are required we will have economic integration. I want to address this remark to the hon. the Minister who boasts so much about the success of apartheid. What has he done to bring about the removal of the Bantu from our economy? No, he can only do this in one way and that is not by words, including the words of the law; it can only be done by deeds; the Whites will have to be prepared to do all this work themselves and to take the consequences.</p>

<p>When it comes to telling the White man that he has to do all the work presently being done by the Bantu, I tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that this Government does not have the courage to make this demand of the Whites of South Africa. In the meantime the Government is proceeding with its twin trains of thought, is continuing to sit on two stools until it eventually falls between those two stools, most probably taking the people of South Africa with it.</p>

<p>But I want to make a second point. I say that the Government are squeezing the last drop of propaganda value out of the theory of total apartheid but in reality they are doing nothing more than to show a lip-service to that theory. But when we talk of total apartheid we must be very clear and we must not be led up the garden path by the political dictionary of the Nationalist Party. They have their own political dictionary and we now have a new term called separate freedom. We must not allow this to mislead us. Separate freedom and separate development both mean total apartheid because total apartheid is a term which was forced on them by the Tomlinson Commission. The commission said that this was the only policy by means of which the White man in South Africa could be saved. The Government has now to stand by that policy. It has to follow that path because it has promised the people of South Africa that it will do so. If it now wants to leave that path, as it is doing in practice, it must be honest with the people and tell them that it is no longer striving to achieve total apartheid but is aiming at something else. The Government must also tell us what they are now striving to achieve. Only a few weeks ago the question of total apartheid was confirmed by the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. Van Staden). He said that since 1948&#x2014;I do not think his date was quite correct&#x2014;it has been the policy of the Nationalist Party to remove the Bantu from South Africa. The propaganda machine of the Nationalist Party is trying daily by means of this promise of the removal of the Bantu supported by the Tomlinson Commission plus the Transkei Act, to make the public believe that the Nationalist Party is still following the policy of total apartheid. But in the meantime the facts prove just the opposite, that we are moving further away from that aim. No one is interested in total apartheid any longer, least of all the Government. They talk of the political success and of the geographical success of the apartheid policy but the hon. the Minister has nothing to say about the matter which is of so much importance, the economic facet, because he knows that the Bantu are more deeply integrated in our economy than they have ever been before. What right has the hon. the Deputy Minister to say that he is following a policy of total apartheid when every day it is clear to us that the facts prove the opposite? What right has he to say this when the White man is leaving the platteland and the Bantu are moving into the platteland to an increasing extent? Look what is happening in the Western Cape where it should be the easiest thing in the world to apply total apartheid because, so the Nationalist Party says, there are sufficient Coloureds to do the work here. What is happening here? We know how the Government have since 1961 been recruiting an increasing number of Bantu to work in the Western Cape. The figure has already been mentioned here. In 1961 it was 666. The State recruited those Bantu itself. In 1962 the number was 892 and in 1963 it was 3,864. For the first three months of 1964 it was 3,511. Is this the removal of the Bantu from our economic life? The Railways have tried to remove the Bantu from Table Bay Harbour. Have they made any progress? Let us see what the 1963 report of the Railway and Harbour Board has to say in this regard (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Arising from the Government&#x2019;s policy to remove Bantu from the Western Cape, the Administration was compelled to recruit Coloured labour in the Transkei in order to relieve the labour shortage in Table Bay Harbour.</block>

<p>If we have to recruit Coloureds in the Transkei to do the work of the Bantu in Table Bay Harbour, what has become of all the Coloureds here? Where is the great unemployment? The argument cannot be that we needed trained Coloureds for that work and that we did not have the time to train them. Surely, if the Transkei Coloureds were trained for that work, the Coloureds here should also have been able to do that work? The fact is that we simply do not have the Coloureds here to do that work and if this is the position in the Western Cape what will be the position in the rest of the country? Let us read what the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) had to say about this position. He was referring to the secrifices which the White man would have to make in order to make this policy possible. This is what he said on 2 November 1963 (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this respect it worries me that the Western Cape is still completely isolated in regard to the clearer attitude it has adopted as far as the increasing number of Blacks in our own homelands is concerned.</block>

<p>He is worried. What fine words. But the Nationalist Party is by no means giving effect to these words in the Western Cape. The hon. member went on to say (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where are our northern bastions where the Black stream flows so much stronger and is so much more important in determining our prosperity and development? Is it not precisely here that more formidable plans and thought are required?</block>

<p>What is the Government doing in this connection? Where is that more formidable <span class="col_8115-8116" refersTo="page_0392"/>thought? There is no thought and the fact simply remains that the Nationalist Party is doing nothing as far as the economic facts of South Africa are concerned to give effect to total apartheid.</p>

<p>I have said in this House previously that the Government can do nothing if it does not give attention to the time factor. The hon. member for Moorreesburg expressed concern in regard to the time factor. He said that we must launch a crusade in the north. This is not being done. No, conditions in South Africa, in Africa and in the world are such that we cannot devote too much time to this matter. We cannot continue too long to hope that a Black, voteless proletariat will remain the basis of our economic structure without giving them some recognition. I can mention other things which the Government is required to do. Do hon. members know what is happening? This is a very serious matter. The Government is picking the economic fruits of a multi-racial population pattern but it is not prepared to accept or recognize the political and social demands made of it by that pattern. What is the result? A wave of frustration is building up amongst the non-Whites which will make it completely impossible at a later stage to apply any reasonable policy as far as race relationships are concerned. If the time comes when it is impossible to formulate a reasonable policy, then the blame for this fact must be placed at the door of only one party, the Nationalist Party, which is prepared to win elections by means of a theory but which is not prepared to face reality as far as the results of its actions are concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken is still fairly young and inexperienced and to judge from his speech to-day he will place his party in a very embarrassing position. If one says things in this House in a challenging way, things which are not in accordance with historical facts simply because one has the right to say what one wants to say in this House, and one makes use of that opportunity because one imagines that one is on the top of a very high mountain and is free to say what one likes without considering the fact that what one has to say is in conflict with the true facts, then one makes a great mistake. He has taken it upon himself to-day to issue a challenge to this side to say which other Statesman or Prime Minister emphasized this policy of total segregation which we are implementing to-day. I want to start with General Hertzog. I think that for future reference it may be in the interests of the hon. member to go back to school and to learn elementary South African history before he discusses these matters. If he does not do so he will only be placing his party in a most embarrassing position. He suggested that no other Prime Minister had ever laid down the principles of separate development. I want to teach him an elementary lesson. General Hertzog, the father of segregation as he is often called&#x2014;and what is segregation and its consequences other than separate development as we are implementing it at the moment &#x2014;had the following to say in this House as early as in 1925 (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear to me that the giving of the vote to the Natives of the Union on the basis of the Cape must of necessity lead to the downfall of the White people of the Union. If no change is made the position in the Cape will make it impossible for us to prevent the Natives in the Northern provinces obtaining the vote within a comparatively short space of time.</block>

<p>In order to remove this danger General Hertzog then suggested that the Natives in the Cape be removed from the common Voters&#x2019; Roll and be given separate representation. [Interjections.] He also had this to say in connection with the question of separate development and the authority of the Native in the political sphere (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Native must feel that his home is in the Native area, not here. As far as he is concerned there ought therefore to be no other restrictions upon him in his area other than those which are necessary in every well organized national family. It is my aim that as far as the Native is capable of doing so he should himself lay down the rules, according to the requirements of civilization, in terms of which he will have to arrange his own affairs within his area. But not only do I want him to be his own legislator within his own national economy; but he must also control his own administration there through the medium of his own Native officials. Within the Native area therefore there will be scope for both the Native statesman and the Native official.</block>

<p>If words mean anything, then this means nothing less than separate development for the Bantu.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member to give me one instance in which the words &#x201C;independent states&#x201D; are used in that speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>What has that to do with this point? We are not dealing here with absolutely independent states. We are dealing here with the limited representation which we are already giving the Bantu in exchange for what he had here. We are giving him the opportunity, according to General Hertzog, to show how he can live out his independence according to his own ability. This is something which still has to be proved by the coming into being of the homelands with their own Governments.</p>

<p>The present Prime Minister had the following to say in connection with this matter in regard <span class="col_8117-8118" refersTo="page_0393"/>to which the Opposition have consistently placed South Africa in a wrong light by saying that we oppress the Bantu and that we have deprived him of his political rights and have given him nothing in exchange (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would prefer in the long run to find myself with a smaller state in South Africa, a state which was White, which would control its own army, its own navy, its own police and its own army and which would be a bulwark for White civilization in the world; in other words, a White nation which could fight for its survival rather than a larger state, of which the United Party is in favour, which would already have been given over to Bantu control.</block>

<p>This is the basic difference between the United Party and ourselves&#x2014;that they are opposed to the fact that a portion of South Africa should be placed under Bantu control. But they are indifferent to the consequences of their policy in that the whole of South Africa must eventually be dominated by the Bantu. That is the basic difference between us. If it were necessary to do so I could still prove to the hon. member how Dr. Malan laid down the same policy from time to time and pointed out that we had to have territorial segregation and segregation in the political sphere, which has already been given effect to as the hon. the Deputy Minister indicated this morning. The hon. the Prime Minister went on to say (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The attitude of the National Party is to strive for a permanent White South Africa, no matter what danger may threaten it, and to be prepared for the development of areas in which the Bantu can take control under the guidance of the White man as guardian on the understanding that even though this may lead to Bantu independence, it is our intention to ennsure by means of statemanship that the development will take place in such a spirit and in such a way that friendship may possibly remain, although without the White man&#x2019;s ever finding himself under any form of Bantu control, either in federal or union form. That is the choice.</block>

<p>What is more, we are now establishing the Bantu, in exchange for what he had here&#x2014;and if hon. members deny this fact again to-day I shall produce proof to show that even General Smuts said that in this lies the only permanent solution not only for South Africa but for the entire continent of Africa&#x2014;Bantu councils and Bantu homelands where we can set up a platform for the educated Bantu and for the Bantu statesmen on the basis of separate development. Even General Smuts supported this idea. During the discussion of the 1936 legislation he argued that this would one day be the permanent solution for South Africa and for the whole of Africa. I see that hon. members are satisfied that this is so because they have not questioned my statement. I shall prove it by quoting from the Hansard of the Joint Sitting of 1936, Col. 317. General Smuts had this to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Separate Native councils are the final solution not only for Southern Africa but for the whole of the Continent of Africa.</block>

<p>In the same speech General Smuts said that he stood alone and did not have the support of his party. In Col. 320 he said that his party did not see eye to eye with him in this regard. That is why they are to-day trying to run away from the attitude which he adopted then. The hon. member knows that the attitude which they have adopted is not more favourable to UNO because the truth is gradually catching up on the lies. It is gradually beginning to penetrate to statesmen throughout the world that in South Africa&#x2019;s present policy of separate development one has a platform from which to defend oneself because this is the only way in which we can live out the principle of one man, one vote, while, if we have a form of race federation in which, as the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) said this morning &#x201C;there is some form a representation&#x201D;, the pressure from abroad will simply be increased because &#x201C;some form of representation&#x201D; will never satisfy the outside world. But the logical consequences are that this can and will be the case on the basis of separate development. Because hon. members are afraid that we will completely disarm the entire world and deprive them of their most powerful weapon against us, that we will convince the whole world that this is a pattern which will serve as a model not only in South Africa but in many parts of the world, they oppose us. Instead of their assisting us in the interests of the survival of White South Africa by declaring this policy to the world, they consistently misrepresent it and substitute for it their policy of a race federation which can provide no solution to these problems either in South Africa or in any other part of the world. These are the remarks I have to make in regard to the points raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>But I rise actually to reply to something that was said on Saturday by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). The hon. the Deputy Minister has already replied to him but I want to say that it is not necessary for the hon. member for Yeoville to step into the breach for industrial development on the West Rand. Without mentioning any further figures, the facts are that the confluence of industrialists on the West Rand is so bad that the three most important municipalities there cannot keep pace with the demand for housing which prevails there at present because of the tremendous influx of industrialists, workers and dealers from all parts of the country. If there is one factor which indicates that a particular area is growing, it is the demand for dwelling houses. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs pointed out the other day how those three municipalities are at present under <span class="col_8119-8120" refersTo="page_0394"/>pressure because of the demand for housing. For the hon. member for Yeoville to talk about the poor West Rand is absolute nonsense. He should confine himself rather to his own constituency. I want to tell him that I am sure that there is not a single hon. member in this House who would not like to see more industries developing in his own constituency. I am one of them but I make an important condition in this regard. I want no industrial development in my constituency which will have the effect of increasing the influx of Bantu to that area. I am in favour of the establishment of all industries which want to comply with the policy of the Government; in other words, industries based on White labour. Sir, the Opposition say one thing one day and another thing the next; they want to see a number of factories come into being there so that they can come along here next year and say that there are too many Bantu in the White areas. One day they complain that there is an influx of Bantu into the White areas and the next day they say that more industries employing Bantu labour should be established in the White areas. There are certain industries which will have a great future if they are established in the border areas because Bantu labour is available there if they want to employ that Bantu labour. On the other hand, if they want to establish industries in the White areas they also have the opportunity to do so but I want to warn them that the Witwatersrand and more specifically the area which I am discussing now will not always be able to afford them all the facilities they need; a time will come when saturation point will be reached. I have raised this matter in my own constituency and my voters support me. It is of no avail for us to talk of the decentralization of industries if this&#x2014;the proposal of the United Party&#x2014;results in an even greater influx of Bantu into the Witwatersrand area. Sir, if you go to the Witwatersrand today and see the White people who are employed there on the mines and in the factories and not only on the Witwatersrond but also in Pretoria, you will find that the vast majority of those White people were born elsewhere&#x2014;in the Free State, in the Western Transvaal and in the Cape. They grow up in other parts of the country; they are educated up to matriculation standard and then they disappear from those areas in which they were born. Sir, where are the young people who were born and grew up in Rustenburg, Lichtenburg, Christiana, Kimberley, Wepener, Rouxville, Ficksburg, Bethlehem, Harrismith, Vrede, Brandfort. Vredefort, Kroonstad, Hoopstand. Senekal, Winburg, Smithfield and other towns in the Free State? They were born there; they were educated there but where are they to-day? They are concentrated on the Witwatersrand simply because we did not have this process of the decentralization of industries in the past. That is why I most strongly support and subscribe to the policy of the Government of the decentralization of industries. That is why I say here that a proper survey must be made of the industrial potential of even the smallest town in the country to ascertain the possibility of industrial development there so that it wil no longer be necessary for the people who are born in those areas and who receive their education there to move to the Witwatersrand or to one of the large industrial centres to find their niche in life. We cannot stop this process until such time as we give definite effect to the policy of decentralization of industries so that our young people can find their niche in that series of towns I have just mentioned. It is only in that way that we will be able to place the unprecedented&#x2014;I would almost say uncontrollable&#x2014;growth of industries on the Witwatersrand and elsewhere within reasonable limits. For this reason I hope that industrialists will take note of the appeal made to them by the Government to establish industries at places where water, labour and power will be available to them and what is more, where they can obtain cheap land. Two other important reasons why industrialists must give serious attention to the desirability of decentralization is the question of public health and the safety of the State. There are a hundred and one reasons why we must act positively in connection with decentralization. We must warn our industrialists that they must be careful where they establish their industries; that they must not establish those industries in parts of the country which are already over-populated because the city councils and the municipalities find it difficult to comply with the very heavy demands made of them in connection with the provision of housing. The city councils will not always be able to comply with the housing requirements of the employees of the steadily increasing number of industries. I have already pointed out that even to-day the city councils on the West Rand are not able to provide sufficient housing in order to keep pace with the tremendous influx of workers into these areas. Things cannot go on in this way. We cannot permit the small town in the country to become steadily smaller and the large cities to become steadily larger for the reasons I have already mentioned. That is why I want again to appeal to industrialists to turn their eyes towards the smaller towns in South Africa where water and power and housing are available and where the influx of workers will not constitute a danger to public health. This steadily increasing influx into the large cities is creating more and more problems. There are even Members of the House of Assembly, so-called leaders of the United Party, who do not even have an elementary idea of the reasons why these problems have arisen.</p>

<p>I was interested in the remarks of the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg). In the first place he made an appeal to industrialists to establish their industries in small towns. Is this a change of Government policy? I was under the impression that the policy of the Government is for industries to be established in the border areas. The hon. member for Krugersdorp <span class="col_8121-8122" refersTo="page_0395"/>has just advocated the establishment of industries in the small towns.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member also said that he only wanted industries based on White labour to be established at Krugersdorp. But in this regard he will have to appeal to the hon. the Minister of Immigration, because the hon. the Minister of Immigration is only prepared to allow skilled immigrants to enter the country. Every factory or industry is, after all, based partly on skilled and partly on unskilled labour. If an industry wants to flourish it must have both skilled and unskilled labour at its disposal. If Whites are not available to do unskilled labour, then this work will have to be done by non-Whites. This, of course, will mean that a large number of non-Whites will have to be permitted to settle in Krugersdorp.</p>

<p>But the hon. member has proved to us that there is a difference of opinion in the ranks of his own party in regard to the history of their policy. He wants to make out that this is the traditional policy of South Africa, while the hon. the Deputy Minister admitted quite frankly this morning, certainly by implication, that this change in policy had to be effected in order to meet changed conditions. I hope to put an end to this story simply by reminding the hon. member of what a Nationalist newspaper had to say about this question in April last year. On 4 April last year a columnist of the <i>Burger</i> discussed the question of whether this policy was the traditional policy of South Africa or not, and this is what he wro te (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the revolution of our time the Nationalist Government has come forward with the revolutionary proposal which amounts to the partition of South Africa between people who are Black and people who are not Black.</block>

<p>Here we have the correct approach set down for us in black and white. We would have a far higher opinion of hon. members opposite if they accepted this fact, because this is, indeed, the position. The hon. the Prime Minister himself said in 1951 that there was no question of the establishment of independent states; the hon. the Deputy Minister also said so. We all know that the hon. the Prime Minister came forward with this revolutionary change in policy because he wanted peace in the face of United Nations attacks.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that this was done for the sake of racial peace in our own country, but I am giving him the reason advanced by the hon. the Prime Minister himself. He said that he had done this in the face of United Nations attacks, and because he wanted peace. The hon. member is trying to reason away this fact, but the fact remains that it was done for that reason. This was also the reason given to the world, and we, and particularly the Nationalist Party, are saddled with this policy to-day.</p>

<p>It is precisely in this regard that the Nationalist Party is leading the country into so much trouble. Let us test this policy against the success, if any, which has been achieved in this regard. I want to start with two tests set by the <i>Burger</i> itself when it had its discussion with Trouw recently. On 13 December 1963 the <i>Burger</i> had this to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Can the masses of the urban Bantu be won over to the idea of an own, but at the moment still comparatively backward, homeland?</block>

<p>The first point I want to make is that we have only just made a start with one of these Bantustans, and I ask hon. members opposite whether they can produce any evidence to show that the urban Bantu accept their policy. Where is that evidence? The urban Bantu evinced very little interest in the election.</p>

<p>There is evidence that they continue to accept the fact, as they have done in the past, that South Africa is still following the old policy. They did not know that the hon. the Prime Minister had made the Nationalist Party do a complete about-face.</p>

<p>Let us now apply the second test. I quote (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8123-8124" refersTo="page_0396"/>A massive development will take place in and near the Bantu homelands which will, as it were, eventually suck back the Blacks so that their numbers in the White area will steadily fall instead of increasing as has been the case over the past years, notwithstanding strict influx control.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>When business was interrupted I was reminding hon. members of the words of the hon. the Prime Minister to the effect that his was a policy which would keep the Republic standing. I have said that we all want the Republic to remain standing. I have said that no evidence has been produced to show that the policy of separate development of the hon. the Prime Minister is accepted by the urban Bantu. It is true that the voters of the Transkei do not want to be cut off from South Africa and even the governing party there has a completely different understanding of this policy of separate development. I want to quote from a report in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 11 June this year which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Transkei Legislative Assembly passed a motion whereby the Republican Government should be asked to relax the influx control regulations.</block>

<p>This proves that they understand the position in a completely different way to the way in which the Government wants them to understand it.</p>

<p>I come now to the second test which I want to apply&#x2014;the massive development of the border industries. I have said that border industries simply do not want to get under way. In this connection I want to quote what the hon. the Prime Minister had to say in April. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister said to-day that border industries were not growing up fast enough to help solve the two major problems confronting the Government in its efforts to implement the policy of separate development, expanding Black populations in the cities and mounting unemployment in Bantu homelands.</block>

<p>When the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) speaks, he always includes the numbers of the old-established industries as though they were actually border industries: he wants to re-christen them in that sense. But the best test is still the Transkei itself. As far as the Transkei is concerned only 2,800 positions have been created for the Bantu there, notwithstanding all the efforts of the Government, from the start of the application of its policy of border industries up to to-day. When one remembers that the Transkei has more than 2,000,000 people, it is clear that this is only a drop in the ocean. Sir, where are the plans which are going to provide employment on the borders of the Transkei? We know of R200,000,000 and more for the 500,000 people of South West Africa, but we have heard of no plans in connection with the creation of employment for the 2,000,000 people of the Transkei. We have also heard of the R2,000,000,000 which is to be spent over a period of five years in the so-called White area. This is a very good thing and we welcome it. This is also our policy, but this fact will simply draw the Bantu back to the Republic at a swifter rate. We do hear pleas made to factory owners to establish their factories on the borders of the Bantu areas, but there are no signs that money is being invested by the Government to implement its plans in this regard. In other words, after 16 years of Nationalist Party Government the Whites are even further in the minority in the so-called White area as against the Bantu.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered that the Tomlinson Commission stated that the reserves would only be able to hold a maximum of 10,000,000 Bantu by the year 2000. At the end of 1962 the Natural Resources Development Council said that there would be 26,000,000 Bantu in the Republic by the year 2000. If, therefore, we deduct those 10,000,000 &#x2014;which is the maximum number the Government can hope to settle in the Bantu areas&#x2014; we still have 16,000,000 Bantu left in the so-called White area. What then will we have achieved? We will still be in the minority in the White area. The Natural Resources Development Council estimates that by that time the Whites will number 6,000,000; in other words, the proportion will then be 16,000,000 Bantu to 6,000,000 Whites in the so-called White area, and this after we have created all these dangers which the Government is creating by means of this policy which it is following!</p>

<p>I come now to the third test that I want to apply to prove how this policy has already failed. The hon. the Prime Minister took this step, as I have already indicated, to try to buy peace in the face of UN attacks. I just want to say in passing that this step which it has announced is a further proof of its weakness. The hon. the Prime Minister came forward with this policy impulsively without giving it sufficient thought. I doubt very much whether he discussed this policy with his colleagues at high level before he announced it in 1959. What success has thus far been achieved by this policy? The Government has achieved absolutely no success with this policy. Indeed, the attacks against us continue and this policy has increased pressure upon us to make concessions. I admit that the concession made by the hon. the Prime Minister was a very great <span class="col_8125-8126" refersTo="page_0397"/>concession; I readily admit that, but the outside world is making demands for further concessions to-day. That is why I say that the sooner we return to the old and tried policy of South Africa, the better.</p>

<p>I also want to tell hon. members why this matter has become a very urgent one. The Transkei is the first state which is now being led toward independence. Six months ago Zanzibar, an Africa state, received its independence. Only six months have elapsed since that happened and we find that the communists are already there. I want to quote from a report which appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> on 11 June this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Technicians from Russia arrived here (in Zanzibar) yesterday to take over the running of the port and marine department. They are on contract to the Zanzibar Government and include a large number of engineers and other people.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members are continually reminding us of the ferocity of the attacks made upon us by the communists and Afro-Asian countries. If this is so&#x2014;and there is much truth in this statement&#x2014;then those people will take advantage of the first opportunity that presents itself to try to overthrow us, and if we open the door to them in the Transkei and other places, as the door was opened to them in Zanzibar, then it will be our own fault if they take advantage of that fact as they did in Zanzibar. We hear that they are already in Tanganyika and other African states. Hon. members opposite are continually referring to Basutoland. I want to refer them immediately to a report which appeared on 26 August last year in the <i>Burger.</i> The report states (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sabotage nest in Bechuanaland.</block>

<p>Colonel Van den Bergh of our Police Force said of Bechuanaland that it was a haven for communists and saboteurs. I also have here a report which appeared in <i>Dagbreek</i> of April, 1964, in which it is stated (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From three sources the suspicion has been confirmed that intense communistically-inclined activities are taking place in the Protectorates. Large sums of Red money and vehicles for which the Chinese have paid have been received in these territories.</block>

<p>I say that the policy followed by the hon. the Prime Minister and his party of renouncing the Protectorates is a very wrong one. They have thrown away our chances and we are now saddled with a very difficult problem because the Transkei is a more dangerous place. As the hon. the Minister of Defence said, we must be prepared for a full-scale attack from the direction of the Indian Ocean and it is precisely on that coastline that the Transkei and these other territories are situated.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying this: I trust that hon. members will come to their senses in this regard. I hope that they will begin to realize that where, at best, we will have 16,000,000 Bantu in the so-called White area, we will achieve nothing by continuing with this policy. I also know that the supporters of the Nationalist Party are beginning to realize more and more that this is not the policy which they thought the Government would follow. I have every confidence that as good South Africans, South Africans who want the Republic to survive, they will not remain silent for long. I hope that they will as soon as possible bring about a change in this regard in the interests of their country.</p>

We were in the Conservative Party at that time when Dr. Malan made an effort to obtain the unanimous consent of this House to have the Protectorates incorporated with South Africa. Who opposed Dr. Malan at that time? Mr. Strauss opposed him. I still remember how uncomfortable the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) felt on that day. [Interjections.] I voted for the motion. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition at the time, the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and all the other members on that side voted against it; they said that we should not incorporate the Protectorates. They said that we should not make this request to the British Government. That was in about 1954.</p>

<p>Of course I know about it. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must not think that he can get away with that. There were private negotiations between the late Dr. Malan and Mr. Strauss. Dr. Malan introduced a motion to this effect: &#x201C;That this House unanimously requests the British Government to transfer the Protectorates.&#x201D; Mr. Strauss then made known the private discussion between himself and Dr. Malan. The hon. member for Yeoville still shouted to Mr. Strauss at the time: You dare not do it! Does he deny that? We were then in the Conservative Party and we <span class="col_8127-8128" refersTo="page_0398"/>voted with Dr. Malan in favour of the incorporation of the Protectorates. That is the position.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands asks: Where are the plans for the Transkei? I want to say to this young infant: His predecessors said exactly the same thing. They asked: Where are the plans for the Republic? And we have the Republic. They told us that we would never have a Republic. They asked: Where are the plans for Iscor; you will never make it a paying proposition. To-day it is a paying proposition. In latter years hon. members opposite have asked: What do you want to do with Sasol? It is a bankrupt business; all you ask for is more and more capital. Where are the plans for Sasol? Sasol is there to-day; it is producing petrol on a profitable basis. No, Mr. Speaker, I am afraid the hon. member for Pinelands is still very young in politics.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). He said this afternoon that the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. the Minister of Justice had precisely the same ideas on Nusas! He said that both of them had said that the students had to rectify the matter themselves.. The hon. member for Yeoville said that Nusas was an honourable organization and the hon. the Minister of Justice said that it was a canker in student life in South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Justice said that he left Nusas to the students so that they could eradicate that canker in our student life. All that those hon. members want is simply to get rid of a few of the members of Nusas and get their own people into those positions. In principle, however, they have no objection to the general executive of Nusas. Not one of them has ever condemned Nusas.</p>

<p>Just before I return to the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville I want to tell the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) that I appreciate the apology he made and that I accept it wholeheartedly and unconditionally. He added a rider at the end of his apology which I accept as having been added to make excuses for what he did but not to detract at all from the apology he made. While I am on this point I think that this is a very good opportunity to clear up a matter which I have wanted to clear up for some time now but as yet have not had the opportunity to do so. The hon. member referred of course to a Press report in which I had apparently said, referring to the appointment of Messrs. Waring and Trollip to the Cabinet, that there were far better members in the National Party who could be appointed. Of course, I said nothing of the kind. I lauded and praised the hon. the Prime Minister for this gesture of his to the English-speaking people. I added that it took a man of courage to do something of this nature. I said that it was not an easy thing to do because there were many men of Cabinet calibre behind the hon. the Prime Minister, people who had devoted their entire lives to serving the National Party. I praised the hon. the Prime Minister in that in the face of this fact he had had the courage to make a gesture of goodwill to the English-speaking people by appointing Messrs. Trollip and Waring to the Cabinet. I want to add this: By doing this the hon. the Prime Minister demonstrated a greater measure of goodwill towards the English-speaking people than any Prime Minister has ever demonstrated towards any group in South Africa in the history of this country and we are enjoying the fruits of that gesture to-day. This entire attack against the hon. the Ministers of Labour and Information is simply the less tasteful manifestation of a childish, spiteful and pathetic attempt on the part of the Opposition to drive a wedge between ourselves and the English-speaking people. Because they have not succeeded in doing this they have now developed a new technique and that is to try and belittle every single English speaking person who comes over to our side in the most spiteful and caustic and unpleasant manner possible. This is what the hon. member for Yeoville was guilty of doing last Sautrday. He made the most spiteful and the most distasteful attack on the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Information. He said that the fact that the hon. the Prime Minister had appointed them to the Cabinet was an insult to the English-speaking people of South Africa. And he is the man who complained to me in the Lobby because I called him weak-kneed; he accused me of being much too personal.</p>

<p>He said that I was far too personal. Then he had the effrontery to say that it was an insult to the English-speaking people of South Africa to appoint Messrs. Trollip and Waring to the Cabinet! Let us see whether this is such an insult to the English-speaking section of the people. What was Mr. Waring&#x2019;s position in that party? He occupied a leading position. They made him the Whip for the Transvaal. It is their policy to make a Whip of a person who is an insult to the English-speaking people of this country? Let us take the case of Mr. Trollip. It is an insult to the English-speaking people to appoint Mr. Trollip to the Cabinet! What was his position in their party? He was the chairman of their caucus. Do they appoint a person who is an insult to the English-speaking people in the country, to be the leader of their caucus? Is their present Chairman, Mr. Piet van der Byl, an insult to the English-speaking people of South Africa? Not only did they appoint Mr. Trollip as chairman of their caucus but they elected him unanimously as Deputy Speaker of this House. Was he then an insult to the English-speaking people? No, Mr. Speaker, then they regarded him as a man of stature; then they elected him unanimously to the highest positions in their party. But now that he is a member of the Nationalist Party he is an insult to the English-speaking people! <span class="col_8129-8130" refersTo="page_0399"/>Then the hon. member for Yeoville takes it upon himself to make an attack upon the competency of the hon. the Minister of Information in the most spiteful and unpleasant manner possible. You know, Mr. Speaker, I gain the impression that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is one of those people who just cannot carry on a debate in a decent way because as soon sa he finds himself in difficulty, he starts drawing conclusions which are extremely distasteful.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has made an attack upon the competency of the hon. the Minister of Information. Mr. Speaker, I do not say that the hon. the Minister of Information is the most competent person in the world. There are people who are more competent than he is; who are more competent than I; who are more competent than the hon. member for Yeoville. But when one makes an attack upon the competency of somebody else, one must at least be sure that one is more competent than that person is. Let us compare the hon. the Minister of Information with the hon. member for Yeoville. Mr. Frank Waring is a very successful businessman; he belongs of one of the oldest trading families on the Witwatersrand; he belongs to one of the largest wheat-dealing families. His family and his father built up a successful business and he has made an even greater success of it. I have not yet heard that the hon. member for Yeoville has made a success in the business world. He and I had one attempt at starting a business but within six months that business was bankrupt. It was my fault that the business went bankrupt but the hon. member was very little help. Let us take journalism. The hon. member for Yeoville was a journalist as I was&#x2014;below average. He did not make a great success of journalism either. He was an advocate with a B.A. LL.B, degree. But he did not start a practice so one cannot judge how successful he would have been. He was in politics. I shall tell him just now how much success he achieved in this regard. Take the question of sporting ability. The hon. the Minister of Information reached the highest rung of the sporting ladder; he was a Springbok. He progressed as far as any man can go in that sphere. What are the achievements of the hon. member for Yeoville in that sphere? In the days when we played snooker together I used to give him such a thrashing that eventually I had to give him three black balls. But I say, give honour where honour is due. I hear he was the best marble player at Steynsburg [Interjections.] The hon. member here says that he was not. So he did not make a wonderful success of journalism and he did not shine in the sporting sphere, except as far as marble playing is concerned and now this hon. member has denied even that! We now come to the political sphere. The hon. the Minister of Information has achieved much success in the political sphere. He has been a Member of Parliament for a long time and to-day he is a member of the Cabinet. What has that hon. member achieved in the political sphere? He has led his party from one disaster to the other. He flees from one constituency to the other. That is the success that he has achieved.</p>

<p>I just want to say this to hon. members opposite: The more they berate Messrs. Waring and Trollip, the closer they drive these people to us. I say to-day with the greatest conviction that those two gentlemen are two of the best loved and most highly respected members of the National Party. The Opposition make me think of an old spinster who has her last chance to marry and is then spurned by her prospective husband. She is embittered; she gossips about men and she makes a nuisance of herself. The United Party are also losing their last chance&#x2014;the English-speaking people in South Africa. We are making a breakthrough and neither their gossip nor their spinterish attitude will prevent our making that break-through. All they do is humiliate themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is another matter I have promised to deal with. This is in connection with Mr. Victor Norton of the <i>Cape Times.</i>In the debate on the Interior Vote when the report of the Press Commission was being discussed, I said that the Press Commission had found that Mr. Victor Norton had sent lies out of South Africa and that he had transmitted those lies about South Africa in times of crisis. The <i>Cape Times</i> then directed my attention to the fact that this was not the case&#x2014;that the Press Commission had not found him guilty of &#x201C;very poor&#x201D; reporting, but only of &#x201C;poor&#x201D; reporting. I immediately published an apology in the <i>Cape Times.</i> I withdrew my accusation and undertook to do the same thing in this House at the first available opportunity. I want to say here quite unconditionally that the Press Commission did not find Mr. Victor Norton guilty of having sent lies out of the country or of having published lies. I want unconditionally to withdraw that remark and I apologize unconditionally in this regard. And with this my debt to Mr. Victor Norton is fully discharged. Now I want to know when he is going to discharge his debt to me. I want to know when he is going to discharge his debt to his own readers and to the people of South Africa. I accused Mr. Victor Norton in the columns of his own newspaper of publishing lies, of writing those lies himself and of publishing lies well knowing them to be lies. I challenged him to take these reports to three ex-Judges for their opinion. I want to know when he is going to discharge his debt to me. I say to-day in this House&#x2014;and I am prepared to say it without the benefit of parliamentary privilege&#x2014;that he is too much of a coward to accept my challenge because he knows that he published lies and he knows that he allowed lies to be published well knowing them to be lies. But this is not his weakness only; it is also the weakness of a large section of the English-medium Press.</p>

<from><span class="col_8131-8132" refersTo="page_0400"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>I shall say it outside this House with the greatest of pleasure. I have already said it. I go further: I say that this is the big weakness of the entire English-medium Press because the report of the Press Commission is a document condemning certain senior journalists in South Africa. It makes the most scathing attacks against certain senior journalists. It accuses them, amongst other things, of having sent lies out of the country and of having transmitted those during a time of crisis. This is what they say of one senior journalist in Johannesburg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He purposely distorted news sent overseas.</block>

<p>They say the following of another senior journalist in Johannesburg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">His reporting was dishonest; he did not report about South Africa but against South Africa.</block>

<p>Of another senior journalist in Johannesburg they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">His reports about Sharpeville were vicious and dishonest.</block>

<p>Of yet another senior journalist in Johannesburg they have this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He did not worry about the truth but only to create a bad image of the Whites in South Africa.</block>

<p>And up to this stage not one single editor of an English-medium newspaper has written a leading article either to deny these things or to say that he is sorry that it has happened or to say that it will not happen again in the future. And not one single member of that party has done so either. Not one single member of any board of directors of those companies has denied these things or said that this will not happen again or expressed sorrow in this regard. This is in complete conformity with the attitude of those people and the attitude of their party. I readily admit that over the past years the English-medium Press has moderated its language considerably but it has not done so with any good motives; it has moderated its language because it has suited the English-medium Press to do so. That is precisely the attitude adopted by the United Party. When it pays them, when they think that there is anything to gain, they are the most spiteful enemies of this country. Then we are a police state and then we are this or that! But when they think that matters are starting to improve they calm down and, just as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did the other day, they say that we are not a police state and that there is complete freedom of the Press in South Africa. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said this I warned the hon. the Minister of Justice. I told him not to expect anything of those hon. members; I said that if trouble arose and they thought that that trouble was worthwhile exploiting in an effort to bring about the fall of this Government, they would do so. When I said this, Mr. Speaker, I did not expect the hon. member for Yeoville to repudiate his leader within 48 hours! The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that South Africa was not a police state but 48 hours later, when there were demonstrations in England in regard to the Rivonia case, when hon. members opposite thought that a crisis was arising which they could make use of to bring about the fall of this Government, the hon. member for Yeoville said that there were 1,000 and more political prisoners in South Africa.</p>

<p>I am excluding Rivonia; I am speaking of these 1,000 people. Does the hon. member for Yeoville want to tell me that those people are in jail for political reasons? If a person is put in jail for political reasons what is he doing out of jail? Mention to me the name of any one person who is at present in jail for so-called political reasons. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) had this to say in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of yesterday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have no sympathy with saboteurs, underground organizations or any attempt to change the Government by unconstitutional means.</block>

<p>These are the only people who are in gaol. They are the people who commit acts of sabotage, people who belong to underground movements, people who want to bring about the downfall of the Government by unconstitutional means. Are these political prisoners in the opinion of the hon. member for Yeoville? Are these people in gaol for any political reasons or is it because they have committed the usual run of crimes? He will not reply, Sir. I want to put this question to the hon. member for Yeoville: Where else but in a police state are people put in gaol for political reasons? Will he answer me? The prosecutor in the Rivonia case, Dr. Yutar, had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Here we had a case of high treason <i>par excellence,</i> a classic case of the intended overthrow of the Government by force and violence with military assistance from foreign countries.</block>

<p><span class="col_8133-8134" refersTo="page_0401"/>The hon. member for Yeoville wants to know why they were not charged with high treason. He does not condemn these people; he says that they are in gaol for political reasons.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<p>The hon. member cannot get away from it. All the other people are in gaol either because they are guilty of committing acts of sabotage, because they belong to subversive organizations or because they want to cause the downfall of this Government by unlawful means. And these, so the hon. member says, are political crimes. He then asked: Why are there 1,000 people in gaol for political crimes? He said it was because those people have legitimate grievances; because they have no representation in this House! In other words, he is taking the part of those people; he tells them that they are martyrs, who are fighting for a just cause; they are freedom fighters. This is exactly the same language used by De Blank; precisely the same terms are used by our enemies overseas. The hon. member for Yeoville knows that when the Bantu had representatives in this House we had more disturbances in this country than ever before.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>That is untrue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Untrue! From 1946 there were no fewer than 41 disturbances in this country. Between 12 and 16 August 1946 73,000 Bantu took part in strikes. During that period alone 1,248 were injured and no fewer than 11 were killed. And that was when they had representatives in this House! There were 41 cases of strikes, of bloodshed and of injuries when the Bantu had representatives in this House. Now those people are made out to be freedom fighters, to be heroes, to be people who are fighting for their rights, people who are fighting against this tyrannical Government. They are political prisoners, according to the hon. member for Yeoville, who have no other alternative. All they can do is to commit acts of sabotage! All they can do is to import weapons, to make Molotov-cocktails and landmines. That is all they can do; that is their only possible solution to the problem! But I understand that story. It will also disappear, because these demonstrations against South Africa have failed so miserably. Tomorrow or the day after hon. members opposite will say that this is not a police state. They will only say this until our enemies abroad are again on the warpath. What did the hon. member for Yeoville do on Saturday when he thought that the demonstrations in London were going to prove to be a success? He thought that those demonstrations in London could bring about the fall of this Government, so he said there were 1,000 political prisoners in the gaols in South Africa, and that they were there because of a just ideology.</p>

<p>When he said this he was speaking the language of the Reeves&#x2019; and the Collins&#x2019; and all the enemies of South Africa. At that time the enemies of South Africa were marching against us; De Blank was marching again; at that time the Collins&#x2019; and the Reeves&#x2019; and all the enemies of South Africa were marching against South Africa in London. Then the hon. member for Yeoville thought that he should beat the drum for them; he had to play march music for them; he had to tell them why they were marching. He said: There are political prisoners here, prisoners who can only come into their own in this way.</p>

<p>Then they tell the Western world: Put us in power and we will eliminate all the objections of the Mandelas and the Susulus and the Sobukwes; we will give them everything to make them satisfied. They say this to the outside world, but they do not say it to the people in this country. But there is one careless member in their ranks. They have one member in their ranks who every now and again blurts out their secrets. I am referring to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). He told the students at the University of Stellenbosch what the policy of his party was. This report appeared in <i>Die Sweep</i> of June 1964&#x2014;this is a Stellenbosch University paper. I quote (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moreover, Mr. Basson said, the United Party stands for a &#x201C;system of natural relations&#x201D; and not compulsory intergration as some people contend.<br/>Mr. Basson also said that if one wants to see a realistic example of the United Party&#x2019;s policy one must go to Lourengo Marques.</block>

<p>It is a tragedy that this houonrable House should have had to listen to the tirade to which we have just had to listen. I can do no better than to quote the words of one of the member&#x2019;s own colleagues who, referring to the hon. member for Vereeniging, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For some time I have been waiting for the hon. member to stand up, frothing at the mouth, and rant and bluster in the House in his characteristic manner.</block>

<p>That was such an accurate description that the member who said it, the then member for Groblersdal, Mr. Hans Abraham, was promoted to Commissioner-General as a reward for his accurate description of that hon. member. And the hon. member for Vereeniging himself had a few views about his own colleagues, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then the wreckers got busy, the political agitators got busy, trouble-makers from the other side got busy, those people who believe it is far more important to score a political debating point than to solve a problem, those people who believe that all you have to do is to try to pin something false on the United Party and everything will be safe.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there was anybody trying to pin something false on the United Party, it was that hon. member this afternoon. No worse attempt to pin false allegations on the United Party have I ever witnessed. This hon. member who attacked Nusas, does he deny that he, when he was a student at Stellenbosch, was a member of the same group with Sam Kahn and other communists? He asked who the political prisoners are. I will tell him. They are the people with whom he associated and for whom he argued and debated when he was a student at the university. If anybody knows how irresponsible a student can be then he should know after having been a socialist and a colleague and supporter of Marxists. The hon. member himself said in this very Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An individual who is a communist because he has read Karl Marx is no danger to this country. As far as I am concerned, he can be left undisturbed and allowed to sit in Parliament.</block>

<p>That was the hon. member for Vereeniging. He wanted communists in Parliament, Mr. Speaker. He supported them in the student Nusas parliament. But that is not all. After he left university he joined the Cape Parliamentary Debating Society in 1937. And whom did he support? The Socialists. He was a Socialist. He was leftist. And that is the hon. member who makes tirades against this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member then went on&#x2014;he was so jealous of the wreckers and agitators whom he envied on that side of the House that he joined them. He could not resist joining the National Party. The temptation was too great. And that hon. member this afternoon again, despite the denials from this side of the House, the clear and unequivocal denials, tried to make out that this side of the House had said that South Africa was a police state. I would have thought that after what that hon. member did the other day, he would have kept very quiet about this. That hon. member got up and quoted from Hansard, accused the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) of stating that South Africa was a police state, and he read this from Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The powers herein contained without an explanation can lead all sensible men to no other conclusion but that South Africa has become in effect a police state.</block>

<p>There he stopped. And the next words, not the next paragraph, but the next words, the very next words were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are we a police state? I do not believe it. That hon. member who talks of distortions of the truth, of suppressing the truth and of lies, himself suppressed from a quotation to this House the vital words from that quotation. And then he has the nerve to talk of distortions and lies! That hon. member who only last week accused the Nationalist Press of distorting.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Well that was published in regard to a speech to the Institute of Citizenship. The hon. member wants to run away from that. He denies it. But that hon. member who has made so much fuss about distortions and lies should remember his own words again in this House, when he said to one of the present Government members&#x2014;</p>

<p>He should know that you can sell practically everything in this world, but there is one thing you cannot sell, you cannot sell an untruth, you cannot sell a stone and tell people it is a bit of soap. If he does that, his business will soon go bankrupt.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member at that stage was sincere. He believed that you could not sell an untruth. To-day he accuses the press of South Africa of having sold untruths to the world and those untruths having been bought by the world, when he himself was the man who said that you cannot sell untruths. Now he blames the whole troubles of South Africa on us. I think that is the last hon. member who should come to this House and try to tell this House about false reporting, false news, suppression of truths, distortion of the truth. Why does he get up here and make that sort of attack, the bitter, personal attack which he made, instead of trying to defend the policies of the Government? The reason is that he cannot defend the policies of this Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member talked of the hon. member for Yeoville as a journalist. Let me say that the hon. member for Yeoville never wrote any pornography or published pornography. I suggest that we leave that sort of personal attack out of this sort of debate. We are dealing here with the Government and with the failures and weaknesses of the Government.</p>

<p>There is one other remark which the hon. member for Vereeniging made to which I want to refer, and that was his sour grape reference to the Ministers of Information and of Immigration. We understand that it is a touchy subject for the hon. member for Vereeniging. We don&#x2019;t blame him. Nobody likes to be so close and then see the fruits plucked from under his nose. But I want to point out what the hon. member himself said about these two Cabinet Ministers. He told this House this afternoon in so many words that they were appointed as a gesture of goodwill to the English. Not because of their ability, but as a gesture of goodwill to the English! Let me tell the hon. member firstly that the English of South Africa don&#x2019;t regard themselves as a separate apartheid section, as that hon. member appears to do and as the Government appears to do. We regard ourselves as South Africans, first, second and only, not as a section of South Africans, not as a language group. We are South Africans and we are the true South Africans, because we deny that distinction based upon language. And we don&#x2019;t need this Government to come with any gestures to the English-speaking people, gestures to a section of the people. The next thing we are going to hear is the Government coming along with a separate voters&#x2019; roll for the English. Is that what we are going to get? Sir, the English-speaking people are an essential part of the body politic of South Africa, and when we get Cabinet Ministers who speak English in South Africa they will be there because of their ability and not as &#x201C;a gesture of goodwill&#x201D; on the part of any government or any Prime Minister. The hon. member then, on the basis of this gesture of goodwill, appeals to the English-speaking people to support the Government. A few days ago we learned that their own propagandist of the S.A.B.C., Ivor Benson, resigned from the Nationalist Party because there was no place in it for his feelings in regard to English-speaking people. Two weeks before that Stirton resigned from the Nationalist Party&#x2014;for the same reason?</p>

<p>There we have examples not in the distant past, not people who are offered high positions in order to change parties, but people who have left the Government party and who have left the possible fruits of loyal support to the Government party. They are people who have left because of their honest convictions and who have said that there is no place for an English-speaking person in the Nationalist Party. And that hon. member a few days later comes and appeals to this House. I say to him again that South Africans, whether they speak English or Afrikaans, in the United Party, are South Africans, and we will have no appeals made to us on the basis of emotional sectionalism or a langauge. We will play our part in South Africa as South Africans, as we have always done in the past. If the hon. member wants an example of how that has worked in South Africa, he merely have to look back to the rich years when the English- and the Afrikaans-speaking people did not ask each other what language they spoke but worked and fought together in the interests of South Africa, through the bitter years of war, and proved in those years that they were and could be true South Africans.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am not referring to the hon. member for Edenvale. You always get an exception.</p>

<p>I said that the hon. member for Vereeniging had been forced to come into this debate, because the Government had to have a distraction from the charges which this side of the House has made. Speaker after speaker from this side of the House has laid charges at the door of the Government, and in a day-and-a-half of debate we have had no real reply from any member on that side. We have had the sort of speech to which we have just listened to distract attention, but the real charges of this side of the House remain unanswered. The hon. member for Yeoville accused the Government of incompetence, inadequacy, and shortsightedness, and speaker after speaker from this side has substantiated those charges. We have not heard from any of the Ministers of Agriculture. We had the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs trying to defend the Ministers of Agriculture. He was the speaker on agriculture. We have had a few other speakers telling the country how rosy everything in Agriculture is. Let them go back and tell the public that everything in the garden is rosy, <span class="col_8139-8140" refersTo="page_0404"/>that the farmers are living in a Utopia. That is all they can say. Not one of them could come with a constructive suggestion, with a constructive idea, nor reply to the constructive ideas from this side of the House. Then we came to economic affairs. We challenged the Government on their lack of an economic policy. The Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs said &#x201C;Of course I have got a policy&#x201D;. We said &#x201C;for Bantu areas?&#x201D;, and he said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. But when we challenged him on everything else, silence! Except a few figures of buildings in Johannesburg, which prove the case beyond any doubt made by the hon. member for Jeppes that the only prosperity and progress taking place in South Africa to-day is taking place where the policy of the Government is not in fact being carried out, where apartheid is not being applied, where more and more Bantu are being taken into industry. There you are getting progress. But where the Government&#x2019;s policy is being applied in practice, there you have no progress at all.</p>

<p>What have we heard from the Government? Not a word. Not a speaker who can deny that incontrovertible argument that the only progress there is in South Africa to-day is despite and not because of the policies of the Government. Not one has been able to stand up and deny that South Africa is dependent, as the hon. member for Jeppes proved, out of 87,000 new workers every year, on the Bantu as far as 55,000 of them are concerned, 55,000 new Bantu hands in the industry of South Africa each year. That is far too cold and hard a fact for them to face. It is a fact which they cannot face because it is the condemnation, the utter and total condemnation of the policy for which they claim to stand.</p>

<p>Then we had the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) who made some challenging statements. What did we have in reply? No reply to the hard realities which he put before this House. He made the point that the Prime Minister had changed his policy because of pressures and changes which had come about. I want to take that argument further. I want to say that having embarked on the Transkeian policy, the Government has abandoned control of the progress and rate of development towards total independence. The Government has claimed that it is following the policies of Africa, the policies of releasing areas and countries and nations to independence. But not one member of the Government, from the Prime Minister downwards, has told South Africa how he will be different from every other metropolitan country which once it had started colonies on the road of self-government, lost control of the rate of development towards self-government and ultimate independence. It has happened in every state. Does the Government believe that Britain and France and Belgium wanted to hand over those countries and give them total independence when they did? Or were they forced to do so because of pressures which they could not resist? But now this Government with its eyes open has embarked on the same road, and no member has tried to tell us how they will resist the fate which befell the other countries who embarked on that road in the rest of Africa. They have also not told us, Mr. Speaker, their intentions in regard to the consolidation of the other Bantustans, and this question is one which they have got to answer before they can hold their policy up as a realistic policy for South Africa. Do they believe that you have non-contiguous, scattered areas under an independent government divorced from the Government of South Africa &#x2014;that you can have a spot here and a spot there, separated by White territories, governing themselves under one Parliament, free and independent of the control of South Africa? Because unless they are prepared to say that is their policy, they have got to face the fact that they have got to consolidate those areas. I think for instance of an area like Umzimkulu, separated geographically from the Transkei. When the Transkei obtains independence at a rate which this Government cannot control, is Umzimkulu then going to be part of the Transkei, divorced physically from that territory and governed from Umtata. But I think more particularly of Zululand, with its multiplicity of separate areas, the result of the Shepstone gridiron policy, areas separated from each other by interwoven White areas. Are those areas to achieve ultimate independence in that separated state, or are they to be consolidated? That is a question which this Government has got to answer before it has any right to claim that it has a policy for South Africa. If the answer is that they are to be separate and not consolidated, then their whole plan becomes a mockery. If the answer is that those areas are to be consolidated, then they owe South Africa an answer of where and how that consolidation is to take place. Only a week or two ago in the Senate the hon. the Prime Minister admitted that there would have to be changes to the boundaries of South Africa. He admitted that there would have to be consolidation. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie aanpassinge geld dit wat ons reeds van weet, dit geld oopgestelde gebiede, dit geld swart kolle, dit geld wit kolle, en dit geld hierdie vorm van aanpassing te midde van byeenbring, en alles is ons reeds mee bekend.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Te midde van byeenbring&#x201D;. In other words, the Prime Minister says that there must be a consolidation. The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) confirms it. When? But more important where, and how? Where and how is that consolidation to take place?</p>

It is a simple question: Will all the Bantu areas of Zululand when they achieve their independence be contiguous? Let me ask the hon. Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Development: When Zululand achieves its independence as a Zulustan, will Zululand be a scattered clump: of separate states and areas, or will it be a solid consolidated block? There is no answer, because the Government dare not answer that question.</p>

All we will get is that it will be a gradual policy of development. The hon. Minister knows that he cannot answer the question. He has spoken already, but he can give the reply by way of an interjection quite easily: Is it going to be a consolidated block, one contiguous area, becoming independent, or is it going to be &#x201C;stukkies en brokkies&#x201D; scattered all over Natal? They cannot answer that question and they will not answer, because if their policy is sincere and genuine then the answer must be &#x201C;consolidation&#x201D;. It cannot be otherwise.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has launched a very bitter attack on the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. Coetzee) in connection with the allegation that we had a police state. I wish to read two quotations from that same debate, one which the hon. member did not read in full and the other being one which has not been quoted in this debate at all. The one is what Mr. Hamilton Russell has said, Mr. Russell, who was a front-bencher of the United Party last year. He made this statement as Leader of the United Party during that debate because he was the main United Party speaker on that side of the House. On that occasion Mr. Hamilton Russell said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The words I have just read out mean to me tyranny and despotism. It says in simple language that South Africa will be a police state as it will indeed be if this clause were accepted.</block>

<speech by="#foreman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FOREMAN</person>:</from>

<p>He said it in the debate last year as the main speaker of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) then read out Another quotation in connection with which he said it was a disgrace that the hon. member for Vereeniging had not quoted it fully. I want to quote more fully than he did from what the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) said. The hon. member only quoted as far as the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the matters which they are very sensitive about in this House, as a matter of fact one of the surest ways of arousing the anger of the Minister and that of any other hon. member on that side of the House, is the very allegation that South Africa is a police state.</block>

<p>He says the hon. member for Vereeniging only read as far as that and he wanted to read further. So he read the following</p>

<block name="quote">I am not going to say South Africa is a police state.</block>

<p>But the hon. member stopped there. What did the hon. member for Hospital say further? He said this</p>

<block name="quote">But I want the hon. the Minister to explain to me what the difference is between a police state and a state in which a policeman, a lieutenant, can pick up anyone in the street and say &#x201C;Come with me&#x201D;?</block>

<p>That was what the hon. member said. These two quotations alone are sufficient proof that the United Party have continually in the past gone around with this story of a police state. I remember how it started in those distant days of Mr. Strauss. He was the first one who started it in this House and since then we have had this story of a police state year after year.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words in connection with the &#x201C;gesture of goodwill to the English&#x201D; in the appointment of Ministers Waring and Trollip. The hon. member suggests that the hon. member for Vereeniging insinuated that that was the only merit which justified their appointment. I want to tell him that they were appointed on their own merit. I want to remind the hon. member that Minister Trollip, for example, was one of the best Administrators Natal has ever had and that aopointment was made by the National Party. He showed what he had in him and he was then included in the Cabinet. I can refer the hon. member to a long list of articles which appeared in the English daily newspapers in those days in which they insisted that the Prime Minister should prove his <i>bona fides</i> if he alleged that he aimed at unity between Afrikaans-sneaking and English-speaking in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_8143-8144" refersTo="page_0406"/>There were a series of long articles in which it was demanded that he should show his <i>bone tides</i> by taking an English-speaking person into his Cabinet.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made an allegation in connection with our Transkei policy, our Bantustan policy. I want to reply to that briefly. He says we have not yet shown that this policy we are now introducing into South Africa differs in any way from the policy being carried out in Kenya and in other northern states of Africa. He asks what proof we have that the same thing will not happen here as is happening there. That was the gravamen of his charge. I want to reply to it in this way: In the first place we follow a policy of separate development and under that policy they get self-government and not immediate independence. They are being trained to govern themselves properly. In this connection I wish to quote what Kaiser Matanzima stated in the Transkei Parliament when he introduced his Budget. He set out his policy as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wholehearted support of the policy of separate development which is the only policy under which the various races in South Africa could live next to one another in peace and harmony.</block>

<p>I want to ask him whether Kenneth Kuanda, or any of the leaders there, is a wholehearted supporter of separate development in Rhodesia? How can he make such an allegation? Surely he knows that is not true. Surely he knows what he is dishing up here and presenting to the people is false.</p>

<p>I want to quote further from the speech made by Matanzima on that occasion. He also said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The traditional system of having chiefs will be preserved and the future state will be built on the firm foundations of the Bantu&#x2019;s own cultural heritage and traditions, enriched as they have been by the ideals of Western civilization and democracy.</block>

<p>I ask him whether there is any Bantu leader in the northern states who subscribes to that policy? He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The aim will be to establish a state in the Transkei which will be based on law and order, a state in which the dignity of the individual will be recognized. That will mean equal justice to everyone.</block>

<p>On that basis we have every right to expect our policy to succeed in the Transkei.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to Zululand and asked whether all the areas of Zululand would form one bloc once they got independence. We have never yet alleged that they will form one bloc, but we have said that the large areas will be consolidated. The Zulu state, which will be established, may consist of one or two or three blocs. We do not know yet and we cannot say at this stage. The Prime Minister very clearly stated that for the purposes of such a Bantu state it would not necessarily have to consist of one single bloc, because Pakistan did not consist of one block but of two. In regard to our policy of consolidation, therefore, we have never yet alleged that before the Zulus get their state it will have to be one solid bloc. The Transkef is not a solid bloc to-day. Umzimkulu is separate. What is the hon. member trying to achieve by representing our policy in this distorted way?</p>

<p>Will it remain separate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#foreman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FOREMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I can only say that the Prime Minister was also very clear on that point because he said the time would arrive when there would be a process of exchange of areas in the White state and in the Bantu state when the latter was fully mature and in a position to negotiate with us on that question.</p>

<p>I really want to come to another matter, namely the allegation made by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) and his attack on the Government with reference to the Rivonia case. He said the following and I want to read it from Hansard so that there can be no doubt about it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Owing to the fact that this Government is denying a political outlet in the Assembly through limited representation to a large section of our people, and owing to the fact that opportunities for legitimate political expression have been removed, there is a growing tendency in South Africa for certain <span class="col_8145-8146" refersTo="page_0407"/>political expression to find illegal outlets, and the only way in which the Minister of Justice can contain the situation in South Africa is by putting more and more people in gaol. We cannot deny that one of the fundamental causes of the difficult situation in which the Department of Justice and the police find themselves is that we have a policy which is fundamentally unjust.</block>

<p>In reply to that the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) said the hon. member for Yeoville had without any doubt referred to the judgment in the Rivonia trial. The hon. member for Yeoville did not deny it. On the contrary when the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) went further and said he wanted to point out that the judge had said they were indeed guilty of high treason, the hon. member for Yeoville asked why they had not been charged with high treason. It is very clear from what happened in the House that the hon. member for Yeoville was referring to the Rivonia trial when he made the allegation that the policy of the Government was one of the &#x201C;fundamental causes&#x201D; why those persons were charged. I can only draw one conclusion from that. In passing I just want to say that hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) referred this morning to what was said over the radio in that connection and that it was suggested that the hon. member for Yeoville had sided with the offenders in the Rivonia trial. As a matter of fact they did not say that because here I have an explanation of that broadcast and they did not say that. I maintain that because of the fact that when the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) said the hon. member for Yeoville had obviously referred to the Rivonia trial and he had asked by way of interjection why they had not been charged with high treason, he did indeed have those people in mind and I can only draw one conclusion from that and it is this that the hon. member for Yeoville who spoke for and on behalf of the Opposition, justifies the actions of the accused in the Rivonia trial and blames the Government for those actions.</p>

<p>Of course he does not stand alone in this matter. We have all the Leftists and those vociferous organization in Britain who have embarked on a strenous campaign in this connection; they even want to submit the matter to UNO. The hon. member for Yeoville must remember that in having made that statement he now finds himself in the company of every member of the Communist Party in every country in the world.</p>

<p>But that is not really the reason why I want to deal further with this matter. I really want to deal with it because this accusation is also made in the London <i>Times</i> which is a very influential newspaper. I do think, however, that the untruthfulness and the hollowness of this allegation should be exposed and that it should be pointed out that what the London <i>Times</i>says and what the hon. member for Yeoville says by implication is absolutely devoid of any truth. The London <i>Times</i> makes the following anti-Semitic.</p>

<block name="quote">The verdict of history will be that the ultimate guilty party is the Government in power, and that already is the verdict of world opinion&#x2026; Evil laws breed disorder.</block>

<p>I think the London <i>Times</i> has committed a ghastly outrage because I want to remind it that the Judge said the following in his judgment. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The crime of which the accused have been found guilty&#x2014;that is the main charge, conspiracy&#x2014;in essence high treason.</block>

<p>He then said they had not been charged with that but with something else. I now want to bring to the notice of the London <i>Times</i> and others who think like it that the legal system of South Africa is based on Roman Dutch law and that the crime of high treason has its origin in Roman law, a law which operated two milleniums before this Government came into power in South Africa. The crime of high treason is as old as Western civilization in Europe. I want to remind the London <i>Times</i>and all those who think like it that the accused were accused of the following: Firstly, that they tried by means of revolution to overthrow the lawful government and that 192 acts of violence were concerned in that, acts of violence which are described as sabotage in modern language; secondly, that the accused took a part inside and outside South Africa in training people in the military field in order to overthrow the lawful government in South Africa; thirdly, that the accused had promoted the aims of Communism in South Africa and lastly, that the accused had received assistance inside and outside South Africa in order to promote the aforementioned acts. It is abundantly clear from the charge sheet that not a single law passed by the present Government is concerned in those charges, I want to know from the London <i>Times</i> to which &#x201C;evil laws&#x201D; it is referring. The only one it can refer to is that governing high treason and let me remind the London <i>Times</i> that the British definition of high treason is practically the same as the South African and also the American definition.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why they were not charged with high treason as such. That rests with the prosecutor himself. He knew there was a high treason case a few years ago and in view of the experienced gained on that occasion he probably thought it would be easier to charge them specifically with these crimes, crimes which were in essence similar to high treason, as the Judge said. I want to know what connection there can be between the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development and these crimes? I say emphatically that there is no connection whatsoever. I want to assure the London <i>Times</i> and the world in general as well as the hon. member for Yeoville that it is not the intention of South Africa to capitulate to <span class="col_8147-8148" refersTo="page_0408"/>the wicked influence of the Communists under the pretence that concessions are made to Black nationalism, as other European powers have capitulated to Communism and in this connection I wish to mention Zanzibar, Tanyanika, the Congo, Ghana and Algeria. [Interjections.] They condemned the policy of separate development in those countries and there they left the Whites in the lurch; they did not capitulate to Black nationalism but to Communism.</p>

<p>To condemn South Africa&#x2019;s actions against revolutionary powers and Communism by trying to link that to the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development may make an impression on the Afro-Asiatic countries, those countries the world is so ardently courting, but it will not make any impression on the citizens of South Africa, White and Black, because the Whites and non-Whites in S.A. stand shoulder to shoulder in their stand that we shall fight with equal force any force which tries, either from inside or from outside South Africa, to undermine the lawful authority in this country. I say Black and White because I again want to quote Kaiser Matanzima in this connection. He recently said the following in a speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tembuland regiments will stand side by side with regiments from the Republic to the last drop of blood. Communism is based on revolution, because they believe in riots, revolutions and the shedding of blood to attain their ends. There is no freedom under Communism.</block>

<p>And Matanzima represents at least 1,500,000 Xhosas but whom do Mandela and Sisulu and those other criminals represent? Matanzima and the other chiefs in South Africa who are well disposed towards the Government and its policy, represent 99.9 per cent of the Bantu in South Africa and these Communists who have made themselves guilty of the crime of violence do not even represent 5,000 or 1 per cent of the Bantu people. Sir, you may ask me why they are so dangerous if they represent so few people? They are dangerous because they are the spearhead of the Communism which is rolling towards us from the north and that is why they must be suppressed.</p>

<p>I wish to add that neither the Coloured community nor the Asiatics have never yet made themselves guilty of violence. That disposes of the charge sheet. I just want to draw attention to the accused in order to refute the allegation that legitimate grievances are supposed to have been the reason why these crimes were committed.</p>

<p>Who were the accused? Goldreich and Wolpe; those two got away; Hepple who turned Crown witness; Bernstein and Kantor who were found not guilty, one White person called Goldberg who was found guilty, and seven non-Whites who were found guilty. It is clear from the composition that they were not all Bantu but a mixed group of people. I do not want to refer to the fact that they were five Jews otherwise the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) will again accuse me of being anti-Semitic.</p>

<p>But I want to say this to him that I know these people are a disgrace to the Jewish community in South Africa and a disgrace to the whole of South Africa. I would rather hold out a man like Ike Greenberg as the true representative of the Jewish race in South Africa, a person who came to South Africa as a pauper, a man who started life here as a hawker and who died a rich man and who left his wealth to the country and the people he had come to love. I want to hold him out as representing the Jewish race in South Africa and not these criminals. I am sorry that Goldreich and Wolpe who were the leaders of this movement escaped because they were the people who actually incited the Bantu. I am sorry that the Bantu have allowed themselves to be misled by this type of Communist, these people who in their own interests have tried to exploit the Bantu. The fact that the real leaders are Whites gives the lie to the allegations that we had to have a Rivonia trial because of laws which supposedly made it impossible for the non-Whites of South Africa to find a political outlet. It gives the lie to the allegations made by the hon. member for Yeoville that it is because of the policy of the Government that we have had a Rivonia trial and that &#x201C;one of the fundamental causes was the Government&#x2019;s policy, which is fundamentally unjust&#x201D;. That statement is given the lie because of the fact that the real leaders were not Bantu. I wish to produce other facts as well to dispute this allegation of the hon. member for Yeoville that the non-Whites are deprived of all political rights, I wish to hold out the Transkei to him as an example.</p>

<p>The Bantu in the Transkei indeed have the opportunity of exercising political rights to the highest degree. The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) said this afternoon that we had not indicated to what extent the Bantu in the White areas would have self-expression there. The hon. member, of course, lives completely in a world of his own, and that is a world of ignorance because last year witnessed the enthusiasm with which they registered for the election in the Transkei. As a matter of fact, over 70 per cent voted. I think the figure was 77 per cent and a great number of those Bantu were in the White areas and not in the Transkei. What is more, meetings were indeed held in all these centres. He tried to create the impression that no meetings were held. The fact that five territorial authorities have been established for the Tswana, the North Sotho, the Venda, the Tsonga and for the Ciskei Bantu proves the extent of the co-operation we already get from the Bantu people in order to give them a political outlet. There is not a single Bantu tribe in South Africa which is not <span class="col_8149-8150" refersTo="page_0409"/>connected with a territorial authority and there are only a few tribes who do not have a tribal authority. Only during this Session we established representative councils for the Coloureds and Indians. Opportunities have been created everywhere for the non-White citizens of South Africa to find political expression. This allegation of the hon. member for Yeoville that &#x201C;there is no political outlet&#x201D; for the aspirations of the non-Whites is simply not true. On the contrary an increasing number of non-Whites are subscribing to the policy of separate development. The allegation that the Rivonia trial was the result of political frustration on the part of the non-Whites because they have no political rights, is devoid of all truth. The allegation that we had a Rivonia trial as a result of apartheid is so much nonsense. It is not often that I quote the <i>Sunday Times</i> with approval and it is perhaps with some malicious pleasure that I quote the mentor of the hon. member for Yeoville against him&#x2026;.</p>

<block name="quote">The conviction and sentences in the Rivonia trial were bound to create an uproar overseas, where the idea seems to exist that the accused were convicted for &#x201C;opposing apartheid&#x201D;. They are certainly opponents of apartheid, but that was not the charge brought against them. They were accused of criminal acts, they received what was manifestly a fair trial, and they were properly convicted and sentenced according to law &#x2026; The Rivonia verdict serves as a clear warning that the South African people will not tolerate sabotage, guerilla warfare, revolution or any other form of violence as a mehod of settling political disputes. Such activities will not win popular support, and those who seek to promote unrest and subversion must expect not only to be caught but to be severely dealt with according to law.

<p>After the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B.

<p>The hon. member did not mention the prosecutor, I did, I hope that when the hon the Minister replies to the debate, he will have the courage to do what has not been done by any of the Ministers on that side of the House when this matter was raised, and that is to repudiate the sentiments expressed by that hon. member. The only member who unashamedly feels like the hon. member for Heilbron is the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke); he was looking at him with admiration in his eyes.</p>

<p>But when the hon. member takes the hon. member for Yeoville to task for what he said in regard to the Rivonia trial, and other matters, and for saying that there is no outlet for these people, and when he says that the hon. member for Yeoville was wrong when he said that owing to the fact that this Government denies representation to these people, the Bantu express themselves more and more in illegal ways, it is fair to ask what are the other outlets to which the Bantu is entitled but those which the hon. member mentioned? He mentioned a Coloured Council. We had a long debate on that. What does it mean to the Coloured people? What sort of outlet is that for them of political expression? There will be a council for the Indians, which will also give them an outlet for expression, so he said, and there are the Bantu Authorities. But what representation is that of their views? Are those bodies going to have any real powers? Has the Coloured Council got any real powers, and will the Indian Council have real powers? When will they ever get representation here? But I want to tell the hon. member for Heilbron that the thing that frightened me most was the Press pictures of the people outside the court at the Rivonia trial, the pictures of those faces. It frightened me, because despite what happened in that court they were still prepared to fight for what they thought were their just deserts. If one wants any answer to the question of whether I am right or wrong in what I saw in those faces, there was the news this morning of another sabotage attempt, showing blatant defiance, as I read it. That was the answer to the hon. member for Heilbron. I condemn sabotage, but what are we going to do about sabotage? Are we going to pass more laws of the sort we have? Surely the experience we have had of all the laws is that we are not stamping it out, because the root cause of this has not been tackled. The root cause of this is Pan-Africanism.</p>

You cut off its head and it grows another one; you put its leaders in gaol and they produce new leaders; you take their legs off but they find some other means of perambulation.

<p>What has the Government done in 15 years to do anything about the root causes of this problem? It has removed the political expression which the Bantu had in this House. Why? Were the representatives of the Bantu in this House a danger to anyone. Did anyone ever suggest between the year 1936 and the year 1959 that the three Bantu representatives in this House were a danger to South Africa; that they were the beginning of the end for South Africa; that their presence here would lead to the whole of this House becoming flooded with Black members leading to a Black majority? Of course, no one ever suggested that then, and they were here for 23 years. That is the only contribution which the Government seems to have made, but the Government has made a greater contribution to PanAfricanism in its rampant form by its laws in this country than I think the Pan-Africanists could have done if they had had a free hand to do what they wanted in this country under a different Government.</p>

<p>Sir, what is the background to all these acts of sabotage? What is the background of Rivonia: what is the background of all these other trials we have had? It is Pan-Africanism. What is the background of the pressure which is being brought to bear upon South Africa outside our borders? In the lobbies of the United Nations, what is the pressure group? It is Pan-Africanism. And then, Sir, we have the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who has the impertinence to say that the United Party policy does not develop in the spirit of modern times! Sir, what is the spirit of modern times? What is the spirit of modern times in our part of the world, in Africa, in South Africa? Pan-Africanism.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I hope I have made a break-through to the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling), because I say it is the policy of this Government to encourage Pan-Africanism. The Government&#x2019;s laws produce a rampant, savage Pan-Africanism in South Africa. I say that the Government&#x2019;s laws have produced it. I go further and say that this rampant and savage Pan-Africanism has been created by the Government&#x2019;s repressive laws, by their nonsense laws, by their laws to remove the representatives of the Africans in this House, by their job reservation laws, by their laws to remove the security of the urban Bantu. But, Sir, I want to go further and show that the official policy of the Government as outlined by the hon. member who has just sat down, is giving active legal encouragement to Pan-Africanism in South Africa. The policy is aimed at separating the Bantu from the influence of the White man and from the influence of our civilization in this country. That is the object of that policy. Can anyone deny it?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am told that I am talking nonsense. I say that that is the object of the policy. The object is to drive them into another world. If I am wrong, why do we have a different education for the Bantu; why do we have Bantu Education; why do they not have our education, if this is not the object of this policy? Why do they have tribal colleges if this is not the object of this policy? Why do we have <i>lapas</i> instead of campuses, if this is not the object of this policy? Sir, in doing this the Government is actively encouraging African Nationalism. The hon. member will no doubt say that African Nationalism is only for African areas, but let us take those African areas; what are those areas? There is the Transkei. The Transkei is too weak economically to survive by itself; it must of necessity remain with us economically even though we are trying to drive them out, but Sir, there are other willing hands ready to help. The Pan-Africanism Movement of Africa will help them and help them very much, and the hon. member for Vereeniging knows that that is correct. He admits that <span class="col_8153-8154" refersTo="page_0411"/>this is a calculated risk that they are taking. Sir, what are the areas to which this policy in fact relate? It is the areas in which the Bantu are, and the areas in which there are most Bantu are the areas in which the White man lives, that is to say, the urban industrial areas of South Africa. That is where this policy is to be applied. Is anyone in this House going to deny that the two political parties which have developed in the Transkei are not going to become African nationalist organizations? Is anyone in this House going to deny that the party of the Chief Minister of the Transkei is not an African nationionalist party already?</p>

<p>A national independence party.,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, a national independence party. It is an African nationalist party, and if they become Pan-Africanists and if any African movement is to be regarded as part of a Pan-Africanist movement in the eyes of those who are pushing this movement to the north of us, what is the position going to be, then? Sir, that is what is happening in the Transkei. But, Sir, that does not worry me so much. What worries me particularly is that the people to whom this policy is being applied are the Bantu in the towns. Those Bantu in the towns have the protection of the laws of this Government, because in terms of the Transkei Constitution, not only are the voters for the Transkei in Cape Town and Durban and Johannesburg, but now they have a political party and that political party, whether it becomes Pan-Africanist or communist is going to have the right to go and talk and spread its propaganda amongst its members, the majority of whom are living outside the Transkei, the majority of whom are living in our urban areas. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to tell us what he is going to do about this; whether he is going to say that he is going to stop Pan-Africanism amongst these people; whether he is going to prohibit these parties from having a policy of Pan-Africanism, a policy of Africa for the Africans or a policy of Communism. I would like to know how on earth he is going to stop it, because the moment he tries to stop it the whole basis of his policy falls apart.</p>

<p>But, Sir, these things are happening now, in our urban areas; they are happening with these political parties at the present time, and if this situation is to remain then I hope the Government will be realistic about the other aspects of Bantu policy. Sir, nothing is more calculated to bring about the sort of situation in which we find ourselves to-day&#x2014;and it is a very parlous situation when you have a trial like the Rivonia trial and the next day, as an act of defiance, you get another act of sabotage&#x2014; when everyone is living in a sort of suspended fear of what the future may hold for us. I say that nothing is more calculated to bring about this sort of situation than the Government&#x2019;s present policy. Sir, the one danger to the White man in South Africa, as it seems to me at this moment, is the urban Bantu who are now being made rootless by this Government. They are the people amongst whom all the riots have taken place; they are the persons who have recruited all the saboteurs; they are the persons who have provided the members of the A.N.C. and Poqo and Night Club and all the other African nationalist organizations. They live here amongst us in the urban areas, and they live here amongst us in the urban areas not because this Government wishes it but because those are the hard, cold economic facts of South Africa. And what is this Government going to do about them? Is it going to prohibit Matanzima&#x2019;s party from spreading its propaganda amongst them; is it going to prohibit Poto&#x2019;s party from spreading propaganda amongst them, or for that matter any other Pan-Africanist or communist organization that arises in the Transkei and that wishes to propagate its policy in the urban areas? Because, Sir, if they do want to do that, they will find willing hands amongst the people in the urban areas. What has this Government done? It has stripped every single one of them of any security that they had. This Government must take full responsibility for it. The hon. the Minister of Housing made the most significant statement of the year in relation to the Bantu when he said that we must give people a feeling of security, which you can only do by giving them a settled, fixed, permanent family abode; and he read from a Russian newspaper which said that we (i.e. the communists) must try to destroy this bourgeois mentality which wants a home, which attaches far more importance to the individual and his home and his family than he attaches to his function as a unit in the State. In our urban areas this year this Government has deliberately destroyed the one thing with which we can fight Pan-Africanism.</p>

<p>I do not believe for one second that it would have been possible for the Government of the day to clear up and clean up Poqo and allied Pan-Africanist associations, as the hon. the Minister says he has done, were it not for the fact that the majority of the Bantu are law-abiding citizens. But I think we are entitled to ask ourselves how long this situation is likely to go on; how long can we expect it to go on if the Government is not prepared to do anything whatever about removing the root causes of the problem. The hon. member for Innesdale says, &#x201C;What sort of alternative do you have to prevent what happened at Rivonia?&#x201D; It is clear that the Government has no alternative but to pass more laws of this kind. Sir, that is not going to solve this problem. Is it going to hurt this Government to give these people homeownership; to allow them economic opportunities; to give them some hope for the future, even if they do another little jingle-jangle with their policy and say, &#x201C;Oh well, in terms of our policy in fact they have always been allowed to remain there&#x201D;. If they did that, which is <span class="col_8155-8156" refersTo="page_0412"/>not beyond the wit of the hon. the Prime Minister, they would be able to fight Pan-Africanism, but if they are not prepared to do that they are not going to succeed in fighting it. They must either abandon their policy in relation to the Transkei or they must abandon their policy in relation to the urban areas, but unfortunately the two go together. While on the one hand they say that the Bantu can have political rights in the Transkei, we find that via the backdoor they allow not only political rights but the worst form of rampant, savage Pan-Africanism in the urban areas on our backdoors, by courtesy of the Government, as a result of the passing of the Transkei Constitution Act. I think South Africa is entitled to ask how long we are going to have to put up with this. The hon. the Minister of Justice can say every day of his life that he has broken this organization or that organization, but the evidence indicates that every time he says something like that, another organization springs up. As long as this Government remains in power we will have that situation. The answer to the question is very simple. As long as we have this Government we will have sabotage: as long as we have a policy directed at curing the effects of something&#x2014;only the effects and not the cause &#x2014;so long will we have acts of sabotage.</p>

<p>When this debate started we thought hon. members opposite would talke about finances and that they would state their policy against ours. It is true that the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) did so to some extent. He hit to the left and the right as he went through the team but he came out at the other end without having achieved anything and immediately after that members of the Opposition turned their backs on financial matters and followed another direction. I now wish to come to the hon. member for Yeoville <span class="col_8157-8158" refersTo="page_0413"/>who followed that other direction. Such a great deal has been said about him to-day and so many explanations have been given that very little remains to be dealt with, but something does remain on which I wish to say a few words. When speaking about the Rivonia sentences the hon. member for Yeoville said he found no fault with them, but he went further and said: &#x201C;It is high time that we investigate the matter; I am convinced that the Government&#x2019;s policy is the cause.&#x201D; The hon. member attacked the Government because of its policy and said the policy of the Government was to blame. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has repeatedly said the same thing just now. Does the hon. member not agree with his own member? [Laughter.] The hon. member laughs but he knows that is the position. He said the cause of all the trouble was the policy of the Government. Every member on that side of the House has said that if this Government were thrown out, those difficulties would come to an end. They have said: &#x201C;We can only stop this trouble if we can remove this Government.&#x201D; Sir, whose language are they talking when they say that? That is the language of U Thant; the language they are speaking is the language of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman); they are speaking the language of the saboteur; they are speaking the language of Patrick Duncan and of Luthuli. Surely that is the language of Luthuli and Patrick Duncan. Is that the language of the Afrikaner? Are those the Afrikaners who tell us they will at all times fight for South Africa? Has the hon. member who has just spoken used the language of a South African? He said the Government was to blame for all the trouble. In other words, he did want to say it in so many words, but what he tried to convey was that what those people did they did as a result of the policy of this Government; that if this Government were not here there would not be a single communist in this country; that if this Government were not here not a single act of sabotage would have been committed in this country and there would not have been a Rivonia trial. Sir, do you know what they are saying to those people by implication? They are saying to them by implication: &#x201C;You are quite right: you are merely the political opponents of the Government; you are not saboteurs; you are not communists: you do not want to overthrow the Government of the country.&#x201D; That is the implication of what that hon. member has said.</p>

<p>Let us analyse for a moment what the hon. member for Yeoville has said. He said this Government has not done anything for those areas on the Rand where border industries cannot be established, and he attacked the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. Van den Berg). I used to live on the West Rand; I was born there and I grew up there. I still have a few small properties there. The hon. member must not tell us such nonsense in this House. The hon. the Minister has given us figures to prove what is happening on the West Rand. I do not want to repeat those figures because time does not permit me to do so but I just want to ask the hon. member whether he knows what is happening in the building sector on the West Rand, as a matter of fact, over the whole country. What does it signify when the building industry is very active? Why are those buildings being erected? Do people build just for the pleasure of seeing those buildings? No, it is a sign of progress, development and prosperity. Never before have they built on a larger scale on the West Rand than they are to-day. Building contractors simply cannot get the necessary bricks. Bricks are being conveyed there from points 40 to 50 miles distant and I know what I am talking about because I own brick-kilns in that area. What is happening in the building industry in that area is proof of rapid development. Did any hon. member of the Opposition try to prove that this country was going backwards in the economic or any other field? They tried to attack the agricultural policy of the Government and even there they made no impression on anybody. Sir, when hon. members opposite are concerned, as the hon. member for Innesdal (Mr. J. A. Marais) has cornered them to-day, by giving them chapter and verse, they try to laugh themselves out of the difficulty or else they join their leader in order to protect him. The hon. member is a big businessman and I should like to recognize him as a very intelligent person; I do not regard him as a stupid person: I regard him as being intelligent; but do you know what he tells this House? He says the people in the lowveld, where I live, are completely insolvent: that the Government has been buying the farms of the farmers over the past three to four years. Sir do you know what happened? After we had a drought for two years that hon. member opened a branch of the Netherlands Bank in Thabazimba and that branch is still there to-day. Does that prove insolvency? A year later Volkskas opened a branch there. That branch is also still there and is doing good business. Barclays Bank also has a branch there and that too is doing good business. In spite of that, that great economist, a person whom I regard as being intelligent, tells this House that everybody there is bankrupt. He says that to the House in spite of the fact that his own bank and other banks have opened branches there during <span class="col_8159-8160" refersTo="page_0414"/>this severe drought. That only proves that even those drought-stricken areas in the lowveld are going ahead. Had that not been the position those banks would not have opened branches there.</p>

<p>Sir, the language those hon. members opposite speak is the language of the hon. member for Suzman. The hon. member for Drakensberg can laugh; she looks even better when I make a slip of the tongue than she looks when she laughs. The hon. member for Houghton tells us every day how unjustly we are treating the non-Whites. Sir, the state of mind that hon. member reveals is such that you can hardly touch it with a barge pole; as a South African it will make one sick even to touch it with a barge pole.</p>

<p>I wish to return to the hon. member for Yeoville, the hon. member who tells us he is a good South African. Had I not had so much respect for the Chair I would have said &#x201C;ciss&#x201D; but because of my respect for the Chair and for the House I shall not say so. Sir, we cannot carry on in this way. We cannot continue with an Opposition such as the one on that side of the House. We cannot continue to listen to the remarks which come from that side, particularly when you consider the way in which they are made. We shall have to devise some plan either of going to have some coffee or of attacking them as strenuously as a party has ever been attacked. That is the only way in which those hon. members can be brought to their senses. You will never get them to co-operate. Sir; you will never get constructive criticism from them; you simply no longer get that from that side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down reminds one of the person who goes to a braaivleis and gets himself a mixed dish and does not know really where to start. He has done his best here to-day to confuse the House with the views that he expressed here on farming; with an attack on the political views of the Opposition, and at the same time he tried to introduce the usual red herring of racialism. Unfortunately, good fellow that he is, he has told us nothing at all about Government policy and he has certainly not told us how Government policy is contributing to the future prosperity and happiness of South Africa. It has been definitely stated on this side of the House that despite the fact that the Minister of Finance has such an excellent surplus he had not been able to give us any indication of any sense of happiness and contentment in South Africa. What we have seen over the last years is anything but happiness and contentment amongst the people. If anything at all. Sir, we are constantly faced with problems, difficulties and a sense of insecurity on the part of the people of this country. I do not think it is going to be very long before this Government, worried as it already is, will find itself in great difficulties with the electorate of South Africa. Sir, there are certain problems for which this Government must find the solution. When criticism is levelled against it we are told that there is prosperity in the country and that things are progressing satisfactorily. But these things are happening despite the Government&#x2019;s policy. These things are happening in spite of the fact that this Government is in power.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<p>Because of the strong Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a question of a strong Government. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said the production of the country was increasing rapidly year by year. He gave us certain figures to indicate, what seemed on the face of it, a fair measure of progress. But is this increased production not really due to the fact that the backlog in production and employment has been wiped out over the last two or three years because of the increase in capital investment in the industrial and financial sector of the country? Until that backlog is completely wiped out production will continue to increase year by year. I want to quote a leading mining expert to the hon. member who has just sat down in the person of Mr. Anderson. Deputy-Chairman of the Rand Mines who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Noting that pressures were beginning to devolop now that the slack in production capacity and employment had been taken up in South Africa&#x201D;, Mr. Anderson said &#x201C;that the first signs of inflation were now apparent.&#x201D; There are now more jobs than there are people capable of filling them or who are allowed to fill them. So wages and salaries are going up as employers fight for labour and unless something is done to check this movement prices must go up.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In other words, the whole of the industrial momentum of South Africa has moved ahead because of the fact that there was stagnation for some years. When finance began to move more freely, when it could no longer withstand being constantly hoarded up, development went ahead because it had to wipe out the tremendous backlog which had been created both in the employment sector and in the general production sector.</p>

<p>Now that the backlog is beginning to be wiped out we have to look more seriously to the future and to the policy of the Government in this direction. We find nothing in the policy of the Government that gives us any sense of security with regard to continued production in future. We are facing a manpower shortage in South Africa and we find that insufficient provision is being made to meet that shortage. The Minister of Finance said he was unable to give back to the taxpayer some of the surplus because it would lead to inflation. The question we are asking ourselves, Sir, is this: Will the refund to the needy lead to inflation? No. It is the manpower shortage in the production field which will lead to inflation and that shortage is due <span class="col_8161-8162" refersTo="page_0415"/>to the short-sighted policy of the Government.</p>

<p>Exports have to-day become the lifeblood of the country&#x2019;s national earnings. In fact, Sir, exports are to-day responsible for one-third of our national income. We are becoming more and more dependent on exports; it has become essential to maintain our exports. Exports are responsible for R 1,675,000,000 of our national income. It is essential for South Africa to maintain a continual increase in her exports and to find new and diverse market; In fact, we are trying to do so. To-day, for instance, we have a big industrial exhibition in Hong Kong in order to encourage that part of the East to take a greater interest in purchasing from South Africa. If we are to maintain this improvement in our exports it will be necessary for us to provide a satisfactory and adequate source of labour. The Minister of Labour himself has admitted that immigration is not sufficient to meet this shortage of manpower. The Government by restrictive legislation is not making use of the full potential of manpower in this country. We feel, and industrialists feel, that unless this is done the export momentum of South Africa will gradually begin to slow down. If it does it will prove a very serious set-back to the general economic development of South Africa and the economic momentum of the future.</p>

<p>Another factor we have to consider is this: In order to advance our export trade it is necessary to provide a highly competitive export product. And to provide that product in the export field it is essential that production in the country must be at as low a unit cost as possible. To do this it is essential, as has been proved in other countries, to improve and develop your internal consumption market and in order to do that you must either provide a higher earning capacity to the smaller number or you have to provide a larger number with a wider spending capacity. In that case the demand for goods becomes greater, the full use of your labour potential provides you with a greater spending power in the country. You are then able to produce goods at a lower cost and able to provide a much more competitive article for export thus developing your export market. Unless we can do that. Sir, we will find that we are unable to produce goods at that competitive rate which is essential if we wish to continue to build up our export market.</p>

<p>An example of the importance of this internal consumption market can be found in the United States, which has that enormous internal consumption market, and their exports only yield 4.5 per cent of the national income. Tn the case of Britain it is 17 per cent, Canada 21 per cent, France 14 per cent as against our earnings of 33&#x2153; per cent.</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The importance of that is that we are becomoing more and more reliant on our exports to contribute to our national income.</p>

<p>Just to give an example of the viewpoints of other people on this particular subject I wish to quote what Mr. Barrett said at the meeting of the Cape Chamber of Commerce. In answering the allegation of the Minister of Labour who has said that job reservation is not even being felt in this country because of the number of exemptions that are granted Mr. Barrett said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What we are concerned about is those who have not been trained to do better jobs or have not entered the particular trade at all because of the overhanging threat of job reservation.</block>

<p>Industrialists make this other point that there is a lack of consultation. This was dealt with by the president of the Federated Chamber of Industries. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There has been a decided lack of prior consultation on major issues by certain Government Departments with regard to organized industry and commerce. This could have the unfortunate effect of our economic policies degenerating into a system of improvization in response to the pressure of events.</block>

<p>That means that there should be much more consultation and co-operation by Government Departments with industry and commerce in order to deal with some of the problems of the country, one of which, I think, is this question of the shortage of labour. Unless we embark on a policy which will enable, not only a small section of the country&#x2019;s population but every section of the population, including not only the Bantu but also the Coloureds of the Cape, to be integrated more closely into the industrial life of the country, a policy whereby they will acquire better skills and a policy which will give them an opportunity of playing a fuller part in the whole of the productive life of the country, we are going to face difficulties in the future. That is one important aspect of fhe Government&#x2019;s restrictive policy which is holding back the fuller development of the economic life of South Africa.</p>

<p>We believe that the policy of job reservation, which is so stoutly defended, is one that is ultimately going to lead to setbacks in the economic life of the country. It is not sufficient to say that it is not being applied in practice when it is in fact on the Statute Book. The complaint of this side of the House is that that legislation is on the Statute Book and such legislation is one of the strongest contributory factors to the feeling of unrest and insecurity, not only on the part of people who are not represented in this House but even on the part of people who are represented by the vast majority of the Members in this House. Despite the prosperity of which the Government constantly boasts there is in the hearts of people a constant sense of insecurity as to what the future holds in store for them. One of the important ways of dealing with this is <span class="col_8163-8164" refersTo="page_0416"/>in the economic field where they can share the best of what we have. Everyone must have a fair share in the economic life of South Africa and a sense of hope for the future, a sense that he will be able to provide for his family.</p>

<p>Dealing with the export side of our economy I want to make it very clear indeed that if we are going to lean heavily on our exports for an important share of our national income, we have to ensure in future that there is a constant flow of exports from this country and that we can meet the demands that may be made. We are developing in a very restricted field. Our exports are mainly taken up by only a few countries. It is only recently that we have been doing business with a country like Japan. That country has purchased a considerable amount of goods from us. The goods which a country like Japan purchases from us consist mainly of raw materials. In order to improve our export market we must also be in a position to compete in the field of the finished product. We must not rely only on raw materials because the exportation of raw materials does not give us a stable and permanent market in the future. It is a sort of product which can be subject to all sorts of changing events, politically and otherwise, in other parts of the world. South Africa must ensure that her goods will be sought after by a very much wider field than the field in which we are operating at the moment. [Interjections.] This gentleman is obviously unaware of what industrialists and businessmen in the country are saying on this particular subject. They are certainly concerned about this subject. Dr. Marais, for instance, said recently&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the export market the same unsatisfactory pattern prevails. Not only is South Africa too dependent on the export of certain basic commodities which are subject to world prices but it is too dependent on its export trade. Approximately one-third of South Africa&#x2019;s national income is earned in the export market and this high percentage is indicative of the extent to which the Republic&#x2019;s economic welfare is dependent for success or failure on world markets.</block>

<p>Dr. Marais himself said that in an article regarding certain statistics. He is economic advisor to Sanlam. He indicates that we are far too dependent on these exports. It is therefore the duty of the Government to ensure that the momentum of exports from South Africa be maintained with the fullest use of all our potential labour resources.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a political party can be as strong as it wants to, but when it allows two things to enter its ranks its doom is sealed. The United Party was a powerful party; it was a strong party but it allowed two things to overpower it and those two things are race hatred and political immorality. I want to prove that, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>That was again evident in the debate to-day. The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) accused this Government of having abandoned the idea of incorporating the Protectorates. That story is not only told here in this House but also on the platteland. It is particularly on the platteland that the charge is laid at the door of the Government of having neglected its duty and of now being unable to get the Protectorates. I do not know whether hon. members opposite have such short memories. Do they not remember what happened in 1952 and subsequently in this House and outside? The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) referred to it in passing that when the hon. Dr. Malan was Prime Minister he did his best to petition the British Parliament. He wanted, however, to get a unanimous decision in this Parliament. What attitude did the United Party adopt? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told the hon. member for Vereeniging that he did not know what he was talking about. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether he has completely forgotten what attitude his Party adopted on that occasion? Their newspapers followed them up, or rather their newspapers dictated to them what to say. Sir, I want to read to you what the <i>Natal Mercury</i> said about that matter on 15 May 1952&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Malan could hardly have chosen a more inappropriate moment to reiterate his demand for the transfer of the Protectorates to the Union. It is difficult to imagine a more farcical situation. While the Prime Minister is in the act of tearing up the compact of Union, while his party is trampling upon the rights and traditions of minorities, he brazenly suggests that the people should give the Government a mandate to strengthen its approach to the British Government for the incorporation of States at present under the freedom and justice of the Union Jack.</block>

<p>That was the language they used&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Blind stupidity! Having destroyed trust in the land they govern, the Nationalists are pig-headed enough to believe that the inhabitants of the Protectorates are hopelessly misguided when they refuse to submit themselves to the despotic forms of misgovernment from which the citizens of the Union are suffering. Nor, in the circumstances which now prevail, would any British Government dare to accede to Dr. Malan&#x2019;s wishes. Whitehall knows full well that to do so would inflame Native opinion throughout Africa, while the tribes of Basutoland, Swaziland and Bechuanaland would understandably react most vigorously to what they would be quite entitled to regard as a most shocking betrayal. The people of the Protectorates need have no fears.</block>

<p>This is important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The people of the Protectorates need have no fears. Neither the people of the United Kingdom nor the right-minded people of <span class="col_8165-8166" refersTo="page_0417"/>South Africa will, until the danger of Nationalist misrule has been removed, lend themselves to any political manoeuvres which have as their object the incorporation of the Protectorates.</block>

<p>What does that mean? You are telling the Bantu in the Protectorates in advance: &#x201C;You need have no fears; the right-minded people in this country (that is the United Party) and the people in England will never allow the Protectorates to be incorporated as long as this Government is in power.&#x201D; They are quite prepared, however, to allow them to be incorporated when the U.P. is in power.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, conveniently. What did the Uunited Party do to the hon. member for Pietersmaritzberg (City) (Mr. Odell) when he made his first speech as a Nationalist after he had walked over to the National Party? Sir, I have never witnessed more disgraceful conduct on the part of the Opposition. They treated Mr. Odell as though he was scum, as though he was untouchable. It is not only in the case of these two Ministers, therefore, that they act in that way. Every person who leaves their party gets treated in the same way.</p>

<p>I now come to a much bigger figure in our political life than this person and that is the late Gen. Hertzog. The late Gen. Hertzog was good enough to be their Prime Minister and their leader; then they lauded him sky-high; then they arrayed themselves behind him as a great Prime Minister. But what did they say about him the day he took a stand? What did the <i>Cape Times</i> say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The pitiful spirit of cowardice and defeatism which has overwhelmed everything which was free and noble and brave in the character of Gen. Hertzog in his old age, and perhaps because of it&#x2026;. Gen. Hertzog has proved himself to be a traitor to the human spirit &#x2026; the people of South Africa are sorry that a former Prime Minister of whom better things could have been expected at one time has testified in such a cowardly way to the loss of character&#x2026;. The policy of defeatism which Gen. Hertzog and his satillites have submitted to the country can only be described as one of disloyalty and treason towards South Africa. We had to have a war to expose the kink in Gen. Hertzog. When you study the trend of events as well as speeches of yesterday (in the House of Assembly) it is difficult not to pass the same judgment on him which is passed over Hitler&#x2014;that he can defend his honour only by admitting that he is spiritually not well.</block>

<p>An then the hon. members ask &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; That is an old characteristic of theirs; their old method of castigating everyone who was within their ranks and who because he could no longer endure their politics, joined the Nationalists, as they castigated Gen. Hertzog and as the hon. member for Yeoville castigated the two Ministers Trollip and Waring. I want to say this to them: You can repeat those attacks; the more often you repeat those attacks on these two Ministers the more will we, the Afrikaans-speaking people on this side of the House, gather around them and support and sustain them. Do you know why, Sir? We shall support them, not only because they are capable, but because to us they symbolize the English-speaking aristocracy in South Africa. That is why we are doing it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) is unfortunately not here. But he accused the hon. member for Rustenburg (Mr. Bootha) of not having contributed anything to this debate in the interests of South Africa. I want to ask him what his party has contributed. I cannot think of one single thing they have said during this whole long debate which I can regard as a constructive contribution in the interests of South Africa. They have only broken down; they have only continually inserted the crowbar to dislodge the foundation stone.</p>

The hon. member for Florida said we were saddled with problems. That was his great difficulty. There is unrest in the country, problems await the people! I want him to show me a country which is without problems today. There we have the mighty America who has to force integration on her people. Does she not have problems? She is continually faced with problems she has created herself. And what about England? Has she no problems? Have France and West Germany no problems?

Show me any country in the world who has been prosperous under a weak and unstable Government. History teaches us that that is impossible because no investor will invest money in such a country if the Government of that country is weak and unstable. If the hon. member for Maitland, who is smiling, had had millions of rand would he have invested those millions in this country had this Government been weak and unstable?</p>

<p>Listen to that! There you have another example, Sir, of what the United Party can do to a man! Prosperity and a stable and strong Government are inseparable. The hon. member also expressed himself against job reservation. I have already said that the United Party was suffering from political immorality. Now they want to abolish job reservation. Let us put them to the test. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will probably still take part in this debate. He must tell us whether he is in favour of a policy of no job reservation. Let him tell us that he is in favour of its abolition in the mining industry as well. That would be honest and moral. If they do not do it surely they are politically immoral. If they want to do away with job reservation they must also abolish it in the mining industry. Why does he make an exception in the case of the mining industry? If the United Party is not politically immoral they must tell us that they will also abolish job reservation in the mining industry.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw). We are accustomed to not taking him seriously. He pretends to be very serious but he is laughing up his sleeve all the time. He makes a farce of everything. But he also said one thing which proves my statement. He said the English-speaking section did not want any gesture of goodwill from this Government. Why not? Why may this Government not do so, this Government which has all these years been represented by that side of the House as the Party which wanted to trample the English-speaking section underfoot? Some time ago the hon. member for Hillbrow still warned the English-speaking people at Paarl that their flag would be taken away from them and one thing and another. To-morrow it is their language rights that will be taken away from them! We have had the story here that there will shortly be a separate voters roll for the English-speaking people. Why do they say these things when they know they are not true. Why do they not wish this side of the House to make a gesture of goodwill towards the English-speaking people? They spurned the gesture of goodwill made by the late Dr. Malan when he asked Mr. Shepstone to accompany him to the Coronation in England. That must not be. English-speaking persons must not be appointed to the Cabinet, not only because they are English-speaking, but not even on merit either. Why? They are afraid that if the National Party were to continue practising this policy of showing goodwill towards the other language group the United Party would lose English-speaking supporters at a faster rate than it is losing them to-day. As it is they are becoming depopulated of English-speaking people. I should like any hon. members from Natal to deny that many of the most prominent English-speaking businessmen in Natal, in Durban, Pietermaritzburg, as well as in the olatteland of Natal, are leaving the United Party. They are seeking their salvation with the National Party.</p>

But I often come in contact with people like that, prominent English-speaking people, also businessmen, in Durban and Pietermaritzburg, as well as on the platteland, people who are beginning to shake the United Party dust off their shoes and seeking their salvation with the National Party. That is the reason why the United Party does not want us to show goodwill towards the English-speaking people. Let me say this: The National Party will continue to show goodwill towards the English-speaking people. It will continue to do so because goodwill does not cost anything. As a matter of fact, it is only a big man who can show goodwill towards another. The United Party can only prey on race hatred. The hon. member for Durban (North) stated, as though it was a fact, that the hon. member for Heilbron had <span class="col_8169-8170" refersTo="page_0419"/>attacked the Jewish race in this country.

<p>What did the hon. member for Heilbron say?</p>

<p>The hon. member pretends that he does not know what the hon. member for Heilbron has said. I listened to him just as hon. members opposite listened to him. He said that those Jews who were concerned in the case he had in mind were no credit to the other members of their race in this country, or words to that effect. He still mentioned the name of the late Mr. Greenberg as an example of the aristocracy of the Jewish race. The hon. member for Pretoria (East) sat next to me on that occasion and still said that the hon. member need not only mention Mr. Greenberg&#x2019;s name because what about Dr. Yutar, a South African patriot? Where and when did the hon. member attack the Jews? But the hon. member for Durban (North) immediately states that the hon. member has made an attack on the Jews. He once again wanted to inflame race hatred, because the United Party can only exist if it inflames race hatred.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) made a few other stupid remarks. He said, for example, that in spite of all our laws&#x2014;and remember this comes from a legally trained person&#x2014;we had not yet succeeded in putting an end to sabotage. As though we have succeeded in putting an end to theft, murder, arson, fraud, etc., with all our laws! Which country has managed to do that? No country in the world has succeeded in doing that because as long as human nature is what it is you will be faced with murder, theft and that sort of thing. But does that mean that we must not pass laws in an attempt to put a stop to that sort of things? That was precisely what we also did in the case of sabotage. Laws were passed to combat those things. I admit that no law will change human nature but you can at least try to curb its activities and you can only do that by way of legislation. It astounds me that an advocate can make such a stupid and childish statement in this House. I want to ask him what would have happened had we not had the necessary legislation to combat sabotage and had it not been possible for the hon. the Minister to act the way he did indeed act? Would we still have had the privilege of sitting here to-day? Surely hon. members know what has been happening in the country. Surely they know what has come to light in the courts. But hon. members opposite do not want us to make those laws; they do not want us to act the way we have indeed acted.</p>

<p>He says the Rivonia trial is hardly over when sabotage is again committed the following day. Was that as a result of the laws we have passed? He suggested that it was as a result of the laws we had passed, because, said he, as long as this Government was in power and passed such laws we would have Pan-Africanism and sabotage. If that is not direct encouragement to the saboteurs in South Africa to continue committing those reckless deeds, I do not know what encouragement means. These saboteurs are clearly told that they are not to blame for what they have done but that the Government is to blame. [Interjections.] Oh, yes. They tell those saboteurs that they are not to blame for doing those things but that the Government and its laws are to blame. I maintain that there is no greater encouragement to those people than words of that nature. And these words come from the United Party! And then they still say they are good Afrikaners and good patriots! But at the same time they tell the saboteurs that they are not to blame for what they have done but that the Government, who tries to restrain them with its laws, is to blame.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Please read your colleague&#x2019;s Hansard to-morrow. However, hon. members know that it does not centre around the laws we have passed or our apartheid policy. We have too many examples to think otherwise. We have Rhodesia and many other countries. So it does not centre around that, it centres around one thing only and that is that they want our fatherland, our wealth and our strategic position. That is what they want and towards that end apartheid is merely a very convenient peg on which they can hang all these diabolical deeds. The Opposition does not want to realize or believe that. And then we still have such inflammatory speeches as those we have had to-day. The hon. member for Durban (North) also said that we were driving the Bantu away from Western civilization. That was merely a statement of his because he did not and cannot substantiate it. What has this Government done to show that it wants to <span class="col_8171-8172" refersTo="page_0420"/>drive the Bantu away from Western civilization? Hon. members cannot give me one example of that. Yet the hon. member makes that statement and makes it in such a way that it has to stand out like a pikestaff.</p>

<p>The hon. member is also concerned about the fact that the Bantu can form their own political parties in their homelands. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with the Bantu organizing themselves into political parties? Are we not continually accused by hon. members opposite of not giving the Bantu a political outlet? Now that the Government is making it possible for them to have such an outlet it is something evil. How can a person be so politically immoral? The hon. member simply accepts that such a political party must of necessity be either a Communist Party or a Pan-African Party. By virtue of what fact does he adopt that attitude? Why can&#x2019;t it be a purely national party, a party which will operate to the advantage of their own homelands? Why must it of necessity be a Communist or a Pan-African Party? To say that is surely just to cause trouble and confusion in the country. Of course that is possible, but the the hon. member accepts that that will be the position. He accepts that Bantu parties can be nothing else than either communist or PanAfricanist. Is that not to cause unrest? Is that not to create a wrong image?</p>

<p>The hon. member also says we are uprooting the urban Bantu. In what way have we uprooted the urban Bantu? I want to ask those hon. members, particularly those who live in cities and do not know the Bantu, please not to talk such nonsense as far as the Bantu are concerned. Since when have the urban Bantu been uprooted? Show me one Bantu in a city who has lost all tribal connections and who is without an anchor. Show me one! I invite hon. members to check the position. I did so myself and I found that a Bantu whose father and children were born in Johannesburg still had his interests in the district of Ladysmith in Natal. He still has a wife with children there, he has his stock there and he goes there annually to plough. He retains his tribal connections and he can still tell you who his chief is. Yet both he and his father were born in Johannesburg as well as some of his children. He retains his tribal connections. He never loses that. It is only the United Party who says the urban Bantu has become detribalized and that that is the fault of the National Government.</p>

<p>I am not concerned with what he said. If he says they have become detribalized I repudiate it and I know what I am talking about. Sir, had the hon. member understood the complex workings of the Bantu&#x2019;s mind and had he understood his moral codes and customs he could also have talked, but he does not know the Bantu. It is only recently that the hon. member has seen a Bantu for the first time. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) was heard to say that we who come from the towns, the urban areas, in other words the city-slickers, know nothing about the Bantu, so that when we allege, as we do from time to time, that the vast majority of the urbanized Bantu are in fact detribalized, that they do not have this longing for what the hon. member for Vryheid calls their &#x201C;homelands&#x201D;, that they do not go &#x201C;home&#x201D;, because there is no home for them to go to in the reserves, and therefore there is no land for them to plough for that matter, that many of them are in the towns in the third and fourth generation as town-dwellers, then the hon. member says: &#x201C;We prove that we know nothing about him&#x201D;, i.e. the Bantu.</p>

<p>Now for one thing, the C.S.I.R., for which the hon. member may have some respect, made a survey in 1962, I think, in which it was proved conclusively that the overwhelming proportion of the Bantu in the towns, in the urban areas, was already detribalized&#x2014;I think the figure was something like 90 per cent. But if the hon. member does not accept that, then I make him an offer now. Let him come to Johannesburg during the recess. I will take him to Soweto, where there are some 375,000 Bantu living in a comparatively small area; he can choose any township, he can choose his own sector of that township, and then let us do a simple survey together, and let him find out how many of them are detribalized or how many of them have still got their hearts in their homeland or their heartland, and which of them have any land to plough there; and if he does not find that 75 per cent of them are detribalized, then I will gladly pay his expenses at the best hotel in Johannesburg. If he is a man, and I have no doubt that he is, he will take me up on this offer, even if he does not like my company. I will give him a good time, anyway. He also referred to an allegation made by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). It is quite right that certain people are not an ornament to their race. Of course, what he forgot was that the hon. member for Heilbron always chooses from the bottom drawer, and not the top drawer, when he comes to the other man&#x2019;s race, as he calls it&#x2014;in this case, more correctly, religious affiliation. He picks the very worst specimens, and then he says: &#x201C;They are not ornaments of their race.&#x201D; Talking about ornaments&#x2014;&#x201C;sierrade&#x201D;&#x2014;would he say, for example, that the hon. member for Vereeniging is an ornament of this House? Would he say that the hon. member for Vereeniging adorns the Afrikaner race? Would he say that he even adorns the human race? I raise this question because this same hon. member for Vereeniging was good enough to send me a note this morning. (I am sorry he is not here now.) He addressed me in endearing terms, which I appreciate, and he said: &#x201C;I hope to take part in the debate this morning; you get honorable mention, in case you are interested&#x2014;Blaar.&#x201D; Very fair, Sir, because last Thursday the man whom he so greatly <span class="col_8173-8174" refersTo="page_0421"/>admires, the hon. Minister of Information, although I did not take part in the debate on his Vote, sailed into me with all guns blazing, without so much as a &#x201C;by your leave&#x201D; or a note saying: &#x201C;Dear, I am going to blast you.&#x201D; I appreciate this. But where was that hon. member to-day when it came to blasting me as promised? He did not say a word about me! He was scared off by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw)&#x2014;and, incidentally, he met me in the lobby this morning and said to me, did I have his note? I said &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. He said to me, &#x201C;I am going to harm you very much&#x201D;, &#x201C;net &#x2019;n paar harde klappe&#x201D;. Now I ask the hon. member for Vryheid to stand up in this House and say that he regards that hon. member to whom I referred as an adornment of or to this House!</p>

<p>Another point he raised was our alleged treatment of the late General Hertzog. Sir, I am not supposed to have a sense of humour, according to the hon. member for Vereeniging &#x2014;frankly, one could not survive here without a sense of humour, with the hon. member for Vereeniging in the House&#x2014;but the point I want to make here is this: How can the hon. member get up here and tell us about what we are supposed to have done to the late General Hertzog? Does he remember what his supporters and that hon. member&#x2019;s political colleagues did to the same late General Hertzog in the Orange Free State? I don&#x2019;t hear the shout of &#x201C;Vrystaat&#x201D; coming from that side now. Don&#x2019;t they remember what they did to the late General Hertzog? Yet the hon. member has the gall to tell us what we did, according to him, to the late General Hertzog. Another point he made in a very intelligible, if not intelligent, address was that stable government and progress go hand in hand, and what is more, that you cannot have progress unless you have stable government. And by &#x201C;stable&#x201D;, according to the way he used the word, he obviously meant that a strong Government which had the country in a grip of iron. I don&#x2019;t know whether he has ever visited Germany. I toured that country in 1961, and if that hon. member goes to Germany, even now he will see the signs left by a very stable Government, &#x201C;stable&#x201D; in the sense that it had the country in a grip of iron for ten years&#x2014; not &#x201C;stable&#x201D; mentally; I do not want to draw an analogy between his Government and that Government, but if he wants to see what happened under a stable Government, as he calls it, and the very visible progress, the Autobahnen which in some cases still survive, the magnificent bridges and buildings, the economic progress and what finally happened to the country, he must go to Germany.</p>

<p>There you have it. The hon. member has seen it. Now I come to one other point he made, which is extraordinary. He says: Look around the world&#x2014;where do you see a country that has no problems, where do you see a government that has no problems? He is, of course, right. I cannot think of a single country without problems. But I say that this particular Government is unique in as much as they have deliberately set out to create the very problems that now beset this country. Whereas in other countries, governments do everything that they can possibly think of to combat problems that arise fortuitously, through no fault of their own, we are blighted in this country because we have a Government that spends all its time, or the greater part of its time, deliberately creating problems. I will give you one example.</p>

<p>Where have you ever seen a government that deliberately places its own country on the operating table in the operating theatre, and then proceeds to dismember a country of 475,000 square miles with a population of 16,500,000, into little bits and pieces? This is called hari-kiri in Japan. I do not know what the Afrikaans word is for it, but this is what the Government is trying to do to South Africa. And then the hon. member talks about problems. This country has one basic problem, and that is the fact that the National Party governs it. Before I go any further, I say again that the condition of &#x00A1;South Africa to-day can best be described by the word &#x201C;kakistocracy&#x201D;. You remember what it means? It means &#x201C;the government of a state by its worst citizens&#x201D;. This is our misfortune to-day in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the time left to me I want to deal briefly with the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs. I am sorry he is not here. And with the hon. Minister of Information, whose absence I deplore even more. I do not know what is wrong in the intelligence section of our Foreign Affairs Department. In May&#x2014;last month&#x2014;the hon. the Prime Minister complained bitterly in this House of certain leakages of information, leakages of which he accused the United States Government and the British Government, in regard to their attitude to what might eventuate from the acceptance or rejection by the Government of the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s report. He said in effect: This is not the way for friends to behave, and the evidence he proffered of that leakage, as far as the American Government was concerned, was a statement by Mr. Clarence Randall made in South Africa in March, according to a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i> on 16 March. Remember, he was once an honoured visitor to this country. Last <span class="col_8175-8176" refersTo="page_0422"/>year and the year before we could hardly say a word in criticism of the Government, but someone on their side would say: &#x201C;What about Clarence Randall?&#x201D; Now this is what Clarence Randall said in the interview&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The ordinary South Africans are not aware of the serious implications of the South West Africa issue. I do not think they realize the serious implications of the South West Africa issue. I think they do not realize the full extent of the crisis. If the decision at the International Court at The Hague is adverse to South Africa, you will be in serious difficulty. I do not think this point has been thought through by the common man.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say that he was absolutely certain that the United Nations, backed by the United States, would enforce such a decision because it involved the rule of law. Sir, this is clearly based on a statement, of which I have the transcript made by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Sidney Yates, on 30 October of last year. I was in New York at the time. Why is it that our Department of Foreign Affairs, and our Intelligence Section in it, did not advise the Prime Minister that there was no leakage of information that what Mr. Randall said in March 1964 could have been seen in black and white on 30 October 1963 by anyone who wanted to look at the document, and that it was in fact reiterated in almost the same words by the senior Ambassador of the United States at the United Nations, Mr. Adlai Stevenson, in December last? I have the documents. I was not favoured. Anybody could get those documents. I say that the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs should find out just why that type of criticism of a friendly power, being the United States in this case, can be made by the Prime Minister himself on the basis that they leaked the information through Mr. Clarence Randall in March 1964, when that information, in fact, should have been available to the Government&#x2014;as it was to everybody else&#x2014;by the end of October 1963&#x2014;and available to the hon. Foreign Minister himself since he was then at the UN as our Ambassador to Britain.</p>

<p>Another point to which I want to draw his attention is the recent activities of the hon. the Minister of the Interior in refusing to give permission to certain people who wished to come to this country, usually from the United States. I have the case here of a man by the name of Gusewell, an American journalist representing the <i>Kansas City Star.</i>with a circulation of 350,000. He was turned back from Jan Smuts Airport. Nobody knows the reason. Now I do not believe that the <i>Kansas City Star,</i> or the American Government, would allow anybody to come here who is going to join up with saboteurs. This man was going to write news stories about South Africa. But he was asked in New York by one of the officials at the Consul-General&#x2019;s Office, apparently, according to this report, what he was going to write about, and the official told him that he might not be allowed into South Africa because &#x201C;our relationship with your paper has been worse than with almost any other paper in the United States&#x201D;. In other words, criticism of South Africa, or of the Government, in this case was anticipated. Mr. Gusewell was turned back from Jan Smuts Airport, and then, if course, proceeded home to write a series of very critical articles about the Republic and its Government. This is what we got for it. There was the case of another journalist by the name of Friedman, who had a letter of accreditation and commendation from the present President of the United States. I took this up with the hon. the Minister of the Interior. The President, who was then Vice-President, said, recommending the application: &#x201C;It would be my hope that the South African Government would give favourable consideration to the application.&#x201D; I asked the hon. Minister of the Interior why this man was not admitted. He said that it was not in the public interest to give the reason. Sir, it is certainly not in the public interest to keep people out merely because they are journalists, merely because they come from the United States, merely because it is assumed that they may write critical articles. I think it does a lot more harm to keep them out than to let them in, because if we have anything to hide we shut them out&#x2014;that is the conclusion they would jump to&#x2014;if we have not, we would let them into the country. There was the case of the Claremore Quartet, touring Africa under the State Department&#x2019;s auspices, and at its expense&#x2014; as a goodwill gesture they wanted the Quartet to come to South Africa&#x2014;harmless musicians, apparently, nobody knows any better or worse about them. The Minister refused them permission to enter. These are matters which I would like the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs to take up with his colleague in the Cabinet, to find out just what the purpose is of this kind of conduct when we already have, as has been admitted freely, that unfortunate reputation in the outside world which we would all like to improve, and which this Government will persist by its stubbornness in some cases, obtuseness in others, ill-will in yet more cases, in magnifying. Further, there is the matter that the hon. Minister of Information raised on Thursday in the debate on his Vote when, for no apparent reason that I know, he criticized me severely, not only for having undertaken a tour of the United States last year, but having said certain things there, and also on my return. I said, for example, when I came back&#x2014;and he quoted this&#x2014;summing up my impressions of our so-called image&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Nationalist Government has created such a bad image of South Africa in the United States, that it is terrifying&#x2026;. We stink from one end of the country to another.</block>

<p><span class="col_8177-8178" refersTo="page_0423"/>The hon. Minister was livid with me because I said it. The Minister disputed that statement of mine. Why is it then that a man who is <i>persona grata</i> with the Government&#x2014;of course, I am not&#x2014;a man who is invited to Groote Schuur&#x2014;of course, I have not been there (recently), but I have hopes of getting there when the Government changes&#x2014;why is it that a man who is <i>persona grata</i> to the extent that he, of all the people in the world, has been commissioned to write what is called a &#x201C;sympathetic profile of Verwoerd&#x201D; for the U.S. magazines, <i>Time, Life</i> and all that, who has said that he admires the Government and its Prime Minister and apartheid, can criticize without being attacked for it? When I said in November last that our image or our reputation stinks from one end of a certain country to the other, I am reviled as an enemy of the people; but when Mr. Stuart Cloete says, in March 1964, that &#x201C;the name of South Africa overseas stinks&#x201D;, there is not a word from the hon. Minister of Information! In other words, the question is: who finds the bad smell, who defines it? It is undoubtedly there. If Gorshel finds it, he is an enemy of South Africa; if Cloete finds it, that is all right. Furthermore, I said on my return that the Government, through its Department of Information, is &#x201C;wasting millions on information&#x201D;. I have said it. I have meant it, and I still mean it quite honestly, because the greater part of our allocation of funds being spent overseas is being spent futilely, is wasted. I said so when I came back, and I gave examples of how our Department could not even get a hand-out&#x2014; the usual and regular Press release&#x2014;into a Washington newspaper. When I say that, the hon. Minister of Information says in effect: &#x201C;How dare you make this kind of attack on the Department?&#x201D;, when all I am trying to do is to show them where the defects in the operation are, in order to make him correct the position. Here we come back to Mr. Stuart Cloete. What Gorshel says in November 1963 is a lie, but what Cloete says in 1964 is true. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South African novelist Stuart Cloete said this week that the South African Information Department was wasting money in the U.S. and elsewhere. &#x201C;They should pack up and go home,&#x201D; he said. Referring to his United States visit, Mr. Cloete said that the Information Department was wasting millions of dollars in America and elsewhere.</block>

<p>When I say that they are &#x201C;wasting millions&#x201D;, why am I accused of being inimical to the Department? Why is it that five months after my statements, on my return, statements which I made in all sincerity. Mr. Stuart Cloete, a very well-travelled and well-known novelist, can make the same statements and then apparently they are acceptable and they are correct. I think that instead of Stuart Cloete following me as he has done in this connection, I should start following Stuart Cloete. Then what will the Minister say if I were to write &#x201C;Turning Wheels&#x201D;?</p>

<p>In the Committee Stage the hon. Minister made great play of the fact that Press reports referred to me as being a guest of the United States&#x2019; State Department, yet I was paying my own expenses. He dragged this matter into the argument. Here is the letter of authority, as it were (a photostat), from the Foreign Service of the United States of America, and it happens to say&#x2014;I did not write it&#x2014;&#x201C;This is to certify that Mr. Alec Gorshel, M.P., member of the United Party in the National Legislature of the Republic of South Africa, former mayor of the major South African industrial city of Johannesburg, is a guest of the United States Government under the Voluntary Leaders&#x2019; Programme. His itinerary has been arranged by the Department of State. Mr. Gorshell is entitled to every courtesy as a distinguished visitor to the United States.&#x201D; You may have a doubt about the use of the word &#x201C;distinguished&#x201D;. The letter says further that the costs of his visit are borne by Mr. Gorshel. What was wrong in the Press reports saying, as they did in America and elsewhere, that I was a guest of the State Department and that I was still paying my own expenses? This latter point must have pleased the American taxpayer more than the visit of the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. S. L. Muller).</p>

<p>I have such a stack of evidence here, such a stack to show how inept is the operation, so-called, through no fault of the officials of the Department of Information in the United States, that I cannot possibly be expected to give all the facts now. It is for us, for this Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, to ensure that this Department operates efficiently, and it cannot do so as long as the hon. Minister takes the line that all is well because he has so many on his staff, he has a Budget of R3,180,000, and all that is expected of him is to report annually. There are greater things expected of a Minister of Information than merely the expenditure of money and the engagement of staff. What is expected is that where there is this bad image&#x2014;and nobody denies that we have it in the United States&#x2014; it should be corrected by Government policy and by ministerial action.</p>

<p>If Stuart Cloete&#x2019;s view alone is not conclusive, mine obviously is not. Here then is an article by a British expert&#x2014;I can give the hon. Minister a copy if he has not got it&#x2014; in which he says, discussing &#x201C;why the British Press is beastly to South Africa&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He warns that the South African Government&#x2019;s Information Service is the most ineffectual and inept in the world.</block>

<p>Not my words, but there it is. Why don&#x2019;t we sit up and take notice of this? Why don&#x2019;t we do something about it, instead of accusing the people who bring this to the notice of the hon. Minister&#x2014;like myself&#x2014;of being unjust?<span class="col_8179-8180" refersTo="page_0424"/>We still have the same position in June of 1964&#x2014;that the Department of Information, having failed to correct all the wrongs and mistakes committed, not by the officials, but by the Government, is faced with the same kind of &#x201C;image&#x201D; in America, if not worse. I have a cutting here from the <i>New York Times</i> of Sunday, 7 June&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. George Weaver, Assistant-Secretary of Labour for International Affairs, has denounced South Africa&#x2019;s racial policies in what is believed to be the most forceful language yet used by an official of the United States Government.</block>

<p>Only eight days ago. It goes on to say that this speech was cleared by the State Department&#x2014;in other words, it is the authoritative view of his Government&#x2014;and just one sentence will convince you. Sir, that this is not a good &#x201C;image&#x201D; to have. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Weaver said that by embracing the doctrine of apartheid, enforced separation of the races, South Africa had adopted a calculated policy of retrogression and repression of human dignity and fundamental freedoms.</block>

<p>This is not my opinion. In conclusion. I sincerely hope that criticism levelled, firstly, in good faith, and secondly, on the bare facts of the matter, will be accepted in that spirit, and not in the &#x201C;smalende&#x201D; way that the hon. Minister &#x201C;accepted&#x201D; it from me, for one; and I say furthermore that there is ample justification for the wording of the motion moved by the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;the Government is in fact inept, inefficient and inadequate.</p>

<speech by="#sadie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SADIE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) commenced his speech with a very unsavoury and personal attack on the hon. member for Vereeniging in his absence. I should like to voice my strong objection to this kind of personal attack which that hon. member makes, where he said that the hon. member for Vereeniging is no asset (not an ornament) to the Afrikaner nation. For my part, I want to say that I regard the hon. member for Vereeniging as someone of whom I am proud as a fellow-Afrikaner, and I am aware that those hon. members who criticize and vilify him in this way have a holy fear of him. They are very afraid of him and they seek to discredit him as much as possible in order to neutralize the strenuous attacks he makes on them from time to time. The hon. member for Hospital in all this speeches concentrates on saying pithy things, in such a way that the rest of what he wanted to say is lost. He just looks for something pithy to say and then he tries to find ideas which can fit in with it. His whole speech was larded with this type of pithy remark, and if one analyses it it has no substance.</p>

<p>The hon. member launched a great attack on the Department of Information because they do not do enough to set right the image of South Africa, the bad image which exists overseas. It is his right to criticize the Information Service and to point out mistakes and shortcomings, but I think it is only fair that he should also point out the reasons why this bad image of South Africa exists overseas, viz. the reports emanating from the so-called &#x201C;stringers&#x201D; in South Africa&#x201D; the false reports about South Africa which are sent overseas. We would have expected him to say a few words of disapproval in that regard, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>The official Opposition has a duty and a responsibility towards South Africa, but what do they do? We find that they are busy developing a spirit which is very dangerous, a spirit of liberalism which is also permeating South Africa and which particularly prevails in those organizations and bodies which serve as a source of strength to the United Party and from which the United Party must seek its expansion potential. Now we find that in these organizations and bodies this spirit of liberalism is exerting a very strong influence. I want to mention a single example. You will remember, Sir, that just before we became a Republic a certain Nelson Mandela took the lead at a conference at Pietermaritzburg to urge that a national convention be held to draw up a multi-racial constitution for South Africa. That same person, who happens to be one of the persons who has now been found guilty in the Rivonia case, and who was the deputy-leader of the A.N.C.&#x2014;and everybody knows by this time that the A.N.C. was a communist organization, and even after it went underground it continued to be communistic&#x2014;also set afoot an organization to proclaim a country-wide strike of non-Whites in order to stop us from becoming a Republic. That failed, but when he had to become a fugitive as the result of his subversive actions the same Nelson Mandela managed to get his messages published continually in a certain section of our Press. He was supposed to have telephoned the editorial offices, and so doing full publicity was given to his attempts. But we remember that a then front-bencher of the Opposition, the hon. member for Wynberg, fully associated himself with the actions of Mandela and that he also insisted on a multiracial convention to draft a multi-racial constitution for South Africa. This action on the part of the organs supporting the United Party and their front-benchers, and particularly the speech last Saturday of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), have a very clear meaning to me if I look at an article which was published at that time, just before we became a Republic, in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> written by Stanley Uys&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The White Opposition finds itself in a difficult situation on the eve of the Republic. It has little or no enthusiasm for the events <span class="col_8181-8182" refersTo="page_0425"/>which will take place in Pretoria on Wednesday. It is sending along some representatives purely out of politeness. It would prefer to be attending a multi-racial convention to draw up a new constitution for South Africa. After much experimentatipn, the Opposition has reached the conclusion that a multi-racial convention must be the starting-point for a new approach to race policies. Whites and non-Whites must sit round the same table and discuss the future.</block>

<p>That has now been given due meaning, these views of one of the worst liberals in South Africa, after the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville on Saturday, in which he violently attacked the Government because they are supposed to lock up the so-called political prisoners and do not give them the opportunity to exercise their political rights. Those people who are now in prison as the result of sabotage and other crimes are the people who wanted to hold this convention. It is the extreme liberals who insisted on the holding of this national convention, which amounts to nothing else, as now becomes very clear from the agitation by the <i>Cape Times</i> and the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i>than that they want to see a majority government in the country. All these bodies and organs and persons are playing into the hands of the liberals who are exercising influence on the Opposition and already have a very strong influence on the Opposition. That is why I say the Opposition also has a responsibility towards this country.</p>

<p>The A.N.C. is communistic out and out and it was also protected by these newspapers which are the spokesmen of liberalism in South Africa. So we find that on 23 March of that same year, before we became a Republic, the <i>Cape Times</i> said the following in a leading article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Among the Africans is the comparatively moderate and relatively responsible A.N.C., but its leaders are banned, its influence negligible in the vital task of recruiting to the side of law and order the large number of traditionally law-abiding Africans.</block>

<p>In that way this communist organization was protected by this newspaper, which is also one of the organs of liberalism which has an influence on the Opposition against which they should be warned that this organ is busy protecting the A.N.C. We also find that the same newspaper is busy propagating a multiracial government, and we saw that particularly recently when it had a quarrel with the <i>Burger,</i> and it does so deliberately, and it admits that a multi-racial government will mean that the majority of non-Whites will rule the country. It propagates it deliberately. We find the same phenomenon in the Rand newspapers, where there was also a quorum between the <i>Star</i> and the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> also propagates a majority government, i.e. a Black government. Those are the organs of liberalism whose influence is becoming stronger. But there are also other sources from which the United Party gets its inspiration and its strength. So we find that the Christian Council of South Africa, which consists of a large number of English churches, attacked the Government in regard to the 90-day clause, and they tried to give a Christian slant to the whole matter, but that same Christian Council quite forgot about its Christian spirit during the last war when Afrikaners were detained without trial indefinitely. Now it is so concerned about the rule of law where Bantu are concerned, but in those years when Afrikaners were concerned it was not concerned about the rule of law.</p>

<p>Another source from which the United Party draws its strength is the English-speaking universities. We find that at the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Cape Town there are no fewer than five listed communists on the staff, and there are also a large number of self-confessed liberals. Those are the people who have to give guidance to the future leaders of the United Party. In those universities we find various leftist organizations. In the 1950&#x2019;s, after the Communist Party was banned, the Students&#x2019; Liberal Association was established, of which, <i>inter alia,</i> Goldreich, Wolpe, Hepple and Slovo were members. Is it surprising that such people received their training there and that these universities are the breeding-grounds of liberalism, when listed communists are on the staff? There is another one, the Human Rights Society.</p>

<p>That hon. member, who is not a leftist, has a duty to raise his voice against the influence which is getting a hold on the universities where the children of the members of his party study. As I say, there is the Human Rights Society, of which the leader was a certain E. Hall, who is now serving six months&#x2019; imprisonment for promoting the objects of Communism. We find that the founder of this Association was a certain Ben Turok, who was also the founder or the chairman of the Congress of Democrats, the successor to the Communist Party, and he also is serving a sentence of imprisonment for sabotage. But it is not only these leftist organizations which flourish there and where liberals were deliberately trained at those universities, but we have also heard much about Nusas. We see the role which Nusas played at these universities. We now find that the United Party, through the hon. member for Yeoville, also takes this leftist organization under its wing, in spite of its connections with communist organizations overseas. In view of the fact that these leftist movements and the spirit of liberalism are so prevalent in the sources from which the United Party has to draw its strength, is it then surprising that the liberals already have such a hold on that party? Is it surprising that this Session has revealed that the liberals in that <span class="col_8183-8184" refersTo="page_0426"/>party have obtained a hold on that party and have come out with their ideas?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Winburg (Mr. Sadie) is extremely worried about the politics of students at our various universities. I have always believed that the primary function of a university was to get students to think. If they happen to think askew for a while, it does not matter very much, provided they come right in the end. I believe students throughout the world are much the same. I can remember the student union at Oxford taking a decision that it would not fight for king and country, but those who supported the motion fought as well as those who voted against it. I think the first public meeting I ever broke up was one, held by Mr. Sam Kahn when he was forming a party which the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) supported afterwards. But he changed his point of view, as I did mine. I believe in essence there is no harm in our students to-day. I believe that Nusas has the wrong leadership at the moment; we have repudiated it; we have made it quite clear what our attitude is. I think these young men and women are well able to put their own house in order, given the opportunity, and I do not think that hon. members opposite are doing the students of South Africa a service to make them think that they are so important that they are worthy of debate in this House. Sir, student politics has always been of an ephemeral kind; it changes from year to year, from month to month and from almost day to day, depending on the people who are there.</p>

<p>But, Sir, certain issues have been raised in the course of this debate, three of which I want to deal with very rapidly before I come to the main things I want to say in support of the amendment. The first is that suggestions have been made in the course of this debate that we on this side of the House refused to support the Government led by Dr. Malan when they wished to incorporate the protectorates in the Union of South Africa and that therefore we must carry some responsibility for the fact that those protectorates are not part of the Republic at the present time. Sir, I said while those suggestions were being made that certain of the members making those suggestions did not know what they were taking about, and for that reason I have looked up the amendment which was moved by the then Leader of the United Party, Mr. Strauss, to Dr. Malan&#x2019;s proposal. What is interesting is that from correspondence between Dr. Malan and Mr. Strauss, the then Leader of the Opposition, in 1954&#x2014;not in 1952 as has been indicated by hon. members opposite&#x2014;it is clear that Dr. Malan orginally thought of proceeding in terms of Section 151 of the old South Africa Act. It is clear too that he was dissuaded from taking that course, and I think the then Leader of the Opposition did a service to South Africa in dissuading Dr. Malan from taking that course. Nevertheless the then Prime Minister came with his motion before the House, to which Mr. Strauss moved this amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This House, while convinced that the mutual interests of the Union of South Africa and of Basutoland and the Protectorates of Bechuanaland and Swaziland will be best served by the transfer of their Government to the Union of South Africa in accordance with the spirit of the provisions of the South Africa Act, is of the opinion (a) that it is ill advised and imprudent to attempt to re-enforce diplomatic negotiation by parliamentary pressure and (b) that negotiation should, as in the past, be conducted by the two Government&#x2019;s untramelled by parliamentary commitments. This House confidently urges the Government to take steps to have the proceedings relative to the question now under its consideration expunged from its record and thereafter, on the usual diplomatic level and in accordance with the spirit of the approaches made by all former Prime Ministers of the Union, to reopen negotiations with the Government of the United Kingdom at the stage reached at the outbreak of the war in 1939.</block>

<p>Then there are just two other matters to which I think the attention of the House should be drawn. I was the last speaker before the hon. the Minister replied and this is what I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We fear that by adopting the method that he has adopted, the hon. the Prime Minister has not advanced our case for the claims of these protectorates, which it is the policy of both sides of the House that they should come to the Union of South Africa as soon as possible.</block>

<p>Then, Sir, we have the reply of the then Prime Minister in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first point that struck me is that in this debate a great measure of unanimity has been revealed. I am not referring now to the amendments. As far as this unanimity <span class="col_8185-8186" refersTo="page_0427"/>is concerned it covers both parts of the motion. The first is the desirability of the protectorates being transferred to the Union in terms of the provisions of the South Africa Act. In that regard there is no difference of opinion.</block>

<p>This was said by the then Prime Minister, Dr. Malan, &#x201C;in that regard there is no difference of opinion&#x201D;, and yet hon. members opposite come here and say that there was a difference of policy between us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every member who has spoken here has adopted the attitude that that is desirable, that it was more than desirable. That was decided in anticipation in the South Africa Act. That is an important matter in regard to which we are <i>ad idem.</i></block>

<p>Then just one further passage; the then Prime Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The whole difference is supposed to be entirely in connection with the method that has been adopted. It is alleged that we have adopted the wrong tactic. That is the only difference.</block>

<p>And, Sir, the proof of the pudding came in the eating because ever since 1925 it had been accepted that there would be consultation with the people of the Protectorates prior to any transfer. As the result of this motion what happened? We had a resolution in the House of Commons that there would be no transfer, not without consultation but without consent. That was the tragedy of the debate, which hon. members opposite are now trying to exploit for their own purposes. The tragedy was that as the result of the activities of hon. gentlemen on that occasion, those protectorates were placed beyond our grasp at that time, because whereas in the past it had been accepted that there would be consultation and consultation did not mean consent, the House of Commons passed a resolution that there would be no transfer without consent.</p>

<p>The second matter that I wanted to deal with is one which I felt should be mentioned before this House went into recess. Sir, we are reaching the end of the session, a most important session for South Africa but one in which we are still faced with a dark cloud of uncertainty hanging over the country because of the position in South West Africa. These events affect not only the Government but they affect the people of South Africa. Therefore I do not want to say anything to make that cloud darker or to complicate the problem even further, but I think it is wrong that we should go into recess without having some clarity on certain matters. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we accept that South West Africa has a peculiar international status. It does not belong to us as part of the Republic of South Africa. I think the second thing is that its people, its European population, are our people and their lives and their future are interwoven with those of the people of the Republic. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned our objective is to see the day when the people of South West Africa, of all races, appeal to us to become part and parcel of the Republic of South Africa. That would be evidence of a measure of self-determination which no one in the world could oppose. But, Sir, I want to warn this Government&#x2014;and I am going to leave it at that&#x2014;that by their race policies and by the poor relations that they have established with the outside world, they may easily create a state of affairs where our objective may become impossible.</p>

<p>Then there is a third matter, and that is that in the course of this debate there has been mention of the trial known as the Rivonia trial, which has ended in life sentences for eight of the accused and the acquittal of one. Attempts have been made to use that trial and what happened for political purposes.</p>

<p>I want to say quite clearly that we of the Opposition want it on record, so that not only this House will know but so that the outside world will know too, that we are convinced that the verdicts in that trial were just, that they were necessary and that they were right in view of the actions to which the accused themselves pleaded guilty. Those findings were arrived at by one of South Africa&#x2019;s great Judges, a man who has proved himself not only a learned jurist but a wise man. In his judgment he pointed out that these men were guilty of treasonable activity. I want to say that if I have any regret then my only regret is that they were not charged with high treason, and I have that regret for this reason that if the prosecution could have sustained such a charge&#x2014;and I believe it could have done so in the light of what the Judge has said&#x2014;the world would have understood the outcome of this case very much better than it does at the moment. You, see, Sir, our law of treason is based on the tested principles of Roman-Dutch Law, a wonderful combination of Roman juris-prudence and, if I may say so, Western European commonsense. It is perhaps a pity that the State preferred to bring charges based upon statutes passed by this Government since they came into power and not charges based upon high treason according to our common law, which is universal, eternal and well understood by the nations of the outside world. Sir, since attempts have been made at political capital in regard to this trial, I want to say that <span class="col_8187-8188" refersTo="page_0428"/>what concerns one is not the fact that these criminals were found guilty as the result of magnificent work by the police, on which I believe they are to be congratulated&#x2014;I believe that that is entirely satisfactory&#x2014;but what concerns one is that they seem to have had a significant degree of support from the voteless section of our population and that the conviction of these criminals was preceded, as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) pointed out, by the conviction, either judicially or by executive action, of more than 1,000 people held at the present time in our jails in South Africa for offences of a kind which must be described as political. I want to say that that is a warning to South Africa. I believe that the matter to which we have to turn our minds during the recess is why South Africa should have such political unrest; why there should be such a large number of political crimes.</p>

<p>It is my sincere conviction&#x2014;and I believe it is the sincere conviction of my party&#x2014;that probably one of the major reasons for the support of this underground, political seething in South Africa is the fact that millions of people of South Africa are denied legitimate political outlets. You see, Sir, it is one of the axioms of political science that every government generates opposition in time. Wise Governments accept opposition: it is a legitimate part of the organization of this State; unwise Governments deny people opportunities for expression; they deny opposition, and that very often leads to attempts at illegal political expression.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, the Government denies sections of the population such a voice, and I believe they are denying it at their peril and at the peril of the State. The hon. member asks whether Wolpe and Goldreich did not have representation? Of course they had representation. You will find rebels, communists, revolutionaries and the like in every state in the world. That does not worry me; what worries me is the fact that they got support. It is that that worries me. I believe that had we had another Government with a different approach we would have had a very different situation in this country.</p>

<p>Having dealt with those three preliminary matters, I now want to deal with certain matters in connection with our policy. There have been many attempts to compare the policy of the Government with the policy of the Opposition. The attempts in the past have been confined to a comparison between our policies in the sphere of race relations. I want to carry this comparison a little further to-day. I want to carry it a little further in support of the motion which is before the House at the present moment, a motion in which it is suggested that the Government, collectively and individually, are incompetent and unfit to govern South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to start by saying a word or two about agriculture. What has interested me so much, Sir, that while there has been consistent criticism from this side of the House of the agricultural policies of the Government at the present time, there has not been one informed reply to those criticisms from the Government benches during the course of this debate. There has not been one reply that has met the criticisms which have been launched from this side of the House. If I were to be asked to-day what the Government&#x2019;s policies were in respect of the problems with which agriculture was faced in South Africa, what solutions the Government were offering, then I would be reduced to having to say I think their policies are fourfold. The first is fewer farms. They are managing that all right, Sir. I would say their second solution is a system of price manipulation, a system of price manipulation which has perhaps had its worse outlet in respect of the dairy industry and which has resulted in the fact that throughout the country to-day you see dairy herds of established old dairy farmers up for sale. And while that is going on in the country we have the position that butter and cheese have to be imported because we cannot meet the needs of our own people. I would say the third thing this Government was doing was that it was departing from the principles of the Marketing Act laid down by Statute. You see, Sir, we accepted under the Marketing Act that the farmer was entitled to his cost of production and a reasonable reward for his labour. But now we hear from this Minister that supply and demand have to be taken into account, that if <span class="col_8189-8190" refersTo="page_0429"/>the farmer wants economic freedom, he cannot have price support from the State. In other words, the hon. gentleman is departing from the principles of the Marketing Act. Go and read the report of the Mealie Board, Sir, and you will see how often &#x201C;vraag en aanbod&#x201D; is mentioned whereas it was not in the past. Their fourth solution is the solution they mention in the report of the Food and Agricultural Organization, namely, farm planning. For farm planning you need farm economists, you need agricultural economists. I believe the position at the moment is such that there are so few agricultural economists that if we are to proceed at the rate at which the Government has been proceeding over the past eight or ten years it would take at least 80 years to plan the farms of South Africa that are in difficulty at the present time. By contrast we on this side of the House have proposed alternative policies. We have asked the Government to accept that there are short-term solutions and long-term solutions; that there must be assistance to the farmers during the period when a change-over is necessary; that something must be done to build up internal markets. We have spoken to them about the importance of getting markets overseas; we have spoken to them about what was being done by the Australians in Japan and what was being done by Australia and New Zealand to take our dairy markets away from us in Rhodesia. Nyassaland and in the countries immediately to the north of us, despite the long haul to get their goods there. What have we had from this Government? We have had a lot of talk but nothing has been done.</p>

<p>We have had the further problem in which we differ from this Government. We have drawn their attention time and again to the fact that many farmers are leaving the land. We have asked them how they are going to resettle these people and their families? What is the Government going to do about them? In almost every civilized country in the world where this process is taking place it is regarded as a sociological problem for which the Government takes responsibility. When I was in the United States of America, I remember Professor Piston delivered a report on the Goals Committee for Americans, a committee specially appointed by the President. I remember his dealing with this very problem of how the agriculturist who has been forced off the land should be settled and what steps the State should take to see that he is dealt with as a sociological problem.</p>

<p>Only two years ago I was in Holland. In Hardenberg, in the Province of Overyssel, after the war, they found themselves in the position that that province had the highest birth rate in Holland&#x2014;22 per 1,000 as opposed to the national average of 13 per 1,000; that that province had the largest number of unemployed; that they had the highest percentage of smallholdings; over 76 per cent of their holdings were under 10 hectare. What did they do, Sir? The Government tackled the problem and they reduced the percentage of the population in that province engaged in agriculture from 54 per cent in 1947 to 20 per cent in 1960 and they found work for those people who were forced off the farm in their own province. What is this Government doing about the same problem? They had land reform schemes in Holland, equivalent to our farm planning, but they had economists. They did the job properly. They went further and declared it a development area. There were liberal grants and subsidies for people establishing industries in that area. Now tell me, Sir, what have we got from this Government to meet the position of those farmers which this hon. Deputy Minister tells us are going to be forced off the land every year for the next five years. The furthest we have got was the hon. the Prime Minister talking about the Orange River scheme in the Other Place.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. gentleman wants to explain what he said I am perfectly happy. I am perfectly happy and I accept his explanation. But why should I quote that hon. gentleman? He is not an authority. Let me quote instead the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. The only difference between the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs and the Economic Advisory Council is that the Economic Advisory Council says the farmers will leave the land at the rate of 2,600 per year and not 2,400 over the next five years. [Interjections.] What have we had from this Government? We have had statements from the hon. the Prime Minister in the Other Place about the Orange River scheme and possible resettlement of these people.</p>

<p>I come to another point where there is a difference of opinion which has appeared only too clearly during this Session. How is the manpower shortage being handled in this country by this Government? We have had the hon. the Minister of Labour telling us that he is doing his best with immigration, but that it is not adequate; that he is quite satisfied that it cannot solve the problem. We have the statement from the hon. the Prime Minister in an earlier debate in this House that the matter was still being studied and considered. That was five months ago, Sir. We have not got the answer yet. We do not know what they are doing. We have suggested that there should be a crash programme. We have suggested that this matter should be tackled. We said we felt job reservation should be done away with. We said we felt there should be even more activity in regard to immigration. We suggested five important matters that could be tackled by this Government. We suggested first of all that the salaries of the technical staff in our Civil <span class="col_8191-8192" refersTo="page_0430"/>Service, in our technical colleges and our universities should be increased so as to put an end to this drain on our brain power in South Africa. We said that steps should be taken to raise the salaries and to improve the position of our school teachers in South Africa to try to attract those back who had left the profession. We said further that we would relax discrimination against overseas professional qualifications as long as that was necessary to alleviate the crippling shortages. We suggested that it should be made a condition of all Government contracts, other things being equal, that the contracts should go to those firms which employed a certain percentage of people over 45 years of age. We spoke about the necessity of giving assistance to every child to continue his education to the maximum of his ability. What has been done, Sir? We have been talking about this now for more than a year. We have raised it in this House but not one single plan has come from the Government in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>Let us take another matter, the question of the siting of industry. The Government tell us they stand for decentralization. We also stand for the decentralization of industry. But there is no doubt whatsoever, Sir, that as far as the Government is concerned the emphasis is on border industries. Because there is an emphasis on border industries there has been a neglect of many of the underdeveloped areas. As a result of the emphasis on border industries and the preferences and advantages they are giving to many of those industries we find an adverse affect in certain of the existing areas. We find that there are restrictions on Native labour which is making industrial development difficult in certain areas. We are told that Bantu labour is going to be replaced by Coloured labour in the Western Cape. I wonder what inducement that is to industrialists to establish themselves here? We, by contrast, have suggested to the Government that if they want to decentralize industry, surely they should decentralize it to those platteland towns who are losing their population, those platteland towns where there is power, water, markets and means of transport. We pointed out what an economic stimulus that would give to the entire country. What have we had? We have had some of their experts, even a man like Dr. van Eck, talking in that direction. What has been done by this Government? Look at their record through this Session. We have raised this matter time and again. We were politely met but nothing happened.</p>

<p>They talk about establishing industries in the reserves. What industries have been established in the reserves in the nine years this Government has been on the job? But they still refuse to have White skill, White capital and White initiative in those reserves. Those industries must be established by the Bantu, they say and what has happened? Exactly nothing is happening, Mr. Speaker. Those industries are just not being established.</p>

<p>Let us take another matter, Sir. Take the steps to eliminate poverty in South Africa amongst all races. What has been the Government&#x2019;s approach this Session, led by this stony-hearted Minister of Finance? What has it been? A minimum of relief, a harsh means test, the subjection of economic laws to ideological considerations, the acceptance of the idea seemingly that the poor will always be with us, reaping our com while it is green and not seeing to it that our young people are getting adequate and sufficient training. By contrast, Sir, we suggested that the means test should be relaxed, that there should be a national contributing pension scheme. When we suggested that we were told the Government could not afford it. When we speak of a national contributory pension scheme, supplemented by social pensions, we are told the Government cannot afford it. But what is his surplus? R 128,000,000, and it probably will be greater still by the time he has sorted it all out. What is being done from the point of view of assistance to the child for his education? We want to see a proper recognition of economic laws as opposed to ideologies. We want to see a more dynamic policy for industrial expansion, we want to see a greater recognition of the part that women can play in our economic life. Time and again we have said &#x201C;equal pay for equal work for women&#x201D;. We have asked for tax relief. What have we got? We have spoken about family allowances, and what have we got? We have spoken about a medical aid scheme. And what have we got from this Government? I said that if you start comparing policies, you begin to understand why it is we feel that this Government is not doing the job. Whenever one talks about the policies of the two sides of this House, one is always returned to Bantu Affairs, to race relations, because that seems to be the only thing that hon. members on the other side can talk about. I will not disappoint them. We are not afraid to meet them on that field.</p>

<p>I have compared in the past the dangers in the policies of this Government and the dangers in the policies of this side of the House, and I have shown very conclusively how much more dangerous is the policy of the Government than is the policy of this side of the House. In the course of this Session, I think, we have had two new issues emerging, and I think the first of those issues is the complete frustration we are finding today amongst the detribalized urban Natives. Some of them are being told that they will have a vote in a future Bantustan, some of them have been given a vote in the Transkei. They are settled here in our urban areas, Sir, They are completely detribalized. Mr. Speaker, we would like to see those people with a proper sense of function, we would like to see them feeling that they belong, that they have a function and that they are part and parcel of the machinery of the State. I think there is another danger which is developing, and that is this myth that the Government is going to manage to reverse the flow of Bantu from the urban areas back to the reserves in 1976 or 1978, or some other date in the distant future.</p>

<p><span class="col_8193-8194" refersTo="page_0431"/>I want to say that all the evidence at my disposal and my own belief is that that flow will never be reversed under this Government, or any other government, and it will not be reversed in 1978 or at any other date. I think that the fact that the flow is still strongly in the other direction anct that it is growing in volume, exposes the complete hollowness of this theory of Bantustans, and is one of the main causes for the frustration which is attaching to the detribalized Bantu. At least under the policy which we advocate those people would have a stake in the maintenance of law and order. We believe they should have home-ownership in their own townships, in and around our industrial areas. Separate residential areas, but home-ownership. We believe they should have undisturbed family life. We believe we must consider again a system of pass exemptions. We believe that they should have the rights attaching to domicile, which has been taken away from them by the recent legislation of this Government. We believe steps should be taken to foster the emergence of a Native middle-class. We believe they should have a sense of belonging in the sense of function, that they must be given opportunities for political expression.</p>

<p>If you compare the policies of that side of the House with the policies of this side of the House what do you find? You find on that side of the House a barren government debarred of any new ideas in dealing with the problems with which we are faced at the present time. You find an Opposition, Sir, that for many years now has been pressing for changes which most reasonable men believe should be given. You find on that side of the House a Government which is unable to get the goodwill of the nations of the outside world because of the stubborn manner in which it is sticking to policies which are not in the best interest of South Africa, and which most of the world believes are going to lead to trouble and difficulties. We have on this side of the House a party which has taken its decisions in the best interests of South Africa, a party which believes that that will not only lead to more racial goodwill, quicker economic development and higher standards of living for everybody, but as an added pasella will get the goodwill of other portions of the world as well.</p>

<p>I must say that he was preceded by much better batsmen. But at least he can say that he did not take up his full time, and for that I am grateful to him. He simply gave himself out and started walking back to the pavilion.</p>

<p>Sir, there are just a few points that I want to deal with. A few general points have been made here which affect me more particularly <span class="col_8195-8196" refersTo="page_0432"/>and with which I want to deal for a moment. I come first to the hon. member for Yeoville. The hon. member also ventured on to the slippery path of finance. As you know, Sir, if you have any knowledge of skating, it is always a very difficult thing for an amateur to keep his balance when he skates on ice. The hon. member for Yeoville says that the Minister alleges that the surplus cannot be given back to the taxpayer because of the danger of inflation. What is the true position? Of this surplus of R128,000,000 R88,000,000 is being spent for the direct benefit of the taxpayer&#x2014; R6,500,000, on taxation relief and R52,000,000 on Defence, R8,000,000, which otherwise would have had to be raised by way of taxation, is for general Government expenditure. R5.100,000 for increased pensions and R 16,000,000 for expenditure on Loan Account. Surely the expenditure of these amounts, which all come directly out of the surplus of R 128,000,000, directly benefits the taxpayers.</p>

<p>The only amount which does not benefit the taxpayer at the moment is this sum of R40,000,000. Of that sum, R20,000,000 is being deposited in the Special Defence Account. The taxpayer will not necessarily get the benefit of that amount this year but if he does not get it this year he will probably get it next year. That amount will be available for Defence expenditure and to that extent therefore it will not be necessary to impose higher taxation on the taxpayer. As to the balance which is not being spent at the moment, that is to say, the R20.000.000 which is being deposited in a Taxation Reserve Account, that amount has already been discussed by the House, it will not benefit the taxpayer immediately but it is being kept in trust for him and it will be given to him next year or when the time is ripe for it, when the fiscal and economic position is such that that amount can safely be given to him together with the other amounts.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I was dealing with the few clumsy points made by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) in connection with Finance. He said that I was scared of inflation. In this regard hon. members opposite make the most contradictory statements. Some members say that there is no inflation; others say that the danger of inflation is much greater than I realize. But the hon. member for Yeoville comes along and says in his wisdom that other countries like the U.S.A., for example, are giving, taxation relief without any fear of inflation. I want to point out that in the United States they have a single Budget, not two Budgets as we have in this country, a single Budget which covers all expenditure (both on Capital Account and on Current Account) to be defrayed from the normal Budget, and that fact makes a great difference as far as taxation relief is concerned.</p>

<p>The second point is that the level of taxation in the U.S.A, is infinitely higher than it is in this country and that is why they are under a greater obligation and under greater pressure to grant taxation relief. In the U.S.A, company taxation, for example, is 521 per cent in comparison with 30 per cent in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Do they have the principle of apportionment there as they have in Britain?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not think so. We have heard a great deal about taxation relief that is going to be given in the U.S.A. I do not want to go into the question of personal tax, but as far as company tax is concerned they propose to reduce it within the next few years from 521 per cent to 48 per cent whereas in this country it is only 30 per cent!</p>

<p>The third difference is that in the U.S.A, there is a comparatively high degree of unemployment (between 5 per cent and 6 per cent) which greatly reduces the risk of inflation. They do not face the difficulty there of a possible bottleneck owing to a shortage of labour. They are anxious to solve their unemployment problem and that is why there is much less danger of inflation in the U.S.A, than there is in this country. But a further and a most important difference is that the U.S.A, is not as vulnerable as South Africa is as far as inflation is concerned. South Africa is a gold-producing country and any increase in costs caused by inflation could have a crippling effect on the development of our gold mines. I think I stated here last year that an increase of 25 per cent in the cost structure per ton of ore milled would mean that gold to the value of R 11,000,000 to R12,000,000 would remain underground, unexploited. As far as our industries are concerned it must be remembered that they have to compete in the foreign market and if there is a great increase in the cost structure of this country as the result of inflation, our industries which have to compete in the international market will not be able to maintain their present high level of exports. I say therefore that in this country the danger of inflation, because its consequences can be so much more serious, is so much greater.</p>

<p>A third point which the hon. member for Yeoville made was that the Government was not doing enough to help the farmers. Government members have already replied to this criticism but just to refresh the memory of the hon. member I want to refer him to the figures for 1964-5. Agricultural subsidies now <span class="col_8197-8198" refersTo="page_0433"/>amount to R40,000,000. This includes subsidies on fertilizers, butter, maize, wheat, fodder under the drought loan scheme, rehabilitation under the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act, loans for seed, fertilizer and fuel. This amount does not benefit the farmers only; to a certain extent it is also used to subsidize consumers&#x2019; prices, but the fact remains that many of these schemes were instituted to place the farmer in a better position in times of drought. I have also stated that out of this windfall we have specially set aside R2,000,000 for the raising of dam walls in the drought-stricken Northern Transvaal to make sure that there will be no repetition next year of the position which obtains there this year. Furthermore, there is the technical assistance given to farmers by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services at a cost of R22,500,000, which is much more than the amount spent 10 or 20 years ago. This represents direct assistance given to the farmers and it has enabled them to reduce their production costs per unit. These are all things which we have done for the farmers in this Budget. That is all I need say in reply to the hon. member for Yeoville. Perhaps the hon. member will see that he is better informed before he again ventures to deal with a subject in respect of which his knowledge is clearly very limited.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) said that certain hire-purchase institutions were evading the provisions of the Usury Act. Generally speaking the Government prefers to rely on free competition to protect the consumer from exploitation, but I am quite prepared to go into this matter and to see whether there are any grounds for departing from the general principle followed by the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will forgive me for disposing rather hurriedly of these few criticisms on financial matters before I proceed to make a few general observations. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) made a few statements which also call for some comment. He said that decentralization of industry was being encouraged for political rather than for economic reasons. I want to tell the hon. member that both reasons are important. There are certain border areas which are eminently suitable for the establishment of industries, quite apart from the political aspect of the matter. In any event if the political objective is of the utmost importance to the future stability of this country &#x2014;and I maintain that it is&#x2014;then we are quite correct in encouraging decentralization to achieve that objective, but that is not the sole purpose of decentralization. The general policy, not only in this country but in other countries as well, when there are certain areas of the country in which opportunities of employment are scarce, is to establish industries in those areas rather than to shift the population in those areas to the existing industrial areas. That principle is one which is generally recognized and it is being applied at the present time in countries like England and Holland.</p>

<p>The hon. member then proceeded to make a rather strange statement. He said that the Government must declare war agains waste; so far I entirely agree with him. The Opposition found it necessary to criticize inefficiency in certain departments, including Finance. I have already said that we are investigating the point which they made here with regard to Finance. A tremendous amount has been done, by means of the merit system that we introduced and by applying O and M methods, to make the Public Service efficient and much more efficient than it ever was in the days when hon. members opposite were in power. Then the hon. member proceeded to make the allegation that the Minister should really have budgeted for a deficit; that it only encouraged waste to budget for a surplus! That was the proposition he advanced, but I do not think he will find a great deal of support for that proposition amongst economists because I think it is generally accepted to-day that deficit budgeting may in fact have the effect of encouraging inflation. That is what the hon. member wants, and what we want to do is to try to check inflation. I shall come in a moment to the reasons why I feel so strongly that every effort should be made to check inflation by means of fiscal methods. The hon. member then goes on to say that it is becoming more and more difficult to justify the retention of import control. I do not know whether he is aware of the extent to which import control has been relaxed over the past 12 months, but that fact will be brought home to him if he looks at our import figures and compares them with those of the previous year. We relaxed import control to such an extent that during the first four months of 1964 our imports were 27.7 per cent higher than they were during the corresponding period last year, in 1963, and 46 per cent higher than during the first four months of 1962. In actual fact import control is no longer a retarding factor. We have already seen what the effect of these relaxations has been on our reserves. We have relaxed import control to such an extent that in the past year our reserves have not grown to the same extent as they did in 1962-3.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member goes on to say that it is very difficult at the present time to justify the retention of exchange control. I do now know whether the hon. member has read what the <i>Financial Mail</i> says in this regard. The <i>Financial Mail</i> is not an authority which I frequently quote but, after all, anybody can be right once in a while! I do not know whether the hon. member has read what the <i>Financial Mail</i> says. Up to a year ago the <i>Financial Mail</i> held the same view as the hon. member, but it has now changed its mind completely; it now admits that under the circumstances of South Africa the best policy is to retain exchange control. This exchange control has also protected oversea investors with the result that at the present time over <span class="col_8199-8200" refersTo="page_0434"/>sea shareholders, practically without exception, are able to obtain higher prices for their South African shares overseas than they were able to get when exchange control was instituted in June 1961. In spite of this there is a considerable margin between prices on the London Stock Exchange and on the Johannesburg Exchange; the margin is about 20 per cent, and this is largely due to the strong demand for shares in South Africa. The abolition of control could have the effect of entirely disrupting the local share market, and that indeed is the crux of the argument advanced by the <i>Financial Mail.</i> Oversea investors have ample facilities for the repatriation of their money. I have referred on several occasions in the past to the various ways that we have offered to them to take their money out of the country if they wish to do so; that is to say, by selling shares overseas or by purchasing the special non-resident debentures locally. Good opportunities are available to them, and even if they sell their shares on the oversea market they can get a much higher price to-day than they were able to get when exchange control was instituted.</p>

<p>Lastly the hon. member referred to the restriction imposed on South African bank notes which may be taken out of the country by persons travelling overseas and to the refusal of the Reserve Bank to buy back the bank notes of oversea banks. He says that that is a poor advertisement for South Africa. I do not know whether it is a poor advertisement because I do not think it is necessary for any <i>bona fide</i> traveller to sell South African bank notes abroad. We allow them a reasonable amount that they can use upon their return to carry on with, but the amount that we used to allow offered an opportunity for the smuggling of capital out of the country, <i>inter alia,</i> by fugitives from South Africa. They took with them not only the permissible amount of R100 but more than that sum, and in this way they evaded exchange control. We have now closed this loophole. The harm that can be done by fugitives who smuggle capital out of the country outweighs any possible disadvantage to the Republic and its <i>bona fide</i> travellers, because we have seen already what they do with that money overseas.</p>

<p>I now come to a point which has frequently been made in the course of this Session and also in this debate, and that is that pensioners have had no share in the general prosperity that we have been enjoying in past years. I think it is just as well that I should set out the facts in this connection. I have figures here showing the increase <i>per capita</i>in the amounts received by pensioners as against real prices, which have been adjusted to allow for price fluctuations. Then I want to compare this increase <i>per capita</i> with the growth during the previous 15 years of our national income, which is the only effective test of general prosperity. I find that in 1947-8 the amount paid out for old-age pensions was R6,700,000. In 1962-3, 15 years later, the amount was R24,800,000. There are, of course, many more pensioners to-day than there were in 1947 and that is why I had these figures worked out on a <i>per capita</i> basis to ascertain how much our pensioners were receiving at the present time on a <i>per capita</i>basis in comparison with 15 years ago. But I was not content to leave it there; I wanted to reduce it to the same price level because after all, there has been an increase in prices over the years. I therefore adjusted the figure to allow for price fluctuations. I find that in 1947 old-age pensioners received an average of R169 on a <i>per capita</i> basis. In the same year, on the same basis, the net national income was R222 <i>per capita.</i> Now I come to the position 15 years later, and I find that old-age pensions increased from R169 to R288 while the net national income <i>per capita</i> rose from R222 to R305. These figures already reflect a big increase, but in order to bring out this point even more clearly I asked my officials to work out the average rate at which pensions were increased and the average rate of growth of the national income, and I find that during these 15 years pensions were increased at the rate of 3.6 per cent per annum and that the national income increased by 2.1 per cent per annum. Sir, I am not satisfied with these figures; I should like both to be higher. I should like to see an increase in both the national income and in pensions, but the point I want to make is that pensioners have had more than their share in the general prosperity of this country over the past 15 years. That is clearly borne out by these figures. I am not at all satisfied with the present pension, but we must remember that there must be some relationship between pensions and the national income, although over these 15 years&#x2014;not every year but on an average&#x2014;we find that on a <i>per capita</i> basis there was a bigger increase in pensions than there was in the national income.</p>

<p>Will the Minister give us a similar comparison with regard to the means test over this same period?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The means test has been taken into account in both cases. But let me give the hon. member another comparison. We admit that there has been a considerable increase in the wages of the average worker employed in industry. I only have the figures for five years as from 1959 but I find that during that period there has been an average increase of 3.7 per cent per annum in the wages of White workers employed in industry. I have not had an opportunity to work out the figure for the same period of 15 years but it should be considerably higher. This figure does not include the best years as far as the wages of industrial workers are concerned. But during the same period pensions have been increased by 3.6 per cent per annum. I think we must get away from the idea that the pensioner has not shared in the general prosperity. No <span class="col_8201-8202" refersTo="page_0435"/>evidence has been adduced to support that allegation. That general prosperity is reflected in the increase in the real national income on a <i>per capita</i> basis, and I say that on the same basis there has been a bigger increase in pensions, a fact for which I am thankful. [Interjection.] Sir, I cannot reply to further questions because my time is very limited and I still have a wide field to cover.</p>

<p>Hon. members have taken me to task for feeling so strongly that we should do nothing to hamper our economic growth or to fritter away our prosperity or to endanger our financial stability. The reason&#x2014;and I think that should be the reason of every one of us&#x2014;why I am so anxious that our economy should remain healthy and that we should retain our financial stability is that I realize the importance of a strong economy to our country in times such as these. It is always important, of course, but at this stage it is absolutely essential for our survival. That is why I am so obsessed with this idea. I do not want to go into details but let me just put this point to hon. members: If it had not been for the growth of our national economy and the improvement in our standard of living we would certainly not have succeeded to the same extent in maintaining industrial peace in this country and in combating the activities of agitators. This fact is one which is of tremendous value to us under present-day conditions and it is a fact which is also appreciated by our enemies. It seems to me sometimes that our enemies appreciate it better than some of our own people in South Africa who want me to spend money recklessly and endanger our financial stability. And it is because our enemies realize this that they are making these desperate attempts to undermine our economy because they know that if they succeed in undermining our economy it will be so much easier for them to prey upon us and that we will not be in such a strong position then to defend ourselves against aggression as we are at the moment. That is why they realize how important it is to try to break down our economy.</p>

<p>I cannot help coming to the conclusion when I think of this debate and of what has happened during this Session that the reason why the United Party frequently adopt an unSouth African attitude is because they are obsessed with the idea of denigrating the National Party and of running down and embarrassing the Government. I want to mention just three examples of what has happened during the course of this Session. I refer in the first place to the hon. member for Musgrave who on one occasion put certain questions to the Government, with the obvious object of embarrassing the Government, with regard to the conquered area in the Free State; he wanted to know whether this area would be handed over to Basutoland.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave never said anything of the kind.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Pardon me, it was the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman). Why does he ask that sort of question? Does he think it will do South Africa any good? The only object of the question is to attempt to embarrass the Government but the effect of it is to put all sorts, of conquest ideas info other people&#x2019;s minds. They forget about South Africa&#x2019;s interest; their sole idea is to embarrass the Government and to bring the Government to a fall. Then there is also the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). One would never have expected this from the hon. member but he read out lengthy extracts here from the judgment in the case of <i>The Star</i>v. <i>Die Transvaler</i> which was heard almost 20 years ago. Why? What useful object can it serve? This is an opportunity which the outside world will once again be able to grasp &#x2014;because they do not realize how many years ago this all happened&#x2014;to say that the Prime Minister of South Africa is a Nazi. That is the effect of it; I do not know whether that was the object.</p>

<p>But why was it necessary to read it out here? The third example I want to mention is what was done here this afternoon by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) when he tried to make excuses for the saboteurs. He says that they are guilty, of course, but that they were driven by the laws of this Government to do what they did.</p>

<p>Sir, if the Governments of other countries, hostile or otherwise, were to use this argument, if they were to say that the sentences in the Rivonia case are unfair, because they assume that what the hon. member for Durban (North) says is correct, and that these people were forced to do what they did, one could still understand it, but in making this point the United Party are only trying to score a debating Point&#x2014;and that is my accusation against the Opposition. All they are trying to do is to denigrate the Government. That is my accusation against the United Party. They are out to do one thing only and that is to see how they can disparage and embarrass the Government. There are many other examples that I could mention but I leave it at that.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words now with regard to the amendment which has been moved here and which says, amongst other things, that the Government have shown themselves to be collectively and individually incompetent and unfit to govern South Africa as a modem and developing State.

<p>Sir, when I listen to hon. members on the other side, I wonder whether it might not be a good thing to read out to them a letter which appears in this evening&#x2019;s <i>Argus.</i> The writer of this letter says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a traditional anti-Nationalist I have of late gone through a period of agonizing reappraisal regarding my political thinking. There are many aspects of Government policy I dislike&#x2014;S.A.B.C. news bias, petty apartheid, occasional outbursts against the English-speaking people, to name only a few.

<p>It does not matter who signed it. There are many other passages in this letter which are very interesting, but the point is that the man who expressed these sentiments is not the only person who feels this way; he is just an example of many others who think exactly as he does. But the hon. member comes along with an amendment which says that this Government is incompetent. I think perhaps I should quote a few further extracts from the letter from which I have just quoted. The writer goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nor can I longer doubt that these men, whatever individual faults we may see in them, are dedicated South Africans who, by resolute and unswerving purpose, have placed our country in the happy economic and peaceful position in which it finds itself to-day, particularly when compared with most of the rest of Africa.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have already said that we should really feel sorry for the Opposition. I am still sorry for them. But when I read in this amendment what they say about this Government, when I think of what the vast majority of the voters of South Africa think of the Government and in what light they regard <span class="col_8205-8206" refersTo="page_0437"/>the Opposition as an alternative Government, then I say that this amendment is an autobiography of the United Party because they are the people who are &#x201C;collectively and individually incompetent and unfit to govern South Africa as a modern and developing state and to lead South Africa through the difficulties that beset us both internally and externally&#x201D;. Those words aptly describe the United Party, and this debate has convinced me more than ever before that what they have tried to attribute in this amendment to somebody else, in an unconscious admission of guilt, actually applies to the United Party. It is with great confidence therefore that I move that this Bill be now read a second time.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That thee Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>I do not intend occupying the time of hon. members with a long introductory speech. If there are any points which I do not cover sufficiently in this introductory speech I shall be only too pleased to do so at a later stage. On this occasion, however, I should just like to explain briefly a few new principles contained in this Bill.</p>

<p>The most important one of those is the one which deals with the members of the Citizen Force and Clauses 1 to 4 and 6 to 14 deal with that. The present balloting system has been put to a severe test ever since the Act was passed in 1957 and it has now been found necessary to effect certain amendments in order to allow that military machinery to function more smoothly. Due to the fact that a citizen has to register during the month of January of the year within which he turns 17 and usually starts his training in the succeeding year, there is not enough time to comply with all the prescribed procedures relating to balloting and in addition give the citizen reasonable notice that his name has been drawn and the date on which he has to report for training. Administration becomes difficult and parents often complain that notification at the end of the year to the effect that the son must report for training early the next year creates problems in regard to plans for his academic or professional training. It has consequently been decided that citizens must register in the first quarter of the year in which they turn 16.</p>

<p>A new principle now follows. In terms of the existing Act the Exemption Board only has power to grant a postponement from balloting on application by a citizen or by somebody acting on his behalf or to agree not to include his name in the ballot list. After the balloting has taken place his training can only be postponed; he cannot be exempted from training. The result is that there is often duplication in that a citizen whose application for postponement or omission from the ballot list was refused again applies at a later stage <span class="col_8207-8208" refersTo="page_0438"/>for his training to be postponed on the same grounds. It also often happens that the circumstances of a citizen after his name has been drawn in the ballot change in such a way that to postpone his training really offers no solution; but the board has no power, as the law stands at the moment, to grant exemption from training in such circumstances.</p>

<p>The following is envisaged in terms of the proposed amendment:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) As I have already said in future a citizen will be obliged to register in his 16th year although, as at present, he will only undergo training in his 18 th year. That gives the Department of Defence an additional year in which to draw up the ballot lists, do the balloting itself, consider applications for postponement or exemption from training, allocate and notify the citizens, etc. Administration will consequently be facilitated and citizens will have certainty at a much earlier stage as far as their military training is concerned.</li>

<li>(b) In future no one will be able to apply that the inclusion of his name in the ballot list be postponed or omitted from the ballot list; Section 66 of the Act which provides for that, is being deleted completely. Instead of that a citizen whose name has been drawn in the ballot may now apply for postponement or exemption from training. The Exemption Board is now given the power to grant exemption from training, i.e. before a citizen has actually commenced his training. The amendment does not in actual fact, therefore, detract from the existing rights of a citizen. As a matter of fact it is definitely in his favour.</li>

<li>(c) Because the procedure relating to the postponement of the inclusion of a name in the ballot list or the omission of such a name is being done away with the names of all the citizens who have registered for training in the year concerned will be balloted and consequently the requirement that preliminary ballot lists be drawn up and posted up in magistrates&#x2019; offices falls away. As hon. members will remember the object of preliminary ballot lists was to notify citizens that their names will be subject to balloting and in order to give them an opportunity of submitting their applications for postponement or omission from the ballot list. That will no longer be necessary in future.</li>

<li>(d) In future the Exemption Board will also have the power, instead of granting exemption from training, to order that the member concerned be assigned to a commando. It often happens that a member for some <i>bona fide</i> reason or other cannot undergo the nine months Citizen Force training or complete it, while there is no reason why such a member cannot undergo the uninterrupted service prescribed for commandos, namely a maximum of 21 days in any one year. If the power of the Exemption Board is limited only to granting exemption from Citizen Force training in such cases members who are exempted in that way will completely escape military training unless provision is made in the Act in terms whereof they are forced to serve in the commandos.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since the publication of the Bill doubts have been expressed in various circles about the advisability of effecting the amendment envisaged in Clause 15 of the Bill and on further consideration I have therefore decided not to go ahead with the amendment to Section 83 of the Act. I shall, therefore, move in the Committee Stage that the clause concerned be deleted.</p>

<p>Legal power is granted in Clause 16 for the establishment of a fund from which all medical expenses incurred by Permanent Force pensioners, their families and dependants, will be defrayed. During his term of office a member will pay in an amount monthly, an amount which must still be decided upon on consultation with the Treasury, until he retires on pension from service. After his retirement he, his family and dependants will receive free medical treatment. For example, members who will retire shortly will first have to pay in a certain amount which has not yet been decided upon yet before they will be entitled to share in the facilities envisaged. I may just add that in the Police Amendment Bill a similar fund is envisaged for members of the South African Police Force.</p>

<p>The following and final clause I wish to refer to is Clause 17. I may just mention that sub-section (2) of Section 18 of the General Law Amendment Act of 1963 provides that if anybody should, without the permission of the person in charge of a place or area which has been decaired to be a protected place or area, enter such a place or who being inside such a place commits an offence, can be sentenced to 15 years&#x2019; imprisonment. In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 89 of the Defence Act the Minister of Defence may also prohibit or limit any person from entering such a military camp, barracks, shipyard, etc. by way of an order signed by him and published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> Although the object of these provisions in the General Law Amendment Act and in the Defence Act is precisely the same as far as this aspect is concerned, it is provided in the first mentioned Act that a sentence of imprisonment of a maximum of 16 years can be imposed in contrast to a sentence of R200 or 6 months&#x2019; imprisonment in the case of the lastmentioned Act.</p>

<p><span class="col_8209-8210" refersTo="page_0439"/>The object of the amendment set out in Clause 17 of the Bill before the House is therefore to obtain uniformity of punishment for the same offence.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid we on this side cannot go all the way with the Minister in his brief approach to the second reading of this Bill. But the Minister has, however, done quite a lot to clear the passage for this Bill by proposing to remove a certain clause. That Clause 15 was one of the main objections we had to this Bill but it having now been moved out of the way, the position has been decidedly eased. I want to point out however that this Bill is a fairly complicated piece of legislation. It applies to from 16,000 to 20,000 odd young fellows who each year will be called up for training. This Bill, if adopted, will also constitute a portion of our permanent defence legislation and consequently it requires very close examination even at this late stage of the session. We must make sure that what we place on the Statute Book now will not need still further amending, at least not in the near future.</p>

<p>The Minister himself has explained that a number of the provisions in the Bill before us have become necessary as the result of experience gained in the general build up of our defences and by the rapid and extensive defence expansion that has been necessary. Under those circumstances it could be expected that flaws would show up, especially as our existing legislation did not take into account such extensive development. So it can be said that these amendments deal primarily with defects which have shown themselves in the present legislation and aim at the smoother working of our defence legislation. Apart from the clauses in the Bill aimed at rectifying these defects, there are also clauses dealing with changes in the established procedure and organization to one of the most important features of our defence legislation, i.e. to the system under which trainees are called up, the general procedure they have to follow and particularly the grounds on which they can submit applications for deferment or exemption. This is a matter which is exercising the minds of quite a number of young people whose careers are being held in abeyance for the period they have to undergo military training. It is also a matter which has been exercising the minds of their families. It has been found necessary to make certain adjustments to the ballotee system itself, adjustment because of the experience which has been gained in the call-up scheme for trainees. But apart from this aspect, the Bill is also attempting to ease difficulties being experienced in certain phases of defence administration, difficulties which are the result of extra pressure, exceedingly heavy pressure in cases, placed on an organization which has not been able to develop as quickly as one would have hoped or as quickly as it was expected at the beginning to do in order to keep pace with the expanding trainee system itself.</p>

<p>The Bill deals with two types of trainees. In the first instance there is the ballotee trainee who is being called up as a result of being drawn in a ballot. The Minister has explained the changes in this respect in regard to age groupings. There will now be a longer time lag between registration and the date of actually reporting for duty. A time lag which must be to the benefit of both the defence administration and of the trainee himself, because a longer time is now available to deal with formalities, particularly those lads who feel they have a right to apply for an exemption and consequently must submit a number of forms. Hitherto these formalities have had to be completed in a very short time. This has been causing difficulties and even resentment to a certain extent amongst the people affected. It is now proposed by this Bill to lengthen this period an consequently a much easier approach will be possible because much more time will be available to dispose of all the necessary formalities. It will also be possible for the trainee himself to know well ahead of the time that he is due to report for training what the decision in his particular case is, i.e. whether he still has to go forward or not.</p>

<p>One other practical difficulty which has been experienced and where a welcome improvement is proposed by this Bill, is dealt with under Clause 2. That provides that a trainee may now be exempted where something unforeseen develops in connection with his home responsibilities. There is no provision in the existing defence laws to deal with such a situation. There is, for instance, the case of a lad who, as a result of a sudden death in his family, has to return home to take up the responsibility for the maintenance of the family. Hitherto it has not been possible to exempt that lad from the rest of his training period. Now, hoever, provision is made for that. This provision therefore meets a flaw in the existing legislation and will make for a smoother working of administration between the trainee and the defence authorities.</p>

<p>Another important provision is the one whereby a trainee, instead of getting a deferment or an exemption, can now be drafted to a commando in order to complete the unfinished portion of his military time. In other words, the commando system is being used for such trainees to work off their commitments to defence and thereby avoid a heavy interruption of his studies such as would have been the case had he obtained a deferment and had to make up the entire period at a later date.</p>

<p>But the proposed amendment does aim at making an improvement in this direction. This is another improvement which we can accept because it remedies harshness under the existing legislation.</p>

<p>One of the most important provisions of this Bill flows from the setting up of the Exemption Board under the Minister of Labour and which now forms a part of the trainee system. It is now being laid down fairly clearly, the grounds under which a trainee may apply and expect to receive exemption. These are generally well-founded grounds, mainly connected with the domestic affairs of the individual concerned, or with his education. Hitherto an application for deferment was in the nature of a ticket in a lottery sweep because the individual who wants to apply for exemption was never sure what would be the best grounds to go for. Consequently he was never sure of his fate. Now it is proposed to take into account interruption of studies&#x2014; whether they be university studies, studies for matric or technical studies. These matters will in future be taken into account. What is more, in Clause 13 the various grounds are set out on which a trainee can apply for exemption, and that, together with the longer period he now has available within which to apply, must assist those lads who feel they have justification for applying for a deferment or exemption. There is however one aspect of this in regard to which I should like to have the Minister&#x2019;s attention Let me say at this stage that this Bill has been published quite a long time ago and consequently we have had ample time to study it. Now, one of the reasons for exemption aims at the avoidance of calling up students who have either just commenced, or are in the course of their studies for a degree of whatever professional qualification they may want to attain. In many cases these young men are equipping themselves for vocations constituting key positions in any modern defence force. If ever they should be forced to go into action, they may be in a position to provide the scientific and technical background on which the force itself depends in respect of so much of its equipment and type of action. Consequently it is important that their studies should not be interrupted. It seems to me therefore that, particularly in view of the provisions of this Bill, somewhere along the line there has been a pretty serious slip up, because over the last couple of weeks a very large number of students, some of them already in their final year of study and others in their second year, have received call up notices after having been granted exemption for the first or second year of their training period. Take the engineering section alone of the University of Cape Town. There something like 20 students, some of them already in their final year of study, who have received deferments previously, have received notification at the end of April that they had been drawn in the ballot for continuous training this year. I want to make it clear that exemption has previously been granted on a yearly basis and accordingly they have to apply again at the end of each year. In any event, these students received notification just after the long weekend in April that they had been drawn in the ballot for this year and were asked to report the date on which they desire to be called up. Naturally that caused some consternation amongst the chaps who are undergoing university training.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Does it not say &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>No, they were asked to give the date on which they desired to be called up. There was not even the latitude of &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;. They naturally reapplied for exemption. They rightly thought this way a formal matter and that they could reapply. What has happened in fact is that they have now been notified that they have been drawn in the ballot and instructed to take their medical examinations. In fact, a large number of them have already taken their medical examinations. That seems completely contrary to the spirit of the existing and proposed legislation and certainly contrary to the principle on which we understood the principle of exemptions would be applied. From information received it appeared that this situation did not only apply in the case of universities in the Cape but also to universities in Natal and to certain of the universities in the Transvaal. I would ask the hon. the Minister whether he would have the position examined with a view to putting right any slip-ups which may have occurred. There can be nothing more disturbing to these chaps who are at university, especially those in their final year, to be suddenly notified: You have gone so far but you must now drop your studies and do nine months&#x2019; continuous training after which you can go back to university. The Minister, knowing the many key positions these qualified young men from universities will be called upon to occupy in defence, is I am sure anxious to see that no such slip-ups should occur. If the Minister finds the culprit I would suggest that he gives him nine months continuous training; it might make him a little bit more careful next time. But it does seem a pretty bad slip-up in organization to have taken place at this stage.</p>

<p>I want to deal with trainees in general. Many of the provisions of this Bill deal with the various facets of the trainee call-up. Among the total number of lads who are registered at the beginning of every year, there is a fairly large surplus, if I may call it that, between the number who are finally required to serve and those who, because of registration and age, have to take their place in the ballot. We know that industry in general is suffering from an acute manpower shortage and the position is no different in the case of defence, a manpower shortage particularly of the type of young men who have had fairly advanced training to fit into the various facets of defence, in which it is required for them to be <span class="col_8213-8214" refersTo="page_0441"/>trained to-day. I want to ask whether it is not possible, in applying the call-up provisions, to use that surplus of registrations to some extent as a cushion, so as to ensure that those who are called up are not put in blind-alley occupations. In other words they must be used to the best advantage of the particular career they are going to adopt. Cannot they be used in that particular, field of defence so that while they are doing their training &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Why do you say the surplus?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am saying the surplus must be used so that as far as possible you do not take into defence, and call up for ordinary infantry training, for example, boys training for key positions say engineering or medical. Rather than training them for basic military defence they will be of greater value to our national defence if they are allowed to complete their technical calling and to get proficient in that. We have a fairly big cushion that we could use for that purpose. Those who have to be called up should be diverted into the particular line in defence which coincides with the profession they intend to take up or the profession they have been studying. It is a two-way benefit. Defence gains by the knowledge they have already acquired and they gain by the fact that during their training, apart from their basic military training, they can concentrate on the type of work they expect to take up when they have finished their military service. I know this may be difficult to carry out in practice but I think it is a matter which is well worth consideration, especially with the new board which will now operate more actively. It will mean a certain amount of screening before they are finally balloted into the army. To take it back to a war-time simile it really means that certain lads&#x2014;similar to the keymen in industry in those days&#x2014; will get some form of automatic exemption or be drafted into the commandos where the call on their time is not so great.</p>

<p>The third alternative, of course, in the case of university students is to develop as fast as possible their own particular units, units in which the trainees from that university, after their basic military training, can do a considerable portion of the rest of their call up period, fitting that military training in with their professional university studies, thereby benefiting in both directions, themselves and national defence.</p>

<p>The Bill also makes provision for those young men who for conscientious reasons object to any service in the armed forces. Let me say at once, Sir, that we appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s difficulties in dealing with this type of case. It is recognized throughout the world as one of the most difficult cases one has to deal with. This Bill now provides that where a lad objects, on religious grounds, to serve in a combatant capacity, he can serve in a non-combatant capacity. But even that is not going to solve the problem altogether. Far be it for me even to offer a solution at the moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The only thing you can do is to sit next to me and look over my shoulder.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I would try that if it would help. In my own constituency I have one such case. There are four lads in the Peninsula today who have already undergone a prison sentence rather than take up military training in any capacity at all. I have tried to reason with one. I have tried to persuade him to serve in a non-combatant capacity but he insists that in accordance with his own religion and scruples he is not permitted even to do that. These lads are probably facing or already undergoing a second term of imprisonment. No matter how one feels personally about the matter, I do not think one can continue to put them in prison. The provision in this Bill is the one which is usually adopted in most countries, an opportunity to serve in a non-combatant capacity, say in the medical corps, where they can in effect remedy the effects caused by the armed side of the forces to which they object. But if their religious scruples and their consciences will not even permit them to do that I do not think one can go on indefinitely sentencing these boys to imprisonment. I am handing it over to the Minister and his advisers to try to devise a remedy and a remedy will have to be found. Sir.</p>

<p>A marked improvement with which we on this side of the House are in full accordance is the proviso contained in Clause 14. This clause provides that nobody will be compelled to commence his military training before reaching the age of 18. Under the old system they could be a bit younger. We feel that this is a step in the right direction and that 18, if it is still not old enough, it is just across the border from being too young to commence military training. It also allows at least one year to elapse between the earlier stages of registration and the time they are being called up for service.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to a medical benefit scheme provided for in the latter stages of the measure in respect of the Permanent Force and their families. I do not propose to enlarge on that but I understand that this medical benefit scheme is being introduced as a result of the recommendations of the Byrack Commission which has sat on this matter. It is on all fours with the police scheme. Certain suggestions will be made by other speakers on this side where we think certain improvements can be effected. But in general, as far as we are concerned, we are wholeheartedly in support of such a scheme. We believe that it is long overdue. We also believe that it is one of the steps of the many we have advocated which will provide that security in the forces generally that will attract people to take up the Air Force the Navy or the Army as a permanent profession. It gives them that additional security. It provides <span class="col_8215-8216" refersTo="page_0442"/>for the pensioner from a certain date as well as the man still serving. Certain of the benefits can be continued to be enjoyed after the man goes on pension. We also believe this scheme will encourage people to serve in the forces and to remain there instead of joining in the manpower wastage which takes place, much to our disappointment, at the present time. I know the hon. the Minister has said in the House before that he cannot compete with industry. Well, I suppose he cannot compete in hard cash but these are the sort of things where he can compete and help to retain the people.</p>

<p>There were two provisions in the Bill about which we were not too happy. The hon. the Minister has already removed one&#x2014;Clause 15. But in terms of Section 67 of the original Defence Act it is provided that not later than the 15th day of April in each and every year the Minister has to publish in the <i>Government Gazette</i> the number of persons to be called up for citizen force training in the ensuing year. In terms of Clause 9 of this Bill it will no longer be necessary for the Minister to publish that information. I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister will give us the reasons for deleting that provision. The publication of that information was not just useless information. Especially in these days of manpower shortage the publication of that information is very valuable to other people interested in the general manpower pool which is provided by school-leavers. It gave them information as to the reserve pool which was left to them to draw on after the requirements of Defence had been met. That information will in future no longer be available. Because of the restricted labour pool to-day the information is very valuable, and it is also a valuable check on Defence demands and a brake on any unnecessary tying up of labour beyond the limit which can satisfactorily be employed by Defence. When I say &#x201C;satisfactorily employed&#x201D; I take into account all the facilities such as training, accommodation and all the rest.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the volunteers form a portion of the general labour pool. Even if it is only in respect of those who volunteer it does give that additional information to outside industry. At the moment we see no reason why the publication of that information as originally provided in the parent Act should not be continued. We are however prepared to wait for the Minister to give us the reason. If we think it is still necessary to publish that information we shall move an amendment in the Committee Stage to have such a provision restored in this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in regard to the withdrawal of the promotion Clause 15 has eased the position on this side of the House considerably. It has removed objections which we might otherwise have raised to the Bill. With these few remarks and those to be made by other members on this side of the House I should like to assure the hon. the Minister that as far as we are concerned we shall not oppose the passage of this Bill.</p>

<p>I want to express my appreciation for the speech which has just been made by the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). I must say that it is encouraging that the hon. member has such an objective view of this Bill. He raised no fundamental objections to this Bill. In other words, the hon. member for Simonstown has, as it were, supported this Bill. He asked the hon. the Minister for information in connection with minor matters here and there and I am sure that the hon. the Minister will give him that information. I think that this is probably the first occasion on which no fundamental objections have been raised by the Opposition in connection with a defence Bill.</p>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>And so we have this Bill to-day which will stand on solid ground when it reaches the Statute Book. There is nothing doubtful about this Bill. When we have the position in which the Opposition support a Bill it is not necessary to discuss that measure at any great length. When we agree on everything it is not necessary to carry on a long debate on the Bill. I do not blame the hon. member for Simonstown. As the leader of the defence group on the opposite side and the person who has introduced the debate on that side, he has acted quite correctly in going into detail and in pointing out in which respects this Bill is an improvement over the old Act and in which respects he thinks minor changes can perhaps be effected. We are on solid ground as far as this Bill is concerned, Mr. Speaker. In the past we were always faced with this difficulty that if a person was a member of the Citizen Force and found that he could no longer fulfil his obligations in this regard, trouble arose. This Bill now makes provision whereby such person can be transferred to the commandos. We now, as it were, have cooperation in this regard. This person who can no longer remain a member of the Citizen Force will now not be lost to the country as far as his services are concerned because he will be given military training in the commandos.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown referred to students. This Bill makes provision for the exemption of students and medically unfit persons from military service. I am very pleased that in terms of this Bill everyone will be called up by means of the ballot system and there will be no exemption from the ballot. Everyone will be balloted and those who are then called up for service because of that ballot will then be able to apply to the Exemption Board if they cannot undergo their service for some reason or other. That Board <span class="col_8217-8218" refersTo="page_0443"/>will then be able to grant exemption if it considers the granting of such exemption to be justified. I do not think that there is anyone in this House who has not already been approached to try to obtain exemption for a person who has been balloted. That-difficulty will now disappear. Such person will now know that he may be balloted and if he is balloted and it is impossible for him to serve, he can apply to the Exemption Board for exemption.</p>

<p>I think that this Bill will place our defence system on a very sound and solid foundation in the future. I repeat that I am pleased that the hon. member for Simonstown has admitted that this Bill is not one to which he wants to move an amendment. He said that a change could perhaps be made in connection with certain minor matters, for example, in connection with those people who have conscientious objections to serving as trained soldiers. The hon. member for Simonstown has admitted that this is an improvement over the old Act. The fact that this is an improvement ought to prove to the hon. member that the hon. the Minister intends making this legislation as acceptable as possible to everyone in the Republic. He mentioned the fact that training would only begin after the 18th year.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I mean, from the 18th year. I also think that this is a very good improvement of the Act. The training that these soldiers receive to-day is strict training; it is training which hardens those people who are inclined to be a trifle soft. If a person is physically weak, he just cannot last out the training and I am pleased therefore that the age limit has now been raised slightly.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as this Bill is concerned it is very clear to me that the amendments asked for in this Bill are as a result of the experience gained over the last number of years under this new training scheme of ours. I have no doubt that the improvements suggested here will make the machinery of the administration run so much more smoothly. It will also make it easier for the bailotees because they will now be given longer notice of when they will be called up.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) has told the House in great detail what our attitude is towards this Bill. We support it wholeheartedly. I also want to tell the hon. the Minister that I am very pleased that he has deleted Clause 15 because that clause would have caused his Department endless trouble and it would have caused the officers concerned a lot of heartache, dissatisfaction and frustration. We are grateful to him for having dropped this and for having found ways and means to overcome his difficulties without the inclusion of this clause.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the amendment which provides for the establishment of a fund in respect of medical, dental and hospital treatment for Permanent Force men who have retired. I am very pleased indeed that the Minister has come forward with this amendment. This has been a long-felt want. Very many of the men who have served in the Permanent Force and who have gone on pension have fallen on difficult times as a result of ill-health. The Permanent Force form a unique group of people. Medical care is part of their service contract and they cannot contribute to a medical aid fund. The result is that everyone who goes on pension is thrown on his own resources as far as medical expenses are concerned. And that is the time in his life when he really needs that assistance. I take it that this fund is going to be self-supporting. I want to appeal to the Minister tonight to investigate the possibility of deleting the words &#x201C;retirement on pension on or after 1 January 1964&#x201D; and making it applicable to all pensioners of the Permanent Force. We can discuss this in detail in the Committee Stage, but I think it can be done because further on in the clause it is stated &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<p>Yes, Sir. I bow to your ruling. May I just suggest to the Minister <span class="col_8219-8220" refersTo="page_0444"/>that he should look upon those members of the Permanent Force who are already on pension in the same light as those who will retire after 1 January. Those other pensioners did not have an opportunity while they were in the force of contributing towards this fund. I take it that they will have to make a lump sum payment in order to belong to the fund. I ask the Minister to turn my suggestion over in his mind and when we come to the Committee to see whether it is not possible to allow all pensioners of the Permanent Force to become members of this fund on payment of a lump sum.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as you have suggested the details can be discussed in the Committee Stage. I just want to reiterate what the hon. member for Simonstown has said, namely, that we are very pleased that the Minister has come forward with these amendments.

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I wish to confine my remarks to Clause 4 of the Bill. That clause amends Section 35 of the original Act which deals with service in the commandos. As I read this particular clause it contains in the main the same principle as that contained in the original Act except for the new principle that where exemptions are granted those people will still be liable for service in a commando and the other principle that where an exemption is granted while a person is still serving in the Citizen Force he will have to complete the period of his training in a commando. I should like to get clarify from the hon. the Minister in respect of this entire redrafting of the original section. I raise this point for this reason: A statement was issued by the Minister on the 29th of last month. In that statement he indicated the number of bailotees who will in future be absorbed into the commandos as such. The Minister stated there that no new members&#x2014;if the Press report is correct&#x2014;would be admitted to the commandos unless they undertook to serve four years. The clause provides that any man whose name is not drawn in the ballot must be posted to a commando. The Minister has indicated in the White Paper that the strength of the commandos at the moment is something like 51,000 of which approximately 8,000 are ballotees. I should like to have some clarity from the hon. the Minister as to what the position will be if the House passes this clause. Is it intended to make up the entire commando system from men whose names have not been drawn in the ballot for service in the Citizen Force? Because this clause provides that they must be posted to a commando &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Not must be posted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I stand corrected; that they are liable to be posted to a commando. And if they get posted to a commando they must serve for a period of four years. But the Minister said in the statement from which I quoted a moment ago that no man will be accepted in the commandos unless he undertakes to serve for a period of four years. Now the question arises: Is it the Minister&#x2019;s intention that the strength of the Commandos will in future be made up entirely of ballotees? If that is so, then there is no question of any period of service because the clause makes it quite clear that they must serve for a period of four years.</p>

<p>The other point that arises from this is that we all know that the present commando strength is in the majority made up of volunteers, up to the age of 65. A ballotee who now serves in a commando, who is posted to a commando, in terms of the Act is subject to all disciplinary measures that any other ballotee is subject to in the A.C.F., subject only to the code applying to the commandos. But a volunteer is not subject to the periods of service; he is not subject to the same military discipline. It is quite clear that it is essential that we must build up our commando strength as a matter of internal security as part of the S.A. Defence Forces to the utmost capacity, and I think that it is very pertinent at this stage, in consideration of the measure that the hon. Minister has now brought before the House that he should make a clear statement of policy in respect as to how these ballotees in future will be absorbed in the commandos. Will they be liable and will they be posted if their names are not drawn in the ballot. We on this side of the House, Sir, have consistently maintained that whilst we may be training half of our manpower, there are thousands of South Africa&#x2019;s young men who are escaping any form of military training whatsoever, even from the security angle. But the Act also provides that men may in time of emergency or war be taken from a commando and posted to a Citizen Force or Permanent Force unit and it seems to me <span class="col_8221-8222" refersTo="page_0445"/>that it would be a sensible policy to adopt that our commando strength should in the main (I do not say entirely) be taken from the bailotees, these men who have escaped the ballot and be posted for their four years training there. Why should there be any distinction drawn between the young men who should serve our country? It will make our commando system far more efficient, and what is more, it would at least increase the security factor in that we know that in any emergency, in time of war or any other emergency, there are at least a number of men who are potential recruits, who have had at least the rudiments of military training and can be more quickly absorbed in any active military unit. I think it is pertinent now in view of the statement that the hon. Minister made on 29 May that he should offer now complete clarity in this one respect of his defence policy as such, particularly as we are now faced with a request of the Minister to approve a clause of this nature in this Bill.</p>

<p>Then there is another point to which I would like to refer and that is Clause 9. The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) has already made some reference to the matter, but I want to approach it from another angle. Sir, apart from the fact that if this clause is accepted as it is, if the principle is approved as it is, that there will be no compulsion on the Minister to post in the <i>Gazette</i>the number of bailotees that he is determined should be drawn in any one year, there is the other fact of the voluntary aspect. I recall very well the discussions in the select committee. The provision was included in Section 67, as it reads at present, that the Minister may each year by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> published not later than 15 April of that year, appoint the number of persons to be enrolled for training in the Citizen Force in the next ensuing training year. The reason why it was drafted like this by the select committee and embodied in the Act as it now stands, was because of Section 65. Section 65 refers to the voluntary enrolment for training on the part of citizens, and sub-section (3) of that section says this: That the Minister shall not later than 1 March in every year fix the maximum number of citizens and other persons who may during that year be accepted for training on application made in terms of sub-section (1). In other words, the position was clear. The Minister was able to tell the public and to tell the youth of South Africa, the businessmen: I am prepared to fix the number. I require for the Defence Forces this year say 10,000 men, but of those 10,000 men I am going to permit 1,000 to come forward as volunteers to serve in the Defence Forces. In other words it was then known that the Minister would only ballot 9,000. Now with the overall picture that is presented here, every man&#x2019;s name is going into the ballot-box. He can subsequently apply for exemption. There are going to be numbers of men with long training traditions of military service, there are going to be young men who wish to serve in the forces. What is going to be the position if it is publicly not known what number the Minister is fixing?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>You are over-stressing the point. I never get the number I allow. I give them 400 every year and I only get about 100.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have dealt with cases myself of men whose names have not been drawn in the ballot and who wanted to serve, and I have had to make representations on their behalf and been a bit successful. I know of a particular case at the present moment. They are told that the volunteers are full. Probably the reason is that the Minister is fixing the number at such a low figure because he is relying entirely on the ballot-box. Now this position is also going to arise: If a man is going to register at 16 and he is not going to be drawn out of the ballot-box at the age of 17, if his name is not drawn, and he goes to the university&#x2014; he wants to get that finished first, but has the idea to volunteer, what then? There are numbers of these young men who want to volunteer, but who consider themselves fortunate that their names have not been drawn out of the ballot-box, because they say: &#x201C;I first want to go to the university and to complete my course.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>We never had the number for four consecutive years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>That is no reason for the Minister to say that he is not going to publish the number of men he requires for the forces. The Minister has an obligation in terms of Section 65. He must state the number of volunteers he is prepared to accept, and I say to the Minister that it is perfectly consistent therefore that the amendment he now proposes should have the same principle applied so that the public can know. Now the Minister says that he is prepared to say how many volunteers he wants but he is not prepared to say how many he is going to ballot for. It is not consistent. I say to the hon. the Minister that it is going to have a bad effect. There are other aspect of the matter. The Minister is well aware of statements that had been made by leading trade unionists, and statements that had been made by industry. There is already uncertainty as to the principle that will be applied by the Exemption Board in regard to the number of men who should be accepted for apprenticeship to meet the skilled manpower shortages of South Africa. We know from a previous policy statement of the hon. Minister that he does require a certain number of these technicians. We recognize that. But at least industry and commerce should know the number that will be available every year. What is going to be the Minister&#x2019;s absorption of that new pool of manpower that is becoming available every year in order that they can make their own assessment. So I join with <span class="col_8223-8224" refersTo="page_0446"/>the plea made by the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) that the Minister should give further consideration to this question. I see no harm that this number should become public. It is not a heavy secret.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>That was not the hon. member&#x2019;s point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>That was as I understood it. There is no objection to the matter being made public and if the clause is left as it stands at the moment, I do not think it will be right. I listened most carefully to the introductory speech of the hon. Minister, but I did not hear any reason given by the hon. Minister as to why this section is being altered in this fashion. I am trying to be objective. We want to give our fullest support to the measure, because we think the measure by and large is a great improvement on the ballot system, but we are also concerned about the build-up of a satisfactory Defence Force, and what we are putting before him here tonight is with the only intent in mind to see that we do get the best for South Africa&#x2019;s defences. I ask the hon. Minister to give closer consideration to the two points I have made.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The first point I wish to deal with is to draw the attention of the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) to the fact that this Bill does not change the age in which trainees will do their training, which was the interjection I made whilst he was speaking. I said that this Bill did not change the age, to which the hon. member took such exception. I hope he will accept now that I was correct.</p>

<p>I wish to deal firstly with the question of the call-up procedure and exemption procedure which is being changed by this Bill. I put it to the hon. Minister that the procedure under the existing legislation is that a person who is due to be balloted in any particular year is sent a notification that he is due to be balloted and a form of application for exemption or deferment if he wishes to apply therefore. He then fills in that form if he wants an exemption, sends it in and he is notified before the ballot that he is either exempted or deferred, or that his application has been rejected and that he will be balloted for the forthcoming year. That is the present procedure, and the Minister agrees that that is correct. This Bill changes that procedure, and it provides that a person will be balloted, irrespective, and then will be notified that he has been balloted and will then after balloting have the opportunity to apply for exemption or deferment. Again the Minister agrees. What I take exception to is that I believe that the Minister&#x2019;s Department has shown a contempt for Parliament, because before this Bill has been passed by this House members have been balloted under the new procedure apparently. The students to which the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) referred and to which the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) referred in the previous debate were not sent their notification that they were due to be balloted. They were not sent a form of application for exemption; they were notified that they had been balloted and instructed to report for medical examination. Now once this Bill is passed that will be the correct procedure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister of Defence can say that, but unfortunately the Minister of Labour deals with these matters. The Minister of Labour is the person who deals with the Exemption Board, and he replied to questions by the hon. member for Pinelands, and it is quite clear, and the fact of the matter is, whatever the Minister may say, that these people to whom we are referring, who are in the middle of their studies, were not sent a notification, in terms of the existing legislation; they were merely notified that they would have to come up for training and instructed to report for medical examination.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>How can they ask for exemption if they are not balloted for two or three years hence?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point, they were not. Before this measure which we are now debating comes into force, a person who went to the university, three years ago, or two years ago, applied before the ballot for deferment &#x2014;before he was balloted, and he was granted deferment for one year. The next year he got a new notification and he applied for his second year and the third year he got another notification that his year of deferment was up and he had now to apply for exemption. Then he applied again. That procedure has been changed, and it is quite clear that it has been changed to conform with what is now proposed in this legislation, and I think it is wrong that this Parliament should be treated with such contempt in that legislation not yet passed should start to be applied in administrative practice before this House has had an opportunity to debate it. I raise that as a matter of principle on which I feel very strongly.</p>

<p>I want to go one step further than the hon. member for Simonstown who referred to what I believe is a wastage of capacity and skill in our trainees. I believe that our trainees are not being utilized to the best available capacity, that their skills are not being utilized. Let me give the Minister an example which came to my notice about a week ago, of a matriculated student with four distinctions in matric, including mathematics and science, who went to do his nine months&#x2019; training in the Navy. He did one month&#x2019;s training and then he was made a steward in the seamen&#x2019;s mess and the rest of his eight months he spent as a steward, as a waiter&#x2014;this lad who passed <span class="col_8225-8226" refersTo="page_0447"/>first-class matric with four distinctions, in mathematics and science amongst others, as a waiter in a seamen&#x2019;s mess!</p>

<p>I do not know. I am asking the Minister. For eight months he was washing dishes and scrubbing floors.</p>

<p>Will you give me his name?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>He came back this year for his week&#x2019;s training and he was promoted. He was made a steward in the petty officers&#x2019; mess. That is the sort of wastage of abilities to which the hon. member for Simonstown referred, to which I referred in a previous debate, and I hope that the hon. Minister will take this opportunity to tell the House that this wastage of skills and abilities which is taking place, and the Minister knows it is taking place, will be stopped. He has not got the skilled instructors to train them properly, they are not being graded and sent to their proper occupations. I can tell him of a man who was training at the university as a doctor and who is doing ordinary training now on the square. I raised with him the question of the gymnasium students who have magnificent training, who come out far better qualified than any nine months&#x2019; boy. They are outstanding chaps, whether they come out of the Navy, the Air Force or the General Army. They come out with a high degree of training. But in the case of many of these lads we are referring to, their skills are wasted in that they are not being employed in the niche for which they are best suited. Their skills are not being employed as officers or potential officers.</p>

<p>Nobody objects, as we have often said, to the sacrifice which our youths are called upon to make, but we do feel that where our youths are called upon to make that sacrifice and where the system is now being changed, there is a responsibility upon the Minister to see that when deferments are made, that when exemptions are made, they are made not only to deal with specific emergency cases, but in the interest of the force as a whole, and that those that are balloted are used to the best possible advantage for the force and for South Africa. Technicians should be used as technicians, medical students at universities can do their training in medical units, engineers can do their training in engineering units. Again I put to the hon. the Minister the proposal that I made previously that there should be specialist units for specialists in the universities, where people can do military training whilst they are studying for specialist subjects. These are practical proposals which I believe can assist the Minister and can assist the Defence Force. I do not want to take it further. I hope the Minister will give us some assurance that the position will improve.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to Clause 5 which is included in this Bill to deal with the problem of specialists particularly who leave the force with specialist training, and can now be called up for 105 days during any period of five years instead of the previous shorter period of 30 days. This discloses a very serious state of affairs, Mr. Speaker. I put it to the Minister, for instance, and I do not think he will deny it, that considering electricians in the Navy, 33 per cent of the establishment posts for qualified electricians are filled and two-thirds of the specialists posts for qualified electricians in the Navy are vacant. I put it to the Minister that that is so and that he has had to call in a civilian firm to do electrical and electronic maintenance in the Navy. This measure now is to try and counter that by making available to him and to enable him to keep trained up-to-date from year to year those who have been trained and left the service. But this is closing the stable-door after the horse has bolted. This is to deal with the people who have already bolted. I hope the Minister can tell us that something can be done to keep that stable-door closed and not merely to bring them back for 105 days every five years, but to try and keep them in the force, because those are the people that we cannot afford to lose, the specialists with specialist training. In connection with that group I want to ask the hon. Minister whether he has given any consideration to the pay position of people who are now to be called up for a maximum of 30 days in any one year; people who would normally get two weeks&#x2019;eave could take that leave, and for the rest they will be unpaid in regard to their normal occupation, particularly specialists on a daily rate or weekly rate&#x2014;they will not be paid from their civilian source while they are in the army. Is there a provision that they will get a living wage, that their dependants will be able to be fed and clothed and housed whilst they are doing this training for which this clause provides?</p>

<p>Finally I want to refer to Clause 17 which provides a maximum sentence of 15 years for the offence of trespassing in certain military premises. The Minister has said that this is to bring it into line with the sabotage Act But what I draw his attention to is that there is no alternative here, that a person perfectly <i>bona fides</i> has got to be sent to gaol in terms of this. The Minister is not providing an alternative fine instead of the gaol: &#x201C;Liable on conviction to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 15 years&#x201D;. The magistrate has no option. He must send him to gaol. So the sailor coming home after a night on the tiles, having had a little bit too much Lieberstein, who wanders across a prohibited area, has got to be sent to gaol. I am sure that is not the Minister&#x2019;s intention. I am sure it could not be considered a reasonable provision. What the Minister of Justice does is another matter. One does not always expect him to be reasonable in these matters in regard to punishments. This is a practical issue dealing with soldiers, sailors and airmen, and with civilians who may be visiting them and quite innocently <span class="col_8227-8228" refersTo="page_0448"/>may find themselves on a prohibited piece of ground&#x2014;a fiancee coming to visit her boyfriend in camp, they look for a quiet spot to have a cup of tea from a thermos flask which she has brought with her or a cigarette, and there you have it: 15 years&#x2019; imprisonment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to thank the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) for the support he has given this Bill. He raised a number of points. He said we should try to train the young men who undergo training in the Defence Force in the direction in which they are talented. I may just say that that is the policy and we try to do that wherever possible. The hon. member for Simonstown raised another point and he said &#x2019;We must use as a cushion the surplus between the number that we are training every year and the actual number available.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If the whole crop is 20,000 and we intend to train 10,000, we should use the remaining 10,000 as a cushion. I understood it in this way that we should select out of the whole lot enough men to train so that we can leave out of training certain categories of students, or young men.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<p>That is before they apply for exemption, after having been balloted?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>There will not be any opportunity now to apply before they are being balloted. The whole crop is being balloted at the beginning of their 17th year. They register when 16 and they are balloted at the beginning of their 17th year, but they are coming for their training at the beginning of their 18th year. So they have a whole year to ask for exemptions. That is why we are now registering them a year earlier, so as to give them that very opportunity.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member once again approached me in regard to the question of the conscientious objectors. I have no remedy for them, Sir. I am in the same position as the hon. member, but I can assure the hon. member that not one of them is kept in prison for ever. But we must make sure that they are conscientious objectors. So we detain them for a couple of weeks and let them out, we make sure that they are conscientious objectors, and then you never hear of them again. But we must make sure first. There are certain churches whose members are all conscientious objectors. But now others approach me, and they tell me that a few of their members are conscientious objectors. Now, really, we cannot take that into consideration. Everybody will be a conscientious objector who is a loafer. So we cannot allow that. We must make sure that they are conscientious objectors. After that, we do let them off.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Where you have one of these objectors who has once been sentenced and has served a term of imprisonment, will he not be prosecuted again and given a second term of imprisonment? In other words, then he goes free?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I believe we have called some of them up a second time, but I do not think more often than that.</p>

<p>*I now come to the hon. member for North East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst). He said we should not fix a date for this medical fund. That is very difficult. There will be people who will have to pay in large amounts, that is true, people who have retired years ago.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Is it not possible to draft the clause in such a way that they will have the choice between paying in or not? I realize the amounts will be large.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>In that case we shall only be assisting the person who is well off. The person who is really in need, the small man who really cannot afford to get ill, will be the person who will not be able to afford to pay in any amount. That is the difficulty I foresee at the moment in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) had many objections. He asked me whether in future the commandos would only be filled with ballotees who are assigned to them? My reply is &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I have always had a very soft spot and a high regard for volunteers. Whether that volunteer is 30 or 40 or 45 years of age if he wants to serve in the commando and signs on for four years I think he is the type of person who should be given the opportunity of giving his services. I wish to advance another reason to the gentlemen who have asked that I should announce on 15 April which and how many volunteers will be given the opportunity. But the names of these volunteers are in any case not published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> If you read Section 65 (3), Sir, you will see that not later than the first day of March of every year the Minister must determine the maximum number of citizens and other persons who can on application be taken in for training during the <span class="col_8229-8230" refersTo="page_0449"/>following year in terms of Sub-section (1). But that does not get published. I only have to determine it. The position is that I also have the highest regard for those young people who volunteer.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein sáid there was such a thing as military tradition and that there were people whose sons wanted to serve where their fathers did their military service. I know that is the position but the hon. gentleman exaggerates the position completely. During the first year I was Minister we left 500 vacancies for such cases and only 100 were filled. Since then I have been keeping 400 vacancies for volunteers each year and only 100 have volunteered. That position is being completely exaggerated. The other day a person came to my office. He was very annoyed and said: &#x201C;My son has not been balloted and now I cannot get him into the Gymnasium either. How is my son to undergo training?&#x201D; I told him it was easy and that he should volunteer. But that was the last I heard of that son. You see, Sir, the question of volunteers is being exaggerated. The position is that I have the highest regard for the volunteer and I give the assurance that there will also be room for volunteers but the question is why should we announce their names on a certain date. In the past we only took men in once a year and we then announced those names once a year, namely on 15 April. But we are now taking them in on any day of the year. Why should I determine at a certain date how many volunteers I shall allow? Supposing I find that the first quarter is entirely filled by youngsters who want to go to university and there is more room in the second quarter. Why should I not be allowed to announce that and fill the second quarter with them? There is no reason whatsoever why it should be determined on a certain specific date. Then the hon. member for Durban (Point) raised the point that we ought to announce how many people would be balloted every year so that the businessmen would know how many were left for them to choose from. That is precisely what I do not want to do because many of the businessmen are more than mean. I had a case to-day where a businessman did not take somebody on because he had to do military service. If those people knew how many were not to do military service they would discriminate against those who have to do military service when they take on employees. The position is precisely that they should not know. They will get them during the year but they need not know beforehand. That is one of the reasons why I do not want to announce the numbers. What is more it is not necessary for the world to know how many I am taking on every year.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member for Durban (Point) has asked what the exact position is.

We have increased the salaries; we have increased them considerably. We made the adaptation this week. We are building houses, we are providing certain amenities; we are introducing the medical scheme. We are doing our best to close the stable door before the steed gets out.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked what the position was in regard to those people who had to do military training for 105 in terms of the new Act or for 30 days in terms of the old Act? Those people are paid Permanent Force salaries when they come in.</p>
