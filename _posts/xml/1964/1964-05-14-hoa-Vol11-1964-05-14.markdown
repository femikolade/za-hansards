<p>Before calling upon the hon. member for Durban (Central), I just want to say that Loan Vote M, Education, Arts and Science, R2,810,000, may be discussed under this Vote. I also want to point out that I ruled yesterday that NUSAS could not be discussed under this Vote. I have reconsidered the matter and now wish to state that inasmuch as the NUSAS organization is a student organization and that membership of that organization is automatic at the universities which are given assistance under this Vote, the organization in question may be discussed.</p>

<p>During the debate last night the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) made a restrained appeal to the hon. the Minister to withdraw his instructions to scientific organizations which would have the effect of forcing them to exclude non-White members under pain of no longer receiving financial assistance from the State. This order has shocked these associations, and so far as could be ascertained in the time available none of them is prepared to acquiesce. The total number of non-White members is about 14. It must be obvious, therefore, that the danger of serious race mixing is minimal. I understand that of the 14 non-Whites three are Japanese, which reduces the number to 11. As these 14 are distributed in different societies, there is no prospect of the formation of non-White societies for many years, because you cannot form a society with one or two members. Yesterday we had a debate on the reporting in foreign newspapers and the image of South Africa which was created thereby. If the Government persists with this policy, the overseas partners of these organizations will break off their connections and our societies will stand isolated. This will have a most serious effect on the image of these societies. Internally it will mean that many senior members will resign and join overseas societies direct. Some societies will disintegrate. Among the results are a few which I want to mention. Societies exchange journals, with the result that at very little cost our libraries are kept up to date. Overseas societies make available their workers for library research. I have myself received photostat copies of scientific papers at very short notice. International congresses are held and our members are welcome to attend and to contribute. The Government itself has on many occasions paid the expenses of its own servants and of university professors to attend congresses. All this will now cease. The amount of money in question could quite easily be recovered by a moderate increase in subscriptions, but the Government has tried to attain its aims by enforcing a change of constitution on these societies, and this must become public through the exchange of minutes with foreign societies. One of the most valued assets of a scientific worker is his close connection with the publications on his subject. In fact, when separated from the big educational centres the library references are invaluable, so much so that in choosing a post a man will consider that separation from such sources&#x2014;and this is what will happen&#x2014;may make the post unacceptable to him, and we are looking for men to fill our posts.</p>

<p>This, I presume, is the thin end of the wedge of the Government&#x2019;s policy to prevent mixed scientific societies. If applied to the medical and dental profession, which fortunately at present receives no financial assistance, it will <span class="col_5965-5966" refersTo="page_316"/>cripple almost completely the established and growing reciprocity with numerous overseas countries. In passing, may I say that the hon. the Minister is not well informed on the question of reciprocity with Holland. It is true that the reciprocity is limited, but the numbers seeking admission since this limited reciprocity was instituted have never reached more than half the limit, as no one has ever been refused admission. Sir, the writ of the Government runs within the boundaries of the Republic, and within those boundaries it can control the results of its actions, but when its actions compel societies to behave in such a manner that their constitutions make them obnoxious to their foreign associates, the Government is acting against the interests of the country and creating an image which is not favourable to us. It is breaking the tenuous threads that hold the great scientific world together, and the effects of this action are incalculable and more harmful to us than to the others because we are the odd man out. I hope, Sir, and I beg that in the interests of the country the hon. the Minister will withdraw his instruction: it can do nothing but good to all concerned, and I would suggest to him that it is a good axiom to &#x201C;leave well alone&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has again discussed a matter to which we have recently given a great deal of attention. I do not want to cover that ground again nor do I want to contradict or support what the hon. member said since we find ourselves in an academic atmosphere in discussing this question of education. May I be permitted to convey my hearty congratulations to the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) on whom Rhodes University has bestowed a doctor&#x2019;s degree. I think we are all agreed that this is a well-earned honour and an honour which is not only being bestowed upon the hon. member, for in honouring such a man Rhodes University also does credit to itself.</p>

<p>In discussing the question of education in recent times, we have been concentrating mainly on the question of manpower, technique and science. There are, of course, individual members who talk about minor matters such as the question of the language medium and discrimination against a particular group. These are transitory things. The serious issues are the questions of manpower, technique and science. It was even suggested recently that a Minister of Science should be appointed. But, Mr. Chairman, we already have one. His Department deals with the sciences in a brilliant fashion. It is not the duty of a Minister to promote and to deal with science; it is the task of education itself. But in placing so much emphasis on the question of education, technique, manpower, development and everything that has to do with the economic and material welfare of the State, we sometimes forget that the nation also has a soul. I want briefly this afternoon to draw attention to our writers. I do not want to discuss individual artists who produce a work of art out of pure love or inspiration&#x2014;something for which they do not expect compensation. Such a person is a devotee; he writes because he is inspired and he makes a gift of his work to mankind. There are such people but there are very few of them. I want to discuss the writer or artist who has to earn his bread by his work, who does creative work in a particular sphere and thus contributes to the nation&#x2019;s treasures, particularly in the sphere of literature. There are many of our writers who cannot make a decent living&#x2014;I do not want to be misunderstood because I do not want the hon. the Minister to seek a means of livelihood for them but I want to put their case as they see it. In the first place, the writer in South Africa has a double task; he is in double harness. When he sheds the yoke of his daily task in the evening he has to don the yoke of creative work. He has to do this at a time when he is exhausted, when he is drained physically and dulled mentally; sometimes he has little time and under those circumstances he has to try to do fine creative work. That is why some great writers who produced real works of art gave up writing. The remuneration offered to writers by publishers is very little. Sir, I do not want to attack the publishers. They have always treated me well under the present set-up. Only this morning I received a cheque for 75 cents! I am going to put it away; I am not going to draw it. I have another which I have had now for three years, a cheque from a certain pressman, a cheque for 15 cents! I am collecting these things so that I can show future generations how lavish their predecessors were in enriching their own souls. The writer usually receives 15 per cent of 80 per cent of the selling price of a book. This works out at 12 per cent but it presupposes a wide circulation. An ordinary work of art has a circulation of only about 3,000. The average price for such a book, the market price, is R1.35 and of this amount the writer receives 12 per cent. If there is a wide circulation, as in the case of prescribed books or book club books, if the circulation is in the neighbourhood of 20,000, the average price is about 85 cents. This does not help very much either. Sir, all prices and all wages have risen in recent years, particularly during the past 15 to 20 years. All workers receive more; all goods are more expensive; the cost of living is higher, and in comparison with this the writer&#x2019;s remuneration in South Africa has fallen. Usually, when there are certain reprints of a book, it is the custom in other countries to increase the percentage of the writer&#x2019;s share. In South Africa it decreases. A writer has to use his resourcefulness, his ingenuity and his imagination. I am thinking now of an extremely deserving writer, a writer like Frans Venter; I am thinking of Karel Kielblock; I am thinking of an hon. member of this House who has been engaged for many years now in writing a historical novel. But writing requires research, travelling and reference work, and for that extra expense that he has to incur the writer receives no compensation at all. He has to do <span class="col_5967-5968" refersTo="page_317"/>all that work for love. The writer is taxed. He devotes his spare time and his energies to the work he is doing and he invests a certain amount of capital in that book but, unlike the farmer and the industrialist, the writer cannot deduct these expenses when he submits his income-tax return. Even we who sit here receive part of our remuneration tax-free; that does not apply to the writer. In certain cases the writer may perhaps be allowed to deduct 5c per mile in respect of travelling expenses, but a doctor is permitted to deduct 25c per mile. Then there is the question of performing rights. The writer in South Africa gets nothing in this regard. When a musical composition is performed, the composer is remunerated. The only remuneration which the writer receives&#x2014;and it is very small&#x2014;is when one of his works is broadcast over the radio; otherwise the writer is paid nothing in respect of performing rights. In other words, the person who uses his books does not pay the writer anything extra for that privilege. There are large libraries in which there are collections of thousands of books but only one copy is kept of the work of each writer and that copy is read over and over again and loaned out to the public. If a writer were to be paid lc or even lc every time his book was loaned out, he would receive what is known as a royalty; he would then be receiving some compensation, but he is paid nothing at all. The more our libraries flourish&#x2014;and we are all pleased that they are flourishing&#x2014;the more the writers suffer. They sell fewer books and yet more people read those books.

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to confine my remarks to the report of the National Advisory Education Council referred to on page 106 of the Estimates. Sir, the council has had exactly one year, so far, in which to function so that its report is understandably slight. It is none the less welcome. The first significant comment appears in paragraph 20, which I will quote very briefly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In regard to obstacles and hindrances to the planning and carrying out of sound and effective education, it was clear to the Executive Committee that the most acute problem was that of the divided control of secondary education and that the solution to this problem would have to be the keystone of the solution of the majority of the other educational problems.</block>

<p>In other words, the council discovered very early on what every other country in the world has discovered, and that is that the basis of the re-organization of our educational system must be the introduction of greater differentiation in the secondary school. The Minister himself, right at the outset, had referred to the council all matters concerning the teacher. With that we have no quarrel at all. There are four sub-committees working on these matters at the present time. The second matter to be referred specifically to the council by the Minister was the question of a basic syllabus and curricula. The council in its turn, referred the matter (and quite rightly) to the Committee of Heads of Education Departments, i.e. the four Provincial Education heads and the Secretary for Education. This was done with the Minister&#x2019;s approval. So far so good. The Committee of Heads of Education Departments duly considered the matter and reported to the council that the syllabus for matriculation and school leaving certificates was the responsibility of the Joint Matriculation Board and then went on to say that secondary education was essentially differentiated education, and that therefore before any planning could take place it must be decided who was to be responsible for secondary education. The Education Council itself met again in June last year to discuss this matter and I think their resolution on this subject makes rather peculiar reading. In paragraph 31 of the report the council at that meeting passed a very generalized resolution, which is quoted in full, requesting the Executive Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To review the education system of the Republic of South Africa and to draw up a draft education system for the Republic in which attention is given to all questions they consider to be of importance.</block>

<p>Then, with the chairman&#x2019;s agreement, they gave an instruction to the Executive Committee &#x201C;to give urgent attention to the pressing problem of the divided control of secondary education and to submit recommendations to the council&#x201D;. The interesting thing is that the Executive Committee, having been given that instruction, discussed the whole matter and prepared a memorandum which was placed before the council at its third meeting. The council&#x2014;and here I would stress what the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said yesterday, namely that they were unanimous&#x2014;resolved to submit a recommendation on this vital matter to the hon. the Minister. The gist of that recommendation was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Taking into account the indivisibility of secondary education, the Executive Committee should hold regular discussions with the six heads of education departments jointly under the chairmanship of the chairman of the National Advisory Council, to deliberate and jointly to evolve acceptable plans with a view to the possible allocation of all education up to and including Std. X to the provinces.</block>

<p>Well, one can only commend the Executive Committee for having come to that decision. It corroborates the vast weight of evidence on the subject given before the Parliamentary Select Committee on the National Education Advisory Council Bill in 1962. Having made that recommendation to the Minister through the council, that is where they stuck, as far as one can see. The Minister&#x2019;s statement on 4 December 1963 on this subject expressly omits any mention of his acceptance of the <span class="col_5969-5970" refersTo="page_318"/>council&#x2019;s recommendation that all secondary education up to and including Std. X should be allocated to the provinces. It is very significant that he merely refers the matter back to the committee of heads of departments, with the following instructions, that they were to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Devise acceptable means of ending the divided control of secondary education and of developing a national education pattern.</block>

<p>Well, they have already had a recommendation that the provinces should, if possible, take over the control of all secondary education up to and including Std. X, and I wonder why that was left out of the Minister&#x2019;s statement? It was a specific recommendation. Perhaps he wishes them to discuss it further; perhaps he has reservations. If that is so we would like to know what those reservations are. I would like to remind the hon. the Minister that this council was appointed by him; it consists of experts in whom he says he has complete faith as to their ability as educationists and their ability to do the right thing for South Africa. One wonders whether the hon. the Minister is prepared to reject one of the most important recommendations of the council in the whole field of education, at such an early stage in the life of the council. We want some clarification on this matter. It is quite clear from this report that apart from the work being done on the subject of teachers, nothing&#x2014;and I repeat nothing&#x2014;practical can be put into operation; no plans can be carried out to improve the educational position until a decision has been taken on the allocation of responsibility for secondary education. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will be kind enough when he replies to tell us precisely what his reservations are and why he was unable to accept the recommendation of the council which was a unanimous recommendation, that secondary education should be taken over by the provinces.</p>

<p>Sir, paragraph 39 of the council&#x2019;s report deals with the question of manpower and complains of a lack of authoritative information on this subject, which is something one can understand. It goes on to say that the council is very pleased indeed that at the turn of the year a manpower research and planning committee was established under the National Bureau of Educational and Social Research of the Education Department. Paragraph 42 deals with the major research projects for 1964, about which we are very pleased indeed. Paragraph 43 says something which I think is most significant and should be brought to the attention of the Minister, because we are back where we started in this matter as well. Paragraph 43 (v) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The secondary school has become the clearing house of the population and this function can be undertaken in a responsible way only if differentiation can be applied effectively.</block>

<p>Sir, right throughout the report you find this same refrain that nothing really can be achieved until it has been decided what is to be the fate of secondary education. With regard to the manpower research and planning committee, Sir, the Minister will forgive me if I remind him that right back in 1948 the de Villiers Commission recommended&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The establishment of a national bureau of occupational information. Pending this, a committee of vocational education and guidance authorities should be appointed&#x2014;to begin at once with a systematic survey of educational demands.</block>

<p>That was right back in 1948, and it has taken this Government 15 years to see the red light. It seems that something is stopping the council from coming to a decision about the allocation of secondary education to the provinces. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will help us to get that clarified.</p>

<p>Sir, paragraph 48, as the hon. member for Kensington has pointed out, reveals a defect in the working of the council and the committees of the council, a defect which we foresaw from the start. They are asking for additional posts to be created on the secretariat because the Executive Committee cannot cope with the work. No further money has been voted this year for that purpose. Posts may have been created, we do not know; perhaps the hon. the Minister can tell us. The vital question, of course, is whether those posts can be filled even if they have been created because it is so hard to get trained people. I wonder if the hon. the Minister is in a position to tell us that he has found people to fill those posts. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I want to issue a friendly warning to the hon. member who has just sat down by reminding her of the saying: More haste, less speed. I remember that when she was still a member of the Cape Provincial Council the hon. member was a signatory to a memorandum in which the establishment of a national education council was condemned outright.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>This council has only been in operation for about a year but the hon. member comes along and demands a solution to one of the most difficult problems in the sphere of education. I would like to tell the hon. member that if she cannot make a positive contribution she should rather remain silent. This Education Council will eventually provide us with the solution which she now demands so prematurely.</p>

<p>But I want to discuss another matter which I consider to be most important. I want to take a few statements from the important Cilliers Report on the question of subsidy formulae in connection with universities and I want to use those statements as the basis of <span class="col_5971-5972" refersTo="page_319"/>the case I want to make here. The first statement in this report that I want to use is that responsible academic circles in Britain and Australia regard the most desirable number of students for the sort of university which we have in South Africa as being between 5,000 and 6,000. The second statement is that it is not in the best interests of higher education and research training to try to meet the increasing demand for graduates by means of excessive expansion and additions to existing university institutions, but that the solution lies in the establishment at suitable centres of additional universities from time to time. The third statement is that at the present rate at which our country is developing it is visualized that within the next five or ten years we shall have to establish one or even more universities in this country to meet our needs. The fourth statement is that the modern semi-socialized state must itself take the initiative in establishing new seats of learning. Mr. Chairman, in the light of these statements I want to take the liberty of bringing the disturbing fact to the attention of the hon. the Minister that the intellectual potential of the White population on the Rand cannot be fully developed, mainly as the result of lack of university facilities. I should like to mention a few of the vast collection of facts and figures to indicate the need for additional university facilities and I want to request the hon. the Minister most urgently but at the same time in a very friendly fashion to take serious note of these facts because I feel that the time will come when he will be compelled to take the initiative in connection with the further expansion of university facilities. The Witwatersrand and the surrounding areas, Vanderbijlpark, Vereeniging and Sasolburg, constitute only .7 per cent of the total surface area of the Republic but it accommodates 30 per cent of the White population of the Republic; it accommodates 22 per cent of the Afrikaans-speaking people in the Republic and 43 per cent of the Afrikaans-speaking people in the Transvaal. In June 1962, in the three school board districts of the Witwatersrand and in the Vereeniging school board district there were no fewer than 125 Afrikaans-medium primary schools and a further 12 Afrikaans-medium primary schools with predominantly Afrikaans classes. Furthermore, in these school board districts there were 34 Afrikaans-medium high schools and four parallel-medium high schools with predominantly Afrikaans classes. The total number of Afrikaans-speaking pupils in those four school board districts was 95,734. It is noteworthy that it has been estimated by experts that by 1970 there will be 118,000 Afrikaans-speaking pupils on the Witwatersrand as against 96,000 English-speaking pupils. As far as the high schools are concerned, there were 150 in the Transvaal in June 1962, excluding the English-medium private high schools. Thirty-four of the 93 Afrikaans-medium high schools were situated in the school board areas that I have just mentioned&#x2014;the three on the Witwatersrand and one at Vereeniging. In other words, in an area in which more than one-third of the Afrikaans-medium high schools of the Transvaal are situated there are no university facilities for Afrikaans-speaking pupils. What is more, there is no room for them at the University of the Witwatersrand. Last year the University of the Witwatersrand already had more than 6,000 students and the Chancellor of the University, Professor MacCrone, said on 4 April this year that his university expected to have more than 10,000 students by 1970. The position at Pretoria University is that last year already more than 9,000 students were enrolled at that university. I repeat therefore that no university facilities exist for the large Afrikaans-speaking population of the Rand. I ask you, Sir, are you surprised in the light of this information that an investigation to which Dr. Op&#x2019;t Hof referred last year, an investigation which was instituted by the eight universities for White students, brought to light the fact that although half of the matriculants at the end of 1961 were Afrikaans-speaking, there were only 37.2 Afrikaans-speaking pupils at university that year as against 64.05 per cent English-speaking pupils? I want to add, moreover, that about 50 per cent of the enrolled students at our residential universities left those universities without getting their degrees. You will understand therefore why I say that there is a tremendous wastage of intellectual potential as far as the White students are concerned because the necessary facilities are not within their reach. The Director of Military Production, Mr. J. P. Coetzee, and Professor S. P. Ligthelm, made a very important investigation some years ago to ascertain why so many students could not receive university training. They found that between 500 and 600 students were lost to us annually in the years 1960, 1961 and 1962 because they could not afford the study fees. They found further that some of our most brilliant potential matriculants were doing inferior work because their parents were not even in a position to provide them with their basic daily needs. You will understand, Mr. Chairman, why I make this plea for university facilities to be placed within the reach of those people so that they can attend university in the morning and go home in the evening. This matter is most closely connected, of course, with the move to the cities. As most of us know, the people from the platteland who have moved to the cities have mostly found their niche in the substructure of our urban economy. I want to demonstrate the effects of that by quoting the following figures. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for West-dene (Mr. van der Spuy) who has just sat down has been putting the case for another university at Johannesburg. In this connection I should like to say that it is felt very strongly by education bodies that the existing universities should be utilized more freely, not only for refresher courses for teachers as advocated in the report of the National Advisory <span class="col_5973-5974" refersTo="page_320"/>Education Council, but that more effective use should be made of them, rather than to foster duplication of universities whose full development is already hampered by the shortage of funds and staff. If it is necessary to increase the number of universities one would rather advocate a bilingual university as was established earlier this year in the University of Port Elizabeth Act.</p>

<p>I should like to bring the discussion back to the subject of bursaries and loans to students. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister in all sincerity again why he sets his policy against a more realistic treatment of bursaries. Sir, I cannot think that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind is closed to the practical and very constructive suggestions which have come from the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) and others on this side, members who have asked for a more realistic treatment of bursaries and loans under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. Here I should like to put forward the proposition to the hon. the Minister that he reconsiders the whole question of bursaries and loans and that he takes into account what the Cilliers Commission has said in this regard. On page 71 of that report they assure us that 82.4 per cent of the students at the United Kingdom universities receive financial assistance in the form of bursaries and loans based on merit and need for the purpose of providing for a substantial part, if not the whole, of their university training and residence. The report says this is a responsibility which deserves much more attention in this country to-day than it has at any time received in the past because the extent of the benefit of bursaries and loans, in relation to the total cost of training and residence, is very much lower in South Africa than in other countries.</p>

<p>I feel the amount voted from Revenue Account to the Department of Education, Arts and Science which averages about 3 per cent of the Budget, while the Loan Account offers about 1 per cent, is far too low. There are large corporations in America that consider that in order to keep abreast of their competitors they should spend at least 5 per cent of their turnover on research and training. If they can do that, then I am sure that South Africa, as a country, can do as well as any large business.</p>

<p>The Robbins Report on Higher Education has just come out in the United Kingdom. They state in that report that one twelfth of the age group have some form of higher education. The report recommends that the State&#x2019;s support of higher education should be sufficient to increase it by half, so that one sixth of the age group should go to university or college and they say that that will cost R700,000,000 per annum. This staggering increase is going to take place over the next 16 years. Sir, I think we should aim to do the same here. Everyone familiar with the needs of a highly developing country like South Africa, which the Minister is, I am sure, cannot doubt the necessity of giving a more realistic allocation to bursaries and loans for students. It was the Governor of the Reserve Bank who said earlier this year that &#x201C;we ourselves needed educated people badly, but it might be possible to increase the tempo of our educational activities to a greater extent by not only educating young people for South Africa&#x2019;s expanding needs but also the experts. We should stop paying lip-service to scarcity of skilled persons and manpower and devote more money and attention to university and technical education and give more liberal study bursaries&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I feel South Africa&#x2019;s stability in peace and war depends on experts. We have created a world around us to-day which cannot be run without university graduates, scientists and technologists. So higher education, which used to be looked upon in days gone by as only available to those who could afford to pay for it, has become a national necessity. The State, I think, should reassess its attitude towards it. The State must concern itself with planning for an ever-increasing university output of trained manpower to relieve the present shortage of skilled manpower. Higher education should be put within the reach of all those who can qualify for it. I appeal urgently to the hon. the Minister to-day to see that all talented youth should be entitled, to receive a bursary to cover both their tuition fees and living expenses. This will have to be done on a selective basis. They should also be paid during vacations provided they complete certain set studies during those vacations. I would ask the hon. the Minister to consider this more generous provision for bursaries and loans and to ask the National Advisory Education Council to consider this during the next year.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister himself when he was speaking on this subject during the Budget debate asked for a crash programme to meet the immediate education needs. I am now asking the hon. the Minister to institute this crash programme in the form of a massive increase in the funds for bursaries and loans for all students who need assistance.</p>

<p>In the very short time available to me there is another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention and that is adult education. What plans have the hon. the Minister and his Department for accelerating the tempo of adult education in this age of automation? Sir, a new approach to adult education is needed to-day. We have to think of re-education. We have to re-educate the population in order to enable them to keep up with automation. They have to match their skills with new requirements and they might have to be re-educated several times during their lifetimes. This is a very complex problem; it is a problem just as important and perhaps more complex than the problem of additional aid to universities. During the last 20 years we have had a half of all scientific knowledge increased in the world and we have had the number of scientists doubled. Under our apprenticeship scheme a young man begins <span class="col_5975-5976" refersTo="page_321"/>at 16 and at 21 he emerges as a supposedly qualified craftsman, with his future determined. Similarly in the case of an engineer who takes a degree at university it is generally assumed that he will not have to undergo any further training during his lifetime. If the annual growth rate is going to be maintained in South Africa and if the present shortage of manpower, which everybody admits exists, is to be remedied, then we shall have to consider re-educating university graduates and workers in unskilled jobs.

<p>We notice that under the Vote of the hon. the Minister assistance is being given to various universities, amongst others, Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Witwatersrand, Pretoria, Rhodes and so forth, but no assistance is being given to the University at Port Elizabeth. I am sure, however, that when we discuss the Vote of the hon. the Minister next year we will find that provision has been made for a grant to the University of Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>It has become the practice of hon. members opposite to laugh when hon. members on this side of the House express their gratitude to a Minister or to the Government. In spite of the fact that they will probably again laugh at me, I want to extend the warmest thanks of the Eastern Cape to the hon. the Minister and to the Cabinet for the establishment of the University of Port Elizabeth. The House is probably aware of the fact that good progress has already been made. As hon. members may have noticed from the Press, the council of the university has already been constituted. That council consists of persons drawn from public life and from universities like the University of Rhodes and Stellenbosch University. As you are also no doubt aware, Mr. Chairman, the rector has already been nominated by the council and his appointment has been approved of by the hon. the Minister notwithstanding the fact that the Opposition told us before the university was established that the rectorship of the university would be a political appointment. I hope that this appointment has proved to those hostile to this university that the hon. the Minister has followed the old practice of approving of the appointment of a rector recommended by the council. I may say that we expect great things from Dr. E. J. Marais, the rector, whose appointment has been proposed by the council and approved of by the hon. the Minister. We also want to thank the hon. the Minister for having given his immediate approval to the council&#x2019;s recommendation.</p>

<p>We are also pleased to be able to say that it is anticipated that the university will be able to start its work next year. I am also pleased to be able to say that at this early stage it is already in a position to teach two subjects more than the number being taught at the moment by the branch of Rhodes University which is still functioning there. The most important point of all is that we are pleased that notwithstanding the predictions of the Jeremiahs who wanted to wreck the establishment of this university and who now sit so innocently on the Opposition benches, notwithstanding their opposition and notwithstanding the struggle that we had to wage, there is hearty co-operation to-day in the Eastern Cape. Everyone there is imbued with one ideal and that is to make the University of Port Elizabeth a dual-medium university at which members of each language group will find what they need for their further training and what they need to qualify them further for those walks of life in which we have a shortage of adequately trained people. We hope and trust that we will even be able to exceed the highest hopes of the hon. the Minister and the Cabinet. I am sure that the Government will not be sorry that it has given this assistance to the Eastern Cape and to Port Elizabeth specifically by establishing this university.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to raise a matter with the hon. the Minister which has been brought to my attention by people interested in the work done by the African Self Help Association. Some time towards the end of last year it appeared that students attending the Johannesburg Nursery School Training College were issued with an instruction that they were not allowed to continue to belong to Nusas or to do work for the African Self Help Association. It would appear that in terms of a regulation which the hon. the Minister had framed under the Vocational Education Act, which allows him to approve or otherwise of organizations to which pupils of vocational schools could belong, a ministerial edict had gone out, an edict which was presumably conveyed to this nursery school as the students were given this instruction, that they were no longer to remain members of Nusas or continue to do any work for the African Self Help Association.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) earlier this year put a question to the hon. the Minister asking whether students had in fact been so forbidden. The Minister gave, what I considered to be not a very satisfactory reply. He referred the hon. member to the regulations he had framed under the Act. Since that time I have taken the matter further. I have examined the particular <i>Government Gazette</i> in which the regulation was gazetted, i.e. R.1946. It seems to me firstly, if I may say so, that the hon. the Minister has exceeded his powers in terms of the Act because on examining the Vocational Education Act of 1955, I find no definition which includes nursery school training as vocational education. It is certainly higher education but it is not vocational education in terms of the definition of the Act. It seems to me that the hon. the Minister has, in terms of the law anyway, exceeded his functions by making this regulation. However, the legal aspect of the matter is only a minor part as far as I am concerned. What I am really concerned <span class="col_5977-5978" refersTo="page_322"/>about is the hon. Minister&#x2019;s disapproval of organizations such as Nusas, which after all is the official student body at the major English-language universities in this country, and the fact that it would appear that he indicated he would not be prepared to approve of students falling under his aegis at vocational training schools belonging to Nusas or any allied activity of Nusas. I would like the hon. the Minister to make it clear whether this is in fact his attitude because this is the impression which the students at the Johannesburg Nursery Training College have been given. I believe most of them have been told to resign from that organization.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hon. the Minister includes in the organizations of which he disapproves, the African Self Help Association. I wonder whether the Minister realizes in what a difficult position that association has now been placed as a result of the withdrawal of the services of the students of the Johannesburg Nursery School Training College. The hon. Minister must be aware that the African Self Help Association is an organization which is registered as a welfare organization in terms of the Act. I wonder whether he realizes that there is no training scheme for African nursery school teachers and that those students were rendering an invaluable service to this association by teaching the simple routines of hygiene and handwork to the teachers at the African Self Help Association. This is an association which is run by a body of White women in Johannesburg in conjunction with African women in the township. Their whole aim and object is to teach African women to be self-sufficient and to assist them in some form of domestic activity, in the running of nursery schools and various other important ancillary organizations like that. I cannot for the life of me understand why the hon. the Minister objects to students doing this work which they do in a voluntary capacity without any compulsion from the principal or teachers of the nursing training college and work, which I understand, they miss considerably now that they have been forbidden to continue with it. I ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider his policy in this regard because I believe he is doing a disservice both to the students and particularly to the African Self Help Association which does magnificent work in the township. It is a completely nonpolitical body. I can give the hon. the Minister every assurance on that score. It does no political work amongst Africans whatsoever. It is entirely a welfare organization. It is run, as I have said, by volunteers from the women of the White community in Johannesburg with the specific objective of assisting African women in learning to be more self-reliant and to pass their knowledge on to others in the township. I know the students were doing a good job in assisting this association and that they feel very sore indeed about having been told that in terms of the regulations it was necessary for them to resign from Nusas and to stop working for this association. Again I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that I believe, as far as I can see from examining the Act, and the definition of &#x201C;vocational schools&#x201D; that nursery training schools in fact do not fall under this definition and that he has in fact exceeded his powers in this regard.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) is here. He said yesterday evening that the hon. the Minister should repudiate what had been said by his two colleagues about Nusas in the past. This Government contributes a large amount to these universities and it is compulsory for students at these four English-medium universities to become members of Nusas. Sir, I ask myself: What is Nusas? In October last year the hon. the Minister of Justice explained to us what this organization was; he told us what its aims were. This year certain students at the University of the Witwatersrand wanted to establish another English-medium organization as a counter to Nusas because of its communistic and political activities but they were forbidden to do so by the Rector of the University on the ground that Nusas was the only authorized organization. According to <i>Dagbreek</i> of 22 March, the establishment of a similar body was prohibited in Durban because the new body wanted to bring about co-ordination between Whites and Whites. The Rector said that co-ordination could only be sought between Whites and Blacks. The establishment of that new organization was also prohibited with the result that Nusas now has a monopoly at these four universities. Mr. Chairman Nusas, as we know it to-day, should be destroyed root and branch.</p>

<p>They can establish other organizations with other aims but Nusas should not be allowed to continue to exist as advocated by the hon. member over there.</p>

<p>I accuse the hon. member for Kensington of co-operating with Nusas in secret&#x2014;and then he comes here and attacks the Ministers! He now adopts a pious attitude in an attempt to hide that fact. Communists like Slovo, Sam Kahn, Lionel Forman, Wolpe, Ruth First and all the other staunch leftists like Hepple, Rubin Sachs, Goldreich, Wentzel and Leftwich are all products of Nusas. The hon. member for Kensington is annoyed because these hon. Ministers attacked this organization.<span class="col_5979-5980" refersTo="page_323"/>The hon. member wants to protect Nusas. That is what the United Party is doing. Nusas is an organization which co-operates very closely with the A.N.C., a banned organization in this country. In July 1963 they held their 39th Congress at the University of the Witwatersrand, the Alma Mater of the hon. member for Kensington and the university at which the hon. member for Houghton learnt her liberal ideas, ideas which are a disgrace to this country. At that congress they elected Albert Luthuli as their honorary president. I want to ask the hon. member for Kensington whether he is satisfied that Albert Luthuli should be the honorary president of Nusas. Is he satisfied with that? The hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) wants a Coloured to be Prime Minister; does the hon. member want Albert Luthuli to be honorary president of an organization of his Alma Mater?</p>

<p>The policy of Nusas is complete political social and biological integration. That is what they advocate. I want to know whether this hon. member agrees with that policy. Is that what he wants? Is that his policy? The hon. member for Kensington criticized the Ministers here last night and I am asking him now whether that is his policy.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment what affiliation there is between Nusas and the communist world. In 1945 it was affiliated with the International Union of Students. This affiliation ceased in 1955 because of the banning of the Communist Party in South Africa. Although they severed their connections with that organization in 1955 they have continued to keep in touch with that organization. Nusas held its congress in Johannesburg in 1963 and minute No. 377 in which they proudly state that they still have contacts with Nugs in Ghana, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this assembly, noting the cordial contact that exists between Nusas and Nugs, Ghana, instructs the Vice-President for International Relations to convey our thanks to Nugs for their support, and to maintain this close contact.</block>

<p>That is what the United Party are advocating; that is what they want. I think in pleading for this organization, this camouflaged Communist Party in South Africa, the United Party are doing a most shameful thing. Mr. Chairman, I think the time has come in South Africa for the hon. the Minister to say to these universities, &#x201C;We will only contribute 71 per cent of your expenses if you put a stop to this sort of thing.&#x201D; We as taxpayers, as parents and citizens of South Africa, are not prepared to encourage these organizations at our universities, because if we do, those universities will become the breeding-ground of communists, agitators and liberals. That is what the United Party want; this is what they want to protect. No, Mr. Chairman, I think it is time for us to tell the outside world that we are not going to permit this any longer. If action has to be taken, we must act. What are the aims of a university? The Cilliers Report describes them as follows; it says that there are three aims. The first is that it must be a training school for public and professional leadership in a variety of spheres. Secondly, it must be a centre of culture for the education of man as a whole; and, thirdly, it must be a training sphere and a research institute for the search after and the discovery of new knowledge. If these are the aims&#x2014;and that is what we want&#x2014;then universities must serve that purpose. We want our students to be trained. This is the penultimate training that they receive before they embark on their careers. The final stage of this training is to adjust themselves to practical life. If the students are not properly trained and educated&#x2014;I hope you will forgive me if I say that one might almost say that the English-medium universities ruin them, (opvoeter) insteading of training (opvoed)&#x2014;if the students are not properly trained by these authorities, by the chancellor, the lecturer, the professor and the teacher&#x2014;then steps have to be taken. That entire group is responsible for the students. We do not want a repetition of what happened in Johannesburg when the rag procession gave rise to shameful conduct on the part of a few students who dressed in women&#x2019;s underclothing and other things in which they marched through the streets. Referring to this behaviour Professor MacCrone said: &#x201C;We cannot blame the university but the parents&#x201D;. To this I say that if he cannot do his duty, if he does not want to accept his responsibility, then the parents must take up the matter and tell Professor MacCrone to clear his university&#x2019;s name which has been sullied because of the conduct of these few hooligans.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not my intention to continue this debate of the importance of Nusas in university life. I think what we are doing <span class="col_5981-5982" refersTo="page_324"/>here is that we are blowing it up out of all proportion, and the best thing that we can do is to confine ourselves to the betterment of education in South Africa and to leave the Nusas alone for the time being. There are opportunities to deal with these political subjects on other Votes. I would much prefer to simply go on with the debate as we were doing previously.</p>

<p>I want to draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to the question of the teaching of medical students in our universities. The hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) was quite right, I think, when he said that there are great difficulties which face the poorer section of our population. He mentioned the Afrikaans section. That also applies to the English-speaking section who find it difficult to attend universities outside their home towns. That is perfectly true, and if it is true for the White people, it is equally true for the Coloureds and the Bantu. We have heard from time to time of the failure of our country to provide sufficient Coloured and Bantu doctors. An establishment has been instituted in Durban to provide facilities for such students who come forward to take up medicine, but our difficulty there is that there are not sufficient candidates of the matriculant class who are good enough to be admitted. There is only a small trickle of Bantu going to this university to become doctors I think the difficulty is financial in the main. We have got, as I said last year, a very large hospital on the borders of probably the largest non-White town, non-White city in South Africa. The Baragwanath Hospital lies next to Soweto. It is almost impossible for a Bantu to provide the fees plus the living expenses of his child to go from Johannesburg to Durban to study there. He cannot afford to do it. So naturally there are not very many students coming from Johannesburg to attend the university at Durban. Now because of apartheid, I know, it has not been possible for the Witwatersrand University to admit Bantu students. Something must be done to alleviate the strain that is put on the Bantu who wants to go from Johannesburg to Durban and take up medicine. He cannot afford both the cost of his tuition plus the cost of his living while he stays there. In addition, as the hon. Minister well knows, the Bantu student has a longer course than the White student. He has to take an extra year at Durban. For some reason it is found necessary for the Bantu student to repeat his first year of study which in itself is very wrong. Earlier in the course of this Session we heard that it may have to be a law of this land to provide half-baked doctors to provide for the services of the non-Whites. The White people that become doctors cannot possibly undertake to look after the Whites plus the Blacks. There are not enough doctors being produced to do that, with the result that large areas of South Africa are being absolutely denuded of medical services. If we are going ahead with the proposals in respect of South West Africa, contained in the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s Report, there again we will need hundreds of additional doctors, particularly non-White doctors. If the hon. the Minister is not going to do something now at this stage to provide facilities for non-Whites to enter the Witwatersrand University then I am afraid all these schemes that are being put forward from time to time of encouraging the Black man to look after his own affairs, are going to remain fairy tales. There is no substance in them, because we, who are the custodians of education are not doing very much to help them along the right lines. So what does it mean? It means in essence that the Witwatersrand University must get a larger grant to make its medical school bigger than it is now, so that it will not only be able to admit more White students but at the same time will be able to admit a large number of Black students, and these Black students to go there to become doctors. They will have their own hospital at Baragwanath where they can do their practical work on their own people. The Coloureds that are admitted to the Witwatersrand University have got their own Coloured hospital at Coronation and the practical work can be done there. The position can be made quite easy for the Black people and Coloured people as far as practical work is concerned. But the university is prevented from admitting these people and until the Minister finds ways and means of lessening this burden that is resting on the White doctors to look after all sections of the population, it is no good going forward with these grandiose schemes on paper of providing services by the Blacks for the Blacks, by the Coloureds for the Coloureds. You will never be able to do it under existing circumstances. It is fortunate that in the Cape there are facilities here for teaching the Coloured students, but north of the Cape there are not these facilities, and until the Minister can see the point that I am trying to make and the importance of this point, he is going to cause a chaotic position in the next five to six years. Day after day we are being told that there are not enough doctors, day after day we are told that there are not enough dentists; day after day we are told that there are not enough pharmacists. What is the hon. Minister going to do about this? Is he going to encourage the Black people to take up these professions, or is he going to close the doors to them, the doors that are right at their doorstep? I again appeal to him to reconsider his decisions of the past, to open up the universities and allow these people to enter. He will not be sorry. South Africa will not be sorry.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Much has been said on this Vote already and perhaps it is just as well for me to give a short review now in regard to a few of the important matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) started off by saying that all university education should be under one Minister. <span class="col_5983-5984" refersTo="page_325"/>This is, of course, a debating point the hon. member raised, well knowing that it would have very little effect, because the policy of the Government has repeatedly been explained in this House, viz. that there are the various education departments for high education. In any case I am glad that the hon. member now evidently begins to advocate a national education department. But in any case there is no question of that. It is Government policy. That is the position and that is how it will remain, and when the Votes of the Ministers concerned come to be discussed the results at the non-White universities will clearly come to light. The splendid results achieved, showing what attention was devoted to those students.</p>

<p>The main matter which the hon. member discussed was the National Education Advisory Council. Before dealing with principles I first want to dispose of a few other points. The hon. member asked which members of this Advisory Council were on a full-time basis, and which were part-time. When we passed the Act in 1962, I very strongly advocated that we should have five full-time Executive Committee members. I still believe it was a good thing that we did not accede to the request that there should be only three, for the simple reason that when we started looking for good people we could not simply take people out of their posts and appoint them full-time in another post. But my standpoint was that we wanted the best possible people. I still maintain to-day that we obtained the best possible chairman Dr. Rautenbach. He is the rector of a university, and the fact that the University of Pretoria was willing to allow their rector to serve on the Education Council not only part time or half the time, but really full time, and that he performs his rectoral duties part time, is only something we can be grateful for. I, who took part in it and saw what the problems of the chairman were in the first year of their existence, can give the assurance that if we had had political people there we would have made a real mess of the whole thing. When I speak about &#x201C;we&#x201D;, I refer to all sides of the House, because what was required in the first place was cautious action. Professor Rautenbach in the first place got a council of 29 members of whom one was more suspicious than the other. The one was watching to see what the other one&#x2019;s plan was and what he would do. The provinces were afraid that they would be deprived of their rights, and the Central Education Department was afraid that it would be deprived of its rights, and the training colleges were afraid that their status would be lowered. Everybody was suspicious, and nobody trusted the other. Then we got Professor Rautenbach, a diplomat and a man who knows what he wants, and he managed&#x2014;it took him some time&#x2014;by means of dining and wining and much talking and by making these people understand the position, and pointing out that it was not necessary to be so suspicious, to achieve one thing which to me is very important, namely that these people now come together there and sit as scientists, professional men and experts, without being suspicious of one another. They are beginning to trust one another, and I just want to say that we should do as little as possible in this the highest council of the land to spoil matters. It should not be forgotten that a system developed ever since 1910. At the time we all desired that something should be done to this system, and now we should not spoil things. As the hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) said, more haste, less speed. That was the first man. The next, who is also a very good man and who was there part time until May but is now there full time, is Mr. Stanley Osler. He was the head of a private school. He could just simply, in view of all the plans they had there, have said: &#x201C;Now I leave you to manage by yourselves&#x201D;. Mr. Stanley Osler had to wait a whole year because certain work had to be completed, and now his board is satisfied that he can do it in a full-time capacity.</p>

<p>In the meantime another problem arose. One of the other pillars was Professor Bingle. He then became rector as from the beginning of this year. I received a unanimous request from the Executive Committee that without the wise guidance and assistance of Professor Bingle, with his background, things would be very difficult, and seeing that matters had progressed to quite a great extent we must please not let that man go. On their strong recommendation I immediately agreed, with the approval even of the Cabinet. Now I must say that these professional people are working very hard. They must now work overtime. Of course they are not paid the full salary of a full-time man. They really receive only a compensatory allowance, which is negligible. But they do it from devotion to the cause, because a certain course was adopted and a certain amount of progress has already been made. I hope that the House approves of this. The position is not ideal yet. I expect things gradually to be sorted out and that there will be five full-time members.</p>

<p>The next difficulty the hon. member for Kensington had is Parkinson&#x2019;s Law. I am just as afraid of that as the hon. member is. We guard against it as much as we possibly can. The hon. member pointed out that there are two bodies, the Secretariat and the Research Bureau, and that both already want to expand their staff. Now I want to explain immediately that the Secretariat is not a big, cumbersome body. As a start we gave them only a secretary and a typist. I have now asked the Public Service Commission to investigate whether their work justifies an expansion of the staff. My information is that at the most only one or two members will have to be added to the staff, because a tremendous number of reports have to be written and typed, and it is essential to have additional assistance. Hon. members have received only a brief report, but I as the Minister&#x2014;not as the Minister of Education, but <span class="col_5985-5986" refersTo="page_326"/>really as their Minister, because this Education Council is really a separate board and the Department of Education has very little to do with it&#x2014;receive all the reports, and there are stacks of them, memoranda, etc. Therefore this expansion of staff is negligible.</p>

<p>In so far as the bureau is concerned, the work it has to do for the Education Council is only a small part of its activities. As a result of the work the bureau is continually being given, with the numerous research projects they have to undertake on behalf of the Economic Advisory Council and the Scientific Advisory Council, expansion is necessary. But there is no question of giving everybody a private secretary and having a large secretariat. This expansion is not unnecessary. I can give the hon. member the assurance that care is taken to see that it does not get out of hand, and that is why we also provided in the Act that this council should not establish its own separate research bureau, but that it would make use of existing facilities. But because more work is being entrusted to them and because the work is urgent, it is necessary to increase the staff. The hon. member said that he was glad that the decisions were unanimous. He expressed the hope that when this council in future took decisions and I accept their advice, it would always be a unanimous decision which I accept. Of course I cannot bind myself there. It is gratifying to see that all their decisions were unanimous, but in any case it is not a rule of democracy that all the decisions one accepts have to be unanimous. I hope it will not happen, but if it later appears necessary for the Minister to take a decision either on a majority resolution or even a minority resolution, the Minister should still have the right to decide.</p>

<p>The hon. member expressed the opinion that we did not make sufficient use of married female teachers. I have been given the assurance that it is the policy of the Department that when an expert person is required and there is no unmarried women to fill the post, a married woman is appointed. But we should beware of one thing, namely that the bread is not buttered on both sides by keeping a married woman teacher in employment because she is a good teacher, whilst closing the door to a young teacher who has just finished her studies, so that there is no opening left for her. So when there are shortages we say that the married woman must assist us, and where we know that the shortage will persist for a long time my Department appoints married women teachers for periods of three years or even longer. And where they are particularly qualified for the post and there are unmarried but less qualified applicants for the same post, they are still appointed. Therefore to a large extent we are in fact doing what the hon. member desires, and we try to secure the best people in the interest of our nation.</p>

<p>I should just like to round off this matter of the Education Council by replying to the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor), who also spoke on the subject. The hon. member made one great point, namely that the Education Council recommended that there should be an end to the divided control, and that with a view to that a change should be made. I prefer to quote the exact words from paragraph 31 of the report. I do not want to read the whole of it, but they say that they will do all these things &#x201C;with a view to the possible allocation to the provinces of all education up to Std. X&#x201D;. That is the advice. This recommendation was transmitted to me and I said that I was willing to allow them to publish the following in a Press statement, and in connection with that particular sentence my words were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To consult and together (the provinces and my Department) to evolve acceptable plans with a view to ending the divided control of secondary education and the development of a national education pattern.</block>

<p>This is a difference in degree, and not in principle. That is how I see it. This advice was definitely, cut and dried, that all secondary education should be given to the provinces. My standpoint was that it is too early to decide on that. That is the very crux of the matter. The crux of the matter is that we want to abolish divided control, but we want to know how it is to be done, and we cannot say that this is the only method. Therefore I phrased it in this general way, that the divided control of education should come to an end and that there should be development of a national education pattern. That is the language which has always been used in this House. There was no difference between us. It was not a question of our saying that we would be taking something away from the provinces or giving the provinces something. It was not a <i>quid pro quo</i> affair but the basic idea is that the whole of the White population, Afrikaans- and English-speaking, feels the need for a national education pattern to be developed, even though it shows great diversity. This is where I differed from them, but I do not think it is a difference in principle; it is a difference in degree as to how one must state the case at the moment, because that is all important. I want to predict that this is only the beginning and that it will not be completed next year either, or perhaps for quite a few years, but there is no idea of our deceiving one another or of playing politics or of seeing where one can gain a disadvantage. This is not a <i>quid pro quo</i> affair. The main point is that this is really an honest effort on the part of these educationists to do the best they can for the child, who is the important factor. The interests of the child come first, before the national interest. Now the hon. member for Wynberg has raised objection. She says they are concerned with the teacher and with this problem and that one. If the hon. member takes everything into account she will see that all these things together just amount to an attempt to achieve the great ideal. This meeting of education <span class="col_5987-5988" refersTo="page_327"/>chiefs has existed for years already, but since we have had this Education Advisory Council now for the first time these five education Departments can get together and really show results because there is mutual trust. Previously there was suspicion and they thought: You just want to get us together to take something away from us. Therefore I am grateful that we have got so far. This House ought to express its gratitude because we are now at least not trying to take advantage of one another and stepping on each other&#x2019;s toes, and seeing how the one can profit from the other. If we can now say as legislators that we want to give these persons every possible assistance, I want to predict that we will render a great service to the Republic of South Africa. I have asked my Deputy Minister to discuss the question of manpower. Then hon. members will not have to listen for so long to one monotonous voice.

<p>There are five members. Professor Rautenbach is the chairman, but he is there part time. Professor Bingle is the Deputy Chairman and he is there part time. Dr. Jordaan is also Deputy-Chairman and he is there full time. Miss E. C. Steyn, one of the members, is there full time, and Mr. Stanley Osler is also there full time.</p>

<p>Now, in regard to the Cilliers Report I just want to point out that the report stated that the subsidies to the universities were steadily increasing and eventually it may become 100 per cent, but all that the State says is this: We recognize the autonomy of the universities, but in regard to one matter we want to retain co-authority, and that is in regard to the money voted for the universities. The State has to provide that money, but the State does not want to tell these people how and what they have to teach. We do not interfere in that sort of thing, but we have co-authority in regard to the whole development, and we just warn them of that. They always boast of their autonomy, but we are very interested in the products they produce. I want to state my standpoint very clearly to the hon. member, and also to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) in regard to the question of Nusas. I received letters of protest from the university authorities concerned in regard to what my two colleagues had to say about Nusas and about those universities. I handed them over to my colleagues. They supplied me with an answer which I transmitted to the principals of these universities without comment, and I have heard nothing further about it. Whether these principals are now convinced I do not know, but my two colleagues are man enough to defend their own case. But what I want to say is this. I stand here as one of the original founders of Nusas. In 1959 I represented my Alma Mater at Stellenbosch, when Nusas was founded. We drew up a constitution and the name of that body was the National Union of South African Students, and that constitution was in the interest of the students of South Africa. It was a cohesive federated body, the object of which was to promote the interests of the students of South Africa. Dr. J. D. du Plessis, the former Secretary for Coloured Affairs, was also one of the founders as well as Dr. Len Verwoerd, the brother of the Prime Minister. But what has happened since then? Instead of that constitution, which is still in my possession, there is an amended constitution and a changed course of action which I must say is frightening. These people no longer stand by the original objects, but encroach on the political sphere. They arrogate to themselves the right as immature people, to a large extent, to criticize any actions of the Government. We receive the greatest criticism from them, but I take no notice of it. When I receive criticism from that association, it goes into the wastepaper basket without any acknowledgment, because that body has been so wrongly inspired in recent years. But I want to say that the State has an interest in it. As the hon. member for Sunnyside quoted from the Cilliers Report, university training has a three-fold object, and we subscribe to that. The State will not allow its citizens to be influenced in this wrongful manner, and they associate with all kinds of movements which are certainly not good for the country and its people. I am glad that quite a few of these universities where Nusas plays a role are waking up now, and I immediately want to tell the hon. member for Houghton that this nursery school of mine has not yet asked me whether they may become a member, but if they do so I will prohibit them from joining that organization. [Hear, hear!] In view of the fact that the Government pays its subsidy and bears full responsibility for that nursery school, we will not allow it, nor will I allow it at our high schools or at any of our other schools. We will not tolerate those pernicious influences. There are splendid international organizations in student life, but this association has left an odium which certainly cannot be ignored. I say this quite clearly so that hon. members may know where they stand as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>The sound ideas expressed by the hon. member for Westdene in regard to the necessity for additional university training are gratefully accepted by me and I want to tell him that I was and still am a Witwatersrander, and I believe that in view of that great concentration of population the large universities do not offer the solution to our problems, and the Cilliers Report also said so. The contact is lost. I received a letter from a parent the other day, whose child is at one of the large universities. This child has been there since February, and last week this parent wrote to <span class="col_5989-5990" refersTo="page_328"/>me saying that the daughter had written to her father that she had actually seen her Afrikaans professor that day for the first time. She had not even had the opportunity to come into contact with him. That is one of the many reasons for the large number of failures. I do not wish to go into the matter, but I just want to say that the Government is not unsympathetic to the establishment of a second university on the Rand.</p>

<p>But the Government thoroughly bears in mind all the points raised here. Since 1922 the University of Port Elizabeth was the first university to be established which did not have to start right at the bottom. The Government is aware that it is not easy to get lecturers. One can get many people, but few good ones, and therefore we have to go slowly, and the University of Port Elizabeth must first be assisted through its difficult initial stage. A lecturing staff has to be appointed. We have the non-White universities, and we cannot take too many lecturers away from other institutions, and we have to take care in that regard. I am not discussing the medium now. Personally, I still believe that the University of Port Elizabeth is not an experiment, but that it will be the crown on the great things we have already achieved in this country, viz. that it is possible to have a dual medium university there where Afrikaans-and English-speaking students will be able to associate with one another happily. And I hope that this will be proved within the next few years. I also want to tell the hon. member for Somerset East in connection with Port Elizabeth that this university will appear on the Estimates next year. It will appear on the Estimates on I April 1956. We have so much confidence in them that the Government has given them a gift of R160,000 to assist them over the initial period, and thereafter they will receive full assistance.</p>

<p>Now there are still two matters. The hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) raised the question of the scientific societies. I want to say immediately that the Government&#x2019;s policy is quite clear and I will not depart from it. It remains as it is. In sport and also in every other sphere our policy is that these things should be organized separately for the various groups, White and non-White, and that there should be the possibility of having contact at the highest level by means of affiliation or federation and on the executive level. That is our policy in regard to the trade unions, the employers&#x2019; organizations, and sport. That is the traditional policy of South Africa. The White man helps the others where they are weaker, and puts them on their feet. That policy will stand. I just briefly want to mention what happened.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1962 we informed these societies that unless they amend their constitutions in such a way that they have only White members, they cannot receive the subsidy the Government pays them. That is mainly a subsidy to publish certain periodicals. Then two problems arose. The one problem is that there are very few of these people. There is perhaps one non-White in one society, or two in another, but whether it is one or five or 100 it makes no difference. The policy is applied consistently. We do not want mixed societies. But we are always reasonable in the application of our policy. When this circular was sent out by my Department to draw their attention to the decision of the Government, trouble arose in regard to two bodies. The one is a purely Afrikaans body, the S.A. Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns, under the chairmanship of Dr. Ampie Roux, and the other was the S.A. Association of Technical Societies under the chairmanship of Mr. Campbell Pitt. These two gentlemen asked whether they could not see me jointly in order to put their problems to me. I agreed, and they came and I had a long consultation with them. Both gentlemen stated their difficulties. I then explained how I viewed the matter and how they could do it. Then we agreed that they would go back to their respective associations and put the matter to them as I had stated it, and then they would come back and tell me whether they now had different proposals, whether I should withdraw the whole thing, or whether I should amend it. I am still waiting for them. I am not reproaching them, because I think they have a difficult task. Perhaps they are still busy negotiating. But in the meantime the members of these associations were in a hurry and asked to see me, I then told the hon. member for Sea Point that I could not see them, and that was my reason; I could not see them because I was still waiting for Dr. Roux and Mr. Campbell Pitt to come and see me. Now it seems to me that there is confusion in regard to the whole matter, and I want to say that I have arrived at the following decision, and that in the light of what happened I have decided that for the financial year 1964-5 I will still continue paying these subsidies to the associations as in the past, hoping that during the present year a basis will be found for implementing the policy of the Government. If this hope is, however, not realized I shall have no other choice but to stop the subsidies for 1965-6. It is only a small subsidy. Not much money is involved. There are only 14 members out of 14,000, and the only thing I can do is to do it in this way, by giving these people an opportunity to consider the matter and then to have consultations again to see whether we cannot settle the matter on the basis of the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>Those are the very suggestions <span class="col_5991-5992" refersTo="page_329"/>I am awaiting from Dr. Roux and Mr. Campbell Pitt. If they tell me that nothing can be done, we will devise ways and means. But let us rather not seek the solution here. Let us seek it in the right place. I think we can probably solve those people&#x2019;s problems.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. Pelser) raised a matter which is of real interest, and this gives me the opportunity at the same time to reply to the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher). Both the hon. member for Klerksdorp and the hon. member for Rosettenville spoke about the training of medical men. The hon. member for Klerksdorp says that three kinds of training are provided in our country. There is the liberal training and there is the scientific training, but there is also such a thing as a Christian background and views. He pleaded that if another medical faculty is established, the training there should be the basis of what is actually the national principle, on a Christian basis. Now I may just inform hon. members, and the hon. member for Rosettenville may also take note of it, that the Government has had a survey made by the Scientific Advisory Council of what is required in South Africa. Should an additional medical faculty be established, or can the four existing faculties be expanded in such a way as to comply with the present requirements and for the next few years? We have been informed that all four faculties can be expanded in such a manner that until approximately 1975 a sufficient number of medical men can be trained to comply with the requirements of the Republic. That does not mean to say that no additional medical faculty may be established before 1975, because it takes quite a while before something like that comes into actual operation, but at least for the next few years there is no need for an additional medical faculty. Now I do not think hon. members need deliver pleas for a medical faculty here or there. We already know all that. Just let us accept the position. This was done in co-operation with the universities, and I just want to tell the hon. member for Rosenttenville that, according to the information we have, it is not only the shortage of money which results in Bantu not being able to go to Durban, but it is because the Bantu cannot succeed in passing the medical examinations to the same extent as the Whites. For many years to come the Whites will still have to provide medical services for the Bantu and the other racial groups. Therefore we shall have to train more medical men to assist those underdeveloped groups.</p>

<p>Now I still have to reply only to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss). She made out a strong case in regard to bursaries and bursary loans. I complimented her on it last time, but I think she will now see what progress has been made in only a few months&#x2019; time, and what we have already achieved. I want to say briefly that my Department has available a total sum of R126,600 per annum, which is made available to the universities in the form of bursaries. Then since 1956 the Government has made funds available to the universities which they can give to needy students in the form of study loans, which the students then repay with interest. In this an amount of R253,000 has been invested. Apart from those bursaries and study loans provided by the Department, every university also has its own bursaries and loan funds to assist students. Large sums are also made available by other bodies. I estimate that this amounts to about R500,000 a year. Those are bodies like the C.S.I.R., the Railways, the Atomic Power Board, the oil companies, the Chamber of Mines, Iscor, the Helpmekaarfonds, etc. But now I come to the most important point, and that is the announcement by the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech as to the establishment of a national bursary fund. Hon. members will remember that the Minister announced that this fund would be established and that my Department would have to handle its disbursement, together with the legislation to legalize that fund, I shall also have to introduce legislation in regard to how the fund should be administered. This will still be done during this Session. Hon. members will remember that companies can subtract a maximum of 1 per cent from their taxable income for this purpose, and I expect that if the necessary publicity is given to it&#x2014;and I hope great publicity is given to it&#x2014;companies will react very favourably, because this is now the first time that we are establishing a bursary fund from which not only the very clever students will be able to receive a free bursary, but the second-class matriculant, the type of student we also need and have sometimes neglected, and who are in needy circumstances, will also be enabled to study further with the assistance of a bursary.</p>

<p>But when I talk about bursaries, I want to say clearly that I think it is quite demoralizing that a bursary should always be a free one. A large proportion of the bursary should be in the form of a loan, repayable by the student when he starts earning his own money. I want to mention an example. I said once that the time would soon arrive when not a single person who had passed matric and wished to go to a university would be prevented from doing so by lack of funds. But what did I find? The other day I received a letter from a woman. Her daughter is at Stellenbosch and she received a bursary of R100, and now she cannot study. When we made investigations, Stellenbosch informed us that we had granted her a free bursary of R100 and had offered her a loan of R200, but the parents had refused the loan of R200 and had only accepted the R100, and now of course that is insufficient. Just imagine! I now want to tell hon. members that our Public Service bursaries, which were always free bursaries, will be changed as from next year so that part of the bursary will have to be repaid as a loan, and for the other portion they will have to give an undertaking to serve for a certain number of years.</p>

<p><span class="col_5993-5994" refersTo="page_330"/>In regard to these bursaries I want to assure hon. members that I have not based my expectations in regard to this national bursary fund on sand. I asked my Head Office what amount had been donated by industry until 31 March 1964 for the technological training of Whites at universities. To-day I received the reply by telex&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Inquiry re technological training refers: Total donations to 31 March 1963 amount to R1,588,938 and for the financial year 1963-4 to R1,239,585, therefore a total amount for the two years of R2,828,523.</block>

<p>I want to say that the reactions of these people to technological training are gratifying. I am grateful for it, and I am quite convinced that next year the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) and I will be able to shake hands and say that our ideal has been achieved, and that we will continue along those lines, and every person who needs it will now be able to obtain the necessary funds. I just want to tell the hon. member in conclusion that I agree with her that re-education is the solution to the problem. But it is not the task of Adult Education to undertake that. For that we have our vocational schools and our technical colleges and the other institutions which see to re-education. Adult Education has a totally different object. We cannot allow re-education, which is a specialized matter, to be tackled in that way. But the hon. member is correct in her submission that re-education is the solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Of course it is compulsory education but I am sure that the hon. the Minister will not argue with me that in the circumstances in which we are living to-day university and higher education has become extremely important. There is a tremendous shortage of manpower in South Africa to-day, particularly of technologists and technicians, and under these circumstances I think the approach of the hon. the Minister is completely wrong. He himself said that a portion of Public Service bursaries would in future be regarded as repayable loans and that this would be put into operation next year. Mr. Chairman, if we follow that policy then I do not believe that we will ever be able to overcome the problem with which we are faced to-day&#x2014;the tremendous shortage of manpower.

<p>Yes, but why did the hon. member advocate that loans should be made available?

They simply cannot afford it. The hon. member asked for a new approach to this whole problem and said that more should be done in the future. But the reply of the hon. the Minister to this was that it would have a demoralizing effect if bursaries were regarded as non-repayable loans. Sir, we Afrikaans-speaking people have undergone fantastic development over the past 15 or 20 years and because we have undergone that development we now adopt an attitude which is almost as snobbish as the attitude adopted by some people in the days of Milner and in the days of Lord Charles Somerset. I say that the time has come for us to see the position in this country as it really is; and the position is simply that thousands and thousands of young Afrikaans and English-speaking people cannot afford to go to university.</p>

<p>I just want to refer the hon. the Minister to the report of Professor A. C. Cilliers, at page 78, to show how costs <span class="col_5995-5996" refersTo="page_331"/>have increased. In 1911 the total cost per university student per annum amounted to &#x00A3;104 16s. Student fees amounted to 17.64 per cent of this amount; the income derived from private sources was 14.12 per cent and the income of the institutions was 31.77 per cent. The State gave a subsidy of 68.23 per cent. What was the position in 1961? According to this report the total cost per university student per annum was &#x00A3;205 16s.; student fees had increased from 17.65 per cent to 29.44 per cent, a tremendous increase, the income from private sources was 3.59 per cent as against 14.12 per cent in 1911. The income of these institutions remained reasonably constant. In 1911 it was 31.77 per cent and in 1961, 33.04 per cent. Sir, we boast about the very large subsidy which the State pays to universities but in 1911 the State subsidy was 68.23 per cent and in 1961 it amounted to only 66.51 per cent!.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, but the contribution of the State must be compared on a percentage basis if we want to do it in a scientific way. Mr. Chairman, the National Advisory Educational Council can study all the reports of all its various committees which have sat on this matter but unless they can work out a scheme to attract more young men and women to our institutions for higher education we will simply not be able to succeed in overcoming this problem of manpower shortage. The important question is whether we have the people to-day to train as the technologists and technicians whom we shall be needing in the future. That is precisely where our whole plan, our whole system will fall down. But what does the hon. the Minister do? He comes along here and he throws cold water over the whole plan to bring higher education more easily within the reach of the ordinary man. He wants to make it even more expensive than it already is to-day. A student will be able to obtain a bursary but he will have to repay a portion of that bursary; it will be regarded as a loan. According to the hon. the Minister it will have a demoralizing effect upon the student if he is granted a bursary that is completely free. There are many people in South Africa and even in this House who received their training at institutions for higher education through the assistance of bursaries, bursaries which they never repaid.</p>

<p>There are others who did not repay the bursaries granted to them because it was not necessary to do so but that does not make them inferior to the hon. the Minister. I am very sorry that the hon. the Minister made that remark at this stage of the development of our education because it can only have a damaging effect upon higher education as such. This statement that he has made can only place a damper on students who are anxious to receive university training but who cannot afford that training. The hon. the Minister also placed a damper on potential students a few weeks ago when he said, in dealing with the A. C. Cilliers report, that the State was going to do a great deal more but that study fees would in all probability have to be increased in the future. I do not believe that the hon. the Minister did the cause of higher education any good by making that statement. If there are deserving people who want to receive higher education and who cannot afford it then it is the duty of the State to assist those people.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister saw fit to follow the example of the hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl) by making an attack upon a certain student organization which functions at some of our autonomous universities. The hon. member for Sunnyside has told us that students at English-medium universities have no choice; that they have to become members of Nusas, but I am sure that the hon. member knows that precisely the same position obtains at our Afrikaans-medium universities. The students at our Afrikaans-medium universities are also compelled to become members of the &#x201C;Afrikaanse Studentebond&#x201D;. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>One is really disturbed at the attitude adopted by the previous speaker. When the hon. the Minister referred to the question of bursaries, he made use of the opportunity, firstly, to indicate the large amounts that are being made available by the State for bursary purposes. He pointed out that those facilities had been increased, but at the same time the hon. the Minister also made an appeal in regard to the morale of our people. He told us that people who need bursaries could obtain those bursaries through the medium of the Government but that after they had completed their studies they should consider it a privilege to repay part of those study fees to the donor. Mr. Chairman, one of the most striking characteristics of a nation is its self-respect. The hon. the Minister made use of this opportunity actually to encourage bursary-holders to show a sense of self-respect and so it disturbs me that the Opposition, through the medium of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), has actually undermined the ground on which a nation&#x2019;s self-respect has to be built. We as legislators ought rather to use our influence to guide and encourage our young people in this country, encourage them to do their share as well and not to expect to be given everything for nothing. That is why I am particularly disturbed by the attitude adopted by the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) in referring to the manpower committee this afternoon hurled accusations against the Bureau for Educational Research which in my opinion were undeserved, unfair and untrue. <span class="col_5997-5998" refersTo="page_332"/>The hon. member referred to the manpower committee which is investigating the manpower position in the country and she said that it was surprising that the bureau which has been in operation since 1948 has not yet been able to do anything in this regard; that a manpower committee has to be brought into being in order to do this work. I say that that is a very unfair and untrue accusation against the bureau. The very last way in which one can solve the manpower problem is either by means of slogans, such as those used by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West), or by means of untrue statements, such as those made by the hon. member for Wynberg. When one wants to get to the root of the manpower problem one has in the first place to ascertain scientifically what the actual manpower requirements of this country are. The second step in this regard is to ascertain the actual talent of the manpower available, juveniles and other, in this country, and &#x2019; thirdly, it is the task of the State to make the necessary training facilities available so that those people who have a particular aptitude can be trained in that direction. Time does not permit me to go into detail in regard to this last-mentioned factor because I want to come back to what has actually been done by the bureau and the manpower committee. I want to say that there is nothing of which the Government need be ashamed in this regard. It is not for nothing that we in this country have the second highest world percentage of Whites at universities. This is not something that has just happened. We have reached this position as a result of the training facilities which the State has made available. America is the only country in the world in which the percentage of Whites at universities is higher than that in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to hurry on in the short time I have left to me to indicate what we have actually done in connection with manpower research. The impression given by the hon. member for Wynberg was that the Bureau for Educational Research has done nothing over the years since 1948; that the State has been fast asleep.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>We can note with appreciation what has been done in this sphere over the past years. The establishment of this manpower committee, the first meeting of which I had the privilege of opening officially in Pretoria the other day, is not simply a first step taken by this Government in connection with manpower research. We have been engaged upon manpower research over the past ten years. In 1958 the Bureau for Educational Research completed a particularly important and interesting study which dealt with a survey made in connection with the training and employment of natural scientists and engineers in South Africa. This was a very comprehensive work and consisted of five volumes. This investigation indicated the manpower position in the sphere of natural science in South Africa at the time as well as what the requirements in this regard would be in five years&#x2019; time, and we were able to set up our educational facilities accordingly. In this connection I also want to mention the fact that the bureau is at present engaged upon an investigation into the labour pattern of the Coloureds here in the Western Cape. They are already engaged upon that investigation and when the investigation into the labour pattern in the Western Cape has been completed, that investigation is going to be extended to the Coloureds in the rest of the country and also to the Indians, beginning with the position in Natal. These investigations that are being undertaken by the Bureau for Educational Research will form the basis for any further advice which can be given to the Government for the establishment of suitable means of employment. But one has also to begin at the root of the manpower problem and that is to ascertain what the talents of our school-going children are. The bureau is engaged upon an equally important investigation in this connection; it is making a survey of children leaving school in order to ascertain why children leave school before they have passed Std. VIII or Std. X. The purpose of this inquiry is to keep children at school until they have passed their final examinations. But that is not the only work we are doing. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has been engaged for some years now upon a similar investigation, through the medium of the staff institutes, into our manpower requirements in this country. This inquiry is being undertaken in various spheres. The bureau is doing the investigation in connection with children at school and also in regard to children leaving school. As a result of these investigations upon which the bureau on the one hand and the C.S.I.R. on the other hand are engaged, as a result of the biennial manpower survey that is being made by the Department of Labour and also as a result of the surveys that are being made by the Bureau of Census and Statistics, we have found that there has been a duplication of work and wastage of manpower. In order to eliminate that duplication of work the Government has decided that all these bodies should be co-ordinated. That is the reason for the establishment of the manpower committee which has now started work. That meeting of the manpower committee to which I have referred was attended by 27 persons representing the Provincial Administrations, various State Departments dealing with labour matters, Departments like Bantu Administration and Development, Coloured Affairs, Indian Affairs and, obviously, the Department of Labour itself as well as Immigration. This manpower committee has been brought into being but the Bureau for Educational Research still occupies a key position; it still remains the actual investigating body of this <span class="col_5999-6000" refersTo="page_333"/>manpower committee. Because the bureau has gained knowledge and experience in connection with manpower research over the years, it is felt that we should retain that machinery in the future and that is why the machinery has been set up under the bureau. That manpower committee will co-ordinate the various projects and the various Government and semi-Government research bodies. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>There are three matters which I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister. The first one arises out of the Estimates of Expenditure from Loan Account, Loan Vote M, &#x201C;Loan to National Film Board&#x201D;, R442,000. It was R450,000; apparently they drew R8,000. The matter I want to raise is the question of the appointment of the general manager of this board. I have asked a total of, I think, ten questions on this subject&#x2014;on 7 February we saw the curtain rise on what I can only call &#x201C;The Curious Case of Mr. Crouse&#x201D;. It is quite a thrilling film or play in ten episodes. I asked on 7 February whether applications had been invited, etc., and the Minister in reply gave me a long list of the positions with the National Film Board for which applications had been invited, starting with the general manager at R6,150. Curiously enough the advertisement in the newspapers, which was inserted in the usual way, and more particularly the one which appeared in the <i>Vaderland</i> on Thursday the 30 January refers to all those positions except the position of general manager, so that I could not&#x2014;and cannot to this day&#x2014;reconcile how the hon. the Minister could tell me: &#x201C;These are the positions that are going to be filled in the usual way,&#x201D; etc., when in the advertisement, which appeared a week before that answer was given, there was no reference to the general manager-&#x2014;the top position was not advertised! I have read this carefully, and I can find no reference to it. There is a fairly lengthy list of positions and I will not have the time to go through it. Then on 25 February in order to try to clarify this rather mysterious position, I asked whether the National Film Board had employed any persons at a commencing salary of more than R3,500 per annum. Of course, the position of general manager was advertised, according to the hon. the Minister, but not according to the advertisement, at R6,150. The hon. the Minister replied and said: &#x201C;Yes, one employee, Mr. F. J. de Villiers, as secretary-treasurer, at R4,080 per annum.&#x201D; We still had not found the general manager! Then on 28 February I asked him whether a meeting had taken place during February this year between any official of his Department and members of the Motion Picture Producer&#x2019;s Association of Southern Africa, who claimed, according to a Press report, that they had met the general manager of the National Film Board, Mr. Crouse, the week before. I put this question to the hon. the Minister of Information who had, perhaps unfortunately for him, insinuated himself into this little discussion between the Minister and myself. The Minister of Information replied &#x201C;no&#x201D; to the first part of my question, and the rest of it fell away. I then came back to the Minister of Education, Arts and Science&#x2014;Sir, the &#x201C;question and answer&#x201D; procedure as employed in the House of Assembly will never cease to be a source of wonder as far as I am concerned. I came back to the Minister on 3 March and asked whether a Mr. Alexander Crouse was employed by his Department. He answered, &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, gave me his degrees, and said that his salary was R4,500 and that he was the chief of the division of State Film Production. Now we come to 10 April when I asked the hon. the Minister whether a general manager for the National Film Board had now been appointed, and his reply was: &#x201C;Yes, on 1 April 1964,&#x201D; and he informed me that Mr. Crouse was the general manager! Arising out of something else, I put a question to the hon. the Minister of Information. I asked him whether his attention had been drawn to the caption to a photograph which had appeared in the <i>South African Digest</i> of 21 November 1963 and which contained a reference to &#x201C;the general manager of the Film Board&#x201D;, and I then referred him to the statements which the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts and Science had made. This caption referred to the general manager of the Film Board, Mr. Alexander Crouse. The Minister&#x2019;s reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes. The <i>South African Digest</i> reflects important revents reported in the South African Press. The name and designation referred to appeared in the South African Press during the period immediately preceding publication of the report in the <i>S.A. Digest.</i></block>

<p>And then there appeared this addition to the answer&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Crouse was General Manager Designate until April 1 and was in charge of administration during the interim period.</block>

<p>The word &#x201C;designate&#x201D; was spelt with a capital D. I then came back to the Minister of Education on 17 April and asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether a post of General Manager Designate was at any time created in connection with the establishment of the national Film Board; if so, on what date?</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister courteously&#x2014;but very curtly&#x2014;replied, &#x201C;No; the rest falls away.&#x201D; I went back again to the Minister of Information and I said to him in effect on 21 April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From what source was the information obtained, given in his statement of 14 April 1964 that Mr. Crouse was General Manager Designate of the National Film Board until 1 April 1964?</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Information replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6001-6002" refersTo="page_334"/>The information became available through National Film Board sources.</block>

<p>In other words, through the Minister of Education, Arts and Science&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to direct the attention of the hon. member to the fact that, in my original reply in the House I used the Afrikaans word &#x201C;aangewese&#x201D; in its generally accepted form.</block>

<p>In the English text, of course, he used the word &#x201C;Designate&#x201D;. In reply to a subsequent question he said that &#x201C;designate&#x201D; should have been printed with a small &#x201C;d&#x201D; instead of a capital D, which merely proved that we were not getting anywhere. What I want to put to the hon. the Minister is this: I believe he is in charge of the Public Service; we talked about that yesterday. I hope he will explain to the Committee how it comes about that a man who was already known to be General Manager of this very important board, which has been given a loan of R450,000 in its first month, as it were, in Government circles and in the <i>South African Digest</i> as the General Manager of the board as early as 21 November 1963 and is thus known publicly, to the Press and to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Southern Africa, with whom this board will have to work very closely, I believe, can be appointed in such a way that the hon. the Minister can stand up in this House and, without a smile on his face, give me eight evasive answers which obscure the fact of the matter&#x2014;which is that Mr. Crouse has all along been the general manager of that board? On top of everything the Minister said to me and the House, did he then have to say, in order to circumvent any complaint, &#x201C;Oh, he was only general manager designate.&#x201D;? Nobody knew that except the Minister of Information. The public, the National Film Board and I were not let into the secret. I hope the hon. the Minister will give an explanation on that score. Sir, this could and should develop into a very lengthy discussion but I am not going to pursue it.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister what he intends to do in regard to the acquisition of works of art, in view of the fact that out of the windfall which the hon. the Minister of Finance has announced, there will be R250,000 to spend on such works of art. I want to ask him what he is going to do, as related to the purchase of the Fehr collection. As I have said before in this House, I was very happy to learn that the State had acquired this collection. In reply to a question from the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) on 7 April the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts and Science gave a number of details, and from the answer emerges the fact that although R300,000 was paid for this collection, one gentleman, being Mr. F. L. Alexander, who was a lecturer on art and erstwhile dealer in antiques and is at present art critic for the <i>Burger,</i> according to the answer, valued the collection at R100,000&#x2014;and then apparently, according to the Minister&#x2019;s answer, in order to make sure that he had not been unfair and had not tried to mislead the Minister, he tried to put the maximum value on it, and Mr. Alexander said, &#x201C;Let us add 50 per cent for goodwill and make it R150,000.&#x201D; This was Mr. Alexander&#x2019;s valuation, and yet, because two other valuers were called in&#x2014;either at the same time or subsequently, I do not know from the answer&#x2014;the price paid was R300,000, when the basic valuation of Mr. Alexander was R100,000, or R150,000 if you add 50 per cent for goodwill for safety&#x2019;s sake. I raise this, Sir, because I sincerely hope that in which ever way we may acquire art treasures for the nation, they will be acquired in a more realistic way, having regard to the public purse; in other words, that we will spend the money more realistically.</p>

<p>The other point is that according to the Minister&#x2019;s answer the only place where this exhibition will be seen will be Cape Town. I will remind the hon. the Minister that it is common knowledge that very important works of art are shipped half-way around the world, including the Mona Lisa, etc., and although this is a condition of this collection &#x2026;</p>

<p>Numbers of hon. members in this House as well as the hon. the Minister have referred to the evils that have resulted from the Nusas student organization and I think one must place the blame for these things at the door of the universities where most of these students receive their education. When one considers the question of sabotage in and refugees from this country, I think it may perhaps be worthwhile to discover what the percentage is of people who are guilty of these things, at which universities they have studied and what the State grants to such universities is. The hon. the <span class="col_6003-6004" refersTo="page_335"/>Minister referred to the Education Advisory Council and then he referred to certain persons who had done particularly good work on that council. He spoke, amongst others, of Mr. Stanley &#x2026;, which gave hon. members quite a fright until the hon. the Minister said &#x201C;Osler&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I think that it may be a good thing if we change his name to Osler Stanley so that one will not get a fright when one hears that first name.</p>

<p>There are many opportunities for employment in this country and there is sufficient money for people to earn. But every person who accepts work must be a capable and able person and must learn that capability and ability at our educational institutions. It is not sufficient just to be capable. We test a person&#x2019;s ability by his knowledge and by his aptitude but we also test his competency by his devotion to duty and by his adjustment to his work and to life. It is this aspect which is also part of university training that I want to emphasize for a moment at this late hour of the debate. We have heard a great deal about the shortage of manpower. We know that the Government is engaged, through the medium of the hon. the Minister and his Department, in anticipating the development in the industrial sphere by making university training available so that when that manpower is required for our industrial development it will be forthcoming from our universities. It will not be a question of needing a certain amount of manpower for our industrial development and then having to wait until the universities produce that manpower. We are already proceeding in that direction, that is why I cannot understand why the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) is so disturbed and has attacked the hon. the Minister so unfairly. He said that the hon. the Minister is making no provision at all for the future. Every person on this earth has a function to perform. The hon. the Minister also has a function to perform in this House and so has the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West). The function of the hon. the Minister as a responsible person is to formulate a policy for us and to give us some idea of what will be done in the future and it is apparently the function of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) to stand up here in an irresponsible way and make a propagandistic speech. That is the easiest thing in the world to do; that is something that does not require much doing. One does not need much knowledge or much ability to do that.</p>

<p>Our aim in this country is of course that the graduates from our universities should not simply become so many cogs in a machine; not simply become so many buttons to be pressed. They must be people who in their life and work are the bearers of a principle of life. I want to emphasize this fact: South Africa will not be able to achieve anything numerically for many, many years. But what she has done in the past and what she will still do in the future as a result of the fact that our students receive the necessary training at our universities is to achieve something as far as quality is concerned. Each one of us has to take the place of six people but this is not the case in those countries where because of their large population, they have more than enough students who have had university training. Mr. Chairman, in our training we must be taught a sense of values. There is a lack of meaning in life, in our work, in our pleasure, in our sport, in our relaxation and in our dress. For what is meaningful in this life we have to rely upon the products of our universities because they Will have to give the lead in the future. They will have to set the pace.</p>

<p>The university has to deal not only with the 2,000 or 3,000 or 7,000 students studying within it. Those students do sit close to the fire but we must have channels of radiation from our universities to the public outside. We know that it is an unfortunate fact that the daily Press is not very interested in serving as a radiation channel for all that is good in our universities. From the nature of things and because of the times in which we live they have to reserve their space for the less meaningful, according to demand. Why is the demand for what is meaningful so poor? We must concentrate upon cultivating people who will ensure the correct demand. They must come from our universities. The universities must implant what is meaningful in life and in our present generation because the generation that is now at university will determine the demand in the future. They must make it easy for the daily Press also to serve as a radiation channel for all the good things at our universities. There is no market for the publications of universities themselves. As far as university publications are concerned the only consumer is the producer himself. Consumers are cultivated at the universities themselves and that is why university training must cover not only the apex of our national pyramid but it must be education on a national basis to such an extent that it permeates through all the masses.</p>

<p>I cannot but refer to the opportunities that are available. The hon. the Minister has already mentioned this fact. I have here a letter which I received from the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science. This is once again in reply to what was said by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) in connection with the lack of training facilities. The letter reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With a view to the great manpower shortage and the resultant necessity to enable all Whites to develop to the maximum of their ability it is felt that there is still a reasonable percentage of those who passed their matriculation in the second class who ought also to be able to obtain a degree or <span class="col_6005-6006" refersTo="page_336"/>a diploma. And so, to make it possible for the universities to give financial assistance to these students as well, the Minister of Finance, as announced in his recent Budget Speech, has agreed that companies who make donations to universities for bursary purposes will receive certain tax concessions. It is anticipated that companies will make handsome contributions for this purpose because they themselves are suffering from a great shortage of skilled manpower.</block>

<p>Our universities are subsidized to the extent of 70 per cent or 80 per cent of their expenditure by the State. I just want to point out that the percentage in Holland is 96 per cent. This is an ideal which it is worth our while in South Africa to strive for. Unfortunately, we have a lack of donors. The donors to universities are not the rich people; they are the poor people. Why is this so? Once again it is because there is too little taste for what is meaningful in life. If all of us had a taste for what is meaningful in life, rich and poor alike would open their wallets in order to make donations to universities by way of cash contributions and also by way of bequests and not simply expect the State to make these contributions. In other words, we should not always turn to the taxpayer to find the necessary funds for providing the necessary manpower for our country.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to prolong this debate unnecessarily but I should like to make one or two observations to remove some misunderstanding which seems to exist in the minds of the hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl) and others. I refer especially to the two quotations I made from speeches by hon. Ministers at functions during the recess. I did not make any attempt to defend Nusas. To be quite frank, the hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs did not attack Nusas. He did something much more serious. He attacked the universities, not Nusas. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Universities of the Witwatersrand, Cape Town, Rhodes and Natal are engaged on a grand scale in destroying the backbone and the pride of our youth and stripping them of their self-respect. The teaching personnel at these universities consisted mostly of liberalists and half-communists who on every possible occasion tried to impress on young people that they were no better than the primitive Black man. These universities play the game of the outside world in eliminating the White man in South Africa.</block>

<p>He did not refer to Nusas. That is the story the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs told the dear people at Wonderboom on the occasion of a &#x201C;stryddag&#x201D;. That is the first. I now come to the second.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Justice did attack Nusas but that is not the gravamen of my charge. The gravamen of my charge is the same as it was in the case of the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Parents should not send their children to universities where Nusas existed.</block>

<p>The case I made was this: That on the one hand we have an hon. Minister of Education doing his duty in introducing Votes in this House providing for R6,271,000 for four English language universities for extension purposes and to enable them to carry on their good work. On the other hand we have two of his colleagues advising parents not to send their children to these institutions. It was the inconsistency of the thing. That was the case I made. I shall not repeat it.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to defend Nusas. I do not think it is necessary for us to enter into a discussion about any student organization. People always criticize student organizations. They criticize one another. That is one reason why they go to university. They have views to express and lives to live out at that stage. It is the Milton idea of a university: &#x201C;Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.&#x201D; This is a personal touch: When I was a student the late Earl Roseberry, who was the greatest and most colourful orator of his day, opened a student union for us. He said at the close of his great oration: &#x201C;I suggest that in this student union you should have a scroll over the door &#x201C;No man will be bound in after life by any opinion he expresses here&#x201D;. Hon. members who have been to university would perhaps like to forget their careers there. You know how we lived at university, Sir,&#x2014;&#x201C;hard-up, but always happy&#x201D; we used to sing. Why should we in Parliament assembled devote our time to criticizing student organizations? They will criticize one another. And when students leave university you will find some of them sitting on the front benches here in later life. If you remind them then of their days at university 40 or 50 years before they will say: &#x201C;Shhh, do not mention that.&#x201D; That is the story, Sir. And that we should attack Nusas or any other organization is to waste our time. There is another student organization, the Afrikaner Studente Bond. Good luck to them too. I suppose they argue against one another. I suppose they have elections and I suppose they have rags. Students behaved so disgracefully the other day that the hon. member for Sunnyside worked himself into a passion, like an Indian Fakir, about the conduct of those students. Why? There is only one way to deal with a student who gets out of hand and that is to touch his pocket. There is very little in it. I think that is the obvious thing to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we make ourselves ridiculous if we spend our time attacking student organizations. The other day I noticed that we touched bottom. Somebody attacked the C.S.V. (Christelike Studente Vereniging). Well, well, if they attack them, Sir, I think there is nothing <span class="col_6007-6008" refersTo="page_337"/>left. If students get out of hand they should be dealt with. By whom? By the university authorities! There the Minister is right. We have to protect the autonomy of the universities and not attack these organizations from outside. The people to deal with them are the members of council on which the Minister is represented&#x2014;he is represented on every university council. They can deal with every situation of this kind.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said that we in this House should not waste our time on student organizations but in the meantime he himself was discussing them. The only conclusion that I can draw from his speech and the way in which he made it is that he aspires to becoming the cheer-leader of one of the universities at &#x201C;Inter-varsity&#x201D;. I want to tell him that is something that has been finalized and it will not help him therefore to cherish any aspirations in that regard.</p>

<p>I want to come back now to a matter which was raised here this afternoon by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) and the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss)&#x2014;the question of bursaries and loans to students. I cannot imagine a responsible hon. member in this House trying to make use of this House as a platform from which to make cheap bids for the support of intellectual young people of our country by criticizing the hon. the Minister for having said that it was demoralizing to grant bursaries to people without attaching any strings to the bursary. How did numbers of our educated people get where they are to-day? Did they get there the easy way by means of bursaries or did they get there the difficult way by means of self-application and by finding the wherewithal themselves? The hon. member told us the cost of how university education had increased. I do not deny that but I want to ask the hon. member whether he has noticed from the Cilliers Commission report to what extent the contributions of the State towards the training of our students has increased. The contributions of the State have increased by no less than 189 per cent since 1948.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) said that about 82 per cent of the students in Britain were able to attend university because they were given financial assistance. Perhaps the hon. the Minister was not listening attentively when she said this but she said that our students should all be exempt from class and hostel fees. That is the extent to which she wants them to be assisted. On page 71 of the report of the Cilliers Commission, after referring to the position in Great Britain, the commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, to give financial assistance to all and sundry irrespective of merit, is to put a premium on mediocrity.</block>

<p>I want to support the hon. the Minister wholeheartedly in his statement that in principle he is opposed to the granting of over-generous financial assistance. I want to say here to-day that the largest portion of the bursary and loan fund for which provision is made in the Estimates this year is used for loans. And that portion which is not used for loans must be used in order to give further encouragement by means of bursaries to the student who does well.</p>

<p>The great need to-day is mainly in the ranks of the pre-graduate students. The hon. the Minister referred to various funds and private institutions which exist to-day to assist students. But they first want to find out whether or not the student is likely to do well, whether he is the sort of person who has it in him to make a success of his studies. Here I have in mind the Helpmekaar Association which also wants to help but they too first want to see what the student is able to do. The main thing is to give that student a start. That is why I ask that this new National Bursary and Loan Fund and all other possible means which may become available in the future should be used for this purpose. Let us assist those students by way of bursary loans, if I may call them that, so that at an early stage the young student will realize that he has undertaken an obligation upon himself for the sake of his own progress and that he was not simply something for which he need not accept any responsibility at all.</p>

<p>Speaking about bursaries and loans I should like to quote what is stated by the Cilliers Commission in regard to various forms of bursaries made available by the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts and Science and by various other Government Departments, bodies which, as a result of staff shortages, encourage students by making bursaries available to them bursaries which are administered by the Public Service Commission. A condition of the bursary, however, is that the applicant must commit himself for a certain period to the Department concerned after the completion of his studies. In this connection the commission has the following to say in regard to these departmental bursaries, including those of the Provincial Education Department&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The above type of scholarship and loan schemes are not primarily concerned with the identification, encouragement and reward of talent, but with the attraction of an adequate supply of trained personnel. As such these schemes for the diversion and canalization of student choice along lines they would not otherwise have followed, to the detriment of other lines of study, is undeniably a reflection on the conditions of service in these sectors of the Public Service, especially in respect of salary scales. Attracting needy students by the trite device of offering comparatively lavish scholarships and loans may be a profitable temporary expedient to relieve a critical staff situation but the real and permanent remedy lies rather in steady and open competition <span class="col_6009-6010" refersTo="page_338"/>petition for the freely given services of the gifted and the trained.</block>

<p>They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Scholarship and loan systems of assistance should, therefore, seek to achieve lasting results by adhering to this basic principle, in preference to the fleeting success achieved by circumventing or ignoring it.</block>

<p>This same idea is supported in a memorandum drawn up by the Federation of Engineering students, a sphere in which there is a great shortage of manpower in this country. This is a memorandum which they drew up and submitted to a conference at which the question of bursaries and loans was discussed. In that memorandum Professor Heydon of Stellenbosch stresses this point, amongst others. He says that this practice of State Departments of binding people to work for the Department by granting them bursaries results in many students discovering after the completion of their studies that they do not really have an aptitude for that particular work and that they are not interested in it. This applies more particularly in the case of the more gifted student who is desirous of studying further after he has obtained his Bachelor&#x2019;s degree. He is then bound by that contract which he signed; he has to work for that Department or for some control board or other for a certain number of years. That sort of thing causes frustration. He is unhappy in his work because he either wanted to study further or to study in a completely different direction. That man is bound by a contract which he signed at a stage in his life when he was perhaps not mature enough to make up his own mind.</p>

<p>As a solution to this problem they suggest, not the abolition of bursaries and loans which are made available by State Departments in an effort to solve the problem of staff shortages, but a pooling of these funds which will be administered by the Department of Education, Arts and Science so that any gifted student or any student who needs assistance can apply to the Department for such assistance. Once that student has completed his studies he will then be free to apply for a post with any of the participators in the pool and, under the guidance of the Department, decide where to work. If he is a very gifted man and he decides to study for his Master&#x2019;s degree he must be given the opportunity, through the Department of Education, Arts and Science and with the assistance of this bursary fund pool, to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to express any opinion on this proposal but I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to this matter because I personally see a great deal of merit in it; as I see it it offers the possibility of attracting more gifted young students to the Public Service. We can even include in this pool groups of employers such as the Chamber of Industries, for example, the Chamber of Mines and other large organized groups of employers, groups which can offer a wider selection of posts to graduates. In this way we can make the man happy in his work and assist in making finances available to more and more of our promising students to study further after they have obtained their Bachelor&#x2019;s degree.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION,_ARTS_AND_SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that we have practically reached the end of the debate. However, I still owe the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) a reply. He mentioned a very important matter&#x2014;the purchase of the Fehr collection. In the first place I want to tell him that instead of asking all the questions that he had to ask in this case before he discovered the name of the person concerned, Mr. Crouse, he should in the future come to my office and I shall assist him then to draw up his questions correctly so that he can be given the answer he requires in reply to his first question. I really do not think that I replied unfairly to any of his questions but his questions were so incorrectly framed that I was not able to answer them in any other way. I really think he should take advantage of my offer.</p>

<p>But that is not the important point. The important matter is the Fehr collection. I am afraid that the remarks of the hon. member in regard to the Fehr collection may perhaps be wrongly interpreted both in this country and abroad. At the time, in 1962, the Government obtained three valuations of the Fehr collection. One valuation was R300,000, one was R150,000 and the other was R144,000. The valuator, however, stated that the Government could purchase the collection for R200,000. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How much the Government should pay depends on how badly it desires to retain the collection at the Castle. It is a very fine collection and one of which the Government might be proud should it acquire it.</block>

<p>As I say, these valuations were made in 1962. The Government has now paid R300,000 for the collection. As hon. members know, the value of these things constantly rises. Let me mention one example. The old Verenigde OosIndiese Companjie plates are valued at R200 each. During this Session some of those plates were sold for as much as R600 each. That is one point, the original articles which were valued in 1962 were supplemented by a further 30 articles which were added at a later stage. Those 30 articles are the following: &#x201C;Five African oils, 17 seventeenth century Japanese and eighteenth century Chinese pieces of china and two large V.O.C. plates, five pieces of antique stinkwood, yellowwood and oak furniture, one bracelet with trinkets, ring and seal for watch-chain, all in gold, from the Van Reenen family, one pair of pewter mugs, inscribed, Table Bay Regatta, 1878 and 1879, and one ship&#x2019;s bell, 1776&#x201D;. These articles did not form part of the collection at the time.<span class="col_6011-6012" refersTo="page_339"/>That is the material aspect of the matter. But imagine how much poorer the people of South Africa would have been, but for the expenditure of an additional R100,000 or even R200,000, if Dr. William Fehr had decided to break up his collection and to sell the items singly at a far higher price than R300,000 for the whole collection? It is estimated that if Dr. William Fehr had not been as patriotic as he was and had decided to sell his wonderful collection piecemeal, a collection which when one enters the Castle gives one the feeling of being transported into a wonderland of bygone days, he would have received far more. Just imagine how the Opposition would have complained! But I would have been ashamed to show my face outside and to hear the accusations of the people of South Africa! I think we as a nation and we in this House owe Dr. William Fehr a debt of the greatest appreciation and gratitude for the fact that because of his love for his country he did not yield to material considerations and hold out for more than he received from us, and that he enabled us to gain possession of this collection as a national treasure. I hope that that is the last we will hear about this question of valuations. From the material aspect alone I want to say that if the Government wanted to do so and had to do so, it would be able to obtain R500,000 for this collection within five or ten years&#x2019; time. Valuators would never value it at less than that figure. I am very pleased that the hon. member raised this matter and gave me the opportunity to express these words of gratitude and appreciation to Dr. William Fehr.</p>

<p>On Revenue Vote No. 24,&#x2014;&#x201C;Schools of Industries and Reform Schools&#x201D;, R2,100,000,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>This Vote of R2,100,000, dealing with the industrial schools and reform schools is an important Vote due to the fact that it covers the efforts of the State in reeducation of those juveniles, many of whom are juvenile offenders and juvenile delinquents, and it is pleasing to know that the emphasis has in recent times been placed rather on reeducation measures for these young persons than on the punitive measures.</p>

<p>However, I would like to deal first of all with the question of the reform schools. Mr. Chairman, you will recollect that in 1961 an important report was issued in regard to research undertaken by Mr. J. M. Lotter: &#x201C;Die rehabilitasie van Blanke jeugoortreders&#x201D;. In this particular report certain factors come to light, and I think one of the most important factors is that in judging the effect of the reeducation that takes place at the Constantia Reform School, it was found that the follow-up cases of some 544 ex-inmates of that school show that there was a very high degree of failures. The figures show that those persons who were not convicted of any further offence after being released from the reform school, only totalled 26.3 per cent, whereas those who were partial failures and who were convicted of only one or two counts for offences of a less serious nature constituted 10.1 per cent, and the failures&#x2014;the criterium here was taken as those persons convicted on several counts for serious crimes usually resulting in heavy prison sentences&#x2014;totalled 60.1 per cent, and of the over-all figure 3.5 per cent were unclassifiable. The hon. Minister has had sufficient time, I think to study the report and the important conclusions that were reached by this research that was undertaken in regard to ex-pupils of the Constantia Reform School, and I hope that the hon. Minister will be able to give some indication as to whether he has taken into consideration other systems of reeducation in this particular field in other parts of the world. For instance in America the principle has been adopted, and that is the modern principle, of establishing small units, and there they find that the degree of success in regard to this particular type of problem is very much higher. The figure that I have here shows that some 58 per cent success was achieved in this one particular school, the St. Francis School in the United States of America.</p>

<p>The other important factor is the after-care of these former pupils of a reform school and it is obvious that the hon. the Minister must consult with the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions in regard to the after-care of these pupils, because there, I believe, is the most important factor in regard to the re-education they received at the reform school. These persons who are released on licence can quickly fall foul of the law and find that they are then classified as failures, and either find their way to prison or return to the reform school. Sir, the &#x201C;Penal Reform News&#x201D; makes an observation which I believe is a correct one, because ordinary welfare organizations dealing with these difficult persons have a similar experience, which shows that the probation period following release is far from satisfactory. The editor&#x2019;s note in this &#x201C;Penal Reform News&#x201D; of July of last year, is to the effect that he has come to the conclusion, after discussing various aspects of the re-education that takes place at the Reform School at Constantia, that &#x201C;our system of probation and parole is far from satisfactory. Because of the lack of proper supervision of the one time loser, the one time loser becomes a hardened criminal&#x201D;. I do hope that the hon. Minister will make a full investigation in collaboration with the Minister of Social Welfare so as to ascertain how a greater degree of supervision can be brought about in regard to the expupils of such reform schools.</p>

<p>I wish to deal with the question of the schools of industries, and here the important work undertaken by the Minister&#x2019;s Department is meeting, I believe, with a greater measure of success. Of course we realize that these schools do not have to deal with the advanced juvenile offenders and delinquents as in the case of reform schools. But I believe that a higher degree of success would be obtained if it would be possible to grade these industrial <span class="col_6013-6014" refersTo="page_340"/>schools on a stricter basis. You find that young persons committed to various homes and institutions, when the boards of management decide that his interest could best be served by sending him to an industrial school, it has been the experience to find that a number of these youngsters on returning from the industrial schools, have learned habits, have learned a way of life which they should not have come into contact with. Because at these schools you also have those persons who have been daggasmokers and have developed behaviour problems, and indeed are maladjusted. I believe it is important to have a stricter grading at these industrial schools, so that persons committed there through no misdemeanour of their own will not have to carry a stigma in certain instances when they come to find employment. The question of the success of these industrial schools, I think, also rests a great deal on the question of having available more accommodation and also the question of smaller units. Due to the lack of accommodation at a number of these industrial schools, there is tremendous over-crowding also at places of safety and detention where these persons are waiting admission to these schools, and here too, the good and the bad are mixed, and I know that the position at the present time at the Durban place of safety and detention is that there is tremendous over-crowding and a number of these young people have to be accommodated outside the dormitories in the passage ways because such a large number of them are awaiting accommodation at the industrial schools. I put a question on the Order Paper the other day which the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts, and Science kindly replied to, and the reply shows that there are altogether some 2,353 young persons now accommodated at the industrial schools, and it is interesting to see that the figures from 1961, particularly in regard to girls, have increased by some 27 per cent, from 661 to 904. Here I believe you find one of the greatest shortages of accommodation in regard to industrial schools, namely to accommodate girls.</p>

<p>I asked also what provision was being made to extend our existing industrial schools, and the hon. Minister quoted that altogether an amount of R2,263,000 had been approved for extension at the industrial schools. But when looking at the Loan Vote, one finds that a very small amount indeed is being provided for the establishment of these schools. You find that a large number of these extensions are mentioned, but only token amounts are being voted: King William&#x2019;s Town, R42,000, but only R50 being voted; Oudtshoorn Industrial School, R16,000 only R50 now being voted; Rustenburg, R310,000, only R50 is being voted; Heidelberg R38,500, again only R50 being voted. It appears that for the financial year ending 31 March 1965 in all these instances these schools are only having token amounts voted on those estimates. Therefore I do hope that the hon. Minister will use his influence and all the power at his disposal to try and expedite the provision of more accommodation at these schools of industries.</p>

<p>Another aspect is the question of the reduction that has occurred in the Estimates under this Vote in respect of staff. If you look at the Estimates, Sir, you will find that under &#x201C;Schools of Industries&#x201D;, whereas in 1963-4, there were 656 posts provided under &#x201C;Staff&#x201D; in these Estimates the number is now 629, an actual reduction of 29 in staff. Similarly there is a reduction in staff for reform schools. I do hope that this is not an indication that in any way this work is not going to be extended.</p>

<p>Another problem which I believe is a very real one is the question of absconders. If you look at the report that was submitted by the people who investigated the ex-pupils of reform schools you will find that of the absconders at the school there were 55.1 per cent and 21.3 per cent attempted or planned to abscond, that is 76.4 per cent.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The days when industrial schools were regarded as penal institutions are long past in our country. Industrial schools have for many years been regarded as places of education in this country where important rehabilitation work is done. Our industrial schools are managed and controlled in that spirit. The reference of the hon. member to the Constantia Reformatory in pursuance of the Lotter inquiry, gives me the opportunity to say that the fact that that inquiry was held testifies to the great interest that we take in this work of rehabilitation and to the serious light in which we view this matter. We feel that we have to take stock from time to time to make sure that our methods are producing the desired results. In this regard I can give the hon. member the assurance that we are fully acquainted with the latest methods adopted abroad. From time to time we send our educationists overseas to visit industrial schools and reformatories there and to report back to us. On the basis of the findings of these educational missions I can say without fear of contradiction that our industrial schools and our reformatory at Constantia and the girl&#x2019;s school at Durbanville are managed in the most scientific, educational basis that one could wish for. The work that is being done at those schools is in conformity with the knowledge that we gained overseas. Then I also want to refer to the setting up of smaller hostel units. Concern has been expressed in regard to the question of the correct psychological approach and whether in this respect we are giving effect to the pattern followed overseas. One of the ways in which we are doing this is to establish smaller hostels not only at the industrial schools but also at the reformatories. This enables the hostel father, who is usually a member of the staff, to make more personal contact with the inmates. I can therefore give hon. members the assurance that we are continuing with that work.</p>

<p><span class="col_6015-6016" refersTo="page_341"/>As far as after-care services are concerned I may say that these services are to some extent performed through the medium of our own Department. We have an employment hostel attached to the Constantia institution. Hon. members are probably aware of that fact. Once these people have been placed in employment, there is provision for proper after-care during the period in which they remain in this hotel. The provision of aftercare services is actually a function of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. In this connection I may say that there is thorough consultation between the two Departments in regard to specific cases.</p>

<p>It is obvious that industrial schools produce better results than reformatories. The child who lands in an industrial school is in most cases a first offender or, on the other hand, a person who has not yet gone too far off the rails. Where it is clear in the case of the child at the industrial school that the work of rehabilitation that is carried out there is not adequate for him he is transferred to the reformatory. In this way the reformatories receive the most difficult cases that we have to deal with and that is why one cannot compare the results of these schools with those of the industrial schools. Our industrial schools are doing excellent work. Even overseas experts are highly satisfied with the results achieved in this regard. Reference has also been made to the reduction in staff. I can only say that this is due mainly to a reduction in the number of non-White servants.</p>

<p>There is one last remark that I want to make in connection with our aim to expand these services even further. Two years ago we established the Schoemansdal industrial school for girls. The hon. the Minister himself and I visited that school recently and we were particularly impressed by the good work that is being done there. The workers there are dedicated people. We went a step further and we established a new industrial school for subnormal girls at Knysna. I say &#x201C;Sub-normal girls&#x201D;; in other words, I am classifying them because the hon. member asked us to introduce a system of classification at these schools. That is our aim. We introduce classification as and when additional accommodation becomes available. As I say, we have already applied this system at Knysna. A further expansion that is envisaged is the establishment of a school at Utrecht, also for girls. We hope to be able to make provision for this in the next year&#x2019;s Estimates. We also contemplate establishing an industrial school at Wolmaransstad. Once all these industrial schools have been established we will be able to apply the system of classification on a wider scale. We admit that this system is necessary for rehabilitation purposes.</p>

<p>On Revenue Vote No. 25&#x2014;&#x201C;Bantu Administration and Development&#x201D;, R21,620,000,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to avail myself of the privilege of the half hour.</p>

<p>Under a system of collective Cabinet responsibility, this hon. Minister must accept full blame for the ideological policies of the Government. However, often we feel that he is a misfit in this Cabinet. We know he has a high regard for, and faith in, the Bantu. One only has to read his speeches, not only those he addresses to the Bantu themselves but also those addressed to this House to realize that. As a matter of fact, he is consistent in expressing his faith in the Bantu. When one compares the Transkei Constitution Act and the speech the hon. the Minister made in this House during the passing of that Act with the Coloured Council Bill and the speech the Minister concerned therewith made in this House, then one realizes the differences in outlook between these two Ministers in the approach to the people under their charge. The Minister of Bantu Administration also manages his personal contact with the Bantu on a different basis. He is inherently courteous and he never fails to pay the Bantu the ordinary civil respects, such as shaking hands. In this respect one must compare his attitude with that of his colleagues, the Minister of Bantu Education. I say therefore that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration seems somewhat out of place in this Government with a Cabinet of ideologists and Herrenvolkers.</p>

<p>But, however kind his smile may be and however good his intentions may be, he remains the instrument chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out the policy of apartheid, or, as Chief Kaiser Matanzima prefers to call it, separate development. The Minister gives the impression of being dedicated to the cause of apartheid and that he really believes in it as well as in Bantustans. If you believe in apartheid, you must, of course, also believe in Bantustans because these are the foundation on which apartheid is built. We, on this side, of course deny that the establishment of Bantustans will solve our Native problem for the reason that we will always have Bantu in our midst and while here they have to be catered for politically. Without viable Bantustans, however, there is no hope of making a success of apartheid. The whole concept of apart-held must fail if Bantustans fail. No doubt if sufficient sacrifice is made and the country is more equitably divided between White and non-White and sufficient capital is spent, Bantustans can be made to work.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to remind the House that Mr. Oppenheimer once calculated the minimum amount of money required to put 50,000 Africans per year in non-agricultural work. He calculated that over 25 years this would cost at least R1,600,000,000. The Minister of Economic Affairs estimated that by spending &#x00A3;600,000,000 over 50 years you <span class="col_6017-6018" refersTo="page_342"/>could ensure an income of &#x00A3;6,000,000 for the Africans. He did not, however, say why he accepted the figure of &#x00A3;600,000,000 except that it was the capital amount invested in industry at that time, i.e. 1956 in White areas. He did not say how many African would be employed but he did indicate that we could afford to spend that amount.</p>

<p>Now, the present Minister of Bantu Administration was placed in a privileged position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the other members of the Nationalist Party in considering the full implications of the policy of apartheid. He was appointed a member of the Tomlinson Commission. For him there were only two courses the country should follow, i.e. either complete integration, or complete separation. There was no middle course for him such as that being advocated by the United Party. In any event, the Minister and the other members of the commission set to work most industriously fulfilling the task allotted to them. You see, Sir, it became necessary for the Prime Minister to appoint this commission because he was at that time Minister of Native Affairs and he could no longer pay only lip-service to a policy of apartheid while being pressed by this side of the House to say what was meant by apartheid and how it would be made to work. He had no answer and he could not tell us how it would be made to work. So he appointed the Tomlinson Commission. The Minister of Bantu Administration was appointed to the commission before he became Minister. The previous Minister had suggested that a commission should be appointed because it was clear that the Government did not know what the economic implications would be of carrying out the policy of apartheid. Now, this commission consulted experts, conducted research and came to definite conclusions.</p>

<p>Dr. Verwoerd is the man responsible for the policy of apartheid. It is his policy and not the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy. Dr. Jansen did not know what it really meant or how to carry it out. And when this side of the House tackled him on how he was going to implement it, he announced that he was going to appoint this commission, which came to certain specific conclusions. I would remind the Minister of what the conclusion was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission concluded that the circumstances demanded a speedy, definite and unambiguous decision. The commission is convinced that the separate development of the European and Bantu communities should be striven for and is the only direction in which racial conflict may possibly be eliminated and racial harmony possibly be maintained. The only obvious way out of the dilemma lies in the sustained development of the Bantu areas on a large scale. This is the germinal point in the process of separate development of Europeans and Bantu.&#x2026;The development programme of the Bantu areas should make provision for the collaboration and the participation of the Europeans. &#x2026; It is of the greatest importance for the eventual success of a programme of industrial development in the Bantu areas that everything should be done to assist the Bantu to undertake the establishment, management and development of industry in their own areas. This arouses, however, interest and the desire to progress. For a considerable time, however, the necessary talent for enterprise will not be found in the ranks of the Bantu, and the Europeans and Government will therefore also have to be added as entrepreneurs.</block>

<p>The whole emphasis was on development with White assistance. The commission also said that &#x201C;the initial step towards the practical realization of the separate development of Europeans and Bantu lies in full-scale development of the Bantu area, and what is of essential importance is the question whether the Bantu and European enterprise will be attracted to the Bantu areas in sufficient measure to utilize to the fullest extent the capital which will be invested in the Bantu as human beings and labourers, and in the basic facilities for productive purposes&#x201D;, and then it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The choice is clear. Either the challenge must be accepted or the inevitable consequences of integration of the Bantu and European population groups into a common society must be endured.</block>

<p>Now, the commission did not come to these conclusions lightly, that development was essential and that White initiative and capital were essential in the reserves. They considered the position very carefully before making these recommendations. Reading the report, one appreciates the great dare given to details in preparing it. After it had been prepared two of the commissioners, the two officials, asked to be allowed to put in a minority report, because they had changed their views on the question of White entrepreneurs being allowed into the reserves. The matter was again brought to the notice of the Minister, but the Minister stuck to his guns. I raise the question of the Tomlinson Commission report again, because this commission <span class="col_6019-6020" refersTo="page_343"/>reported in 1954, ten years ago, and in terms of that report there had to be &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D;, and at once. In the first ten years R208,000,000 had to be spent on the development of the reserves. The whole emphasis of the report was on speed in tackling the problem; we could not afford to waste time. Now we know that nothing like the amount suggested was spent. The Minister, I know, will get up and say that they are carrying out the terms of the White Paper. The Government did not accept the recommendations of the commission in all respects. They, e.g. declined to allow White people to take part in the development of the reserves and did not consider that all this capital expenditure was necessary. But when the Minister was questioned recently in Another Place as to what was being done, he replied in generalities. We say that if the Government&#x2019;s contention is a valid one, that the Bantustans can be made to pay, we demand that this Minister tells the country what steps the Government has taken since 1948, and we do not want generalities, but details. We know that the Prime Minister, who was then Minister of Native Affairs, accepted the policy of border industries rather than development in the reserves. I want him to tell us what has been done in that regard. We know that there have been certain developments at Pretoria and that the boundaries of the reserves were changed quite a lot from what they were originally. We know there was development in Natal, but the eyes of the whole country now are on the Transkei, not only of the White people there but of the Blacks as well.</p>

<p>Recently the Minister of Economic Affairs was asked what border development had taken place near the Transkei to furnish work for the Bantu living in the Transkei. He replied that certain industries had been established near East London, Queenstown, Kokstad, Harding and King William&#x2019;s Town. In looking through the information he gave, we find that in East London he mentioned two industries, a textile industry, a metal box industry&#x2014;the textile industry employed 1,400 Bantu. I want to point out that those factories serve the Ciskei. The nearest factory to the Transkei is 35 miles away, so it cannot be described as a border industry for the Transkei. The whole idea of border industries was that the Bantu would live in their homelands and sleep there at night and walk out to go and work in the factories, but this is 35 miles away. And the development of the border areas has been so bad that even the Prime Minister has expressed his dissatisfaction with the development in the Ciskei, and he also referred to the poverty there. He is now making another attempt to get industries to go to the border areas by making certain concessions in regard to railway rates. But the Minister of Economic Affairs said that two industries had been established in Kokstad, and one at Harding. I want the Minister to tell us where those two industries are in Kokstad. I do not want him to tell us about old-established industries, about a mineral water factory that was established many years ago, or the sawmill at Harding. We want to know what industries have been established by this Government since it accepted the policy of border industries. I do not want the Minister to tell me about the textile factory at Zwelitsha, which was established by the United Party. We want to know what this Government has done. The feeling is gaining throughout the country, as we have said all along, that this Government is merely paying lip-service to the policy of apartheid, and we want to see what the Government is doing. They cannot go on bluffing all the people all the time.</p>

<p>The Minister of Bantu Administration says you cannot encourage White capital to go into the reserves because that is the worst form of colonization and it will breed resentment and hostility. I want to ask him whether there is any hostility on the part of South Africans towards Britain and America, because their capital has developed industries in South Africa? The Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance are always very pleased when they hear about new capital coming in to start new industries. Does that breed a feeling of inferiority and hostility towards the British and the Americans because they invest capital here? And if it does not do so here, why should it do so in the reserves? What this Government does amounts to a much worse form of colonization. They have adopted the old British form of colonization of taking over a colony to rule. Well, we can understand why they did it,</p>

<p>This Government has the same troubles as the British, the Belgians and the French and all the other metropolitan powers had. They had the worry of what political rights the Africans should enjoy. This Prime Minister was very interested to see how easily Mr. Macmillan got rid of his troubles, merely by giving them independence, and so did General de Gaulle and the Belgians, but unfortunately for him he had no colonies to which to give independence, so he has now proceeded to create colonies. While the whole world is against colonies, he is creating colonies, as in the Transkei. What is more likely to breed hostility and resentment than the Parliament established in the Transkei? Just recently the budget was produced in the Transkei, and the expenditure is R16,000,000, but their income is only R3,000,000 and this Government has to give R13,000,000 to enable them to pay their way. Do you not think that will breed hostility and resentment, when they are always under an obligation to the Republican Government and have to come cap-in-hand to this Government for money, merely to carry on their administration and without any hope of establishing industries by themselves? Chief Kaiser Matanzima, who is the exponent of separate development, said in this Budget Speech, and also at other places, that he wants industries in the Transkei. How will he get them? He can only get them through White <span class="col_6021-6022" refersTo="page_344"/>initiative and White capital. Sir, the development which has taken place in the Transkei is negligible. There is a small factory in Umtata and a few other local things, but that will not employ thousands of people. The Minister has to do more, and I want him to tell the country what he is doing. Because it will not be so easy now to deal with the Transkei. They have a Government now with two political parties, and as has happened everywhere else in Africa, where you have two political parties, the one party has to become extremist if it wants to retain power; it has to become Nationalist, in the same way as this Government came into power by getting the majority of the Afrikaans people to support it. Whatever that Government does now, there is an Opposition which will ask for more, and the Opposition will ask for more industries to be established. Chief Matanzima said that he was against migratory labour. Naturally he is against it, and why? Because he will be pestered all the time by the democratic party who will ask him what he is doing to protect his subjects who are working in the Republic.</p>

<p>Are you addressing the Transkeian Parliament now, or this House?</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>It is time hon. members over there realized what is happening. More and more Transkeians leave the Transkei to work elsewhere because they cannot live there. The figures show it. The policy of the Government is to return the Bantu to the reserves. The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) wrote in the <i>Patriot</i> just the other day that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government is at present through many of its existing agencies energetically pursuing the end to reduce and remove the 200,000 Bantu from the Western Cape area, and although it would be extremely unwise to commit the party or the Government to a programme to attain this purpose within the stated number of years, it can be safely accepted that the aim of establishing a White area in the Western Cape will be attained in the near future.</block>

<p>Now, what is the &#x201C;near future&#x201D;? Last year I asked a question in this House as to how many Bantu had been sent by Government agencies from the Transkei to the Western Cape. In 1961 there were 666, in 1962 there were 892, in 1963 there were 3,864, and do you know how many have come in during the first three months of this year? It was 3,511. One of the officials in Umtata in an interview said that the figure for 1964&#x2014;this is not just for the Western Province, but for other areas as well&#x2014;as at 18 April already showed that 6,274 had left, which is only 49 short of the total for 1963.</p>

<p>Namaqualand had no Bantu until 1963, and then they got 697, and so far this year they already got 157, and they go out to work because they cannot live in the Transkei. The Minister must tell the House how he is applying apartheid. What is going to happen to all these people who are coming out? Does he not think that it will lead to trouble with the Transkeian Government? Measures like the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill cause resentment among the Bantu, and the Government in the Transkei cannot ignore the resentment and the treatment meted out to their subjects by this Government. And as far as the urban Bantu are concerned, the Government is going to have more and more trouble, as more reserves are given the right to govern themselves. Incidentally, when the Natives&#x2019; Representatives were abolished in Parliament, the impression was given that by the time they left this House there would be Territorial Authorities throughout the country. Where are all those authorities? Why is there this delay in establishing Territorial Authorities? The Transkei got a Territorial Authority and the next area is the Ciskei, and I suppose it will be the next one to get self-government. But there is no doubt that the impression created is that the Government is back-pedalling and we do not blame them for back-pedalling. The whole outlook is different now because of what happened in the Transkei. The Minister cannot pretend that Bantu who are opposed to his policy and criticize him are merely put up to do it by White people. If he hears a Bantu criticizing separate development, he blames White people for talking to them, and he always says they are friends of mine. But that is no answer to the criticism. There are Bantu who can think for themselves, as he is always telling us, and they do not need to be told by the White people what grievances they have. And because of what has happened there the position of the White man has become more difficult. Matanzima said recently at Lusikisiki that the Transkei was the home of the Xhosa and the White man must realize it and in time he would have to get out. The other day the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) is reported to have said at the Witwatersrand University that Umtata would go.</p>

<p>Sir, I can hardly believe that he did not say anything at all! [Laughter.] <span class="col_6023-6024" refersTo="page_345"/>The point is that I do not believe that Matanzima intends the White man to get out of the Transkei now, and I do not believe that the Government ever intends all the Black people to get out of the rest of the country. They are just paying lip-service to this policy, but the trouble is that every time anyone makes a statement of that nature there is more and more embarrassment for the White people living in the reserves. It is not only the White people in the Transkei who are affected, but the Whites living in all the reserves which may become independent.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask the Minister what the Government is doing for the White man? After all, this is supposed to be the White man&#x2019;s Government. Sir, they have done a Kenya on them. I am not going to address the House on what the White man has done for the Transkei, because I have done so every year for 15 years, but I say it is time the Government told us now what they are going to do. The Prime Minister has always merely said that he would look after the Whites, until at the Nationalist Party Congress at East London in 1962 when there were certain resolutions asking what would be done, he could not ignore it any longer and so he appointed the Heckroodt Commission. That commission sat in 1962. They went through the Transkei taking evidence and they gave hope to the people because they said that no Government would ever legislate against the interests of the White people and therefore they would be protected. That commission took a year to report. It seemed easy when they started off, but apparently they ran into snags. Last year the Minister told the liaison committee in Umtata that he had received the report and was discussing it with the Prime Minister. In the beginning of this Session I asked him when we would see the report, and he said it would be very soon. We have been waiting for four months now and we cannot allow the matter to drag on any longer. What is the trouble? Obviously the Prime Minister does not know what to do. Our charge against him is that he should have known what he was going to do with the White people there before he gave self-government to the Transkei. He embarked on this scheme without realizing the full consequences, and members opposite must put themselves in our position. Talk about Kenya! The British Government did lend the Kenya Government money to buy out European farms. How many trading stations have been bought for the Bantu through the agencies of the Government in the last five years? Now is the time to tell us what he is going to do for the White people. If we are expected to make a sacrifice, and if the Government tells us: For the sake of solving our Native problem you will have to be sacrificed, we will say: Very well, if that is going to solve the problem, we are prepared to be sacrificed. But we all know that this is no solution, because there are more and more Bantu going to the White areas all the time, and there is increasingly less chance of them getting back. I know the Minister will say that the Prime Minister said that by 1978 the Bantu would start going back to the Transkei, but on what basis did they work that out? As far as we can see, the position is getting worse. The figures I have given just for the Western Province show that the position is getting worse. I have not even referred to the Natives going to the mines, but only to those who are recruited through Government agencies. The position is getting worse and therefore the Minister must now tell us whether he still thinks they will go back by 1978. And what does he visualize in the meantime for all the Africans living in the White area? What political rights will they enjoy? Is he going to continue with them as they are now? Does he intend giving the other reserves self-government? [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) raised a number of matters. I only have ten minutes available to me and so I can only confine myself to a few of these points. But before I do so I want to clarify one matter and that is in connection with what I said last Friday in regard to the Witwatersrand University. I want to quote from a correction which I had published in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of the 12th because I want this fact to be recorded&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I know that the reporter denies it but what he said was an infamous lie, I would almost say, a deliberate lie. I think he wanted to report me in that way in order to sow suspicion amongst the Whites in the Transkei.</p>

<p>I want to discuss another point raised by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories. He referred to border industries. He said that development had to take place within the Bantu areas and that we had nothing to show in this regard. I want to mention a few figures in this regard but before doing so I just want to say this. We are too much inclined, in connection with border industries, to speak about the number of Bantu who are actually in service there without having regard to the other Bantu who obtain employment in their own areas as a result of those border industries; for example, a factory may be established on the border and there may be, say, <span class="col_6025-6026" refersTo="page_346"/>1,000 workers employed in that factory but homes have to be built for those workers in their own area and a large number of building workers is required for this purpose. Shops are also required to supply people in those townships with what they need. Other activities are also started in this way. I just want to mention a few figures in this regard. There are about 42,000 workers in the border industries at the moment and about 6,000 of these are in the better paid posts. But now we must remember that as the result of the border industry policy and the five-year plan of the Government for developing the Bantu areas we also have many more people working elsewhere than on the farms. Before this Government came into power the majority of the Bantu in these areas were all dependent upon the agricultural industry for a living but as a result of the policy of the Government nearly 200,000 Bantu have now become employed in the Bantu areas in spheres outside the agricultural industry. This is the position in the Bantu areas and in regard to the border industries. There are 42,000 actually working in the border industries but living in the Bantu areas. To this number I also want to add the 200,000 who are now employed there. How are they employed? The hon. member for Transkeian Territories spoke contemptuously about the sisal industry but I want to give him these statistics to consider. There are 10,184 Bantu labourers employed in the fibre-processing industry alone in the Transkei and there are 1,478 occupying the higher posts. This gives us a figure of more than 11,500 Bantu employed in the fibre industry alone in the Transkei.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<p>What did they do previously?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They probably worked in the Transkei but they have now been given other work and they are no longer dependent upon agriculture. I say that 200,000 Bantu are now employed there, excluding those employed in the agricultural industry, and the labourers alone number 140,000. There are 23,800 in the higher paid positions, masons, etc. There are 18,000 employed in education alone. We also had to provide health services as a result of our development and there are 5,000 Bantu employed in these services. When we add all these totals together we find that as a result of our policy there are now an additional 200,000 people who have been placed in employment in the Bantu areas, people who previously were dependent solely upon Bantu agriculture in those areas. There are these 200,000 workers, and taking each family as consisting of about five members, this alone gives us 1,000,000 people. These are figures which the Opposition cannot refute. The Department is making a thorough survey of these activities but the difficulty is that these hon. members do not take the trouble of going to the Bantu areas to see what is actually being done there. It will be an eye-opener to them. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories lives in Umtata but he did not even take the trouble to go and see the factory that we had erected there until two years ago when we drew his attention to the fact that there was a factory there. It was only then that he went to see the factory and he was surprised at what had been done.</p>

<p>Hon. members from Durban have not yet even visited Umlazi to see what is happening there. A large Bantu township has been established in the Bantu area; it is not a Durban location. When one discusses this township with people from Durban one finds that they think that it is another location that is being built there; they do not know that it is a huge Bantu town which is providing work for thousands of Bantu in their own area.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the Transkei. Let us take the question of the Bantu authorities. The Bantu authorities which were established by this Government to-day employ 6,000 labourers and have 1,481 Bantu in higher paid positions. Each of these Bantu authorities has its own budget. I wish hon. members would go and see how they work and what they are doing; how they build roads, how they build their schools, how they construct their clinics, the health services that they render to their own people. If hon. members will only take the trouble to visit the Bantu areas in order to see how the policy of the Government is being implemented, they will be absolutely dumbfounded and amazed.

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with the figures quoted by the hon. member for Heilbron a little later. At the moment there are two points I should like to clear up with the Minister. The first of these is that this debate now gives us the opportunity of getting quite clear the claim of his party and his speakers at public meetings that the policy of the Government which is now being followed, is the traditional policy of South Africa. I charge the hon. the Minister of following a policy akin to revolution. [Interruptions.] In support of this claim, I should like to quote from &#x2018;Bantu&#x201D;, a document issued by the Department of the hon. the Minister. In its issue of last month and in a specially splashed first page story it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;We in South Africa are busy with a reformation, with something which is akin to a revolution,&#x201D; said Dr. Verwoerd &#x2026;</block>

<p>Therefore I say that the policy of this Government is akin to revolution and for this I bring the hon. the Prime Minister as my witness. In <span class="col_6027-6028" refersTo="page_347"/>his own admission it is a revolutionary policy. [Interruptions.] Mr. Chairman, when the Prime Minister puts his own followers in the cart, then they squeal! We have heard in debate after debate that there is nothing new in this policy and that it is only a development of our traditional policy. But the Prime Minister here admitted that this policy was akin to revolution.</p>

<p>The second point I want to raise with the Minister is that we have asked him either to accept or repudiate the statement issued by the Chief Minister of the Transkei that it was the policy of his party to annex parts of Queenstown and the districts of Mount Curry, Harding, Port Shepstone and other areas. We have asked him either to repudiate that statement or to say that it is correct and to say what negotiations or discussions have taken place with individuals or organizations in respect of these areas.</p>

<p>I now want to discuss the figures given by the hon. member for Heilbron. He painted a glowing picture here of Bantu economic development and of the number of people employed in the Bantu areas. The point I want to make is that according to the latest available statistics there are 3,881,000 Bantu who are economically active. This number can be broken down into the various categories of activities, but we have a current employment throughout South Africa of a few under 4,000,000 Bantu. These are actively occupied in earning their living. The hon. member for Heilbron is now bragging that 42,000 Bantu are employed in border industries. But by saying that he is repudiating one of his own commissioners-general because in the February issue of &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; there is a report of a speech by Dr. Eiselen when he addressed the North Sotho Territorial Authority. In that speech he claimed that there were 15,000 Bantu occupied in all border industries throughout South Africa, and that it was expected that an additional 12,000 would be employed in the near future. Now, Dr. Eiselen was a former Secretary for Native Affairs. So now I should like to know whether the hon. member for Heilbron repudiates one of his own commissioners-general and claims his figures are false. Working on Dr. Eiselen&#x2019;s figures, you find that 15,000 in relation to 4,000,000 is .4 per cent; so that if you accept the figure of 42,000 to be correct, it will be a little over 1 per cent. That means that that only about 1 per cent of economically active Bantu are employed in border industries. The hon. member also talked about the tertiary activities but in terms of their own policy these tertiary activities cannot be allowed in the White areas as the towns and shops must be in the Bantu areas. But where are they? If you go to Hammersdale, you find factories but where are the shops, the butcheries, the bus services? They just are not there! There is not even a village.</p>

Umlazi is the dormitory area for the industrial area of Durban. That is why we are getting figures which differ from those of Dr. Eiselen!</p>

<p>What I am trying to show and what I intend to show, if we can get this Government to face the cold facts, is that after ten years since the Tomlinson Report, they have failed to put more than a drop in the ocean to meet the problem of employing the Bantu. I want to deal, not with vague woolly figures, such as those quoted by the hon. member for Heilbron, but with the cold hard facts. We have an estimate of what is required. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) referred to the R208,000,000 that was required of which R100,000,000 was to be utilized for industrial development in the reserves within ten years. We have a Bantu Investment Corporation whose object it is to finance industrial and economic development in the reserves. White capital is forbidden. White entrepreneurs may not enter the reserves to start industries or any commercial activities. Only the Government can do that and the Government only acts through the Bantu Development Corporation as far as initiating new industries is concerned. Here I have the report for the year <span class="col_6029-6030" refersTo="page_348"/>ending 31 March 1963. We find that after four years the Bantu Development Corporation has on loan the sum of R289,000. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal later with the hon. member who has just spoken because I want to deal first with an important matter, and that is a statement made by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) here this afternoon. He said that the Transkei Government have an Opposition which will demand more industries. You know, Mr. Chairman, that is a very important statement. It is important, firstly, because it will be a very good thing, and secondly, because that Opposition will be better than the Opposition we have had in this House for some years now. If the Opposition in the Transkei insist on more industries, they will be a better Opposition than this one because the Opposition in this House opposed tooth and nail all the key industries which have been established in South Africa, industries like Iscor and Sasol and so forth. They did not want them to be established at all. If the Opposition in the Transkei is going to be an Opposition which will act differently to the way in which the Opposition in this House has acted, then the Transkei will develop far more swiftly then we could ever have imagined would have been the case. I want to express the hope that that Opposition will act responsibly, because if they do it will prove clearly that they accept the fact that the Transkei is their homeland and that they have to find their salvation and develop their future prosperity in that homeland. What effect other than salutary one can this have upon the development of the Transkei?</p>

<p>What have we heard in this House? The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) said just now that the figures quoted by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) were &#x201C;woolly&#x201D;. What did he mean by that? The hon. member for Heilbron pointed out that as the result of those 42,000 Bantu employed there, there was a total of 200,000 Bantu employed in the Bantu areas of the Transkei, Bantu who previously were dependent exclusively upon agriculture.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member was not listening to what he was saying. He gave us these statistics but the hon. member was not listening at the time. Mr. Chairman, I say that the Transkei will develop more swiftly than we could ever have expected if they have a responsible Opposition which does not follow the pattern followed by the Opposition in this House of always hampering and opposing the development of their own country. It will be a good thing if they have an Opposition in the Transkei which works for its country&#x2019;s benefit and which does not undermine and sabotage everything done by its Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) has to-day again proved for the umpteenth time that the Opposition are no longer obsessed with the idea of revolution but that they are pregnant with it! They cannot discuss anything or consider or mention anything without talking about a revolution. Have you ever heard a greater distortion, have you ever in your life heard a greater misrepresentation of the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister than that of which the hon. member was guilty to-day? The hon. member has interpreted that speech as a sinister idea that we want to encourage revolution! Have you ever heard anything like it.</p>

<p>If that is the only way in which the hon. member can express criticism, then I feel sorry for his party. He is as conversant as I am with Afrikaans, but when despite this fact he can still distort a sentence to such an extent, then we must not blame the outside world for having the wrong idea about South Africa. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories in his turn resented the fact that the hon. the Minister has continued to provide the Bantu with work, firstly, through the medium of a five-year plan within the Bantu areas, the partial results of which we have heard about here this afternoon, and secondly, through the medium of border industries. The hon. member does not want that. What does he want then? He and his party want all the Bantu to leave their homelands.</p>

<p>Once ten of them have bought land there, what is to prevent 20 or even 100 more doing the same thing at a later stage? What Bantu will remain in the Bantu areas when he knows that he can obtain land in the White man&#x2019;s area? Instead, therefore, of allowing the Bantu to develop in their own homeland and making it their country, those hon. members now want to sever the connections of the Bantu with their homeland and encourage them to come and settle here in the White areas at the expense of the development in their own areas. If that possibility is always being held out to the Bantu, what Bantu will then devote his money and enterprise to the development of his own homeland? It simply goes to show that the <span class="col_6031-6032" refersTo="page_349"/>United Party have no aim in view but to destroy the Bantu homelands as far as they can. If we create a lack of confidence on the part of the Bantu in his own area it is obvious that he will go somewhere else, particularly if there is the attraction of his being able to settle in the White areas.</p>

<p>But what is wrong in the Bantu coming to work in our areas if we need their labour and if there is employment for them here? Where else must they go? Why does the hon. member resent the fact that the Government permits Bantu to be employed in White areas if there is work for them there? We resent the fact that that party does not make the Bantu aware of his homeland and encourage him to devote all his initiative to the development of that homeland. It is only in regard to those Bantu for whom there is not at this stage nor will there be in decades or centuries to come, any work and a niche &#x2026;</p>

<p>Of course it may take centuries. Why not? What is wrong with that? In fact, this is a pattern which is revealing itself throughout the world. What is wrong with that? Let me tell the hon. member what is right with it. It is that every race group in this country will have the opportunity of knowing where his homeland is. If the concept of a homeland is so wrong, I wonder how hon. members opposite argue because the first homeland that springs to my mind is Israel which came into being by way of the Balfour Declaration. This was supported by America, by Lloyd George, the late General Smuts and others. But that still does not detract from the fact that there are still millions of Jews in the rest of the world to-day although that is their homeland. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>While I do not want to waste my time with the hon. member, there are two points of his speech with which I should like to deal. The first of these is the question of industries in the Bantu homelands. I do not know where the hon. member has been wandering for the last umpteen years because he does not know that the United Party has consistently fought for the establishment of industries in the reserves with White capital and White skill. We as a party have always been in favour of the development of industry in the reserves. The second point of his speech which was interesting is his violent reaction to his own Prime Minister&#x2019;s description of their policy as revolutionary. It is of course revolutionary. Only they do not like to be reminded about it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But I want to come back to the argument with which I was engaged when my time expired. I pointed out that during the four years of existence of the Bantu Investment Corporation, a total of R289,000 is put out on loan. That, however, is not the most serious aspect of the matter. The more serious aspect is that during the year 1962-3 there were 530 applications compared with 718 the year before that. In other words, instead of increased investment in the Bantu areas, the applications for help have decreased. After all, this corporation is the basis for all the hopes for the development of Bantustans. Yet we find that applications for help are becoming less. Let us look at the number of applications during previous years. During 1960-1 the number of applications was 60, during 1961-2 71 and during 1962-3 76. In other words, this corporation which is to be basis for the development economically of the Bantu, is not meeting the purpose for which it was claimed to have been established, because not only are there less applications but the rate of increase in applications granted is so negligible as to be unimpressive. If you look at the money allocated to the various groups, you find that only four groups have had loans, i.e. the Northern Sotho, the Xhosa, the Zulu and the Tswana. What about the other groups? What about the other areas? They too are Bantustans! But not a single cent has been loaned to them during the four years of the existence of the corporation.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to take the House into my confidence with regard to the work for the rest of the Session and the probable date on which we can bring the Session to an end. If we were to go on with the Estimates only we would finish on 5 June. Then you have all the financial Bills and the Bills which are on the Order Paper at present plus certain financial Bills which my colleague, the Minister of Finance, has already discussed with the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and which he can introduce before the Estimates are passed. As you know, Sir, the trouble is that the Minister of Finance always has a lot of Bills which flow from the Estimates, so we have to keep other financial matters on the Order Paper back so that while he is in the Other Place, this House will have something to go on with. As a result of this there is the mistaken belief&#x2014;very often mistaken&#x2014;that Parliament rushes a lot of Bills through at the end of the Session. I am not saying that the Government rushes them through but that Parliament rushes them through. This is an old complaint, but I think it is due to a misunderstanding; we have to keep a lot of legislation back. The hon. the Minister of Finance will try to introduce as many of his financial Bills as soon as possible while the Estimates are still under discussion so that he can get those measures to the Other Place. That will shorten the Session to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Sir, we will not sit on Republic Day. Republic Day is actually 31 May, but the public holiday is on 1 June. We did not sit on Republic Day last year either.</p>

<p>We will have to start morning sittings, and after discussion with the Whips we have decided to start morning sittings on 2 June, from 10 o&#x2019;clock in the morning. If we do that, and with the help that I am getting from the hon. the Minister of Finance in getting as many as possible of his Bills through this Chamber before the Estimates are disposed of, we hope to finish the Session round about 15 June. This is not a fixed date. It might be a few days earlier or a few days later, but that is the date that we have fixed with the cooperation of the Whips. I think it is necessary that hon. members should have some indication as to when the Session will end, that also applies to the Parliamentary staff and to representatives of the Press who have to come down here specially for the Session. I cannot say that the Session will come to an end on the 15th but that is the date we have in mind; it might be a few days earlier or it might be a few days later. As I know Parliament it will probably be a few days later rather than a few days earlier.</p>

<p>With regard to the Estimates, we are now dealing with the Vote of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and as soon as we have disposed of his Vote we will go on with the Vote of the Minister of Economic Affairs. As far as I can see, this will be the only break in the order in which the Votes appear in the Estimates. As hon. members are aware, the Minister of Economic Affairs has to leave next week for a conference overseas and we want to dispose of his Vote before he leaves.</p>

<p>I do not think there will be much more legislation, apart from the legislation which already appears in the Order Paper. As far as I know nothing contentious will be introduced which is not on the Order Paper at present.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned last night I was dealing, to the obvious discomfort of hon. members on the Government benches, with the cold hard facts of life of the Bantustan revolution which the hon. the Prime Minister is conducting in South Africa. Sir, hon. members opposite resent one&#x2019;s dealing with this subject on the basis of facts because they are having to realize that Bantustans do not grow on gooseberry bushes; they have to be grafted on to the economic tree of South Africa. We have been trying to find out from the Government the extent to which it is prepared to make South Africa pay for the economic aspect of the political policy which it has forced on the country. There has only been one proper investigation into what this is going to cost. The hon. the Minister himself was convinced that a minimum of R86,000,000 would have to be spent in the first ten years purely on the economic aspects. The Minister was himself convinced of that but the Government rejected his own figure, for political reasons, because it would frighten the voters off. Therefore the Government said that a lesser amount was necessary. But now the ten years have passed, the ten years during which urgent action had to be taken. Last night I indicated that expenditure on industrial development, through the only body entitled to invest in the Bantu areas, the Bantu Investment Corporation&#x2014;no White man, no private White company can invest there&#x2014;was some R600,000 which is less than 1 per cent of the minimum of R86,000,000 which was required. In the ten years since the Tomlinson Commission reported, in the five years since Bantustans got under way and in the four years since the Bantu Investment Corporation has been operating, only 1 per cent of the minimum of R86,000,000 has been spent. The hon. the Prime Minister realized that this was not the answer to the problem and therefore he pulled a rabbit out of the hat in the form of border industries. We heard a great deal yesterday from the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) in regard to what border industries have done towards meeting the unemployment problem. He carefully avoided the fact that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own Economic Advisory Council had stated specifically that the Development was not going nearly fast enough. But the hon. member for Heilbron produced some interesting figures. He maintained that 42,000 Bantu were employed in border industries. Well, I have here the reports which are available for the last two years, that is to say, the report for the year 1961 and for the year 1962. Border industries have only been pushed by the Government in the last two or three years, and when we look at the <i>South African Digest</i> for April 1962 we find that in the year 1961, a total of 1,239 Bantu was employed in new border industries, following an expenditure of R3,000,000. When we look at the report issued by the permanent committee for the location of industry and the development of border areas we find that in 1962 with an expenditure of R5,300,000, 1,850 were employed. That means that for an investment of over R8,000,000 in border areas 3,000 Bantu workers have been given employment. If that is so&#x2014;and these are Government figures, they are the figures of the permanent committee, figures published in Government documents; they are not my figures&#x2014;if the position is that 3.000 were given employment in 1961 and 1962, where then did the other 39 000 to which the hon. member for Heilbron referred suddenly materialized from? Either he has to say that the bulk of them were employed since December 1962, which I don&#x2019;t believe, or they were already in employment in industries which have now been classified as border industries for the purposes of a political propaganda campaign. That is the real truth, Sir. Here I have the figures from the same Government document: 3,000 have been employed as a result of positive Government assistance through new industries created since 1961. The rest were there before them. But now the hon. member for Heilbron and the Government claim that that is the answer. They are pretending to have absorbed workers who were already in employment before. They have not taken them out of the White areas; they have classified industries in the White areas as border industries. They are trying to pretend that they are meeting the problem. In point of fact, all they have done, is to extend Bantustans into the White area. They <span class="col_6045-6046" refersTo="page_356"/>have stretched the borders of Bantustan down to the White area. They are beginning to realize more and more that this policy will fail unless they continue to do that. Unless they bring all the borders down to our cities they have not a hope of employing the Bantu who become available for labour every year. The answer is quite clear, Mr. Chairman. I want to refer to the views of the Chairman of the I.D.C., Dr. Van Eck who admitted in an address two years ago that he was at odds with the Prime Minister. He said the following about the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy of border areas and no White capital in the Bantu areas&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister is a purist and I take off my hat to him for his principles and consistency. Well, that may be right; I am not arguing that case&#x2026;</block>

<p>He was talking of the political case&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I am talking as an industrialist who believes that time is running out on us and we would like to see an increase in the standard of living in the reserves. We would like to see more economic attractions which would keep the Bantu population there. How is that to be done?</block>

<p>Then he goes on to deal with the essential need for White capital and skill in the reserves if the reserves are to be developed. That has been confirmed by many, many speakers. This is the warning I want to give from Dr. Naude who spoke at the same seminar at which Dr. van Eck spoke. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think that we in Africa, or should I say the Western World, have to face this fact that we have raised the aspirations of the Africans far above what they can achieve and we are risking tremendous dissatisfaction that may accelerate the slide towards Communism as a result.</block>

<p>I have innumerable quotations here from these two speakers, which prove beyond any shadow of doubt, supported by Dr. Holloway in many regards, that the concept of the Bantu building up their own economy within the reserves without White capital and skill was ridiculous. You can get a few basket-making industries, perhaps a coffin-making factory, perhaps a few industries of that nature, but, they say, when it comes to the real industrialization of the reserves you will have to have White capital and skill. Mr. Chairman, they made it equally clear that border industries were not the solution. They made it quite clear that whatever you did&#x2014;I am quoting Dr. van Eck&#x2014;&#x201C;the industrialist had to decide to go to a border area where there were no cinemas, caf&#x00E9;s, schools or other amenities for his supervisory staff; no water, no roads, no communications, etc.&#x201D;. These are not politicians talking, Sir, these are industrialists, these are economists, these are people who know what is needed. Dr. van Eck carnes to this conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<p>In reply to what Dr. van Eck and others are supposed to have said and to which the previous speaker has referred, I just want to point out that they said that two years ago. I also wish to draw the attention of the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) to the fact that when the hon. the Prime Minister came forward for the first time with the idea of border industries, the economists of South Africa were not interested in the idea at all. They did not want to have anything to do with it. Now that they see where it is leading to and what can be done most of them have changed their minds.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Those figures are two years old. Border industries have really only been boosted since 1959.</p>

<p>I wish to return to the figures I quoted yesterday. These figures are not without foundation. These figures are based on a survey made by the Department in this connection. Before I go into these figures I wish to explain once again what is meant by border industries. It is true that the Department of Commerce and Industry classifies decentralized industries as border industries for certain purposes, such as concessions to those industrialists. Certain industries at Durban, for instance, are not classified as border industries because Durban has always been a metropolitan industrial centre. The entire complex of industries at Durban is not classified as border industries so that those industrialists can enjoy those concessions. That is likewise the position in other cities. In spite of that there are still Bantu areas which are close to Durban such as the Bantu area of Umlazi. Umlazi is on Durban&#x2019;s doorstep. There are workers who live in Umlazi but who work in Durban. The industries in Durban are not classified as border industries but it does not follow that the Bantu who work there are not working in border industries. [Laughter.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There are probably three-quarter of a million Bantu working in industries in Johannesburg. There are many working in Bloemfontein and in Cape Town but that does not make those industries border <span class="col_6047-6048" refersTo="page_357"/>industries. They become border industries when the Bantu workers live in Bantu areas in spite of the fact that they are not classified by the Department of Commerce and Industry as border industries for concession purposes.</p>

<p>What Dr. Eiselen was supposed to have said was quoted to us yesterday. It is obvious that those figures of Dr. Eiselen only refer to the area of which he is Commissioner General. The hon. member laughs but the area which falls under the Department of Bantu Administration is divided into various areas each one with its own chief Bantu Commissioner. I wish to give the figures employed in border industries in the northern areas: 14,631 are employed as labourers; 1,951 are employed in higher paid posts. That gives you a total of roughly 16,000. That is in respect of the northern areas. If Dr. Eiselen gives the figures of 15,000 it is obvious that he only refers to his own area. Yesterday I mentioned the figure of 42,000 and I want to be very exact as far as that figure is concerned because I think it is essential. According to that survey 42,615 Bantu are employed in border industries. This figure includes those Bantu who work in White areas but live in a Bantu area, like Umlazi for example. [Interjections.] Yes, Umlazi too. There is nothing wrong with that. Umlazi is a Bantu area. The Bantu there live in their own area, namely, Umlazi and work in White industries. Of these 42,615 Bantu nearly 7,500 work in higher paid posts. This is where border industries are directly concerned. I now come to those who are indirectly concerned. The number of Bantu I referred to yesterday are not only dependent on border industries.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, you may not. The hon. member can make his own speech later on; I only have ten minutes. The hon. member only wants to waste my time. Yesterday I gave the figure of 200,000 as being in employment to-day and no longer dependent on agriculture. Before this Government came into power the Bantu in the Bantu areas were only active in agriculture and stock-breeding. But since this Government has been in power it has started to develop those areas and the Bantu engaged in that development together with those working in the border industries number approximately 200,000 which includes the 42,000, working in border industries in the Bantu areas. I just want to mention these figures, Mr. Chairman, so that you can realize what the position is. There are still some Bantu who work in White undertakings. In all the towns in the Transkei there are Bantu who work in White undertakings but live in Bantu areas. The Bantu Authorities as well as Bantu undertakings, of which there are no fewer than 11,000 to-day in the Bantu areas, employ Bantu. Bantu are employed in educational services, health services and in the fibre industry. If you take all those together, Sir, you arrive at approximately 200,000. That means there are 200,000 who are no longer active in agriculture. On the basis of five persons per family it means that approximately 1,000,000 no longer make their living from agriculture. That is clearly the position; we cannot get away from these figures.</p>

<p>Very, very few. I now come to the further argument advanced by the hon. member. He referred to what the Bantu Development Corporation was doing. He said R700,000 was advanced during the first year and R600,000 during the second year. He says there has been a decline. Mr. Chairman, but that is no argument. During the first year many Bantu availed themselves of those facilities because they did not exist previously. Consequently the accumulated needs were met in the first year. After the initial rush, to put it that way, there will obviously be a decline.</p>

<p>The hon. member made another misrepresentation. He referred to what the Bantu Development Corporation was doing but he forgot what was being done by the Department of Bantu Administration and by the Trust Fund. Does he not know how many millions of rand the Bantu Trust Fund is to-day pumping into the Bantu areas? Not R500,000 but over R20,000,000.</p>

<p>Not only into industries but into many other activities. A state does not only consist of industries. This hon. member must not misrepresent the position by saying only R600,000 was advanced&#x2014;only 1 per cent. I think it is a ghastly misrepresentation. I have given the figure of the number of Bantu who are employed there. That is the test. The test is not how many pounds you are spending but to how many people you are providing employment. That was why I limited myself to the number who were provided with employment under this policy. Border industry development is only in its initial stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) may be right when he says some of the figures used by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) are not valid. But I must say that that same argument applies to himself. Let us look at some of the figures he used this morning and last night. First of all he makes the extraordinary statement that because he has estimated that 42,000 people are employed in border industries as a whole and 200.000 employed in the industries, such as the production of sisal, and other industrial establishments, inside the reserves. He multiplied this <span class="col_6049-6050" refersTo="page_358"/>200,000 by five and then came to the interesting conclusion that a livelihood, outside of agriculture, has been provided for 1,000,000 people. This, of course, is not a new idea. If I remember correctly the hon. the Prime Minister came up with this bright idea last year when he worked out that over the next 50 years it would be possible for the Republic to provide 500,000 Bantu with employment in border industries and inside the reserves. He multiplied that by five and thought he had solved the whole problem of employing Bantu.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because it is nonsense and I shall tell the hon. member why it is complete nonsense. First of all, not even in the urban areas, where higher wage rates are paid, is it possible for one member of an African family to support that family, even at a subsistence level, by his own earnings. Two members of the family usually have to work. In most urban families it is not only the father who works but the mother has to work and very often some of the children as well. This is the main reason why the majority of African children in South Africa leave school in Std. II, because the family simply cannot exist on the earnings of one member of the family alone. If that is the case in the urban areas where higher wage rates apply how much more so is that the case in the rural areas where the wages are far lower.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. The main attraction which is offered as bait to industrialists to set up industries in the border areas is that the wage rates prevailing in the rest of the country will not apply. Take the statement made by the Chairman of the Board of Trade. Dr. du Toit Viljoen, when he delivered an address on border industries in November last year to the Federated Chamber of Industries convention. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government was determined not to allow the jurisdiction in the rural area (i.e. the wage jurisdiction) because lower wages were the main advantage enjoyed by border industries.</block>

<p>Of course that is the case. This is the main bait, except for tax exemption which has not worked at all, of course. I might add that the President of the Trade Union Council of South Africa pointed out at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon very recently that in some border industries non-White workers had to spend five years in training before they reached a wage rate of 10c per hour. Let us take a week of 40 hours. That will give him R4 per week. How any family of five is going to live on R4 per week I don&#x2019;t know. Perhaps the great economic genius, the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) or his colleague, the hon. member for Heilbron may be able to explain that to me. It is nonsense from beginning to end. No family of five can live on the wages paid in border industries. Those who are on a higher wage scale may be able to but not the overwhelming majority.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron used another extraordinary argument. He said he included in his figures people living in border reserves, like Umlazi. Incidentally, I presume, Rosslyn, which is a few miles outside Pretoria, is also now included in the number of areas where the people are employed in border industries. I have a very easy solution for the Government. If they really want to give overwhelming proof that their Bantustan policy has succeeded&#x2014;the second leg is the important border industry leg; the first leg is the development of the reserves themselves&#x2014;is to include Langa as a reserve and Soweto as a reserve and other Bantu townships! Then they will have solved the problem. [Interjections.] If I may say so, it is only an accident that those areas are not designated reserves. It was a purely arbitrary designation in 1913 and 1936. It so happened that Umlazi fell in one of those reserves designated in 1913 or 1936 by the Lands Act. It will be very easy to exchange an existing residential Bantu township of the enormous complex of Soweto, where over half a million people are settled, for some Black spot elsewhere in a White area and the problem will be solved. Then you will be able to say that all the people of Soweto are employed in border industries of the Witwatersrand. Because the Witwatersrand employs something like 300,000 African workers; you can multiply that by five and you won&#x2019;t have to wait 50 years any more; the problem is solved! You have catered for your whole working Bantu population.</p>

<p>From an answer given to me by the hon. the Minister in this House. The latest figure I have is 6.000 unemployed in the Transkei in December and 4,000 in the Ciskei. Then I am not even talking about the millions still engaged in uneconomic farming activities. As far as I am concerned, Sir, most <span class="col_6051-6052" refersTo="page_359"/>of those people if not unemployed, are underemployed certainly. Because they do not earn any sort of living at all. But officially 10,000 are unemployed, people who have gone back from the areas from which they have been endorsed out&#x2014;from the Cape Western Area. When they get there there is nothing for them to do. This is an overwhelming problem in the reserves. People are simply endorsed out because they don&#x2019;t happen to have employment in the urban areas at the moment, even if they in fact later found jobs to go to. They get sent back. Then they have to re-apply and if they are lucky to get a sympathetic commissioner in Langa or elsewhere they may then come back and take up employment. It is the most lob-sided, completely irrational way of handling the labour problem of South Africa that I have ever discovered.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says the Minister&#x2019;s policy is not succeeding in reducing the number of Bantu employed in the cities. I consequently wish to avail myself of this opportunity to reply to the attack the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) made on me on 25 March when he doubted figures I had produced during the Budget debate. The hon. member feigned to be very friendly when he made that speech and I am going to be just as friendly towards him as he was towards me. I still regard him as the best actor and consequently the best speaker of the United Party. The only difficulty is that the verse he recites is usually not so good. The hon. member does much better when he recites his own verse than when he lends himself to being an instrument of the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) whom I hold responsible for the wrong information given by the hon. member for Yeoville in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s first attack on me was on the following allegation of mine&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The number of Bantu employed in industries rose to 375,000 in 1951 but the figure dropped to 357,000 in 1960, a decline of 4.4 per cent in nine years. Our industrial production was R558,000,000 in 1951 and it increased to R1,125,000 in 1960, practically a 100 per cent increase in production with a 4.4 per cent decline in the number of Bantu workers.</block>

<p>He made three attacks on this allegation of mine. Those attacks were made with a view to trying to keep alive the United Party lie that increasing prosperity leads to the integration of more Bantu workers&#x2026;His first attack was that I had wrongly omitted, in determining the industrial production for 1960, to make allowance for the declining purchasing power of our country&#x2019;s money and that the 1960 production, in terms of the value of money in 1950, which he took instead of 1951 because the former was more favourable to him, only amounted to R800,000,000 and not R1,125,000,000 and that consequently there was not a 100 per cent increase in the growth of production but only a 55 per cent increase. In so far as that is a correct calculation on the basis of the value of money it is true that our real production was not as big as statistics indicate. But I deny that it is either necessary or customary, when it comes to simple statistical comparisons, to make allowance for the fluctuations in the value of money. Even more so in view of the fact that I linked my argument with the White Paper on this year&#x2019;s Budget speech in which internal production and the contributions by private factories and other economic sectors were reflected in the normal way without any allowance having been made for varying monetary values. This White Paper of the hon. the Minister who made no monetary value adjustment when he gave the national production and the contribution by industries etc. was repeatedly welcomed, praised and accepted by various United Party speakers. My figures are based on precisely the same basis as those in the White Paper which was accepted by the United Party without further ado. That is consequently not a valid point of criticism. Even if we were to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s argument that we should convert the production figures into what they would have been in terms of the value of money in the earlier year, 1951, being the year you are making the comparison with, the principle I stated remains unaltered. In that case my statement would simply be that the industrial production of the Republic, in terms of the United Party&#x2019;s own adjusted value of money for the period 1951 to 1960, increased by 55 per cent while the number of Bantu workers employed in industry decreased by 4.4 per cent.</p>

<p>The member&#x2019;s second point of criticism was much more serious. He practically accused me of having carelessly falsified figures because I gave the number of Bantu workers in 1951 as 375,000 whereas there were in fact not 375,000 Bantu workers in 1951 but that the figure of 375,000 which I gave for 1951 related to all non-White workers, i.e. Coloured and Indians included. To support this attack the hon. member referred to Table L 3 of &#x201C;Union Statistics over 50 years&#x201D; as the source of his allegation. Table L 3 was not my source of information at all. Table L 3 gives details concerning the main groups of industries listed in Table L 1, which the hon. member did not read, and it therefore does not include all industries; it only deals with certain 21 main groups of industries. The source of my information in regard to the number of Bantu workers in 1951 <span class="col_6053-6054" refersTo="page_360"/>was the correct Table G 7, also taken from the statistics covering the 50 years, and it deals with the opportunities of work in private industries. In 1951-2 375,462 Bantu were employed in private industries. Table L 3 which the hon. member was so anxious to use in his attack on my figures, only has one column dealing with the opportunities of employment in the 21 industries concerned. It gives the total number of workers and the White workers, and in his anxiety to find an argument the hon. member (I should have said the hon. member for Jeppes, because the hon. member for Yeoville has enough common sense not to do so) deducted the number of 168,245 Whites given for the year 1950-1 from the total figure of 543,252 workers and arrived at 375,007. Then he immediately said: &#x201C;Sela, I have found an argument&#x201D; without testing the validity of his argument. He then made the reckless statement across the floor of this House that private industries did not employ 375,000 Bantu in 1951. These are the statistical figures. In concluding on this point I also wish to confirm that the figure I used for 1960, namely 357,000 was, of course, also not taken from the incorrect L Table of our statistics, but from Table B 5 of the monthly bulletin of Census and Statistics which also deals with the opportunities of employment in private factories and which deals with Bantu workers as a specific category.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s third point of criticism which he tried hard to thrust home and about which hon. members opposite tried to laugh heartily with him, was that after 1954-5 the statistics no longer included workers employed in the workshops of garages, motor assembly plants and by traders in motor spares, because since 1954-5 those categories were given an independent head in our statistics and according to him they should therefore be added to the total number of Bantu workers for 1960. I was fully aware of this change. Statistics concerning the motor industry, trade and manufacturing, appear in the trade statistics of our census returns. Table M 21, but since Union Statistics for 1958 only showed 10,000 non-White workers of all races (Bantu and the other non-Whites) and since it also included certain trade activities which were not included previously in the industrial census, I did not use that figure because it was not of any significance.

<p>I am unimpressed by the case which has been presented to us by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). We all know, Sir, that if you work in percentages and figures and you mix them up sufficiently, it is enough to confuse almost anybody, and I must say that I do not believe anybody in this House could possibly have followed the case the hon. member was seeking to put up. But I think what is clear is that the hon. member is seeking to excuse the utter failure of the Nationalist policy to carry out the promises that they have been making for all these years in relation to the growth of the number of Africans taking part in our industries in the European areas. Quite clearly they cannot succeed in that. And people are not interested in figures, they are interested in what they see for themselves, and we can see exactly what is happening, and hon. members opposite know that our present industrial development is in a larger measure due to the increasing use of Native labour in the industries in this country, whether it be in areas which are on the borders of the reserves, or like Umlazi, areas which are now being brought onto the borders of the reserves or in any other of our industrial areas in this country. We cannot get away from the fact that the great development of this country is in a large measure dependent on the use of our Native labour, it is quite obvious that that use is going to grow with the years, it is quite obvious that in spite of making use of towns on the borders of the reserves and building industries there, unquestionably if we are going to maintain the prosperity of the great urban centres of this country, as they grow it will be essential to make use of the Native labour to an even greater extent than at the present time. And figures cannot disprove that case. The case is there for anyone to see, and I am sure that other hon. members far better qualified to deal with the figures of the hon. member, will prove him to be completely wrong. I prefer to stick to the simple facts as we all know them and see them.</p>

<p>It may be generalities, but they are actual generalities, and I prefer generalities which are true to figures which mean nothing.</p>

<p>I wish to come back to the point which was raised by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) who unfortunately is not here at the moment, Sir, he made it perfectly clear to this House that Durban is now an area on the borders of the reserves, and obviously it will be quite easy to produce beautiful figures if all our main urban centres are turned into areas on the borders of the reserves and the Natives who are already working in the industries there are treated as Natives who are working on the borders of the reserves. It does not prove anything. One can do that for statistical purposes, but the fact of the matter is that the hon. member, while he quoted a lot of figures proved nothing, except to establish that Umlazi is now regarded as a border area. There is a difference apparently, and the hon. Minister should clear it up, because there seems to be doubt as to whether it is Umlazi which is on the borders of the reserves, or, as the hon. member put it, the Natives in Umlazi are being treated as being on that basis.</p>

<p>But I wish to come back to the hon. the Minister, and I am going to make an appeal to the hon. Minister here to-day that after a period of 16 years he should accept that the time has now come that this Government <span class="col_6055-6056" refersTo="page_361"/>must be prepared to take the people of this country into its confidence and to be quite open with them as to what the plans of the Government are in respect of what areas are to be Bantustans, what Bantustans are to be created, exactly where they will be, and which areas, if there are any, which are at present Native reserves, it is intended will eventually be European areas. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that there is the utmost uncertainty throughout large areas of the Transvaal as to what the plans of the Government are. [Interjections.] Hon. members object to that, but I want to refer to a decision taken by the Transvaal Agricultural Union as recently as 30 October 1963, which shows how deeply concerned our farming population is in respect of this matter. I have the resolutions here in Afrikaans and they were as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dat &#x2019;n bevoegde liggaam beklee met die nodige statut&#x00EA;re magte ondersoek sal instel na die gebiedsbehoeftes vir die daarstelling van veral staatkundig selfversorgende Bantoetuistes.

Daarna moet &#x2019;n bre&#x00EB;re plan vir goedkeuring aan o.m. die organiserende landbou voorgel&#x00EA; word. Na goedkeuring moet die Staat &#x2019;n liggaam daar stel waarop verteenwoordigers van die georganiseerde landbou sal dien en wat bedeel sal wees met magte om sonder ernstige afwyking van die beplanning oor te gaan tot die aanknoop van die benodigde gronde.</block>

<block name="quote">Dat die betrokke wet gewysig moet word om uitvoering van bogemelde voorstel moontlik te maak.</block>

<p>This is an important body, but I want to say that the doubts which gave rise to that resolution are shared by all the people of the Transvaal. Over this period of 16 years, the people have been kept largely in the dark as to what are the details of the Government&#x2019;s plans. The time has now come to demand that at the very least a tentative plan with details will be made known. At the present there is a system of creeping paralysis which is changing the borders of the reserves, and only as it creeps forward do people realize that they are in danger. It is not fair to our population, and the Government should take immediate steps. I assure the hon. Minister that the gravest uncertainty exists and the Government ought to be prepared to do something about it.</p>

<p>The reason is that there will obviously be a number of large Bantustans. We know the main areas in the Northern Transvaal: Vendaland, Tsongaland and the area adjoining Pietersburg; we know that there is Sekukuniland, we know the area in the neighbourhood of Rustenburg, we know the area north of Pretoria, the Hammanskraal area and the area which lies between that and Sekukuniland. These are jagged pieces of land reaching out in every direction, as the hon. Minister knows. Altogether the boundaries must run into thousands of miles and along all those boundaries there are farmers who are in doubt as to what their future is. What is required is a clear statement from the Government, indicating which of the areas are to be expanded, the direction and the extent to which they are to be expanded. And then there is the further question of the large number of smaller reserves. Is the plan that these are to remain, to what extent is that to be the case, are some of them to be extended, are some of them to be consolidated or not? Sir, if this is done and we know where we stand, then people can get on with their development. The hon. Minister knows of the uncertainty which exists in the areas of the Eastern Transvaal and in the Rustenburg-Marico areas as the result of the legislation which has been passed allowing a further extension. There is a state of complete uncertainty. There is uncertainty in regard to the areas which adjoin Bechuanaland. What are the present proposals of the Government in regard to those areas? We are entitled to know these things.</p>

<p>I pointed out that the hon. member for Yeoville had said that 50,000 non-Whites were employed in the motor industry in 1960. That figure is completely wrong. I have the correct figure here. Only 12,554 Bantu were employed in the motor industry in 1960-1 and 5,000 non-Whites. That is the omission from the later census. Therefore, if we add the number of Bantu employed in the motor industry to the 1960 census figure we find that my submission remains unaltered, namely, that from 1951 to 1960 South Africa&#x2019;s industrial production increased by 100 per cent but by 55 per cent if you adapt it to the value of money, while the number of Bantu employed declined by 5,000. This figure is<span class="col_6057-6058" refersTo="page_362"/>unfavourable to me because this number of Bantu workers includes those employed in border industries which are labour intensive. If you want a true picture of the position, in order to test this United Party lie, you should be able to separate the growth of production of the urban industries which are capital intensive from the border industries, in which case the figures will be much more in favour of the National Party.</p>

<p>The second attack of the hon. member was completely contrary to the facts. In his second attack he alleged that the figures I had given as being the total amount of capital invested in South African industries in 1948, 1960 and 1962, were really the figures in respect of the annual growth in investment in our industries for the years concerned, and that I had consequently made ridiculously wrong statements. The entire party opposite heartily laughed with him as they have been very inclined to do lately. Had I said anything like that it would have been ridiculous but I did not make that mistake. I am not the one who has made a fool of himself. It is the hon. member and his party who have made fools of themselves in this case. I clearly spoke about the total capital investments. I said I could unfortunately not get the capital investment figures for 1951. The closest figure was for 1948. The hon. member ought to know that it is a census figure. At that time the amount of capital invested in industries was R296,000,000 and the annual production was R364,000,000 or 123 per cent on the investment. Obviously when you take the production as a percentage of the investment you must only take the total investment, and not any increased investment. I then continued and said the capital invested had increased to R913,000,000 in 1960 (again a census figure) and I went further and ultimately arrived at an estimated figure of R1,083,000,000 for 1962. That is the only &#x201C;estimated&#x201D; figure and it is a carefully estimated figure. That is also the only figure in connection with which I had outside assistance, namely, from the Department of Economic Affairs. I then went on to say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is significant is that as our capital investment increased the value of our production, relative to the capital investment, declined slightly. In 1948 our production was 123 per cent of our capital investment because we did not have a great deal of machinery but many hands, but that in 1962 our production was 113 per cent of our capital investment because we had more machinery and fewer hands.</block>

<p>So quite obviously I was talking about the total amount of capital invested in our industries in the various years and anybody with the slightest knowledge of the matter should have known, after a rough calculation, that that was what it was all about. But the hon. member makes the ridiculous statement which he did make, in an attempt to belittle me, that the figures I gave were in respect of the annual growth in the capital invested and then he very learnedly referred to our national income and savings figures to prove that that was impossible. It is really not necessary to say that that is impossible. You ought to know that yourself. That is why my submission remains unaltered. I just want to emphasize this final submission because this is not a matter of scoring a political point over the United Party&#x2014;we already have that point. Capital intensive industrial expansion offers no solution to the problem of providing the increasing Bantu population of our metropolitan areas with employment. Our metropolitan industries are expanding as a result of an intensification of capital and constitute a relative source of employment for the Bantu. If we wish to serve this country and the interests of the Bantu people we must see to it that labour intensive industries and other fields of activities are created outside our metropolitan industrial areas. That is an economic fact and a social responsibility which rests on this country. That fact and that responsibility are acknowledged within the framework of the National Party&#x2019;s policy and it is one thing to accuse us of not meeting that need sufficiently but we accuse the United Party of completely closing their eyes to that need. They say we are totally wrong in trying to find a solution in this connection.</p>

<p>In a few minutes left to me I just want to follow on what the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) and the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) said. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories made a very important remark in a speech in which he offered constructive criticism. He said he believed this side of the House could make a success of our Bantu homelands policy provided there was a more &#x201C;equitable distribution&#x201D; of land in South Africa between ourselves and the Bantu.</p>

<p>The United Party say they reject our Bantu homelands policy, but although they reject the principle, they criticize us and say there is too little industrial development. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories raised a second point of criticism in his speech. They reject our policy of homelands but they also criticize us because there is not an &#x201C;equitable distribution&#x201D; of land between ourselves and the Bantu. This &#x201C;equitable distribution&#x201D; of land is very important because that party is beginning to echo international criticism of South Africa. The outside world is continually saving our present Bantu policy is not based on an &#x201C;equitable distribution&#x201D; of land between ourselves and the Bantu. Well, we take a definite stand on a historical basis and the 1936 settlement. We say that all the historical Bantu areas were allocated to the Bantu of South Africa in 1936. We maintain that the area of every national group should carry its natural increase of that group and that it has no right, when it becomes thickly populated, to say to its neighbour, whose area is not as <span class="col_6059-6060" refersTo="page_363"/>thickly populated, &#x201C;you must now give me land&#x201D;. But we want to know what the United Party&#x2019;s attitude is. If we carry out our Bantu homelands policy properly is their attitude that we have divided the land unfairly in South Africa? Is their demand that we give the Bantu a greater percentage of our father-land than that given under the 1936 settlement? Or do they abide absolutely by that agreement, also in the event of our developing our homelands policy?</p>

<p>They reject the homelands policy but at the moment we are carrying that policy out and another point of criticism of that homelands policy, <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the hon. member for Transkeian Territories, who probably made the most responsible speech he has ever made in his career in this House, is that our policy is based on an &#x201C;inequitable distribution&#x201D; of land between ourselves and the Bantu. You cannot come to any other conclusion but that the United Party&#x2019;s attitude is the following: If you Nationalists continue with your Bantu homelands policy, not only do we say you must see to it that there is greater industrial development in the Bantu areas, but you must also give the Bantu more land because we say you cannot make a success of that policy unless you divide the land more equitably.</p>

Then we know where they stand. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>We have had an exhibition by two of the ablest conjurers in regard to Native Affairs on the Government side, the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) and the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). The impression which their conjuring with figures has made upon their own supporters I think could be read on their faces.</p>

<p>I think we must get back immediately to some hard facts. It is very, very pleasant to wander around in a dream world and solve problems which those two hon. members do and do very ably; but it does not solve those problems, and I think that we should get back to hard ground immediately. I want to get to the question of the one and only Bantustan-to-be that has been created, namely the Transkei, and consider exactly what the border industry policy has achieved for this one and only Bantustan-to-be, this showpiece of the Government. In answer to a question on the facts of the position the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs was good enough to give a full and fair answer. He told us that since the establishment of this policy two manufacturing undertakings have been established that he relates to the Transkei and Ciskei area. They are Cyril Lord&#x2019;s factory, and one metal container factory. These two establishments are approximately 30 miles from the Transkei border. So if anybody says that so far as the first Bantustan is concerned, you can do this business of working in the Republic and sleeping in the Transkei &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>How far are they from the Ciskei?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Not very far. I&#x2019;ll give the facts. They are not far from the Ciskei; but we are discussing the Transkei at the moment. And surely, as it is the show-piece of the Government, you would expect them to establish some industries close to the 2,000,000 and more inhabitants of the Transkei who are meant to share in this prosperity and be kept working there in happiness. Now these two establishments&#x2014;and I am speaking now of everything that has been established both for the Transkei and for the Ciskei&#x2014;are employing at a fair estimate 1,500 Natives. In addition, there have been 15 undertakings (established before the border industry policy was introduced) which have carried out certain extensions, partly with the assistance of the Government&#x2019;s special incentive measures. Those 15 existing undertakings are mostly in East London and the additional employment given by those is 1,300. So there has been a total of 2,800 new jobs on the borders of the Transkei and the Ciskei, which is the Government&#x2019;s show-piece Bantustan!</p>

<p>When one can get lyrical, as the hon. member for Heilbron can, about this policy of theirs in the light of those figures, then I say he is living in a dream world. There are 2,800 new jobs established for the Ciskei and the Transkei under this policy since it was established, a territory which is the show-piece of that policy, and has about 2,000,000 inhabitants. No wonder the hon. the Prime Minister very rightly said recently that the border industries are not growing up fast enough to help solve the two major problems confronting the Government in its efforts to implement its policy of separate development&#x2014;the expanding Black populations in the cities and mounting unemployment in the Bantu homelands. And he said among other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The social problem in the Ciskei has reached serious proportions there, while the rate of development up to the present has been low.</block>

<p>I say with great respect that these industries just have no possibility of getting off the ground. In the first place the borders themselves are most uncertain, and what manufacturer <span class="col_6061-6062" refersTo="page_364"/>is going to establish himself there? Secondly, it is highly likely that if this policy is proceeded with much further towards independence, these will become most unsettled areas, as they were in the past. Thirdly, who will establish industries on the borders in those circumstances if, when the time comes for those areas to get their independence, they will possibly be discriminated against by the new Governments of those territories? If they were in those territories, at least they might receive the protection of the tariff walls which very possibly those territories will erect. So I think it is completely true to say that this policy has failed and will continue to fail. Some of the places the hon. member for Heilbron mentioned, which are included in these figures, are places like Rosslyn, the Natives in which I think I am correct in saying the Tomlinson Commission recommended should be removed entirely, but very correctly they adapted themselves to the facts of the situation and left them there. In regard to the other areas, most of the people he mentioned were working in factories established under the old policies of this country, including the policy of decentralization. I suggest that it is most misleading for the hon. member for Heilbron to give the country the impression that these new jobs have been created as the result of the policy of border industries.</p>

<p>I said this policy has failed and would continue to fail; but I want to go further and say that even if a success could be made of it, it will not prevent our having to order our affairs on the basis that we are a country with many races, and I will give him some figures.</p>

<p>I am quite convinced that we can solve our problems in this country if we just get on to the right road. [Interjections.] I say that even if this policy had had a moderate amount of success, which certainly cannot be claimed for it, it still just scratches the surface of the problem. Let me give hon. members a perspective. The Tomlinson Commission obtained two population projections for the end of the century, one was that there would be 16,000,000 Bantu and the other 21,000,000, and the report itself says that the second projection was the more acceptable. On that point the Natural Resources Development Council in 1962 made a population projection for the end of the century and said there would be 36,000,000 people of all races here, of whom 26,000,000 would be Bantu. In other words, 5,000.000 more than the highest figure given to the commission. The commission said that a maximum objective for the Bantu areas, including 2,000,000 earning their living outside those areas, was 10,000,000 Bantu in those reserves. The balance, therefore, is 16,000.000 who will be in the &#x201C;White&#x201D; areas.</p>

<p>Yes, I would have thought so; but it is because hon. members have forgotten their school geometry that they are still drifting around in the clouds. We therefore have the position that on the most optimistic figures of the Government there will be a minimum of 16,000,000 Bantu in the so-called White areas at the end of the century, and approximately 4,000,00 to 5,000,00 Whites. What do hon. members think they will achieve? Here they are basing their whole policy on the fact that you can treat these people as if they are foreigners. I stress&#x2014;because I know this is what hon. members always throw back at us&#x2014;that we will develop those reserves far more and create far more opportunities there if we allow the development to take place inside the reserves, and therefore there will be quite as many people in the reserves under our policy as under theirs [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to give some good advice to the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson), and that is that before he talks about such a vast subject, he should go back to school again for a while. When one talks about a subject like this one must first make very sure of one&#x2019;s facts. But I would also advise him not to remain anchored in Cape Town but to travel a little more in his own country; then he will have the right to talk about this subject. I want to refer to two matters in connection with which the hon. member made completely erroneous statements here. Nowhere in its report did the Tomlinson Commission recommend that the developmental centre at Rosslyn should be removed. On the contrary, if the hon. member had read the report he would have seen that Rosslyn is one of the very places which was recommended as an important developmental centre. [Interjections.] But the hon. member was also wrong in his reference to border area development. He says that border area development is a total failure and that nobody is really interested in it. But if the hon. member had just taken the trouble to go and look at the influx of industrialists to the border areas he would not have made that statement. I admit that I should like to see much more rapid development but the fact remains that everybody is amazed at the rate at which the border areas have developed in the past few years. Hon. members must not forget that this development began only very recently. However, I shall come back to this matter. There are one or two other matters that I want to deal with before I proceed.</p>

<p>Let me deal in the first place with the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). I want to say quite frankly that the hon. member made the best speech that I have heard here from the Opposition during this Session. That will give you an idea, Sir, how bad the other speeches were! When the hon. member sat down, I could not help thinking <span class="col_6063-6064" refersTo="page_365"/>of the words of the old prophet, &#x201C;My people are perishing because of ignorance&#x201D;. The Opposition is perishing because of ignorance, and I want to mention a few examples to illustrate that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories says that I must accept the responsibility for this homelands policy. He says that our conduct in connection with this matter, generally speaking, is reasonably good, but surely the hon. member knows that that is the traditional conduct of the South African nation. Both the English-speaking and the Afrikaansspeaking sections, particularly in the Eastern Cape, have always treated the Bantu very well, and not only in the Eastern Cape but also in the rest of South Africa. There have been people occasionally who have adopted the wrong attitude, who have revealed an unSouth African spirit, but that spirit is one which is foreign to this country. I want to say here very emphatically that since the days of my youth I have had an unshakable faith in this homelands solution, and there are sufficient publications of mine dating back to 1960 to prove that. The homelands policy has been the traditional policy throughout South Africa; it has been the traditional policy of practically all Governments, except the present United Party. Everybody used to talk about the homeland areas in which the Bantu would be given the right to govern himself&#x2014;and nobody can deny that.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. [Laughter.] Sir, there are a few principles which have been observed throughout our history and which stand there as a monument to us. Our attitude as a nation is to concede to the Bantu the right to manage his own affairs in his own areas. We have never deviated from that attitude. The Bantu, like any other nation in the world, has the right to develop his own spiritual possessions in his own areas and to promote his own economic development. But the United Party now come along with a new policy which is foreign to South Africa, a policy which they describe as one of justice and fairness. The United Party have laid themselves open to the charge that they are not prepared to recognize these important principles in the case of the Bantu. Take the Bantu&#x2019;s spiritual possessions for example. Under the policy of the United Party, a policy which is very unfair to the Bantu, the Bantu has to throw overboard his own language, culture and spiritual possessions, and the same applies to his economic development. More than ever before the policy of the National Party in connection with homeland areas is vindicated in the eyes of the world. The whole development in the world points to one lesson&#x2014;and here I need only refer to Cyprus which was held out to us by the United Party as a model. Sir, unless the policy of the National Party, the policy of separation, is applied in Cyprus there will never be peace in Cyprus. That is what we predicted at the time, and we proved to be right. Let hon. members opposite stand up to-day and say that we were wrong! Look what happened in Zanzibar. An assault was made there upon the Arabs, and the matter does not end there. The Arabs not only in Zanzibar but also in Kenya and Tanganyika are going to be wiped out systematically, and the signs are perfectly clear for everybody to read. Why? It is because the integration policy in which the United Party believe simply does not work. But it goes further than that; even the Indians are fleeing to-day. The ships to India are crowded with passengers. Why? Because they are afraid that their survival in those countries is threatened. I need only refer to the relationship which exists in Natal between the Zulus and the Indians. I could go on mentioning country after country to prove to hon. members that this racial clash goes much deeper than they realize and that there is only one solution and that is the policy of the National Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories says that the National Party never really knew what its policy was and that they always had to ask us what apartheid meant. They stood up here in season and out of season and wanted to know what apartheid was. Do you know why, Sir? Because they did not know what their own policy was. As soon as one starts doubting one&#x2019;s own policy, one thinks that the other man is also in doubt&#x2014;and that is what we still find to-day. The fact of the matter is that in 1947 the National Party appointed a commission which formulated its policy; a manifesto was then drawn up, and the 1948 election was fought on that manifesto, in which our policy was stated clearly and explicitly, with the result that every Nationalist was able to announce this policy to the whole world. Our policy was stated so clearly that in 1948 the National Party was able to defeat one of the most powerful parties in the history of South Africa. That defeat of the United Party was one of the political miracles in the last few decades.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. It is stated in this policy that the National Party recognize the Bantu areas as the homelands of the Bantu in which they will be given all their political rights and in which they will develop economically. [Interjections.] Hon. members have often read it out themselves and they must not come here now and try to deny it. How can the hon. member say that the Tomlinson Commission had to draw up a policy for us? It is quite correct that the commission was appointed by Dr. Jansen and that it was launched by Dr. Verwoerd, and one of the special terms of reference of the commission was to examine in what way the Bantu areas could best be <span class="col_6065-6066" refersTo="page_366"/>developed. That was the task of the commission and the commission produced a monumental report which will go down in history. [Interjections.] The hon. member says that the commission recommended that the Bantu areas must be developed with White capital. That point has been replied to repeatedly. What the commission proposed&#x2014;and I subscribed to it&#x2014;was that White capital and White initiative could be used but on the condition that those industries must be handed over to the Bantu within a certain period, which was not to be longer than 15 years. But even at that time I told the commission&#x2014;and I subsequently repeated that&#x2014;that one would never find an industrialist who would be magnanimous enough to do that. There is not a single member on the other side who would be prepared to do so. I challenge the hon. member for Transkeian Territories to carry out the commission&#x2019;s recommendations in this regard. Let him build up an industry in the Transkei and hand it over to the Bantu within 15 years; after all, he will then be carrying out the commission&#x2019;s recommendations, about which he so frequently criticizes us. No, let us be perfectly clear on that point. The Tomlinson Commission did very great work and brought home to us the necessity of undertaking certain developmental projects, and many of those projects are being tackled today. Take township development. The hon. member says the commission recommended that R208,000,000 should be spent within ten years on the development of the Bantu areas and that we are not doing so. A White Paper was drawn up which deals with all these things, but the commission did not give its attention to the greatest problem which faced South Africa and that was the problem of the Bantu in the cities. It was not the task of the commission to go into it, but the Government had to give high priority to it. We came to the conclusion, after looking through South Africa, that one of the main priorities was to clean the stable which we had inherited from the United Party and to do away with the Sophiatowns and the Cook&#x2019;s Bushes and the Windermeres which all came into being as a result of the United Party&#x2019;s policy of integration, under which the Bantu were allowed to enter the urban areas without any restrictions. I wish the hon. member for Pinetown had the courage to visit Cook&#x2019;s Bush at that time, because then he would not have said a single word here to-day. I had to come and clear up those places, and I had to do the same thing in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth and Durban and everywhere else. [Interjection.] We realized that this would cost a great deal of money. It has cost us much more than R200,000,000, if we take into account transport facilities and everything else. Sir, this was an enormous task. Is there anybody in South Africa to-day who is not grateful to the National Government for that great work which it did for South Africa? Because that work was done not only in the interests of the Bantu but also in the interests of the Whites. But we had to take into account the economic carrying capacity of this country; we could not simply go and spend millions indiscriminately without getting any results, as the British Government did. That is why this was priority No. 1 and I think we carried it out successfully.</p>

<p>But in the meantime we have not been idle as far as the development of the Bantu areas is concerned. That development has been proceeded with. Do hon. members know that since 1957 up to the present moment we have spent more than R100,000,000 on the development of Bantu areas alone? We said at that time that the basis on which the Tomlinson Commission had worked in calculating the costs was too high and that most of those projects could be carried out at half the cost estimated by the commission, and we have proof to-day that we were right. I want to mention just a few things that we have done in recent years.</p>

<p>When we came into power in 1948 the total area under irrigation in the Bantu areas was 10,000 morgen. We are giving our attention to-day to the building of quite a few large dams which will enable us to bring a large area of land under irrigation within a year or two, but at the moment the total area under irrigation is 22,000 morgen. We have more than 14,000 settlers on that land, and they are doing very well. We are also constantly giving our attention to further development, but all this costs money; that is something which the United Party know nothing about. When we came into power there was an area of 1,350 morgen under ordinary plantations and to-day there is an area of approximately 7,000 morgen which has been placed under afforestation, and then there are also the commercial plantations which are of great value to South Africa. I wonder whether hon. members have any idea of the work that is being done in connection with afforestation in the Bantu areas? Look at the Northern Transvaal and northern Natal and the Transkei. Hon. members of the United Party have no idea how many trees we have planted there. Let me mention just one example. At the moment we are employing more than 1,000 Bantu men at just one reasonably small afforestation project in Soutpansberg. Why do hon. members opposite talk about these things in such disparaging terms?</p>

<p>But I go further. There is the question of the supply of water in the Bantu areas, particularly in the western areas where this was a very serious problem. When we took over there were only 2,000 boreholes. To-day there are more than 4,000. When we took over there were just a couple of hundred dams. We have now built more than 3,600 dams in the Bantu areas&#x2014;and they are beautiful dams. I want to invite hon. members to come and look at those dams. [Interjections.] It cost us very little to construct those dams. [Laughter.] Hon. members are laughing but that is all they can do; that is their strongest argument. After all, when one has a weak case, one tries to cover it up by laughing. <span class="col_6067-6068" refersTo="page_367"/>They are afraid of the success achieved by this Government. When we took over there was 3,352 miles of fencing and to-day there is more than 44,000 miles. Take roads. Just think what the state of the roads was in the Bantu areas, particularly in the Northern Transvaal and in northern Natal. Look how the Bantu Authorities are constructing roads to-day. When we took over there was 8,000 miles of roads; to-day there is more than 18,000 miles. This is a tremendous undertaking in which many Bantu are employed. When we took over there was not a single morgen under sisal. To-day there is more than 8,000 morgen under sisal, and do you know, Sir, what income the Bantu will derive from sisal this year? It will easily reach R200,000, and this is just the beginning. There are just a few areas in which these projects have reached the stage where the people can start harvesting. Just imagine what the position will be like within a few years. Sir, I could go on mentioning similar examples. One of the fine results that we have achieved is in connection with the development of townships. We have already planned 73 townships and we are now proceeding with their construction. It takes time to plan a township. Hon. members know themselves how long it takes to lay out a township. These townships are being laid out by experts and they are being planned to comply with all the modern requirements of town planning. I invite hon. members to go and look for themselves. I say again that this planning takes time. Is it right therefore to stand up here and to say that we have done nothing yet?</p>

<p>Then there is another aspect of this matter to which I also want to refer. One of the basic requirements of every nation in the world is the development of its human material. Look what this Government has done in this sphere for the Bantu. This Government has done more in this connection than any previous Government in South Africa. Look how many Bantu children there are at school to-day. On a percentage basis there are more Bantu children at school in South Africa than in any other part of Africa. Look at the results we are achieving. Look how many Bantu children there are in the secondary schools to-day. Look at the large number of Bantu students who are attending our Bantu universities to-day. The establishment of universities for the Bantu was a huge task, but to-day there are more than 2,000 Bantu students at university. You will remember, Sir, that when these universities were established a hullabaloo was raised here; we were told that these people should be allowed to attend the mixed universities, universities such as the Witwatersrand and Cape Town. If ever there were institutions which were a bluff as far as the Bantu were concerned it was the so-called free universities. Why? Because a bare minimum was admitted to those universities. Take the Witwatersrand, for example. I was present a few years ago when a Bantu student begged for permission to carry on with his medical studies there, but he simply could not be admitted. No, these free universities are a bluff as far as the Bantu are concerned. To-day there is an opening for Bantu students and I hope that before very long there will be sufficient facilities for the full medical training of Bantu students. We already have reasonably adequate facilities to-day for the Bantu student who wishes to receive medical training. It is no longer necessary for him to crawl on his hands and knees if he wishes to take a medical course. We hope that the position will be improved considerably in the near future. Look at the manpower that is being trained at these universities, manpower which is needed for the development of the Bantu; look at the facilities which have been created at these universities for technical training. Sir, show me any country in the world, even in the Middle East, where as much has been done for the development of its human material as the National Party has done in this country. I ask hon. members whether they think it is right to give the world this distorted picture.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories put a further question to me. He wants to know what has become of the Bantu Authorities and why we are not carrying on with the establishment of Bantu Authorities. Sir, I say again, &#x201C;My nation is perishing because of ignorance&#x201D;. We are continually creating new Bantu Authorities. I have a long list here of new Bantu Regional Authorities which I propose to establish. Hardly a week passes without some tribe, which formerly refused to co-operate, deciding to establish its own Bantu Authorities. These Bantu Authorities are necessary in the first place because it is a system which is understood by the Bantu; it is necessary because it gives them the necessary experience in connection with administration and in connection with government; it is virtually a school for the Bantu. It is a system which flows from their own system which they understand and appreciate and which they use for their own upliftment. What we have in these Bantu Authorities therefore is a system of adult education on a large scale. I say again that the Territorial Authorities are carrying on in all the various regions and that they are doing excellent work. I invite hon. members to come and see for themselves what Regional Authorities and Territorial Authorities and Tribal Authorities are doing for the development of their own areas. Look at the financial contributions which they themselves are making. Last year the financial contribution which they themselves made amounted to more than R2,000,000. Why does the hon. member put this question to me? Surely he is not going to tell me that he knows so little about South Africa that he does not know that this system is being proceeded with in the other areas. He knows that this system is the forerunner of the system that we have in the Transkei to-day. In the Transkei too this system produced results which enabled us to proceed with the next step.</p>

<p>No, what they do is to push the poor Bantu into the forefront while they sit back, perfectly safe. They sit back safely with the money of the Bantu in their pockets; they are not concerned about the safety of the lives of the Bantu. That is the unfortunate position, and the hon. member for Transkeian Territories ought to know that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Bantu Authorities are still serving a brilliant purpose to-day throughout South Africa; they represent a vast school for the development of the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories made a second statement here; he said that these Bantu homelands would never be able to become economically independent. He repeats the old accusation which the outside world makes against us. I shall come to the Transkei in a moment. The hon. member also advanced a third proposition here; he said that the Transkei would never attain any form of economic independence. The fact of the matter is that the potentialities of this Bantu homeland have not been exploited at all; bearing in mind the potentialities of these homelands, one might almost say that not a spade has been turned yet with a view to their proper development. There is a great deal of work that still has to be done, and I have no doubt that once this development has taken place, these Bantu homelands will be self-sufficient to a very large extent. One can say the same thing in respect of Basutoland, and yet the British Government believes that Basutoland can stand on its own feet. One can say the same thing about Swaziland and Bechuanaland. But I want to make this statement here: We realize that with our single economic structure the weal and woe of the Bantu areas in the economic sphere will be inseparable from that of the Republic of South Africa. I have always maintained that. It is not necessary for South Africa constantly to shower gifts upon those Bantu areas. The riches of South Africa will also enrich the Bantu areas, as they are already doing today. But the pattern of development must be right. The United Party do not realize that in this respect we are setting an example to the world to-day. The pattern of development must be the right pattern, and I want to say here at once that in the economic sphere there will not be proper development if the pattern of development is not the same as the pattern followed by the Western countries. I want to mention the Transkei here by way of example. The Transkei has an income of only R3,000,000 at the present time. But can you blame those people? If South Africa had to rely for her income entirely on farming, what would South Africa&#x2019;s income be?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Precisely the same thing applies to the Transkei. Hon. members must not overlook the fact that practically the whole of their income is derived from the pockets of the farmers only. The development of the Transkei has definitely taken place on the wrong lines. What there should have been in the Transkei to-day instead of White towns is Bantu towns. I am one of those people who have always said that the Whites in the Transkei have rendered a great service to the Transkei; they rendered a great service to the Transkei in the days when the Bantu still did not have the skill and the ability to render this service themselves. But this is where the policy of the National Party comes into it. We say that the Transkei and the other Bantu areas must develop in such a way that they have their farming communities&#x2014;and the farming community seldom represents more than about 25 or 30 per cent&#x2014;but then you must also have your secondary industries there, and the policy of this Government is to have secondary industries in the Bantu areas; I want to make that perfectly clear. But the most important thing is the development of large cities so that tertiary industries <span class="col_6071-6072" refersTo="page_369"/>will develop there, which will be in the hands of the Bantu. Look at the position throughout the world to-day; the vast majority of the people are engaged in tertiary industries. If a country has no tertiary industries it has no hope of development. That is why our policy is that the Bantu areas must have their own cities; they must have a farming community and they must have cities in which tertiary industries can develop. They must have their own Public Service; they must have their cafes, their own banks, their own post offices, staffed by their own people. They will then have a larger source of income, a source of economic stimulation. That is what is lacking in the Transkei to-day. It will not be possible for the Transkei to develop properly until such time as large Bantu towns come into being, together with tertiary industries and, where necessary, secondary industries. And it is in this respect that certain Whites of the Transkei are being unfair and unjust. Mr. Chairman, the present pattern is that these industries in the Bantu area are in the hands of the White community, but as soon as the Bantu himself acquires the skill to be able to render this service himself to his own community, then the White man will really be sponging upon the Bantu, and that would not be right. That is what this Government wants to avoid. That is why we are following this pattern of developing cities in the Bantu areas, and we have already achieved a great deal of success in this regard.</p>

<p>Where?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deal for a moment with the Transkei. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories says that it is true that the Transkei has a Budget of R16,000,000 but he points out that of that R16,000,000 only R3,000,000 is derived from the Transkei itself, and he asks how the Transkei can make headway under those circumstances. Sir, the hon. member will concede that when one compares what the Transkei looked like ten years ago with what it looks like to-day one realizes that what has taken place in the Transkei is nothing less than a revolution. Look how they have improved their lands and their cattle. That is only the beginning. I readily admit that a great deal still remains to be done. The Bantu themselves have been drawn into this whole process of development. Just take the possibilities which have been created in respect of their own Public Service. To-day there are about 2,000 posts in the Transkei which are occupied by the Bantu themselves, by sons and daughters of Transkeian Bantu, by people who in many cases did not know where they could make a living and who even went to seek employment in the Protectorates. Those people are coming back to-day to the Transkei to serve their own people. As the Transkei develops more and more such posts will be created in the Transkei, of course, and as and when White officials are withdrawn many more senior posts, which will then become vacant, will be filled by Bantu. After all, as Dr. Van Eck so aptly remarked&#x2014;a statement which was quoted here by one of my hon. friends opposite in an attempt to substantiate his own distorted point of view&#x2014;development results in further development, and if this pattern is followed that we are following in the Transkei, the Transkei is going to become one of the rich areas of South Africa. But I want to say at once that the task of seeing to it that tertiary industries are developed for the benefit of their own people is one which rests on the shoulders of the Transkeian Government. I accept that it may still take quite a few years before that stage is reached. I am one of those who said that I foresaw that Whites would still remain in the Transkei for generations to come, and I repeat that here. But once the Bantu themselves have acquired the necessary knowledge and skill, it will be the duty of the White man to ensure that the Bantu is given his birthright in his own homeland. That is the policy of the Government in respect of the Bantu homelands, and if we work along those lines then the Bantu areas will have something for which Europe is yearning to-day and which is already in operation there to a certain extent; in other words, there will be a ready-made Common Market for the Bantu areas for their own enrichment. And hon. members must not forget that prosperity in the Republic of South Africa also brings prosperity to the Bantu areas and that the troubles of the Bantu areas are also the troubles of the Republic of South Africa, because we are not going to leave those people in the lurch. That has always been the attitude of this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised a further question; he asked what the Government had done for the Whites of the Transkei. Sir, the hon. member is not a very good representative of the Whites in the Transkei. If they had listened to his scaremongering, there would not have been a single White man in the Transkei to-day, but they showed a little more courage than that; he frightened them to such an extent that some of them lost their heads and asked me whether I thought they would be safe there for another week. Surely, Mr. Chairman, one should not frighten one&#x2019;s constituents in this way. Even if one becomes scared oneself one should at least pretend not to be afraid.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<p>I am coming to that. When I said at the time that the Whites in the Transkei were now going to become rich, hon. members of the Opposition laughed at me. What is happening today? The Whites in the Transkei are becoming very wealthy. I know, Sir, that wild horses could not drag the hon. member for Transkeian <span class="col_6073-6074" refersTo="page_370"/>Territories out of the Transkei. There is prosperity in the Transkei to-day such as it has never experienced before. The Government made the promise that it was not going to leave the Whites in the Transkei in the lurch, and it proceeded to appoint the Heckroodt Commission which went into this whole matter. The Heckroodt Commission duly brought out its report, and I announced in the Transkei that in principle the Government was accepting the main principles contained in the report of the Heckroodt Commission. If any Whites in the Transkei suffer any damage as a direct result of the granting of self-government to the Transkei, the Government will not leave them in the lurch. The Government has promised to table a White Paper on this matter during the present Session. I just want to say that that White Paper is already before the Cabinet and I expect it to be tabled any day now.</p>

<p>That White Paper will be tabled, and all doubts will then be removed. This Government will not leave the Whites of the Transkei in the lurch. But I want to mention another example here. There were quite a few people in Umtata who were very anxious to sell their houses to me; they wanted to leave Umtata. I bought those houses; and what is happening to-day? I do not know whether one of those people left Umtata. I am informed that some of them are building new houses. They want to share in the prosperity there. How can the hon. member bring himself to level the reproach against the Government, which treats its people so well, that it is leaving them in the lurch? We are not doing what England did in Kenya. But even if it so happens that the Whites have to leave the Transkei in time to come, they have this assurance that the Government will help them. This Government has never left its sons and daughters in the lurch.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked what the position was in connection with the influx of Bantu to the Western Cape and other White areas. That is against Government policy, of course. This Government has always said that it will see to it that the development of this country does not come to a standstill; that it will see to it that the development in the Western Cape continues and that there is no dislocation. This promise was made by the Prime Minister; it was made by me and by every Minister who spoke on this subject. When development takes place in a White area steps are taken to ensure that that development does not come to a standstill. But there has now been a change in the attitude of the Bantu as a result of the policy of the National Party. The Bantu realizes to-day that he is here in a temporary capacity and that his home is in the Transkei or the Ciskei if he is a Xhosa, or that his home is in Zululand if he is a Zulu. This change in the attitude of the Bantu means a great deal to our people; it forms the basis of co-operation, a fact which hon. members on the other side do not always realize.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw). The hon. member referred here to the reference made by the hon. the Prime Minister in the course of his speech to a revolutionary development that was taking place here. That is not quite correct. What the hon. the Prime Minister said that what was actually taking place in South Africa today was in the nature of a revolutionary development. But when we look at what is happening in South Africa to-day, when we look at the development of the Bantu areas, when we look at the development over the whole of South Africa, is it not a fact that we are living in a revolutionary period? What is happening here to-day is much more revolutionary than the industrial revolution which took place in England. It must not be forgotten that hitherto only promises have been made to the Bantu by previous Governments; this Government now comes along and carries out those promises; it does not make promises only. This is a revolutionary step.</p>

<p>That is why we have this new attitude to-day on the part of the Bantu. This is the first Government which has carried out its promises to the Bantu. Sir, you can go throughout the length and breadth of the country and talk to the Bantu and they will all tell you the same thing. This is the first Government which has proved that it does not begrudge the Bantu a place in the sun in South Africa. I receive letters to this effect every day. I admit immediately that this is a revolutionary development. It is because we accept the full implications of apartheid that this development is taking place, and this is where I have a serious quarrel with the United Party; the United Party accepts integration but it refuses to accept the full implications of integration, and in that connection the United Party stands charged before the tribunal of its conscience and before the tribunal of world opinion. While this Government accepts the full implications of apartheid, the United Party refuses to accept the full implications of integration; in other words, we are prepared to give to the Bantu in his own areas what we demand for ourselves in our area, and we have no doubt that the Bantu will make a success of self-government. Sir, what has taken place in South Africa is indeed something revolutionary.</p>

<p>If the hon. member had known the history of this <span class="col_6075-6076" refersTo="page_371"/>policy he would not have asked that question, because the policy of apartheid is the traditional policy of South Africa; it is the policy which has been followed throughout the history of South Africa, but what is revolutionary is the fact that to-day the policy of separate development is being implemented. We are proving to the Bantu that we do not merely make promises but that we also come forward with deeds. What is happening to-day is traditional but at the same time revolutionary. Let me just remind the hon. member of the history of England. Traditionally the British nation was a nation of traders, but at a certain stage a revolutionary development took place in the economy of England. The traditional policy underwent a revolutionary development, and the same thing has happened in connection with the policy of apartheid. We are now giving effect to a policy which over the decades has taken shape in the heart and soul of the people of South Africa, not only in the heart and soul of the Afrikaans-speaking section only but in the heart and soul of the English-speaking section. Let me repeat what I have said here before: On one occasion when I walked into the library here to see who the first writers were on the subject of apartheid, I could not find a single Afrikaans name there; the first writers on this subject were all Englishmen. The policy of apartheid was really devised by them. The policy of apartheid has taken shape in the heart and soul of the entire nation.</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members opposite sneer when we talk about Umlazi as a fine example of a Bantu township which is near to a White area. But, Mr. Chairman, it has always been our policy to develop Bantu townships which are situated close to White towns, particularly White industrial towns &#x2026;</p>

<p>If the Zulus are given self-government, Umlazi will be included. I just want to say this: It was I who convened the first meeting of industrialists in South Africa to discuss border area development. They told me that there was no hope of carrying out that policy. I then said to them, &#x201C;Let us first look at the map&#x201D;. I pointed out Umlazi and other places to them. When I finished the chairman stood up and said, &#x201C;This has come as a surprise to us; we thought that all these industries would be established somewhere in Dark Africa where there are no railway facilities, no water and no electricity.&#x201D; They asked me whether I was sure that it was the Government&#x2019;s policy to establish industries in those areas. I then referred them to the report of the Tomlinson Commission and pointed out that these recommendations were contained in that report. They were surprised to hear this; they said that they knew nothing about it. Why did they know nothing about it? Because they had only read the English language Press. [Interjections.] No, I am not blaming the English language Press. The English language Press obtains its news from the United Party. It was the United Party who had told these people that these places would be established somewhere in Dark Africa. I was also the person who called the first meeting of economists to discuss this matter. When we discussed this matter one economist after <span class="col_6077-6078" refersTo="page_372"/>another stood up and said that this thing would never work. One man, whose name I could mention if it is necessary to do so, said, &#x201C;Let us first go into this matter; I think it is going to work excellently.&#x201D; Subsequently they again came together, together with Dr. Diederichs and myself, and again considered this matter. To-day most economists in South Africa are highly enthusiastic about this plan. There is no doubt that the industrialists are interested.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me to mention a few examples; he said that he wanted examples, not just generalities. The example which he asked me not to mention is the Good Hope factory near to King William&#x2019;s Town. That factory was established&#x2014;I honestly admit it&#x2014;by the United Party but it was the National Party who saved it. If the National Party Government had not come into power I doubt whether the Good Hope textile factory would still have been in existence to-day.</p>

<p>By applying this fine National Party policy. More than 3,000 Bantu are employed in that factory at the present time.

The quality of their work is such that their services could be used anywhere.</p>

He says that there is no power station. Sir, one of the biggest power stations in the southern hemisphere is situated a little distance away from Rosslyn. To my great surprise the hon. the Leader of the Opposition then stood up and said that his objection was that Rosslyn could not really be regarded as a border area because it was too close to Pretoria; that this was really development in a White area, and to that he had no objection.</p>

<p>Kokstad will also get its chance. Sir, I have now given sufficient examples of the development that is taking place at the present time. I can tell hon. members how many Bantu have already been employed at these various places. They will be astonished to see how these places have developed. We always said that in order to convert the subsistence economy of the Bantu areas into a diversified economy there was one important thing that had to be done and that was to create points of growth; that points of growth had to be created everywhere, because development promotes development. I do not regard this so much as border area development; it is really a spreading of industry over the whole country; it is a decentralization of industries.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite say that we have done nothing, but look at the points of growth which have been created everywhere; look at the rate at which development is taking place. This is a process which has been taking place over the past three years. Look how my five-year plan is making headway; look how the Bantu are being fitted in. The hon. member for Heilbron has mentioned the large number of Bantu who have already been employed. I am not talking about border industries now, but I can tell hon. members that over the past two years 120,000 have been given employment under my five-year project and other <span class="col_6079-6080" refersTo="page_373"/>projects that we have tackled.

<p>In these circumstances is it right for hon. members opposite to say that we have done nothing? I do not blame the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson). He is young; he will still learn.

<p>I think I have replied to the hon. member in that connection previously. My reply is that Matanzima has never made such a request to us. I did see a Press report along those lines, but I cannot be expected to repudiate everything that appears in the Press.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>If he made the statement that those White areas are going to be incorporated then it is incorrect. He knows what the borders of the Transkei are. He made no such representations to me. Let us be perfectly clear on that point therefore. I had this experience just the other day again at a large meeting where the Bantu said to me, &#x201C;We have learnt by this time to believe very few statements which appear in the English language Press&#x201D;. It is very unfortunate that that should be so, but that is the position.</p>

<p>I want to conclude on this note: I contend that the Bantu are very favourably disposed to-day towards the policy of the National Party. One finds evidence of that wherever one goes. I admit that there are certain people who are not in favour of it but those people are mostly the victims of propaganda made by certain Whites. They constitute a very small percentage, however. There is no doubt that we are getting a degree of co-operation to-day that we never had in the past, particularly in connection with the development of the Bantu areas, a development which is taking place at an ever-increasing tempo. Hon. members must remember that the planning which has to precede this development, takes a long time. We have now got into our stride, and the Bantu realize what is being done for them in connection with the development of their own areas, a development which is in the interests not only of the Bantu but in the interests of the whole Republic of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister started his speech by complimenting me on my criticism. I must hate deserved that compliment because the Minister certainly did not answer the criticism which I offered. As to his remarks about my being a good or bad member to represent the White people, I think he should leave that to the White people in the Transkei to decide for themselves. If he wants my advice, he and the Nationalist Party should be as wise as they were in the last election and leave me alone in the next election.</p>

<p>The Minister said he had given the assurance when he was at Umtata that the Government had accepted the recommendations of the Heckroodt Commission with regard to the White people. I take it that includes the Coloured people because the commission also dealt with the Coloured people, and that the Government has accepted those recommendations as far as the Coloured people are concerned as well. What I cannot understand is this: If the Government is accepting the recommendations of that commission why cannot the recommendations of that commission be tabled? Why cannot we see what the recommendations are? Why cannot the White Paper be tabled? Why cannot we see what the Government has decided to do? If it has made up its mind why is there this delay?</p>

<p>I asked the Minister at the beginning of the Session when we were going to get the recommendations of that commission and when he was going to lay a White Paper on the Table and he said &#x201C;shortly&#x201D;. Yet he says the same thing to-day. We are nearly at the end of the Session; it is nearly four months since it started. The Minister of Lands even gave us the closing date of the Session this morning. What I suspect is that we will get it <span class="col_6081-6082" refersTo="page_374"/>on the last day of the Session so that we cannot criticize it. Is that the Minister&#x2019;s plan? If the Minister does not want to lay a White Paper on the Table why does he not tell us in this debate what the recommendations are? The Minister said they had undertaken not to leave us in the lurch and that they would compensate those people who could prove that they had suffered directly because of the Government&#x2019;s policy. But how do you prove that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Directly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, directly. How do you prove that you have suffered directly? The Minister said he had bought houses in Umtata. He said the people offered the houses. Of course, they offered their houses. When the Minister said he wanted to buy houses in Umtata 99 were offered. I suppose more were offered in the end because the only way people could dispose of their property was to sell to the Government. For his information I can tell the hon. the Minister that the information he gets from his officials at Umtata is not always correct. A large number of those who sold their houses have left Umtata. Some of the travellers who operated from Umtata now operate from East London because their firms refuse to invest money in houses in Umtata. The Government has certainly boosted Umtata by bringing in all those Government officials but what about the villages and the trading stations? How many properties are being sold in the villages? How many trading stations have been sold? I asked the Minister yesterday how many trading stations had been bought through the Government agency over the last five years but I have not heard a word from him on that.</p>

<p>It is not true that the White people of the Transkei are closing their businesses because of Government policy. The White traders are making money as they always have. I have never disputed that fact, Sir. But my criticism is this that properties have dropped in value because they cannot sell their properties. People are not prepared to buy. It would be quite easy for this Government to say they will buy the properties of all the White people in the Transkei. If the Government does not want to do a Kenya on us they must compensate us and treat us the way they have treated the farmers and pay us on the same basis. The farmers rushed to the Government to sell when the Government wanted land for the Bantustans because of the prices the Government paid. If the Government were to treat the traders in those areas and the other White people in the villages the same way those people would probably offer their properties. And the Government can easily do that. They can use some of the R40,000,000 they found the second time by mistake and the public would not even know they had spent it; the Government could use that money to compensate us. But of course they cannot afford to do that because they cannot afford to have the White people leave the Transkei and the Minister knows it. The Minister&#x2019;s difficulty is to find out how he can keep us there and give us security at the same time. That is what we are interested in and that is why we are interested to know what the recommendations of the Heckroodt Commission are.</p>

<p>The Minister said he had not had any request from the Government of the Transkei for the inclusion of new areas in its zone. The Minister must know that a claim was made for additional areas in the manifesto of the Chief Minister. The Minister will also remember that when the constitution of the Transkei was passed we asked him where the final boundaries were going to be. We have not yet been told. The Minister then said they would negotiate with the Government of the Transkei. Have there been any further negotiations as to where the final boundaries of the Transkei are going to be? I also want to know about the zoning of the European towns and villages. A committee has now been appointed to go into the question of zoning. It is about time, Sir, because there is a great deal of confusion in the Transkei about this. The Minister will know&#x2014;he acts as the Minister applying the Group Areas Act in the Transkei&#x2014;that there was trouble about an African doctor who moved into a White area in Umtata. He is living there, contrary to the law, but nothing is done about it and an inquiry has been held by the magistrate of Umtata. What has happened about that inquiry? It is of interest to people in the Transkei, especially to those in Umtata, to know which areas are going to be zoned for Bantu occupation.</p>

<p>Officials and two White residents of the Transkei were appointed to the committee but what about the Bantu residents? I would have thought that they would have had a representative of the Government of the Transkei on that committee as well, because, after all, it is of vital interest to get the approval of the Transkeian Government as well when it came to the question of zoning. They are the people most interested.</p>

But, Sir, one man did want to start an industry in the Transkei, and I do not think he is a United Party supporter, but he is a South African with vast interests throughout the world. Anton Rupert wanted to start an industry in the Transkei and this Government refused him and did not allow him to do so. Anton Rupert&#x2019;s point was that if he could start an industry in Malaya, why could he not start an industry in the Transkei? He is quite right.

<p>As you know Sir, my time is limited and I should like to talk about the number of Bantu in the White areas. However, I just want to say something in regard to the final point raised by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) in connection with which he and I actually conducted an argument across the floor of the House, contrary to the Rules of the House. Then I also want to deal, at a later stage, with a few other points that have been raised. The hon. member asked whether the Transkeian Government was represented on the commission appointed by the hon. the Minister to go into the question of the zoning of the towns situated in the White spots in the Transkei. The hon. member asked why the Transkeian Government was not represented on that commission. I then asked the hon. member by way of interjection whether the Republican Government was represented on that commission. Then he said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. Very well. He probably said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; in view of the people serving on that commission. Officials of our Department serve on that commission. The chairman of that commission is the deputy Secretary of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, Mr. Smuts of Pretoria. I then said: If you regard those officials of this Government as representatives of the Government of the Republic, then the Government of the Transkei is also represented on that commission because the hon. member ought to know that the Secretary of the Interior of the Transkei serves on that commission. That was what the hon. member could not understand. The hon. member has just been complimented on the good speech he made earlier on but I think his last speech was an anticlimax. The hon. member said we could not afford to remove the Whites from the Transkei and he wanted to know what the delay was in deciding on the report of the Heckroodt Commission, as he put it. The Minister replied to that but I just want to tell the hon. member that we never said, as the hon. member tried to imply with that remark of his, we were immediately going to remove all the Whites from the Transkei.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>We never said that but the hon. member implies that we are immediately going to remove all the Whites from the Transkei. Surely we never said that. We said the Whites had a task to perform there; we have sent White officials there as the hon. member ought to know. But we also know of the scare stories hon. members opposite spread amongst the Whites in the Transkei a year or two ago by saying to them: &#x201C;You are really in a precarious position, you have to leave the ship like rats; you must force the Republican Government to promise to compensate you&#x201D; and that sort of thing, as the hon. member again did a moment ago when he said that the surplus was more than sufficient to buy out everybody. That sort of thing <span class="col_6085-6086" refersTo="page_376"/>makes no impression on the people in the Transkei and the Whites who are still in the Transkei and who realize that the Transkei is entering a period of prosperity, those people whom the United Party frightened at the time and who were perhaps frightened and wanted to leave, no longer want to leave the Transkei to-day. As the hon. the Minister said they want to remain there longer so as to share in the prosperity. Hon. members of this House ought to know that the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards the Whites in the Transkei has always been that they could not remain in the Transkei forever but that they will gradually have to leave. But the hon. member need not suggest that our attitude has ever been that they must hurriedly be kicked out. The Government will fulfil its obligations towards those Whites.</p>

<p>I want to point out a few aspects in connection with the number of Bantu in the White areas. The question is whether the number of Bantu in the White areas is being properly controlled, yes or no. It is not a question of a definite number, 10,000 more, 11,000 more, 30,000 more. The question is whether the position is under control, yes or no. All these years we have said that as far as the specific number was concerned it was possible that the number of the White areas might even increase and that the tide might turn some time in the future, then the numbers would be drastically reduced. We have always said that it was possible that the numbers in the White areas would increase but what hon. members opposite must realize is that the increase is not taking place in terms of their policy, not on the basis of integration. If there is an increase it takes place in terms of the steps we are taking, in terms of influx control, in terms of labour bureau regulations, in terms of service contract regulations, in terms of all the forms of control which we are applying according to our policy of separate development. Let us look at the real numbers which are of importance. The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) previously, and again to-day, dealt with the question of the natural increase amongst the Bantu in the White areas and he compared that with various important components of our national development, or shall I say, with the development of our society. He compared it with the natural increase in general; he compared it with the production of the country, he compared it with the capital invested, etc. He again proved the correctness of his figures to-day. I do not want to go into that aspect. To supplement what the hon. member for Kempton Park has said I want to point out a few other aspects, similarly to prove, but from another angle, that the presence of the number of Bantu and also the increase in the number of Bantu in the White areas are under control. I want to prove that the control we exercise has been and still is reasonably effective. I shall also deal with the position in the Western Cape Province although I shall probably not be able to do so to-day in the short time at my disposal. It is mainly a question of relativity. It is not a question of definite numbers. I want to give an example. Let us see what the growth rate of the Bantu in the White areas has been. I shall then divide the White areas into two groups, Sir. I shall give you the general growth rate in the White areas, urban and otherwise. Since 1936 to 1946 the tempo of growth was 2.3 per cent per annum. From 1946 to 1951, five years, the tempo of growth was 2.8 per cent per annum. In other words it had gone up; that pleases the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) because that means more Bantu. During the following nine years, a much longer period, from 1951 to 1960 the growth rate went down from 2.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent per annum.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>You see, Sir, the hon. member only counts heads. He only counts the number of Bantu heads. He does not consider how fast or slow that increase has been; he does not consider all the factors such as production, productivity, how the number of Whites have grown and similar factors. He only grabs at the one factor and runs away with it. But that will not bring him anywhere. Let me analyse it further. Let me deal with the position in the urban areas where the question is much more urgent. The tempo of growth in the urban areas has even been more favourable according to our yardstick. During the years from 1936 to 1946 the tempo at which the number of Bantu increased was 4.1 per cent per annum; during the following five years, from 1946 to 1951, it was 5.1 per cent. In other words it had increased. During the subsequent nine years the growth rate again went down to 4.2 per cent. In other words, it was only .1 per cent higher than the growth rate during the period 1936 to 1946. During the nine years from 1951 to 1960 there was, therefore, not only a decline in the tempo of growth in the number of Bantu in the White areas to the level of the previous five years, but it declined further to the second previous period, namely, the ten years from 1936 to 1946. If that does not prove that the number of Bantu in the White areas has been properly controlled, I do not know what it does prove. [Time limit.]</p>

If there is a decrease of 4 per cent in industry, what are the 1,000,000 Bantu doing? The hon. Minister says that because the Bantu are coming into the urban areas now under control, it is a good thing. He mentioned influx control, and the various regulations they have. I would like to point out that every Bantu who comes into the White area is taking part in integration. It is all integration! I should like to ask him why it is such a good thing now? Who introduced influx control? The United Party was responsible for influx control. The United Party controlled the influx of Bantu into these areas. It is one of the criticisms against us by the Progressives. This hon. Minister must not claim any credit for the fact that the Bantu are now coming in under control. This control was introduced before the present Government took over. I would like to refer again to the Western Province figures. The hon. Minister said that the Natives would be removed gradually. But I want to ask him this: Why is it, if the whole policy is that the Bantu must be removed from the Western Province, that the Bantu in fact are coming in in increasing numbers? Those figures given by the hon. Deputy Minister mean nothing when applied to the Western Province.</p>

<p>Let him just answer this: In 1963, through the Government Bureaux 666 Bantu came into the Western Province, in 1962, 892 and 3,864 came in in 1963 and in the first three months of this year 3,511 have come in. Now surely the percentage increase of Bantu in the Western Province is above normal! And this is an area where it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to remove them. Or is the Government not going to carry out that policy any more? Has the Government now thrown up its hands?</p>

<p>The hon. Minister said that the traditional way of governing the Bantu is through Bantu Authorities. He asked whether I did not know what was happening and he strung out a number of figures of tribal authorities that have been established. My question to him was about Territorial Authorities. How many Territorial Authorities have been established? It is all right establishing the lower authorities. If the Bantu are so keen on taking over this policy of authorities, why is there such a delay in the establishment of Territorial Authorities? Why is it that they are having trouble in Zululand? This is proof that the Bantu are not so keen on Bantu Authorities. And to get back to Pondoland, the hon. Minister said that the trouble in Pondoland was caused by Mr. Patrick Duncan and Mr. Ohrenstein. But I would like to remind the hon. Minister that he appointed a commission to go into the question of the trouble in Pondoland. And what did the Van Heerden Commission find? They found that the hostility of the Bantu to Bantu Authorities was because of corruption of the chiefs. That is what they found. It was not because of Mr. Patrick Duncan and Mr. Ohrenstein. As far as I can remember those gentlemen were not mentioned in the commission&#x2019;s report. And if the Government knew what the trouble was, why was that commission appointed? If the trouble was caused by Mr. Patrick Duncan and Mr. Ohrenstein, and if all the trouble faded away once Proclamation 400 was brought into being, why was the Van Heerden Commission appointed to go into the question of the troubles in Pondoland?</p>

<p>The hon. Minister said that the policy of separate Bantustans and independence has always been the policy of the Government, at any rate since 1947 when the Sauer Committee was appointed to go into the question. If that is so, why is it that the Tomlinson Commission had to go especially into the question as to whether the policy of the country should be one of separate development or of integration? Why did they concern themselves with that particular question if it was the decided policy of the Government to follow a policy of separate development, of complete apartheid? Surely when the Government appointed the commission, the terms of that commission were for it to consider bringing about the necessary economic structure in the reserves, in the areas which were to become separate Bantustans.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister also told us about the achievements of the Government and the progress in the development of the reserves and the border areas. He told us about the number of miles of roads that had been completed&#x2014;it works out at about 700 miles a year&#x2014;of the dams completed, and that sort of thing. I want to tell the hon. Minister this, that no Government is so bad that it cannot do something, <span class="col_6089-6090" refersTo="page_378"/>and surely in a period of 16 years something should have been done. The Minister seems to be proud of the fact that they have done something in 16 years. He compares the country now with what it was in 1948. But surely under the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission so much more should have been done. That is our complaint. I ask him again about the border areas. The hon. Minister spoke about Hammarsdale and Pretoria, but he avoided the main question we asked him. We asked him to deal particularly with the Transkei because of the development that has taken place there. What has he told us about the border areas around the Transkei? He did not mention it. When I asked him what industries he was starting at Kokstad, he said that they would get their turn. But the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs in reply to a question by the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) said that two industries had been started in Kokstad under the border industries&#x2019; scheme, and one at Harding. I want to know what those industries are? Surely the hon. Minister should know what developments are taking place. I do not know of these industries, and I am sure the hon. Minister does not know about them. That is why he did not answer the question. The point we make is that the development is not taking place that should take place to absorb the people in that area. If the Government is sincere in its policy, it has to establish industries on the borders of the Transkei. That is why the hon. Minister was so right when as a member of the Tomlinson Commission he recommended that industries should be established in Umtata. There was the obvious place to establish them&#x2014;in the White area in Umtata, where you have all the labour you need around you, close by. But the only industry is an industry 35 miles away from the borders. And we say that while the Bantu of the Transkei have to go out, as they had to go out in ever-increasing numbers, there is bound to be trouble between the Republican Government and the Government of the Transkei. Because once the subjects of that Government come into the area of the Republic, they come under the laws that apply in the urban areas of the Republic, and we know that those laws are restrictive. I do not necessarily blame the Government for all the laws. Some of the laws are necessary. Influx control for instance is necessary. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member says he hopes so. He does not hope that. I referred a moment ago to the numbers in the White areas and I have disposed of the first point, namely, the growth rate.</p>

<p>I want to refer to something else; a second approach to the number of Bantu in the White areas is this: What is the ratio between White workers and Bantu workers in the entire field of employment in the White areas in South Africa? In 1954-5 193 Bantu were employed for every 100 White workers in the entire industrial field in South Africa. In 1957 the number had dropped to 180 for every 100 White workers.</p>

<p>Sir, seeing that my time is so limited, the hon. gentleman should show me the courtesy of allowing me to make my speech. That hon. member has unlimited time, except in committee, and he ought to give me a chance now. In 1955 there were 193 Bantu for every 100 Whites; in 1957 there were 180 Bantu for every 100 Whites, in 1959 (another drop) there were 172 Bantu for every 100 Whites, it dropped further in 1961 to 169 Bantu for every 100 Whites, and the latest figure I could get was for March 1963, when it was 168 Bantu for every 100 Whites. I want to know whether that ratio does not show an improvement in the ratio between Whites and Bantu in industries in South Africa. And does that not prove that control has been exercised over the number of Bantu working in the White areas and working in industry and other employment.</p>

<p>It does not prove anything to the <span class="col_6091-6092" refersTo="page_379"/>hon. member. Only one thing proves anything to him and that is his own attitude. If anything is said in support of his own attitude then it is proof, but when it proves our attitude it is not proof. I want to tell the hon. member that we realize that many factors have contributed greatly to the position being what it is. There are the control measures to which I have already referred, there are such things as wage increases, productivity, and the general cost factor. During the past few years, in particular, it has been very noticeable that there has been more and more rationalization of work on the part of employers in order to limit the number of Bantu in the White areas by means of allocating time, organization methods and similar techniques. Those are all contributing factors and that is being done in terms of the policy of this Government. That is why greater success has been achieved in the past few years and I predict that we shall continue to be more successful as far as this ratio is concerned, even if the specific number of Bantu still has to increase. We have always said that the specific number of Bantu may increase but the fact of the matter is that since 1954 to 1964 the position has improved as far as the ratio is concerned. And I say it will continue to improve.</p>

<p>I want to mention a third aspect in connection with the control exercised over the presence of Bantu and that is the number who work in the White areas, i.e. the number of them who are here and who work in comparison with the number of Bantu who are here. In other words how many work and how many do not work. They are not unemployed, because you have the women, for instance, who stay at home; they are not necessarily people who ought to work. Let us look at those figures. The figures I am about to give you, Sir, do not include the Bantu who work in urban areas, in the mines, because the Bantu who work in the mines are there on a completely labour migratory basis. Sir, I want to give you the example of four big complexes in respect of which the statistics were available. Take the area Germiston - Alberton - Bedford View-Edenvale, the greater Germiston complex. Out of the total Bantu population ten were male Bantu workers out of every 21. In the area Brakpan-Boksburg-Benoni, the far East-Rand area (excluding Springs because I could not get those figures) the ratio was 10 to 27&#x2014;not as favourable as at Germiston. In the case of Johannesburg-Randburg it was 10 to 24, and 10 to 29 for Krugersdorp-Randfontein-Roodepoort. It is quite clear, therefore, that roughly half the number of Bantu were employed. We know in those areas a large percentage of the Bantu have their families with them; in other words, there are women and many children. The generally accepted figure is an average of five per family. I think these figures prove effectively that in those complexes a large number of Bantu in every Bantu community are in employment in comparison with the total number&#x2014;more so when you take into account the presence of the women and children. [Interjections.] These figures relate to registered service contracts in respect of males only. The working women are not included and that strengthens my argument because we know many of those women are in domestic service or work in factories, etc. It also confirms what I said a moment ago.</p>

<p>I now wish to return to the position in the Western Cape and I want to tell the hon. member that he did not prove anything in respect of the Western Cape. What is the position here? Our policy in regard to the Bantu in the Western Cape is that they should gradually be removed as the work they are doing can be taken over by Coloureds and others who can do it&#x2014;not only Coloureds. [Interjections.] Surely the hon. member knows that there are other people in the Western Cape apart from the Bantu. There are Coloureds and Bantu and Indians and Malays The hon. member boasts about the 3,500 whom we are told have entered, but what is the position? At the end of December 1962 32,153 Bantu males were in employment in the proclaimed area of Cape Town alone. In December 1963 there were 31,317, a decrease of 800. That is not important but I am coming to the point I want to prove. In April 1963 the figure was 32,792 and in April 1964 it was 33,244 which includes that 3,500. There you had an increase of 452. The point I want to prove is that the number working in Cape Town, except for a small variation, is a constant figure. The entry of Bantu is mainly attributable to seasonal demands.

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Deputy Minister has made the point that his policy has succeeded because although the over-all number of Bantu in the White areas is increasing, the proportion in the industrial areas between Black and White is decreasing. Let us accept for the purpose of the argument that that is correct. I may say that he did not deal with the rural area and I should like to hear him deal with the question of whether or not the Blacks in the rural areas are increasing. But let us apply the test of his own party to this question, merely on the acceptance that the over-all number of Blacks in the industrial areas is increasing. I want to refer to an article by the hon. member for Kempton Park in the <i>South African Patriot</i> in 1962 where he was dealing with the removal of the Bantu in the Western Cape. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By removing the Bantu from the Western areas of the Cape, nearly 37 per cent of the total White areas of the Republic will be freed from Bantu occupation, which will provide a further White bastion and which will give a geographical content to the policy of separate development demonstrating both to the internal and overseas public opinion that the policy of separate development is in fact a policy of partition.&#x2026;After years of administrative preparation the time has arrived where the policy <span class="col_6093-6094" refersTo="page_380"/>of separate development can be measured only in numbers, the numbers of Blacks living in their own areas, the relative numbers of Blacks and Whites in the White areas, and the extent and size and the economic strength of White areas where no Blacks are present.</block>

<p>There is one test which, applied to the policy of the Deputy Minister, shows a total failure of the policy of separation. But that is not the only test. Let us take the test of Dr. A. L. Geyer, the chairman of the S.A. Bureau of Racial Affairs, who said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the economy of the White man could in fact not manage without the mass of Bantu workers, if their numbers in the cities could not be drastically decreased and if the Bantu homelands could not carry even half of the population, so that more than half will have to live and work among the Whites, then there would be a question in regard to separate development to which no reply has yet been given.</block>

<p>On those two tests alone, both set by prominent supporters of this Government, and on the figures given to us by the Deputy Minister, there has so far been a total failure of the policy of separation, and it is progressing in the direction of failure, rather than in the direction of success.</p>

<p>But I would like to come now to certain remarks made by the hon. Minister in the Other Place. In regard to speeches he attributed to the United Party which were made in certain areas of the Free State in regard to the so-called conquered territory, the Minister said that if it was suggested that under the Government&#x2019;s policy that area was to become part of Basutoland or would be governed by the Black people in future, to say so would be to spread a tissue of untruths, and the Minister got very angry on that score. The same thing was said by the hon. member for Smithfield, as reported in the <i>Volksblad</i> of Saturday 19 October 1963 where the hon. member is reported as having said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is geen sprake dat &#x2019;n deel van die verowerde gebied aan die Vrystaatse oosgrens uiteindelik aan Basoetoland gevoeg sal word en dat die Naturellegebied Thaba Nchu by die Basoetogebied sal aansluit nie, het adv.

<p>In answer to the hon. member for Heilbron, who feels that that extract from the speech of the Minister does not cover the question of the conquered territory, I would like to refer to the statement made by the Prime Minister at his meeting in Durban, when he said that the policy of this Government was a policy of partition, and that the manner in which that partition would take place would be that those areas historically Bantu would go to the Bantu. The conquered territory is one of them. If he disputes my approach to the historical content, I hope he will look at the Archives Year Book for 1939, Vol. II, a publication issued on the Government&#x2019;s authority by the various archivists of the Union. This particular section which I will read was written by Dr. J. J. G. Grobbelaar, under the editorship of the Chief Archivists of the Union, Mr. Graham Botha, Dr. Coenraad Beyers, Professor Dr. J. O. M. Francken and Professor Dr. H. B. Thom and Dr. P. J. Venter. These gentlemen have no doubts about the position of the conquered territory because they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die onderwerp &#x201C;Die Vrystaatse Republiek en die Basuto-vraagstuk&#x201D; sal seker die belangstelling wek van elke Vrystater, en meer bepaald van diegene wat tans in die verowerde gebied woon.

<p>The Prime Minister says we have in this country a policy of partition along historical lines, <span class="col_6095-6096" refersTo="page_381"/>but how does he see in the light of this language the future of the conquered territory in the Free State? If, after Basutoland becomes independent, they approach the Minister and say: I ask you to implement your own policy and to hand over to the Basuto people those sections of the Free State which historically belong to the Basuto in terms of the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister, how can he refuse such a request?

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Let us once and for all clear up this question of the conquered area. The hon. the Prime Minister said very clearly that certain areas, Basutoland in particular, could be extended if they wanted to come under our complex and if there were certain areas which could be included. That is why we have an area like Witzieshoek but if anybody ever alleges that it is the policy of this Government to return to Basutoland the area that has been conquered, not only conquered in victorious battle, but which was subsequently acknowledged by an international commission, he would be very far wrong. I go further than that. People in the Free State have even said that Thaba Nchu should be linked with Basutoland by giving them the conquered area in between. How can people be so stupid? Our policy is to place the ethnic groups together and the Barolongs fall under a completely different group. Mr. Papenfus is not even the Commissioner for the Thaba Nchu area; it falls under the Tswanas, under Mr. Klopper. Nor does the Government think that Thaba Nchu is an area which can ever be joined with Basutoland, because it does not fit in there; the people are not of the same ethnic group. It is, therefore, pure malice to allege that that conquered area will ever be handed over to Basutoland and as a member of the Government I wish to state to-day that that conquered area belongs to the Free State and it will, as sure as Heaven, continue to belong to the Free State as long as we have a White civilization in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I find the reply of the Minister of Defence very interesting. It shows that there is, to an extent, dual thinking on the side of the Government. [Interjections.] I say that because the Minister made out a case that this conquered territory had become part of the White area of South Africa by right of conquest and by right of treaties as the result of that conquest. Now, what did the Prime Minister say in Natal? He said not only that his policy was one of partition, and not only did he say that the way in which that partition would be carried out was on the basis of giving to the Bantu the land that was historically theirs, but he issued a warning. He said he was very worried about the position in Natal, and he held up the picture of a hand, and said it would tax the ingenuity of a genius to keep Natal White because so many of the Whites in Natal were living in areas which were formerly Zulu territory. Every single piece of Natal and Zululand presently occupied by the Whites is as the result of conquest and treaties following those conquests, and settlement following on those treaties, precisely in the same way as the conquered territory in the Free State was settled. When it comes to the Free State the land is perfectly safe for future White occupation, but when it comes to Natal the Prime Minister has the greatest difficulty in deciding how these areas can be kept for the White man because they are historically Bantu areas. When I said there was a measure of duality in the thinking of the Government, hon. members opposite denied it, but I hope the Minister will tell us precisely what the Prime Minister meant when he said it would tax the ingenuity of a genius to keep Natal White, because the greater part of that province where the Whites at present live historically belongs to the Bantu. I am accused of raising bogies when I talk this way, and of misrepresenting the position. Here is the ideal opportunity for the Minister to tell us precisely how this policy is to be implemented, both in the conquered territory of the Free State and in the greater part of Natal. I was not the only one who was disturbed and who had thoughts about the conquered territory in the Free State, because shortly before I spoke there was published in the <i>Volksblad</i> of 10 September 1963 a map. A similar map was published in the <i>Burger</i> on 7 December 1963 and the caption underneath these maps, which incidentally shows a greater Basutoland such as the Prime Minister has spoken of, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie kaart, ontleen aan die Tomlinsonverslag, toon sekere aspekte van die Eerste Minister se aanbod i.v.m. Protektorate. Hy stel onder meer in die vooruitsig &#x2019;n groter Basoetoland, Swaziland en Betsjoeanaland deurdat daar konsolidasie kan plaasvind met die aangrensende gebiede van dieselfde etniese groepe van binne die Republiek. Op die kaart van sulke gebiede teenaan of naby al drie protektorate gesien word. Die kaart toon die Bantoegebiede van die Republiek in swart, met &#x2019;n aanduiding van moontlike konsolidasie in die vorm van &#x2019;n bree stippellyn.</block>

<p>And that &#x201C;bree stippellyn&#x201D; includes the conquered territory. It goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is vanself &#x2019;n baie ruwe idee van blote moontlikhede. Wat wel duidelik is, is die aaneengeslotenheid van vier groot Bantoegebiede, die Transkei, Basoetoland, Betsjoeanaland (vir die grootste deel buite die kaart) en Swaziland. Al vier word na politieke selfstandigheid gelei, die laaste drie deur Brittanje.</block>

<p>So it was not only I who had queries in regard to these various statements which had been made. But I am sure the Minister is in a position to elucidate both what the Prime Minister intended to convey when he spoke in Durban, and how the point of view of the Minister of Defence can be reconciled with <span class="col_6097-6098" refersTo="page_382"/>the views expressed by the Prime Minister that there was to be partition on a historical basis, and that he had the greatest anxiety and that it would tax the ingenuity of a genius as to how great parts of Natal could be kept White, because the Whites were living in areas which were historically those of the Zulus.</p>

<p>The hon. member says there is duality in our thinking. Has it ever struck the hon. member that there is duality in the two cases he has mentioned? The Prime Minister said we were giving the Bantu the historical areas in the Republic of South Africa. That was done in the 1936 Act. The hon. member talks about an historical case where, more than 100 years ago, we got that area by conquering a foreign power, incidentally under British rule, and where, under British pressure, we unlawfully had to sacrifice a large portion of that area but we retained a small remnant, however, and that is something totally different. The hon. member cannot mention one instance where the Prime Minister or anybody else said we would hand over any area to foreign powers outside the Republic because of any pressure of a historical nature by a foreign power. [Interjections.] We did not say we would hand over any land because of any historical demand on the part of any foreign power. What the Prime Minister did say in connection with the protectorates was that there were already defined Bantu areas adjacent to the protectorates, areas which were reserved in the 1936 settlement and recognized by us as Bantu areas. He said that those areas, where they fitted ethnically into the adjoining protectorates, might become the subject of negotiations with a view to extending the boundaries of those protectorates. The hon. member for Zululand, however, suggests that the National Government has said we will sacifice some of the Republic&#x2019;s territory in favour of Basutoland or any other country for historial or any other reasons. [Interjections.] Even now the hon. member is still too stupid to understand what I am saying. I say the Prime Minister did not say in his statement concerning the protectorates that we would hand over any area to foreign powers. He said if the protectorates and the Republic came to an understanding we could have discussions and negotiations in respect of the adjoining Bantu areas which were already defined and which adjoined the protectorates.</p>

<p>But I want to make two other points. I wish to address the one to the Leader of the Opposition. Because he reads his policy in the <i>Sunday Times</i> he must not think that a drawing error by or the idea of a clerk in any newspaper office has anything to do with the policy of this Government. Our policy is formulated by our leaders and is not read anywhere. The importance of the statement by the hon. member for Zululand, and its acclamation by the Leader of the Opposition, lies in this that the hon. member for Transkeian Territories was the first person who started this agitation that if the homelands policy were carried out there would have to be a more equitable redistribution of the territory of the Republic between White and Bantu. [Interjections.] We now have this agitator from Zululand &#x2026;</p>

<p>I withdraw the statement that he is an agitator, Sir. We now get this agitation from the hon. member that (a) historically and (b) according to statements by this Government Basutoland has a claim to the conquered area. He builds on the idea of the hon. member for Transkeian Territory that if this Government wishes to carry out its homelands policy new areas must be handed over to the Bantu and the Leader of the Opposition applauds that. It is very clear that they are trying to evolve a new pattern of propaganda. They are trying to manufacture a story so that they can say to the public that the National Party wants or has to make the Bantu areas larger than they will be in terms of the 1936 settlement. But in actual fact they are the party who, in co-operation with the world outside, are planting the idea in the minds of the South African Bantu and of the world outside, that we can depart from the 1936 settlement but it has been stated over and over again on behalf of the Government that there is no question of departing from the 1936 provisions. But two speakers, together with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who unfortunately did not get guidance timeously from the <i>Sunday Times,</i> have in this debate stimulated the idea of handing over a larger area of land to the Bantu, It is a sinister consequence of the United Party policy of playing into the hand of the world outside that to-day they too want to stimulate this idea that the Government is obliged to come to a new settlement with the Bantu whereby the Bantu will palm in larger White areas and the United Party stand accused of, and from the lips of their own speakers they have been found guilty, of once again seeking the favour of the outside world by echoing what the great ones outside prescribe.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the hon. member who has just spoken is not certain of his ground. It is quite clear that the Prime Minister was bidding against Great Britain; he was offering Basutoland, Swaziland and Bechuanaland better conditions if they came under South Africa and then they would get the additional territory. He knows that the Prime Minister was bidding to try to get those three protectorates to come under South Africa. That is why there is this uncertainty. That additional area included the Basuto territory. That is why the Minister of Defence entered into this debate.</p>

<p>Sir, it is time we got clarity when we raise these matters, but it is equally important that we get clarity on the Government&#x2019;s assurances, because my opinion is that the assurances of the Government are worth nothing. For inefficiency, for muddling and indecision commend thee to this Government as far as Bantu areas are concerned! Take my own constituency. In 1948 when I came to Parliament I saw the then Minister of Native Affairs and asked him what his intention was with regard to the Bantu area in Pinetown. I invited the Minister of Bantu Affairs there. He came to this area and the town council entertained him to lunch. He did not approve of one site but he approved of another site in Pinetown for a Bantu area. In due course that gentleman was made Governor-General, and the present Prime Minister was made Minister of Native Affairs. He was invited to Pinetown; he was also entertained by the town council and he approved of the new area of which his predecessor had approved. The Pinetown town council then proceeded to lay out this area for a township, but in the meantime some good friends of the Nationalist Party had built houses near that area and sent a deputation to the Prime Minister, who was then Minister of Native Affairs, and after two or three years he changed his mind and said that the Native area should be further away in Klaarwater. Klaarwater was then developed and a few hundred houses were built there with money raised from the Government, and eventually the Minister of Native Affairs decided that it was not a very important township so he sent his understudy, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to open this new township, and the Deputy Minister went there.</p>

<p>I forget whether he was entertained to lunch, but he went to that area; he met the Bantu there and congratulated them on having moved there.

He will not deny that he opened the township; he will not deny that he said that it had been established in accordance with Government policy. He will not deny that he encouraged the people to establish themselves there, to have their own schools, their own houses and their own playing fields, etc. He said that this was all in terms of Government policy.

<p>Sir, this is what is taking place; the Government does not know its own mind. Two former Ministers of Native Affairs (one of whom subsequently became Governor-General and one of whom subsequently became Prime Minister) and the present Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the Deputy Minister, all said that this was going to be a Native area, and now that it is proposed to make it an Indian area, hon. members say, &#x201C;So what!&#x201D; I hope the Deputy Minister is going to go to that area and ask the Bantu there what they think of the White man&#x2019;s word. They have no confidence in the White man&#x2019;s word; they have no confidence in this Government. The assurances of any Minister of Bantu Administration are worth nothing to them. If they try to move the Bantu from that township and trouble breaks out, the responsibility for that trouble will lie at the door of this Government. They have encouraged families to move there; they have encouraged them to establish their schools and home there; the burial grounds of the Bantu have been established there. All this has been done during the period of office of this Government. They have changed their minds three times, and on 28 February of this year this area was advertised as a proposed Indian area. Here I have a map from the Government Department concerned, and right in the middle of this map it says, &#x201C;Pinetown Bantoe-woongebied&#x201D;. And yet the hon. the Deputy Minister says &#x201C;So What!&#x201D; when I tell him that it is now proposed to make this an Indian area. Is this same Deputy Minister going to go to those Bantu and tell them to move peacably, or is he going to change his mind again? Sir, for sheer muddled inefficiency you can hand it to this Government! No wonder people are uncertain. No wonder they are uncertain about the boundaries outside Basutoland; no wonder they are uncertain about these various areas; no wonder the people of Natal are uncertain when there is one rule for the Free State, because the Minister of Defence puts up a case for the Free State, and another rule for Natal. No assurance of any kind by this Government, whether it has to do with large areas or even Native townships, is worth the paper it is written on.</p>

<p>I can understand why the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) will not give me an opportunity, but it is strange to me why he will not respect you. I should like to explain the position as regards Klaarwater. Klaarwater was established as an urban Bantu residential area, not as a homeland town where the Bantu will have property rights. It was established as a Bantu residential area. It was established there at the time because it was imperative to give those Bantu a residential area near the urban area of Pinetown. I have not yet even seen that map the hon. member for Pinetown has referred to.</p>

<p>What difference does it make if I say I have not seen it? It is probably a map of the Groups Areas Board, of the Department of Community Development, which advertises a proposal they are going to investigate in terms of the law. Let us consider the two possibilities now. The one possibility is that, after making their inquiry, they may say they no longer desire that place as a group area after hearing the representations. This advertisement relates to an inquiry which is still to take place. The hon. member knows nothing about the group areas machinery either. Supposing the result of the inquiry is that they do not want Klaarwater as an Indian group area, then it means that Klaarwater remains what it is, namely an ordinary urban Bantu residential area, or a town location as hon. members opposite call it. But the other alternative is that after that inquiry the Group Areas Board may decide, and the Minister concerned may approve this decision, that it should become a group area for e.g. Indians. Then it means that the Bantu will have to leave that area. What does it mean then? It means then that other provision will have to be made for those Bantu. This is not the first case of this nature we have had in South Africa. Do hon. members not know that at the present time there are numerous such places in the country where one population group is moved from its residential area. At the present time there is such an example at the East Rand where the Bantu are moving from Stirtonville to Vosloosrus, the new Bantu residential area, and the Indians or the Coloureds are going to establish themselves at Stirtonville as a group area. There are many similar places in the country. What may happen in Pinetown is probably that those Bantu at present living in Klaarwater, where they cannot own their dwellings and their premises, and can only hire, where they cannot acquire ownership of land because it is within the White urban area, in the White group areas, will be resettled, when they have to move someday, in a Bantu township which we will provide for them within a Bantu area or within a released area. There they will be able to acquire ownership of their land; they will be able to own their own homes; they will then become a land-owning class in their own area. In other words, the only alternative possibly waiting for those Bantu&#x2014;we do not know as yet whether that is going to be, because we do not know yet what the decisions are going to be under the group areas system&#x2014;will be an improvement upon what they have to-day, namely a town in which they will be able to live on a basis of ownership of land. Is that the kind of argument the Opposition should drag into this debate in an attempt to create atmosphere? That argument is as stupid as that of the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) with his story of the conquered area. That story of the conquered area is of such a misguided nature that nobody here need pursue it any further; it is utter nonsense. The hon. member for Zululand has revealed an absolute Rip van Winkle mentality. He is living still further back in the past than the period when that area became part of the Free State, as the hon. the Minister of Defence has said. Mr. Chairman, I am not making any further reference to the conquered territory, because I do not wish to allow the little bit of intelligence I have been endowed with to sink so far below my level of intelligence as to be on a level with his intelligence.</p>

<p>Then there were a few loose points raised here by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) on which I should like to say a word or two. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories made a big fuss here and said: Where are the factories in the Transkei; where are the secondary industries that are to be established there? Does the hon. member not know how industries are established? Even if he does not know, perhaps one little word might provide a little guidance for him, and that is the word &#x201C;secondary&#x201D;. Secondary surely means &#x201C;secondly&#x201D;; it comes after other things. Although the hon. member for Transkeian Territories has no knowledge of the things going on around him, does he not know that certain basic development works have to be tackled in any country in the world before factories can be established [Interjection.] No, in the very first speech the hon. member made here he said much should have been done, and that nothing had been done in the homelands. The hon. member ought to know that under the five-year plan for the development of the Bantu areas, we are engaged throughout South Africa and in the Transkei too on basic development which is needed there: Improvement of the soil, soil reclamation, rehabilitation works, the construction of roads, water supply, dam building. All these things are nothing but basic work. There is even basic work such as the provision of basic raw materials, e.g. the planting of fibre, and the establishment of forests, etc. Does the hon. member want to build factories without having any raw materials; without having a single product to process in <span class="col_6103-6104" refersTo="page_385"/>the factory? Does the hon. member wish to put up a factory without water being available for the factory, without electricity being available, without having a road to that factory? Does the hon. member not know how the economic development of any country comes about? Does he not know the successive phases? We refer to secondary industries. Secondary to what? The hon. member does not even want to provide the &#x201C;what&#x201D;. The hon. member should be a little more patient. All these things he desires will come. He need not worry about it. I told the hon. member just now that Rome was not built in a day. The Transkei and the border industries cannot be established in one day either. If the hon. member will be just a little patient and rather co-operate positively, we shall be able to bring about much more that is good.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) used the same kind of stupid argument. Then, as regards the point already dealt with by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) in connection with the reference of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories to the &#x201C;inequitable distribution of land&#x201D;, I should like to mention only this further point: The hon. member for Transkeian Territories referred to the unequal distribution of land for the Bantu, as hon. members also have done here before. I merely wish to point out that the position as regards land has been laid down very explicitly in the Acts of 1913 and 1936, with the possibility of development, in terms of the Act of 1936, that land to a maximum extent of 7,250,000 morgen may be added to Bantu areas, and there it is provided for very definitely. When the 7,250,000 morgen of land is reached, the acquisition must stop, whether the hon. member calls it &#x201C;creeping paralysis&#x201D; or whether it is called the releasing of areas, as long as this Act of 1936 remains on the Statute Book, and hon. members opposite ought to know that. But I should like to tell hon. members opposite that according to their policy of race federation, they have already by implication surpassed the 7,250,000 morgen of land promised to the Bantu in 1936, because in terms of the United Party policy they say that the Bantu should be able to acquire ownership of land in the White areas, here in Cape Town, in Johannesburg in Pretoria and wherever they may be living. I should like to remind hon. members that all over the whole of South Africa, in all the 400 or 500 or 600 local authorities in existence to-day, wherever there are town locations, there are hundreds of thousands&#x2014;perhaps 1,000,000 morgen of land already&#x2014;in the form of urban Bantu residential areas, and in terms of their policy that land may become the property of the Bantu, together with other land, if they are willing to permit it, within the White residential areas. The United Party has therefore already surpassed the 7,250,000 morgen of land promised in 1936, in terms of their policy. Those hon. members must realize that fully. The United Party must not think the people are so stupid as not to appreciate the implications of their policy. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch the duality on that side of the House. Every Minister and every member on that side who has thus far spoken has had a story of his own. The hon. the Deputy Minister once again referred to the policy of the United Party in an attempt to divert attention from the policy of the National Party. He tells us, almost with tears in his eyes, that the Government is going to adhere to the 1936 legislation and that they are going to acquire only such land as has been released under the 1936 legislation, but surely the Deputy Minister knows that that is not correct; surely he knows certain portions have been added, and he knows that when a part has been added the next farm is automatically regarded as a released area. The Deputy Minister is in the habit, as soon as he finds himself in difficulties, of saying that another member is stupid and does not appreciate the position. He got to his feet here to-day and referred to the rate of increase of the Bantu in the White community, and do you know where he ended? He said the rate of increase from 1936 to 1946 was 2.3 per cent; from 1946 to 1951 it was 2.8 per cent, and from 1951 to 1960 it dropped from 2.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent per annum. Mr. Chairman, was the period prior to 1946 not the war period when the influx policy was suspended? The hon. the Deputy Minister ought to know that the period before 1946, when there was no influx control, was the most difficult period in our history. Sir, I referred to duality and uncertainty on that side of the House. The hon. the Deputy Minister is saying that the uncertainty to-day is not limited to the White people alone, but that all races in this country are uncertain, because he tells the hon. member for Pinetown that if that Native township is moved, if the Natives have to go to another place, that will not be the only case of its kind, because other racial groups are also being moved and are going to be removed, and the process is going to continue. Sir, just imagine, it is the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration who is telling that kind of tale. The hon. the Minister of Defence tells us, with tears in his eyes, that as long as there is one White man in the Free State, those conquered areas will not be touched. But what about Umtata where there are many White people; what about them?</p>

<p>And what about Natal? Just listen to what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development told us here this morning. What is his story? He says that these border industries merely amount to decentralization of the rural industries, and then he continues, and says: See how well things are going; see how splendidly things are going; see how the Bantu are <span class="col_6105-6106" refersTo="page_386"/>being integrated. And then he mentions Phalaborwa and he refers to Newcastle and Estcourt and Buffalo River and Ladysmith and Bergville and all those places. Then he refers to Newcastle and he says: &#x201C;Look at Dutchpond&#x201D;, and he talks about Phalaborwa, but surely that is White man&#x2019;s land. Dutchpond is, after all, five miles distant from Newcastle; it is between Utrecht and Newcastle, in the constituency of the Minister of Bantu Education. That, now, is the solution of the hon. the Minister; that is now apartheid! And then he says members on this side should come along and look at the wonderful position there, and in the same breath he says that of course all the Bantu now wish to return to the Transkei; that they wish to go and live amidst the riches of the Transkei. But what is the position? Apparently the whole country now wishes to go and live in the Transkei. When one hears the tales of the industries that are going to be developed in the Transkei, one would swear the Natives just pick up gold sovereigns under the stones of the cattle kraals and hand them over to him. Now the hon. the Minister says we must go and see the position at Dutchpond. Mr. Chairman; I have been looking at Dutchpond for years; I live there, in fact, and I see there are 20,000 families placed five miles from Newcastle. There is a tent town on the banks of the White River, three miles from one of my farms, and then the hon. the Minister wants to tell me that that is apartheid! He says that is the solution. But what kind of a solution is that? Those 20,000 families situated in Dutchpond, and the other crowd sitting in tents on the White River, have nothing to live on. There is no industry in which they can be employed. The hon. the Deputy Minister mentions secondary industries, and there is a terrific fuss about that now. We do not mind what kind of industry it is, as long as it is an industry which can offer employment to the Natives. Do you know what the people of Newcastle and the people of Utrecht are saying ? They say they will wake up one morning and find that whole multitude of Natives in the town, demanding food and employment. Where are they going to get that? The hon. the Minister puts 20,000 families there and there is no work for them. You see, we are living in this &#x201C;never-never land&#x201D; of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. He gets such a heavenly glow on his face, and then he tells us that he will never disappoint his sons and daughters. It is high time he begins to do something for those sons and daughters of his, particularly that large group of them sitting near Newcastle and that large group sitting in the district in which I reside. If I were the Minister of Bantu Education, I would not feel at ease for a single hour, because he is allowing himself to be used by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development for the placing of all his surplus Natives in that constituency. And what is happening in other towns?</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister asks whether they should come and live on my White farm. Sir, it is not my policy that is being tested; it is the policy of separate development of that Government. You certainly cannot put multitudes of Bantu into White areas and then say you are applying apartheid. What more does the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development do? He does exactly what he has done in Pinetown. Where Bantu townships have been established in some of the bigger towns, and where building is in progress already&#x2014;some of them have 300 to 400 dwellings; I am thinking of Ladysmith for instance&#x2014;there an edict from the Minister suddenly comes like a bolt from the blue that there shall be no further building activities in that area, and that no further industrial development shall take place there. The town council is told: Unless you can persuade the farmers to sell their farms&#x2014;I mention this example, unless you can persuade the people of Wesselsnek to sell their land so that it may be added to the Msinga Native area&#x2014;you will have no border industries and no development and you will have no Native township. There is no end to the methods which are applied to surround the White man and to endanger his economy and his livelihood. But, Sir, I have referred to duality. Hon. members opposite do not know what they are talking about, as I have shown here this afternoon. The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. S. F.

<p>I do not wish to follow the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), for then I shall make myself guilty of duality! I should like to refer to an item under Loan Vote N, the loan to the municipality of Edenvale for the resettlement of Bantu living in the municipal locations. For years there has been a struggle to have this location removed to Thembisa. The difficulties that arose there were enormous. We know that for years they have struggled there to have these Bantu removed. The Bantu from many of the other local authorities, such as Germiston, Bedford View as well as Kempton Park were accommodated in this location. After the war it was difficult to obtain accommodation for these people. Edenvale at the time had to help the Department by accommodating these people in the Edenvale location. In due course many of the <span class="col_6107-6108" refersTo="page_387"/>local authorities in that vicinity resettled their Bantu in Thembisa, but the Edenvale location authority found it very difficult because it is not a wealthy urban area. They cannot tax their taxpayers too heavily. They had a large sum of money which they used to accommodate the Bantu in Thembisa, but they then found that they were going to be embarrassed. Here I should Eke to tell the hon. the Minister and his Department that the voters of Edenvale are very thankful for this loan of R100,000. It will now enable them to remove these Bantu and it will also enable the Department to see to it that this location will disappear completely. Of course it will take a little time still.</p>

<p>There are two points I should like to mention in this connection. The one is in connection with transport. I hope and trust, in view of the recent negotiations with the Department, that the Department will assist the Edenvale local authority as far as possible in transporting the Bantu. The difficulty at the moment is that they have to make use of the train service and bus transport. It costs them a lot of money and the Bantu are not keen to travel so far. They have to rise early in the morning and they return home late at night. If direct transport by road could be arranged, it will of course help a lot.</p>

<p>As regards the second matter, I should like to address my remarks to the Treasury. I should like to urge the Treasury to see to it that this money is granted to the City Council of Edenvale at a sub-economic rate of interest. Edenvale has throughout the years developed comparatively slowly, but during the past two years it has developed very rapidly. They require large sums of money for sewerage and for the development of the urban area in general, for the construction of roads, etc. They cannot raise their rates too much, because all the people residing there fall within the middle income group. There are many also who do not even fall within the middle income group. Increased rates will hit them vary hard. If they are to be taxed to cover the interest charged on the ordinary market, it will mean that the municipality will have to over-tax the people. I am pleading for the South Africans there&#x2014;English speaking as well as Afrikaans speaking&#x2014;who certainly cannot afford to pay higher rates. We know the cost of living is high at the present time, and if we could have this concession as regards the rate of interest, it will of course be a tremendous help to give relief there, and it will also enable the Edenvale municipality to redeem the loan together with the interest thereon by easy stages. I understand that to begin with they will be unable to repay much, but later on they will be able to do so.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like once again to thank the Minister and his administration for this concession and for this loan.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister says I am talking nonsense, but I want to call the hon. member for Rustenburg as my witness. In every instance where proposals have been put up by organized agriculture I do not think the Minister can give me one example of where he has accepted those proposals. [Interjections.] If that is untrue then I say the Minister has rather followed a policy of approaching individual Members of Parliament of his party for the areas concerned in order to see if they can arrive at arrangements with the farmers concerned. As the Minister knows, certain meetings were held by the Rustenburg, Marico and Swantruggens farmers&#x2019; associations. The proposals made by the Rustenburg farmers&#x2019; association, in particular, with regard to the purchase of land affecting that particular area were turned down by the hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department. Arrangements were then arrived at that the hon. member for Rustenburg should act as liaison and try to persuade the farmers concerned to sell their land. I have the minutes of that meeting here. I do not want to read everything except the relevant parts. They say&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Marico knows about the dissatisfaction that exists in his constituency; he knows about the representations he has had from the farmers&#x2019; association in Swartruggens. The fact remains that as far as the boundaries of the proposed Tswanaland are concerned there is not a farmer in that area to-day who is prepared to make a capital investment because of the uncertainty; he does not know whether his land will be purchased or not.</p>

<p>Why does the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) not take the trouble to look at the correspondence that is written to his Department? Then he will know what representations have been made by, for instance, the Potgietersrust Farmers&#x2019; Association.</p>

<p>Why is the hon. Minister following a new policy to-day? Because he cannot persuade the farmers&#x2019; associations to accept the proposals of his Department, he now exploits the difficulties the farmers are experiencing in certain areas, particularly in the north-western Transvaal where the drought conditions are as extreme as they are to-day. You have the position to-day, Sir, that individual farmers have no desire to co-operate whatsoever, because they reject entirely the idea of establishing a Bantustan in the Transvaal. The hon. member for Marico knows it. He knows what has been said to him at farmers&#x2019; association meetings. They neither want or wish to sell their land in order to have a Bantustan right on their borders. That has been stated to the hon. member many times.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>The reason why the Minister does not want to accept the proposals made by the farmers&#x2019; associations is because he feels his department can better exploit the economic difficulties, to the advantage of his Department. So many of these farmers in the drought-stricken area find themselves in such economic difficulties that the only way out for them is to sell to the Department at a greater profit and not to accept the proposals made by the &#x201C;Landbou-unie&#x201D;. I see the hon. member for Rustenburg has entered the Chamber and is taking an interest in the debate. He knows what I am saying here is true. He has had to face it at a meeting himself. He knows what the position is in his constituency. I do not want to name any areas, but I could if I wanted to.</p>

<p>Then there is another thing. How far is the Minister to go with this concept of purchasing land outside released areas? Information has come to my ears that his Department is making contact with certain farmers who find themselves in bad economic circumstances because of the drought and making them offers for their land which is outside released areas. I believe those farmers have more or less been given an undertaking that the Department will consider purchasing their farms. The Minister laughs. I know this is a very touchy issue and that was why we had such violent reaction from the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). I should say the hon. members for Marico and Rustenburg receive letters daily from their constituents in regard to this.</p>

<p>In this debate the Opposition has spoken in a very belittling manner of the work the Government is doing in connection with our policy of Bantu homelands. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) said very little has been done and that very much more ought to be done. The hon. the Minister earlier this afternoon pointed out to us that priority had first to be given to housing; that the slum-conditions had to be eliminated first. When we look at what has been effected, the Opposition must admit much has been achieved.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, referred to the uncertainty with regard to boundaries in certain areas. The only thing he is trying to do, is to create uncertainty in the minds of the farming community. The United Party is fond of discussing race matters in connection with our Bantu policy. I am not finding fault with that, for it is very important. But I do object to the fact that they have become nothing but the echo of the English language liberal Press. I am referring to the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> the <i>Sunday Times</i> and the <i>Cape Times</i> which have during recent years, been pointing out that only 20 per cent of our population are Whites; that percentage is then broken up further; the Nationalists constitute only 11 per cent and they are the people now who are implementing the policy of separate development in the country; these 11 per cent are the only people who approve of that policy. Then the world is being given the impression that all the other Whites, including the United Party are in favour of implementing the policy of one man, one vote here. In recent times the United Party has made more and more concessions to the left wing. During this Session they have made various statements here which, I believe, were aimed at discrediting our country overseas. The hon. member for Durban (Point) <span class="col_6111-6112" refersTo="page_389"/>(Mr. Raw), with a sardonic smile on his face, said that the Minister had used the word &#x201C;revolution&#x201D; in connection with the development of the homelands. He construed it as a rebellion, whereas the hon. the Minister meant &#x201C;evolution&#x201D; or &#x201C;development&#x201D;. The hon. member knows he tried to create a wrong impression by placing that construction on that word.</p>

<p>Various views have been expressed in this debate in relation to this Government, which are offensive and which will harm us overseas. I refer to the hon. member for Simons-town who referred to gas chambers; the hon. member for Benoni referred to slave labour; the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) referred to &#x201C;death by torture&#x201D;. They are saying these things in an attempt to discredit the Government overseas. Mr. Chairman, what is their aim in doing so? All they are doing is to say to the Bantu: If there is a revolution, we shall approve of it. The person who first used the word &#x201C;revolution&#x201D; in this House, is the Leader of the Opposition. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) tries to attribute the word &#x201C;revolution&#x201D; to our Prime Minister. But the Leader of the Opposition was the father of that word. He intimated to the Bantu of this country that if there is to be a revolution, it will meet with the approval of the Opposition. The Opposition hopes that there will be a shock emanating from outside, as they said on one occasion, so that they may try to get into power once again somehow. That is what they are aiming at, and nothing else. The United Party is very sensitive about their own policy. They are unwilling to say anything about their own policy. Indeed, I have not heard anything positive from their side during this debate. They have criticized the Bantustan policy of the Government, but they have made no positive contribution. They are very sensitive about criticism of their policy by us, because they know where that policy will lead the country.</p>

If they hope to become the alternative Government, they really should give the country some idea of how they will better administer the Bantu Administration and Development Vote.</p>

<p>I wish to revert to the hon. member for Durban (Point). Yesterday he referred to the statement of the hon. member for Krugerdorp (Mr. N. J. van den Berg) that Israel is the homeland of the Jews. The hon. member for Durban (Point) then asked whether the Jews of Israel had the vote in Israel or here? Did the hon. member say that?</p>

<p>He says it is correct that he asked that question. Now I should like to ask him a few questions. What is the implication of that question of his? Is he not suggesting that it is the policy of the United Party to grant to the Banu in the White areas of the Republic, one man one vote, as in the case of the Jews? [Interjections.] That is the implication of his question. He said the Jews in South Africa have the vote here and not in Israel. By saying that, he has sent overseas the view that the United Party is in favour of granting the franchise to the Bantu within the White areas.</p>

<p>It is very clear that the United Party is moving to the left, and that they are trying to transmit overseas the idea that they are in favour of one man one vote, while we know that in actual fact they do not approve of it. They are trying to mislead the Bantu by means of incitement. I should like to express my admiration for the Bantu having regard to all the incitement by liberals and communists as well as by this new United Party. Having regard to all the agitation perpetrated by them, and having regard to the friendly disposition there still is, one has to admire the Bantu. The United Party is very sick at heart because the Bantu is supporting this Government&#x2019;s policy to the extent to which they are in fact supporting it. They are disappointed at the great success we have achieved in the Transkei. It is clear that the Bantu policy of the Government is making rapid strides, and that the Bantu is realizing to-day that separate development is to his advantage, and that he may exercise his civic rights within his own area, the civic right of which everyone of us in this country is proud.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>If that is not what I said you can correct it.</p>

<p>I now want to get back to more sane ideas. There are a few questions to which the hon. the Minister must still reply. Mr. Chairman, you will pardon me for returning to them because it is causing greater anxiety and aggravation in the Corridor, which is known as the Border Corridor, than you have ever had in history. Before I deal with that question I want to deal with the remarks by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) who accused the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) of having said that he wanted a more equitable distribution of the land in South Africa. He did not say so, Sir. But in any case, I should just like to remind the hon. the Minister that, if ever such a thing should have to take place, the Natives in the Transkei might have to forego a section of that land in the interests of the Whites. Because of experiments and research carried out by the Government itself we know that land is capable of carrying, when developed, at least 50,000,000 more sheep than is carried by the whole of South Africa at present. We can accept it that that section which is owned by the White section of South Africa is fully developed and fully stocked. The hon. member for Kempton Park went on to say that the historical homelands would be the future boundaries of these Bantustans. What is interesting are the remarks that have come from the Chief Minister of the Transkei from time to time. The hon. the Minister knows full well that the Chief Minister has staked his claim, first of all, to the area from the Fish River to the Zululand border. That idea has fallen away temporarily but it is working up again and demands have been made in that regard. Secondly, he made another claim and that was to the whole of Ugie, Maclear, Elliot, Queenstown, Indwe, East Griqualand, Harding and some sections of Natal. I was not surprised to hear the Minister say he was not fully informed because he cannot be fully informed. Those are the demands made by the Transkei and they are going to continue to make them. I want to know what the Minister&#x2019;s reaction is to those demands. The hon. the Minister has told us from time to time that he has got to get more land to fulfil the requirements of the 1936 Act, an Act to which he has committed himself. He has bought quite a lot of what was scheduled. There must be very little left. The hon. Minister has gone far beyond those areas, Sir. I am sure he would not suggest that the areas he bought on the eastern perimeter of the Ciskei reserve were released areas. The Minister has taken the power to buy any land and that makes the position of those people living in the Corridor still more precarious. I want to ask the Minister whether he will not give us some assurance that he is not going to close that Corridor any more than it is closed at present. That is important to those Whites who have fought for and lived in that Corridor and protected the rest of South Africa from the encroachment of Natives in the past. They should know what the future holds in store for them. Their very future depends on it. Surely the hon. the Minister can give us an idea of what he intends to do so that these people can make arrangements for the future.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Minister has done something more serious. He is evacuating Natives from the Western Cape and other big towns. A few of those Natives go to the Transkei, a few to the border but many go to the reserves. Many of them are parking their families on mission land as squatters, in the reserves and on farms. Does the hon. the Minister realize what is going to happen as a result? We have told the Minister in the past that this illegal squatting is taking place on such a scale that it is becoming dangerous. When an area is full of squatters the Department says: We better take it over; we now declare it a released area. That is happening. I can assure the hon. the Minister that the position in the whole of that eastern corridor is such that it is becoming dangerous to both Natives and Whites. The tsotsi gangs and the uncontrolled thieving gangs that have set themselves up are becoming a menace to that part of the country. The Minister&#x2019;s Department stakes its claim to that land immediately it has, what the Department calls, an abundance of Natives in it. Will the hon. Minister indicate to me whether he intends to take any action to remove those squatters to townships where they can be cared for. I can assure the hon. the Minister that the male members of those families are simply returning to Cape Town as migrant labourers. They get employed in the same services where they were employed before they were evacuated. What is in fact taking place is that these Natives are being ousted with their families; they park their families in the Corridor and the male members return. They are streaming back as is apparent from the figures that have been mentioned here.</p>

<p>I now want to come to this question of the border industries. What really constitutes a border town at which we might expect a border industry to be established? To my mind there is really only one border town in that Corridor that has all the facilities to become a suitable border industrial town and that is King William&#x2019;s Town. The hon. Minister knows there are tens of thousands of idle squatting Natives in the whole of that section of the country. Over and above that it has the power and water, for that matter, every possible facility. But what is being done? The hon. the Minister has bought land to connect East London so as to be able to call it a border town. He has established an industry there. Sir, there is a clamour from almost <span class="col_6115-6116" refersTo="page_391"/>every city and town in South Africa for border industries. They all want border industries, regardless of where they are situated. What is the hon. Minister going to do about it? There are certain areas that I will admit are eminently suitable for the establishment of border industries. But to carry on as we are and try and bring that labour to where you are going to establish an industry is quite wrong. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Because I knew that I would be dealing with hon. members who do not understand the truth and who have so little regard for truth that they do not know what it is, I armed myself very well in regard to this matter. I think the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) does not know at all what he is talking about. He has not the slightest idea of what actually happened. But the Opposition members, as usual, grasp at something and continue with it, without understanding anything about it. There is a piece of land which almost forms a point in the Pilansberge, and that strip of land is surrounded by Bantu territory, and the land was offered by the owners to the Minister, through my mediation. The owners approached me with a document in which they offered that land. There was no opposition which had to be overcome. The people who were opposed to it are still outside that reserve to-day, and I can bring witnesses who were at the meeting to give evidence that I told them that they could remain outside if they wanted to. But there was a dispute about the boundary, not in regard to the sale of the land. One section wanted the boundary in the mountains, and the Minister could not accept that, and therefore there was a difference of opinion among these people. The Minister instructed me to hold a meeting there, and I think that is the meeting to which the hon. member for Turffontein referred. But because I know him, and knew that he would be sitting listening with open ears, I took a stenographer to the meeting and I had every word spoken at that meeting recorded by a qualified stenographer who also sometimes records cases in the Supreme Court, and I handed that report of 65 pages to the Minister. Therefore the allegation by the hon. member that the farmers are upset by the purchase of land there is simply not true. I cannot describe that untruth in words. Words are quite inadequate. The hon. member told an untruth when he said those people were so dissatisfied. To prove my proposition, I want to say that the people in that whole area of 22 miles offer their land to the Government. I can prove by means of documents which at the moment are in the office of the Minister that those dissatisfied people referred to by the hon. members offered their land to the Minister over a distance of 22 miles. The Minister has already refused to accept the offer of certain land. Sir, if the truth were poison then that hon. member would never have grown up; the poison would have killed him while he was still small. Because there is not a word of truth in the allegation that the farmers are up in arms against the Minister, against me and against my colleague. We are the greatest friends in the world. I have the offers made by those people. What is more, at that meeting I was congratulated by the biggest United Party supporter in Rustenburg, and that is also recorded in this report. But here we have a man who stands outside and knows nothing about the whole matter and he condemns us and says there is so much dissatisfaction.</p>

He has forgotten, he cannot remember. Yet he says that he went to a large meeting of farmers, and here is a member of Parliament professing to represent a farming community in the Rustenburg constituency, and when he came to discuss an important matter which was causing consternation in the whole district he had to take a stenographer along because he could not trust his own constituents. He had to get a stenographer to take down what was being said for fear that his constituents might not trust him. What an admission! What a shocking admission! His confidence in that constituency is so undermined that he has to take a stenographer along so that he can place it on record to face his political enemies in the area. The hon. member knows, as I know, that in the whole of that area, including the district of Marico, there is considerable consternation amongst the entire farming community in regard <span class="col_6117-6118" refersTo="page_392"/>to the fixing of the boundary line of the proposed Tswanaland.</p>

They are concerned about the proposed Bantustans. The hon. member has probably not seen to-night&#x2019;s paper, where it is said that in the Transkeian Council, Chief Kaizer Matanzima has said that the Whites should withdraw. &#x201C;This is a Black man&#x2019;s country,&#x201D; he said, as reported to-night Chief Kaizer Matanzima continued to say &#x201C;other Bantu in South Africa will soon be talking about their land as we are doing now&#x201D;. What the farmers in this area of the north-west Transvaal want to know is how soon will they be talking of the farmers&#x2019; land there as the land of the Bantu? That is the question they want answered and that is the answer that the hon. Minister cannot give. We all have the fear. I have the fear. I farm nearby there. I have no certainty, like many other farmers there, as to what will happen in these particular areas, and as to whether or not there will be a Bantu man next to me who will say &#x201C;that is my land&#x201D;. I challenge the Minister to get up and give us a clear picture, so that the hon. member for Rustenburg and the hon. member for Marico can go back and report to their constituents: The Minister said in Parliament that &#x201C;these are the boundaries of Tswanaland and now you know that you have got to get out&#x201D;. I challenged the hon. member for Marico in the last recess to let me appear on platforms with him in that constituency to put two questions: &#x201C;Would he tell his constituents where the boundaries of Tswanaland are going to be?&#x201D; He was too afraid even to accept my challenge or to have me at any of his meetings, or any United Party member at his branch meetings to put that question because he cannot answer it. If the hon. Minister wants to placate the consternation and if he wants to satisfy the White community of vast areas, thousands of people, let him get up and say that his intentions are honourable and that there is going to be deprivation of the rights of the White men in these areas, or let him say that no further land will be purchased in those areas for the establishment of Tswanaland, other than the released areas. Now I challenge the hon. the Minister to say where the boundaries are going to be, and let us see what the hon. member for Rustenburg is going to say in this debate when the hon. Minister refuses to do so to-day in his reply to the debate.</p>

<p>It will have to happen. But I really got up to react to what was said by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) in regard to what Kaizer Matanzima is alleged to have demanded in relation to those districts in my constituency, viz. Elliot, Indwe, Maclear and the so-called whole of Mount Currie. The hon. member for Durban (Point) is really the spokesman who traditionally represents the Black man here and makes all the demands on their behalf. He did that last year as well. But the demands they make there are their own affair. We could make our demands too. But we do not intend running away and surrendering everything like the United Party. We are not prepared to follow a negative policy, a defeatist policy, and hand the whole of South Africa over to them. We are only going to give them the Transkei. Have the members of the Opposition ever tried to ascertain whether there are still any released areas in those districts? There are no more released areas in those districts. But that they have never realized. The boundaries are clear. In those areas the supporters of the United Party as well as the Nationalists are agreed on this point, that the borders are clearly demarcated. We no longer quarrel about that.</p>

<p>The point is that certain United Party members become frustrated in this House, like, e.g. the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson), who quietly left here at the time of the Bashee murder and then held a meeting at Elliot to frighten the people, and recently again the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor), who also went to address a meeting there. That is a very suitable constituency in which to sow dissension and unrest. I just want to read what a member of the United Party, and not a member of the National Party, wrote to me. It comes from Maclear. I can give the date, but I will not give the name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For your information, Mrs. Taylor, M.P., addressed 53 people in the hall last week. One of the themes was that this and surrounding districts are going to be given to the kaffirs, notwithstanding assurances given by Mr. de Wet Nel at a meeting here in 1959 at which you also spoke. She says Matanzima&#x2019;s election manifesto demanding a large area of ground including Maclear and the surrounding districts was never repudiated by Mr. de Wet Nel or the Prime Minister.

<p>He replied to it last year also. But the tactics of the United Party are to try to sow dissension in the border areas, because it is not in their interest to have a prosperous White community there, because if we have a prosperous White community next to the Bantu areas it will obviously lead to prosperity for the Black community on the other side of the border, and that is not in their interest. That is why they try to sow unrest on the borders, and they do everything possible to bring the people there under a wrong impression, just as they try to create false political impressions in regard to the whole of South Africa. Those are their tactics. Hence all the problems we have in respect of certain people. It is you who are the cause of it, with your dual policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think this debate has demonstrated that the Government&#x2019;s Bantustan policy fails when tested out on all practical issues. We have it now working almost in reverse. Great efforts are being made by the Government to house Natives outside the reserves. For instance in every town of any importance in this country, they are going all out to build houses to accommodate more Natives, with Government assistance. On the Witwatersrand 700,000 Natives have been accommodated and that is proof of the insincerity of the Government as regards its Bantustan policy. They know that policy cannot succeed. Even on the simple issue of fixing the boundaries of the Bantustans, even when they are so simple as those of the Transkei, the Government fails and cannot satisfy the people concerned.</p>

<p>One has only to see the damaging effect of the Minister&#x2019;s inability to come near any solution of the boundaries of the Bantustan of the Ciskei. I refer particularly to the Peddie district, where the Minister is seeking to expropriate additional territory to erase the many Black spots and the Native-owned farms in that area. Under present conditions every European or Native owner of land in our border areas lives in an atmosphere of uncertainty as regards the future ownership of their property. The Government gives no guidance whatsoever as regards how it is going to move the future boundaries, or where the future boundaries will be. With fear and uncertainty the Minister&#x2019;s next move to obtain the land he requires is awaited by families who have occupied their farms for 100 years, where the graves of their ancestors lie and where they have established a tradition and where they have developed a love for their property. I defy any member to go into the <span class="col_6121-6122" refersTo="page_394"/>Peddie district and see with what care the European owners have developed their properties. Some of our finest farming propositions are in that area. Just put yourself in their position of being in that area and not knowing what your future as regards your ownership of your property is going to be. Imagine the damaging effect on future development, the damaging effect on love of land. These are the things which are happening through the Minister&#x2019;s inability to give any satisfaction as regards where his future boundaries will be.</p>

<p>The Minister has given the assurance that the farmers&#x2019; associations in the particular areas will be consulted before he expropriates or purchases any properties. But that is no solution. That does not in any way solve the uncertainty that permeates that particular area. This atmosphere of uncertainty is a damaging one throughout the country. The Government allows all kinds of rumours to circulate which they assert as untrue. I would like to know what steps the Minister undertakes to use the Department of Information, or even the High Commissioner in London, to contradict the palpable untruths that are told about this country. The Minister makes no endeavour to do that. The hon. Minister actually is responsible for propagating a sense of uncertainty, not only in this country, but even overseas. The Government is sitting here with a big majority in this House, but I want to tell its members that public opinion can change, and I think the Government should be more definite in its policy, much more definite. We in the United Party support the development of the Native reserves. We want to see those reserves developed to a state that they will be able to carry the future increase of population in those reserves. We realize that that will be one of the greatest problems. General Hertzog once said to me when he introduced his segregation policy that they had hoped to reduce over-population in certain areas and provide settlements for Natives in the areas purchased under his 7,250,000 morgen scheme, and he thought that if Native areas could only cope with the increase in population there that it would be a solution to our troubles. We in the United Party believe that we have to accommodate these people and to develop our industries and resources and use the Natives in the development of this country, as has been done in the past. You cannot turn back from what has been established in the past. That is evolution. This Government is professing that it is working contrary to natural evolution and development of the peoples of a country, but it is quite impossible for them to do so. As I said, even with regard to simple questions they fail. Even in regard to the border industries, they are establishing hundreds of thousands of Natives in settlements outside the reserves, or they say they will do so. What will their future be? Take even a place like King William&#x2019;s Town. It is surrounded by Native reserves. They say that in future further industries will be established there. Will not King William&#x2019;s Town be incorporated in a great Native state? Is not that also possible? Is not the Minister playing with fire as regards these border industries? This carrying of industry to labour, instead of bringing labour to industries where the facilities of water and power are all available, is madness! The Government has no solution, and I say the proof is that up to now the Government is going backwards as regards the development of its policy instead of going forward. Even in the rural area, on the platteland, that carries one-third of the Native population, you find that big families are bringing about an enormous increase in the Native population. During our recent vaccination scare in the Eastern Province we had proof that there are thousands and thousands of Natives that have not been registered. We also have proof that there are individual farms carrying over 200 Natives. This is a problem for which the Government offers no solution whatever. It is not border industries or Bantustans that will settle our problems in future. It is the development of tertiary industrialization throughout the country and using Native labour where it is wanted.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar game that is being played here. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat Says that the Bantu homeland policy has failed, but then in the same breath he says that the Government must be more definite in its policy. He says the Bantu homelands are a failure, but they must be developed further in order to accommodate more Bantu. Well, if it is a failure, why do those hon. members ask that the homelands should be developed further? The United Party is opposed to the homeland policy. The Leader of the United Party said very clearly that he preferred to have eight Bantu representatives here to eight Bantu homelands. That shows that the United Party is against the homeland policy, but to-day they attacked the Government because it does not immediately draw the boundaries of those homelands. They do not want homelands, but they now ask the Government to delimitate the other homelands also. How is one to understand them? But I can just tell the hon. members that this Government will not allow itself to be driven by the Opposition. It will not take action helter-skelter and make mistakes which will again have to be remedied. This matter must be dealt with slowly and carefully. The Opposition attacks the Government particularly in regard to the Transkei and says that it is not being developed fast enough. But is that not the same party which said, when the Prime Minister announced his policy in regard to the Transkei, that it was a waste of money? [Interjections.] Now they ask that more money should be spent on the Transkei; the Government is not doing enough. Here they plead very nicely for the Bantu homelands, but when they go to the platteland they say that the Government is doing everything only for the Bantu.</p>

<p>Yes, that is what they say. They show the people all the splendid residential areas which the Government has built for the Bantu in Johannesburg and Pretoria and then they say everything is being done for the &#x00A1;Bantu and nothing for the Whites. But they neglect to say that the Bantu living in Meadowlands lived amongst the Whites under the United Party regime. They do not say that this Government took those Bantu out from among the Whites and put them on one side where there could be proper control. Nor do they tell the people that the money which was spent there is being repaid by the Bantu over a period. No, they create the impression that those houses and that land belong to the Bantu. Here they call those people Bantu and plead for them, but if the hon. member for Drakensberg goes to Natal she says that the Government now calls them Bantu but she simply calls them &#x201C;Kaffers&#x201D;. There is no honesty in their policy. They Want the borders to be defined, particularly in Natal. It is obvious that the Government wants to consolidate there as far as possible, and then people will have to be shifted. But if removal take place, they will fight strenuously to prevent it, and then they sow dissension among those people and say that the Government wants to give all these areas to the Kaffirs. Now I want to ask those hon. members&#x2014;unfortunately there is no member from Natal here at the moment&#x2014;what their attitude will be in Natal, and they must please give the reply here and not do what their leader in Natal did when he said that he would reply later, but never replied at all. What will their attitude be if the Natal Agricultural Union and the pubic recommend to the Government that those three locations, Locations Nos. 1 and 2 and the Bergville Location, should be removed from the catchment area of the Tugela, the largest river in Natal? They are opposed to removals, just as they opposed the removal at Besterspruit, in spite of the fact that the Bantu there were living in the most deplorable conditions. Then they set the whole world on fire, even overseas, in regard to that removal. I now want to ask the United Party to give a clear reply as to what their attitude will be if the Agricultural Union and the public of Natal ask that the catchment area of the Tugela should be cleared up?</p>

Henwood) against or in favour of those three locations in the catchment area of the Tugela being moved? Now they are as silent as the grave, but we will force them to say whether they are for or against it. In this problem with which South Africa is faced, where we want a fair arrangement between Whites and non-Whites and where we are trying to find the solution, the United Party will make no contribution towards solving the problem. No, it will only put obstacles in the way, as it has consistently done for all these years.</p>

But they have not passed such a resolution, so it is ridiculous to put such a question The hon. member has also accused us of being for the Bantu in this debate. As I sum up this debate, the members on this side have been pleading with the Minister to give us a definite indication of where he intends to draw the boundaries of the Bantustans. We are pleading for the Whites and for the Blacks. In the Eastern Province the farmers are becoming desperate at the vacillating tactics of the Government in regard to the boundaries and the purchase of land in that area. We have made repeated efforts and public bodies have made efforts to get something definite about these boundaries, and all we get are vague and embarrassing replies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#field">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FIELD</person>:</from>

<p>We get contradictory replies and we want to know what the Government is actually doing. Ten years ago the Tomlinson Commission handed in its report, with maps, showing what they intended to do. The Government has had ample time in which to give us some other boundaries if they do not agree with the boundaries of the Commission. We want something definite that we can work on. The farmers in the Eastern Province do not know where they are, and as the result they are not able to share in this boom we are having in South Africa because they cannot develop their land, because they do not know where the boundaries will be; and not only the farmers but the townships and smaller villages in these areas are in the same position. They Cannot develop because they do not know whether the land in their vicinity is going to continue to be White land or whether it is going to be turned over to the Bantu. Professor Hobart-Houghton, in a survey he made of the boarder areas, gave a brilliant report and pointed out that it takes 27 Bantu in their forms of agriculture to equal the purchasing power of one White man. You can see what that means to any village or town in these areas. If the farmers&#x2019; land is going to be handed over to the Blacks, it will take 27 Blacks to give the same return, and obviously the villages in that area will deteriorate and in fact many of them will become ghost towns. I am thinking particularly of the Ciskei. Questions have been put in this House, and they have been answered by the Prime Minister and by the Minister of Bantu Administration, as to where these boundaries are to be, and we have been told that the boundaries will be those of the areas which were historically Bantu. To-day the hon. member for Kempton <span class="col_6125-6126" refersTo="page_396"/>Park (Mr, F. S. Steyn) made the same statement quite emphatically, that the land for the Bantus will be the land which was historically theirs. He also said that it was to be the land set out in 1913 and 1936, the scheduled areas. A big strip of land is now in the process of being purchased on the western side of the Buffalo River as part of the land mentioned in the schedule to the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill which was passed this Session. It is a very big strip of land which was not scheduled land. Now, what must we believe? We are told from the Government benches that the Bantu will get the scheduled land, and yet this very Session we passed a Bill containing a schedule which comprises very big areas of land which was not scheduled in 1956. But what worries me is this. I have just learnt that the Government is negotiating for the purchase of land on the eastern side of the banks of the Fish River. That land was not scheduled land. In this contradictory position nobody knows what to do in that area.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to point out that the land referred to in the 1936 Act does not cover only scheduled areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#field">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FIELD</person>:</from>

<p>There is another contradiction again. The hon. member for Kempton Park told us that scheduled land would be bought, and now that hon. member, who should know something about it, tells us exactly the opposite. That is the difficult position we are in. While we have these difficulties in getting anything definite from the Government, there is one head of a Government in South Africa who does know what he wants. I refer to Chief Matanzima, and he says that he wants all the land on the eastern side of the Fish River. Now we find that the Government, contrary to what they have told us, is buying land along the Fish River which was not scheduled land. It is obvious that Chief Matanzima is playing the bagpipes and the Government is dancing to his tune. Surely it must be obvious to everyone that there is a private pact between the Minister and Chief Matanzima, a private pact for a <i>quid pro quo.</i> Matanzima has asked for the land along the Fish River and he is getting it as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for advocating Government policy. That is in reply to the hon. member for Pietersburg (Mr. Niemand), who said that the United Party is disappointed at the success of the policy of apartheid of the Government. It is not a question of being disappointed. We are not surprised because it is obvious that there is a pact with Matanzima by which he is to get that land. If that is the price we have to pay when one chief bids against our Government in a bull market, I wonder what the position will be when we have seven such chiefs bidding in the same way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) (Mr. Field) has repeated the old refrain: Show us the borders. That is a very old song. If only he would page through the Hansards, he would see that this matter has been discussed for the past five years or longer, and the replies have very clearly been given, but the United Party has to-day revealed a bankruptcy such as I have never seen before on that side of the House. Here we have again had the old story about the borders, and that party also recognizes the Bantu homelands. Then they should set the example, and let them tell us how they want the homelands to be. [Interjections.] We have so often said that there we have the Bantu areas, and they are defined in terms of the Acts of 1913 and 1936; there are the released areas which have to be purchased. Most of those areas are well defined, and we said that we were following the policy of consolidation. Where people feel that it is better to consolidate in this way, we help them, and we do so with the co-operation of all the agricultural unions practically throughout South Africa. But now I ask the hon. member for East London (North) and other hon. members who raised this point: If they are so concerned about the borders of the homelands why do they not set the example and define those homelands? But they know it is nonsensical. Here we have a process of consolidation and this will still last for an appreciable time, because one has to take into account all the interests concerned. One must take into account the interests of the farmers and of the Bantu in this process of consolidation. It is a natural process.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for East London (North) made one very unsavoury remark. He wanted to know whether a secret agreement perhaps existed between the Minister and Matanzima. I just want to tell him that I do not make myself guilty of that sort of thing and he should not voice such suspicions. The hon. member is an honourable man and I do not want to give him the reply he deserves, but there is no such thing. But remember that Matanzima was reported by the newspapers as having said these things, and I replied to them, and ten to one Matanzima had in mind those Bantu areas adjoining the Transkei, and that they would in time be added to the Bantu area. And that is our policy. Whether geographically they will be added to the Transkei now or later is a different matter, but it is obvious that in time they will all be linked with the Transkei, at least politically. That is the natural thing. I do not think anyone objects to it, but why sow all this suspicion against Matanzima? It is not fair.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). His second speech also surprised me to-day. He said a few things to which I want to reply. In the first place he asked whether the position of the Coloureds would be dealt with in the report of the Heckroodt Commission. I can only say that I have already instructed the Heckroodt Commission to investigate the position of the Coloureds also. I expected that this matter would have been finalized already, but I am still awaiting their report. But I want to say immediately that I cannot see <span class="col_6127-6128" refersTo="page_397"/>how there can be much difference in the approach to the position of the Coloureds from that of the Whites. The hon. member asked when a start would be made with the zoning of the non-White towns in the Transkei. I can only say that I appointed the commission and gave them instructions to start work as soon as possible. Where precisely they will start is their own affair. I give them a fairly free hand. I asked them to get together as soon as possible to decide on a <i>modus operandi,</i> and my further request to them was that they should give careful consideration to the interests of the Whites in the areas concerned. Now the hon. member is suddenly concerned about the interests of the Bantu. He is playing a political game. The fact is that I have already stated that the Secretary of the Interior is a member of that commission and he can represent those people, and it is obvious that everybody&#x2019;s interests will be taken into consideration. The commission will submit their recommendations to me and then I will take the final decision.</p>

<p>The hon. member again spoke about White capital and initiative. He knows what my policy is. The White Paper puts it clearly. But the matter about which we argue is this. He is always stressing the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission, but the fact is that the commission said that the industrialist who establishes an industry in the Bantu areas should hand it over to the Bantu after a few years. I then said that I had never yet met an industrialist who was prepared to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member should not drag Anton Rupert in here. He is not here to state his case. I asked the hon. member whether he would do such a thing, and he was not prepared to do so. While I sat on the Tomlinson Commission I had my doubts in that regard, because one will never find an industrialist who will build up a business and then hand it over to the Bantu [Interjections.] The hon. member says Anton Rupert would do it, but he has quite a different system. We want to preserve those areas for the Bantu. We have so often already said that one of the main things which cause racial conflict is the idea that the Whites exploit all the natural resources for themselves, and that is why we have to guard against it.</p>

<p>The hon. member again referred to Bantu authorities and asked why more such authorities had not yet been instituted. But the hon. member does not know what is going on. Practically all the large ethnic groups already have their territorial authorities, except the Zulus, and the Zulus already have so many regional authorities that I could start establishing a territorial authority to-morrow. The other groups all have them, with the exception of the Swazis, who form a small group and who prefer to work together with the Tsongas. The Deputy Minister has already replied to the other matters raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>I should now like to come to the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman). It is a pity that he is not here now, because he should really defend his standpoint. I do not even want to talk about the way in which he launched his attack, because it does not redound to the credit of a Member of Parliament who is also a lawyer. He said at Wepener that he wanted to warn the people of the Free State that the Government had decided that the whole of the conquered territory would be handed over to Basutoland. Can one imagine a responsible Member of Parliament making such a statement in public? It is very irresponsible. Apart from the fact that he tried to embarrass the Government, it is wrong to tell the people of Basutoland things like that. [Interjection.] The hon. the Prime Minister stated his standpoint very clearly, and anyone who wishes to draw a different inference from it does so maliciously and not honestly. The historic areas are determined in the Acts of 1913 and 1936. That is why we have always spoken about the historic areas. If we are to give this interpretation to it, what will then happen to South Africa? Every baboon will then be able to claim a place in South Africa. But the hon. member knows as well as any other hon. member in this House that the Prime Minister has always said that this establishment of Bantu areas merely grants recognition to an historical process. It is an historical process; history has resulted in those areas being there. It is not the National Party which put the Bantu heartland there. Now is it fair of a responsible Member of Parliament to make such a statement?</p>

<p>That hon. member has no manners. One should at least display some courtesy in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what the Prime Minister meant when he spoke about the difficult task in Natal. That is what he said. The hon. member should not forget that there are a number of Black spots in Natal which give us trouble to-day. Who are the people who oppose the removal of those Black spots? In many instances the fight is led by the United Party members. Now that we are removing those Black spots we are being opposed. But I want to mention another example. Certain United Party Members of Parliament and certain United Party Senators took it upon themselves to go and see whether they could not perhaps find a solution, whether they could not perhaps evolve a proper plan for Natal, and in the end they quarrelled so much that they just left the matter there and we never heard about it again. I refer to that group of people at Empangeni. They often got together; here I want to mention particularly the name of Senator Pretorius. They met repeatedly <span class="col_6129-6130" refersTo="page_398"/>but they could find no solution. That shows how difficult the position in Natal is. But I have no doubt that we will solve that problem also. We are not going to be deterred from clearing up those Black spots. I may just say that the Bantu everywhere are grateful to me for eliminating these Black spots. Look at the great fuss which was made here in regard to Besterspruit. There the position was that there was hardly any site where people had not been buried. But the people remained on those plots; they used the water available in the vicinity. A plague could have broken out. To-day the Bantu are grateful for what we did, but there are certain Whites who are ungrateful.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand, who has now come back, went further and quoted from a map which appeared in the <i>Burger</i> and the <i>Volksblad,</i> a map of the Tomlinson Commission. What is wrong with that map? The Tomlinson Commission merely indicated the possible methods whereby consolidation could take place. In order to obviate ambiguity we decided to draw a broad line, and not a fine line which would indicate the precise borders.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I have already dealt with that. It is unreasonable of an hon. member who is a lawyer to make such points. There is at least some logic in the law, but the hon. member has revealed no logic here; what he has said here is just petty politicking and nothing more. It is unreasonable of the hon. member to get on to a platform, as he did in Wepener, and to give the people there the assurance that the conquered territory would now be handed back to Basutoland. This sort of thing does not build up a party! The result is that those people are to-day ridiculing him. A responsible Member of Parliament cannot make such statements. Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition laughs about it. I can quite understand it. It is a sign of political bankruptcy.</p>

<p>I just want to pause to deal for a moment with the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). She said that we were developing the Bantu areas in all kinds of underhand ways, and that we were even opposing development in the White areas. She referred to Ladysmith and Utrecht, etc. I want to ask the hon. member whether she has read the latest report in regard to the development of the Tugela basin.</p>

<p>Then I cannot understand why the hon. member talks such nonsense here. What is more, Sir, do you know that the Whites of those areas came to see me in Durban and unanimously requested me to consider extending Msinga to the river; then they will be near enough for the development of a large industrial complex between Colenso and Ladysmith, and then Ladysmith and Colenso will not be burdened with the development of locations? It is a great saving to them. The people there unanimously requested this. It will also solve a great problem for me. Msinga is really one of our great problems. If we can develop a great industrial complex there, we will at the same time have employment for the people of Msinga, and then many of these difficulties there can be eliminated. All I said was that, in the light of these findings by this body in regard to the development of the Tugela basin and in the light of the wishes of the people there, I was busy investigating the whole matter to see whether we could not meet the wishes of those people. We have the hearty co-operation of all the bodies and all the people there, including the Natal Agricultural Union. Can you imagine, Sir, a Member of Parliament getting up here and blaming me for it? I thought the hon. member would get up and thank me &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Edenvale (Mr. G. H. van Wyk) raised the matter of a low rate of interest on the loan to Edenvale in connection with the removal of the Bantu in the location there. He also asked that a concession should be made in regard to the road giving access to it. This matter has already been submitted to me and it is receiving consideration. The Deputy Minister is giving special attention to it. We will see whether we cannot meet the wishes of the Town Council. But I want to take this opportunity of expressing a special <span class="col_6131-6132" refersTo="page_399"/>word of thanks to the hon. member for Edenvale. He went to a lot of trouble in regard to this matter. He did his best to get this matter solved, and I am grateful to him for it. I think we are now practically on the verge of finding a solution, but I shall do my best to see whether that concession cannot be made to Edenvale.</p>

<p>Then I just want to come to the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant). I am surprised to see all the people who are emerging as farmers&#x2019; representatives. I want to warn the hon. member that he should first make certain of his facts. It is not the first time that the hon. member has made such a bad blunder in this House. This is what happened. Those people asked me to buy the area. I refused. They first asked my predecessor, the hon. the Prime Minister, and he said that it would be considered if unanimity could be achieved. Eventually they were unanimous, and I then decided to buy that area. As usual, I negotiated with the farmers&#x2019; association, and they had no objection; they were quite satisfied. Eventually the question of the border line cropped up. The farmers&#x2019; association wanted the border line along the mountain. A number of these people wanted the border line to be below the mountain; they wanted the road to be the border. I asked the farmers&#x2019; association to meet these people again and to see whether a solution could not be found. They informed me that they had done everything in their power; that this was their proposal, and then the matter was finalized. I then asked the hon. member for Rustenburg (Mr. Bootha), seeing that he was going to Rustenburg, to get into contact with the farmers&#x2019; association and then to meet the people there, together with the representatives of the farmers&#x2019; association, to see whether they could not come to an agreement. I like to do what is in the interest of the majority of the people.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The farmers&#x2019; association took that decision, not the people there. I said there was a difference of opinion in regard to the borderline. I have had the experience of a mountain line being very dangerous. I had that experience in the Magaliesberge, near Rustenburg. The Bantu set fire to their veld and then the whole of the White area bums out. The position was so bad at Magaliesberg that I was eventually compelled to remove those Bantu and to make it a White area. The Whites simply could not farm there any longer. That is a lesson I learned there, and it was a very dear lesson. I then asked the hon. member for Rustenburg to get into touch with the farmers&#x2019; association and to meet the people there in order to see whether they could not achieve unanimity in regard to this matter. He went there but the agricultural union in Rustenburg simply turned their backs on him. They said they would not agree; that they had already made their recommendations. He met the people there and they were practically unanimous.</p>

<p>I discussed the whole matter with him and then decided that I would go there myself, together with my officials and a person who knows the country there very well, viz. Senator Combrinck. We inspected the whole place. We found that the people in the area were of the opinion that the road would be the most effective border, because there was a wire fence on both sides of the road. We discovered in the past that a road constitutes a very effective borderline. The road is not far from the mountain. We then made the road the borderline, and all the people are satisfied, except a few who live far outside that area. The people in the area are all satisfied; they all offered their land for sale. They are quite happy and I have had no complaint from any of them. How can the hon. member therefore make such allegations here?</p>

I am experiencing no difficulties. It is only a few members of the agricultural union who are dissatisfied because we did not accept their recommendations. I told them frankly that the agricultural union was not the only body whom I had to consider, but that the public and other bodies were also concerned in it. I must consult everybody, and not only the agricultural union. That is what some people cannot understand.

<p>Then the hon. member should not do such an ugly thing as to call somebody else a liar. He knows nothing about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) put a few questions to me. He asked me in the first place whether it was my policy always to keep the corridor open. The hon. member knows it is our policy to join up the White areas as far as possible. These matters are being reconsidered. In this regard the Eastern Cape Agricultural Union is cooperating splendidly. Their secretary visited me the other day and we discussed many of these matters. The hon. member also referred to the illegal squatting. I think that is a problem in the Eastern Cape which is fast being solved. We are, however, devoting attention to it continuously.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) asked whether it was fair that I should expropriate the land of the people at Peddie. I can just tell him this. A few farmers offered their land. The easiest method would have been to expropriate, and everything would have been completed, but then members of the agricultural union came to see me and said that they had certain problems and I must leave the matter there. That land is included in the Bantu legislation we passed. However, I listened to the representations of the agricultural union and took out that piece of land. We shall go into the whole matter again before taking any decisions. You see, therefore, Sir, that where it is in any way possible, I work together with the relevant bodies. In a few cases we proceeded to expropriate, more particularly because that would be in the interests of the persons concerned. Here and there were cases where we were compelled to expropriate, in spite of the feelings of the people concerned.</p>

<p>Do not ask such clever questions. The history begins in 1652. When we talk of the historical process and the Bantu areas which are determined by the historical process, those are the areas dealt with in the 1913 Act. They were delineated in that way in the Cape Province at the time, and also in the Free State. There was a special commission which delineated it in the Transvaal, and also in Natal.

The hon. member should advise his party to lay down their borders, and then they can reproach us. To a large extent the heartlands have been delineated, and there is no difficulty about that. A process of consolidation is in progress. It will take some time before it is completed. It is something which I do in consultation with the public which is interested in it. No political party can do more. It is unreasonable of the hon. member to sound the same discordant note continuously. That note has become so out of tune already that nobody listens to it any more.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity of putting a small matter right. I refer to the uncalled for attack made on me last Friday afternoon by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) when this Vote was under discussion. I regard his remarks as unnecessary interference with the affairs of the Marico constituency; he unnecessarily poked his nose into the affairs of that constituency. He said the following, <i>inter alia,</i> and I want to quote his exact words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If there are two members in this House whom I thought would have risen in their seats to participate in this debate, they are the hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) and the hon. member for Rustenburg (Mr. Bootha) because there is uncertainty and seething discontent in regard to the boundaries of the proposed Tswanaland in the constituencies of those two hon. members.</block>

<p>He then went further and launched a personal attack on me. I think it is necessary for me to put matters right in that regard because he said the following, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<p>I challenged the hon. member for Marico in the last recess to let me appear on platforms with him in that constituency to put two questions: &#x201C;Would he tell his constituents where the boundaries of Tswanaland are going to be?&#x201D; He was too afraid even to accept my challenge or to have me at any of his meetings, or any United Party member at his branch meetings to put that question, because he cannot answer it.</p>

There is consternation and frustration in his own mind; he is on the run; he is packing his bags to run away from Turffontein because he knows his party will not again nominate him as their candidate. We know that they have made him play second fiddle to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) as far as railway matters, on which he used to be the main speaker, are concerned.

<p>I only want to correct an allegation that has been made against me. It concerns the determination of the boundaries of the Tswana homeland in my constituency. In this connection he is supposed to have challenged me to appear with him on the same platform. The fact of the matter is that he asked me here in the Lobby whether he could appear with me on the platform when I held my series of meetings to report to my constituents in order to state his attitude and that of the United Party, that we should thus hold report meetings together. I summarily refused to have anything to do with it and said that nothing of the kind could be done, that the idea could not be entertained of having a Member of Parliament of the Opposition on a Nationalist platform when reporting to your constituents. I told him he could attend those meetings to ask questions. The hon. member also said I had refused to allow United Party members to attend our meetings. I can tell the hon. member that there have been more United Party members than Nationalists at some of my meetings and they passed a motion of confidence and not of no confidence in me, for example, at the meeting at Engelsberg.</p>

<p>Then I return to the allegations made under the Vote. He said there was seething discontent amongst the farmers in connection with the boundaries of the Bantu homelands. That is not so. What is indeed true, and I am realistic enough to admit this, is that individual farmers as well <span class="col_6137-6138" refersTo="page_402"/>as agricultural societies have, from time to time, discussed matters with me and said (just as the head committee of the Transvaal Agricultural Union said to the Minister), it would be a very good thing if the Minister would determine those boundaries; but that there is seething discontent is not true. All the Black spots in the Marico constituency have been removed, or are in the process of being removed, by way of consultation and negotiation and I have the assurance of the Minister in writing that no more farms are required in the Swartruggens and Marico districts for the establishment of homelands for the Tswanas. There have been negotiations right from the start and I acted as mediator between the farmers&#x2019; organizations, the party organizations and the Minister. I invited the then Deputy Minister, Mr. Mentz to meet the farmers throughout the constituency. He did so and there was general satisfaction. In the specific area to which the hon. member for Turffontein has referred the public gathered <i>en masse</i> and decided unanimously (and they put this to Deputy Minister Mentz) that not one additional morgen of land should be purchased. That was during 1960. Last year a few farmers again offered their farms. I invited the chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission, the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) to meet the farmers and we travelled through the whole constituency and had satisfactory discussions with the representatives of farmers&#x2019; unions. There was calm discussion of the boundary problem but nothing of the seething discontent to which the hon. member has referred. I can tell the hon. member that the Nationalists of Marico, like those of the whole country, have for a long time fought and waited for the policy of separate development to be carried out and they are willing to wait longer for it to develop completely. They are sensible enough to realize that no Government can at this stage immediately define permanent boundaries. There will be seething discontent and consternation if the Government were to fix boundaries that cannot be moved over the whole country to-day. The hon. member said he had a small farm in my constituency. That shows you that he is running away from Turffontein. He wanted to join the National Party, did he not? He probably wanted to avail himself of those meetings to introduce himself there, but what can the National Party do with a member of his calibre? He says even the position of his farm, which is about 30 miles from the Bantu border, is uncertain. He does not know how soon he will have a Black neighbour. Sir, that is the old story, because of the provincial council election next year the Bantu story is dished out to the people at every meeting that the entire area will form part of the proposed Tswanaland. It is the old story we have heard over and over again in Marico. Only recently three farms which were Black spots near the small farm which the hon. member wants to use as a springboard when he runs away from Turffontein, were removed. Would it be logical on the part of the Minister first to remove Black spots and then to declare the whole area a Bantu homeland? Surely that is ridiculous and illogical. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>May I ask for the privilege of the half hour, Sir? The hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) will in due course get a reply from another hon. member on this side. So far a great deal has been said in this debate by the Government side which amounts to this that the Government is running away from the implications of its policy whereas the Minister has said in this debate that he accepts the full implications of the apartheid policy of the Government. To give a few examples of how the Government is running about from the implications of its policy, when this side of the House repeatedly asked where the boundaries were going to be, the Minister posed a totally new question. He said: Surely the United Party accepts Bantu homelands; tell us where your borders are. But the Minister ought to know that in terms of the United Party policy borders are completely secondary. That they must be defined is not a prerequisite of our policy in which the emphasis is placed on the racial group and not on his area.</p>

<p>Before the Bantu can be led to freedom in separate states the borders have to be very clearly defined. This uncertainty about the borders can still cause the biggest eruption in this country. [Interjections.] The hon. member says it is nonsense but it is necessary to remind the hon. member of the philosophical words the Prime Minister used in January 1962 when he told us that separate states would have to be developed. Later in the same speech the Prime Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, when foreign nations were squashed together in one state it was an eternal cancer which caused the whole body to explode. We must realize that we have a parallel position here.</block>

<p>In the same speech the Prime Minister gave Africa as an example, Africa where they had obtained satisfaction in that states were created with clearly defined borders which did not cut across the area of other national states. It was not the United Party, therefore, who demanded that, but the Prime Minister himself. If we want separate states in this country we must have clearly defined borders which do not cut across other national areas. That statement very clearly tied the Government to the idea of separate states with separate freedoms but it recoils from the prerequisites to those states, namely, clearly defined borders. In reply to the hon. member for East London (North) (Mr. Field) the Minister said the question of the borders did not constitute any <span class="col_6139-6140" refersTo="page_403"/>problem at all; he had the fullest co-operation of the agricultural unions and farmers&#x2019; organizations. But what are the facts of the matter? At one agricultural congress after the other they ask that this matter be expedited. I have cuttings from what happened at every congress over the past few years. At every one of them the Minister was asked to determine the borders. I can quote from the <i>Landbou Weekblad</i> of two years ago to show that there is great uncertainty about the borders of the Bantu states. The <i>Burger</i> said: &#x201C;Bantu homelands: Farmers say they are confused.&#x201D; In 1962 when the Minister addressed the agricultural congress at Pretoria he said the borders could not yet be finally decided upon. It is obvious why people ask for the borders to be clearly defined but it is inexplicable why the Government refuses to do so. Do they lack the courage to tackle the matter? Separate states cannot succeed without clearly defined borders. While the Government is refusing to do anything about it Kaizer Matanzima is making one demand after the other, and the Government is conditioning the people of South Africa to accept a smaller South Africa while the Black nationalist of the Transkei is insisting on a bigger Transkei. Our Government does not say boo to a goose but Matanzima conditions his people to say they will not be satisfied with anything less than their historical areas.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron has obviously not read the election manifesto of Matanzima last year. I want to quote from the <i>Burger</i> of 30 October last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The area will gradually be divided until it is completely occupied by Bantu. Additional territorial areas which were previously occupied by Bantu will be incorporated, after consultation with the Republican Government, with the area of the Transkei. &#x201C;I refer to such areas like the districts of Queenstown, Lady Frere, Indwe, Maclear, Elliot, Ugie, Mount Currie, Harding and Port Shepston&#x201D; Tribal Chief Matanzima stated.</block>

<p>He said the same thing at an interview granted to a number of Pressmen in November last year. While he is saying that and making one demand upon another this Government is not doing anything; it does not say boo to a goose. It is indeed true that the Government announced earlier on that the question of land and borders would be decided upon by means of negotiations between the various Governments. They said there would be a round table conference. But the fact remains that the Government&#x2019;s chances of negotiating are getting smaller as the demands of the Xhosa become more insistent. Matanzima&#x2019;s demands will become stronger and the stronger he states them the more difficult it will become for the Government to refuse. I sincerely trust the Government and the Minister realize in what an embarrassing position they are placing our country because of their failure to come to a decision on this matter. Because of the way it has handled this matter the Government has roused a great deal of suspicion right from the start when they said it would be decided by way of a round table conference. I say it is a pity, and this question of borders is very dangerous to our race relations. It is absolutely necessary that the Government be warned. They made irresponsible promises and to-day they are irrevocably bound to them; they cannot back out. If there are border disputes in future the Government will be to blame. It is easy to envisage a serious state of affairs. We only trust that that will not become a reality.</p>

<p>But I wish to refer to another matter which deserves closer analysis, and which proves that the Government is running away from the implications of its policy. The Deputy Minister gave us figures in respect of the growth rate of the Bantu in the urban areas. He said the growth rate was 4.1 per cent in the cities from 1936 to 1946, 5.1 per cent for the period 1946 to 1951 and 4.2 per cent for the period 1951 to 1964. He also gave us the figures in respect of all the areas in South Africa. The Deputy Minister boasted about the fact that they have kept the figures constant but the United Party was in power during the period 1936 to 1946. The most serious charge against that regime is precisely that it allowed the White areas to be overrun by Bantu and today that period is held out as the period in which the position was ideal. They say the position to-day is more or less what it was during the period 1936 to 1946. The Minister says that although more Bantu have been employed proportionately more Whites have also been employed. But that does not prove that fewer and fewer Bantu have been employed. It only proves the irrefutable fact that we will always have them. For the purposes of Government policy, and in order to have any basis, they must state categorically that they do not want any Bantu in the White areas. If they say that the Government would at least be logical. (Dr. Scholtz also says that in his book.)</p>

<p>By way of interjection the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked the Deputy Minister what the position was in respect of agriculture and that he should give those figures but the Minister does not reply to that. Let us for a moment look at the increase on the platteland. Here I have the 1960 census figures, as given by the <i>Burger,</i> I just want to refer to a few places. Take Uitenhage. In 1951 they only had 16,900 Bantu there but in 1960 that figure had increased to 21,300. Take Klerksdorp. There the number had increased from 15,800 in 1951 to 28,500 in 1960. Take a place like Queenstown. There the number had increased from 14,000 to over 20,000. In Grahamstown the number had increased from 11,000 to 17,000. In Oudtshoorn the number of Bantu <span class="col_6141-6142" refersTo="page_404"/>increased from 1,171 to 1,900 and in Upington there was a fantastic increase. Why did he not mention that? The Minister knows that if there is one area in the country where the numbers are completely out of proportion it is the platteland because of the increase in the number of Bantu labourers because so many Whites have left. They are apparently satisfied that the position is under control in the Western Cape and the Deputy Minister tried to prove that by giving the figures in respect of the Cape Divisional Council area, but that is not the Western Cape. There are still 250,000 Bantu west of the Eiselen line, if we include their families. If the position is under control here why do some Nationalist Members of Parliament still agitate that the Bantu should be removed from the Western Cape so that it can be a purely White man&#x2019;s country? If the Minister thinks his figures are satisfactory, that they show the problem has been solved, and says there is no question of large-scale removal, we shall be very grateful to him because we know such a removal will create economic uncertainty. We know there are not sufficient other labourers to replace these people. I can refer to the figures of Professor S. P. Cilliers where he showed that there had been an increase in the number of Coloureds in the Western Cape over the past years as well as an increase in the number of Bantu. That shows that those people did not oust another racial group. One can therefore take it that if the Bantu are removed from here there will not be sufficient other labour. One can also expect other serious problems to arise in the reserves, because there is insufficient employment for them, and that great dissatisfaction and unrest will be created as a result of the removal of the Bantu from this area. For the sake of good race relations the Government should abandon that policy. We already see the signs that they cannot apply that policy without causing large-scale retrogression and stagnation in the Western Cape.</p>

<p>To give another example of the uncertainty regarding Government policy I wish to refer to its policy in connection with the Orange River. One member of the Nationalist Party says the Orange River complex should be free of all Bantu. The hon. member for Kempton Park said something similar and the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) told us as far back as 1962 that the Orange River complex should be free of Bantu. But having said that another Minister said the Bantu in the Western Province could assist with the Orange River scheme. It was the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs who said that in a speech at Aliwal North and while he was saying that a statement appeared in the <i>Burger</i> of 10 October last year that Coloureds would be given preference on the Orange River scheme. How do you understand that Sir? The one says there will not be any Bantu and the other one says all the Bantu of the Western Province should go there. If both Bantu and Coloureds are used who will be left in the Western Province to meet its needs? What is the policy of this Government regarding the Bantu in the Western Province and what is their policy going to be in respect of the Orange River scheme? I want to say this that if the Orange River scheme were to depend on the number of Coloured labourers available it would take 200 years to complete. The employment of Bantu in the White areas has been described as a parasitic policy. The hon. Minister called it the &#x201C;bushtick policy&#x201D;. The Bantu allows himself to be used according to his own free will. If they do not do that they simply cannot exist in the reserves. The Government must choose between making greater use of voluntary Bantu labour on the one hand or giving greater State assistance to these people so that they can make a living in their own areas. Which one does the Minister choose? The Government is opposed to economic integration in the White areas but at the same time they are doing precious little to assist the Bantu in their own Bantu areas. They apparently expect him to help himself. The assistance the Government is giving there to-day is tragically little and ineffective. If that is what they are doing how is it possible to carry out the policy of having separate states? How is it possible for the Government to remove these people from the White areas? How can the Government remove seven out of every eight farm labourers, six out of every seven on the mines and four out of every six in industry without lowering the standard of living of both White and Black, and economically that would spell chaos? Did Professor Tomlinson not predict that approximately 2,000,000 people would have to be taken off the land in the Bantu areas? What has happened to the 50,000 posts which should have been created annually in order to give them employment? That is a gigantic task and this Government has failed every year to perform it. It is impossible to have separate states without an independent economy. That can only be done if large-scale inroads are made on the ability and resources of the Whites and that would be detrimental to the country in every respect. In order to appreciate the magnitude of the task one must see it in the light of the implications and the repercussions of this policy of removing the Bantu from the Western Province. What do we find in respect of that policy? There has already been sharp reaction. Not only are the people locally sharply divided on this question but it is only sharply condemned east of the Eiselen line. Not only will stagnation follow here but the people east of the Eiselen line say they have no room for these Bantu. I want to read what Mr. Scholtz, the overseas editor of the <i>Burger,</i> wrote after he had travelled through the Transkei&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Last week at Umtata a senior official said to me:</block>

<p>&#x201C;You people in the Boland talk glibly about repatriating the Bantu but what must they do here? There is no work for them here.&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="col_6143-6144" refersTo="page_405"/>But hon. members say we must clear up this part of the world. In the <i>Burger</i> of 28 May 1963 they talk about the labour shortage in the fruit-growing industry and they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Farmers&#x2019; Association here have appointed a deputation to go and discuss the question of more farm labour with the Secretary for Coloured Affairs.</block>

<p>But they also want to remove the Bantu from this area. The removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape is only one small facet of Nationalist Party policy and that is already causing so much difficulty. How much more difficulty will not be created by making the Bantu areas viable and keeping those people there? So I can go on. Professor Cilliers asks who will do the work when these people are removed. I can also quote what the farmers&#x2019; associations on the other side of the line ask: &#x201C;Congress objects to the Removal to East London.&#x201D; Strong representations are made that the Bantu who are removed from the Western Cape should not come to that area because there is neither room nor work for them there. Then the Government tell us they are busy with a practical policy, a policy that can be carried out. If it is impossible for them to carry out this policy of moving the people how much more impossible will it not be for them to carry out the policy of greater apartheid in South Africa. I maintain that the policy of this Government will fail because of two irrefutable and contradictory facts, namely, the practical circumstances prevailing in the country which demand a sustained economic tempo of development in the White areas and the theoretical state this Government is creating for the Bantu in his own homeland, a state which is not viable. That is why the policy of this Government will fail and that is why the people will be obliged to accept a practical policy as the one suggested by the United Party.</p>

<p>I shall not say much about what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) said a moment ago because he talked a lot of nonsense. He alleged, for example, that all the Bantu were going to be removed from the Western Cape. But I leave him at that. There are other members on this side who are only too anxious to deal with him.</p>

<p>Sir, as you know, I represent a constituency in which there are many Bantu areas and it is obvious, therefore, that many White farms in that area border on those areas. For many years those farmers have wanted a proper fence between the White and non-White areas. When I talk about a proper fence I mean a vermin-proof fence. I know what I am talking about, Sir. I myself farmed on one of those border farms and I know the difficulties one has to contend with. The Bantu farmer has not yet developed a sense of responsibility. I am not saying that applies to all Bantu farmers but it applies to most of them. The result is that their stock, particularly their goats and sheep, graze wherever they want to. They come into the White areas and they destroy the gardens and agricultural lands of those White farmers. You can realize how strained the relationship is between the Bantu farmer and the White farmer in those circumstances. Such a fence would serve a dual purpose. In the first place such a fence will prevent the stock of the Bantu farmers from crossing over to the property of the White farmers, and <i>vice versa,</i> but in the second place such a fence will be a deterrent to stock theft. As the position is today it is very easy simply to uproot a number of iron standards, flatten the fence, and to chase your cattle over the fence and replace the iron standards but that will not be so easy in the case of a vermin-proof fence. That is much more obvious. In the second place I want to ask the hon. the Minister to erect such a fence at the expense of the Department of Bantu Administration. I shall tell you why I am asking that. The market value of farms bordering on Bantu area is less than the market value of farms which do not border on such areas, for the very reason I have just mentioned, namely, the continual crossing over of stock and stock theft. I go so far as to suggest that if Bantu Administration will provide the material the White farmers on the adjoining farms will erect the fence. Sir, every year we pass new laws in this House in an attempt to create a better relationship between White and non-White. Here we have a golden opportunity of doing so. If we erect such a fence there I am sure there will be hearty cooperation between White and non-White.</p>

<p>I am not going to reply to the hon. member for Kuruman (Mr. du Plessis). He asked that a fence be erected between White and non-White areas. I once had a neighbour who said one&#x2019;s best neighbour were 14 strands of barbed wire. The hon. member for Kuruman apparently also thinks that 14 strands of barbed wire is the best fence you can have between a White area and a Bantu area and between the farms acquired by the Department of Bantu Administration and the farms of White farmers. I can, however, tell him that irrespective of the number of barbed wire strands the fence has, the moment a farm is acquired by Bantu Administration for Bantu occupation the adjoining White farmers immediately also want to sell their farms.</p>

<p>But I want to return to the accusation levelled last Friday by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development at this party, namely, that the United Party was politically bankrupt as far as a Bantu policy was <span class="col_6145-6146" refersTo="page_406"/>concerned. He adopted the attitude that the best form of defence was attack. He asked why the United Party did not announce where their borders were going to be. Mr. Chairman, let me put it this way: The biggest catastrophe that can hit this country is for this Government to remain in power much longer. When this party comes into power we shall see to it that the necessary line of demarcation between White and non-White farms is established. That will be sufficient time to serve the hon. Minister with a reply to that sort of argument. I wish to return the ball to the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration. I want to accuse him and the Government of being politically bankrupt because a Government which establishes a Bantustan, as this Government did in the Transkei, and which continually assures both the Whites and the Bantu that that Bantustan will ultimately enjoy complete independence and which is not in a position to say where the borders are to be, is guilty of political bankruptcy. I want to go further. This sort of policy borders on political deception. I do not want to refer to the establishment of other Bantu areas; I want to take the Transkei as example, a Bantustan whose borders have not yet been defined although a Parliament has already been established there, a Parliament whose ministers have certain powers and who have been promised that they will ultimately be completely independent. Sir, if that does not border on political deception I do not know what political deception is. I want to go further. The hon. the Minister said&#x2014;and I refer specifically to the Transkei&#x2014;that the consolidation of the Bantu areas which was taking place there was being done with the co-operation of the White farmers. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether the farming community in the Transkei are the only people who should be taken into account in this regard? What about the big city of East London? Should the citizens of East London not be taken into account? When the hon. the Minister was asked whether the corridor around East London would remain open he gave the categorical assurance on behalf of the Government that that corridor would always remain open. He said the Government would do its best to see to it that it remained open. We are dealing here with a great city like East London and East London is entitled to an assurance from the Government that the corridor will be kept open but when the Minister is asked to give that assurance we get this negative reply from him that the Government will do its best in this connection. Does the hon. the Minister not think East London is entitled to demand that the corridor be kept open? Or must East London become an island surrounded by Bantu areas? Does the hon. Minister think that is the correct way to act towards the White people of East London? I want to take the argument further. To which group do these Bantu who are now being removed from the Western Province belong? Surely most of them are Xhosas; in other words, their homeland is either the Transkei or the Ciskei.</p>

<p>Surely it is Government policy to remove as many Bantu as possible from the Western Cape. In that case they have to go to either the Ciskei or the Transkei. Does the hon. Minister really think the Whites in that area should just take it for granted that the Bantu should be removed from the Western Province and sent to the Transkei or the Ciskei and that the corridor must ultimately disappear, because the hon. the Minister cannot give us the assurance that the corridor will remain open. The hon. the Minister repeatedly said that consolidation would take place in co-operation with the farmers&#x2019; associations, organized agriculture, and the Bantu. I want to know this from the hon. the Minister: What about the area which is not farming area? Must they just be satisfied? I go further and say that the people who are to be removed from the Western Cape and who have to go to the Ciskei or the Transkei are not only Bantu; they constitute the labour force of the Republic. They are human beings before they are labourers. They are also the people who assisted in bringing about the prosperity this country is enjoying at the moment. They constitute the labour force on which the prosperity of the whole country, particularly that of the White, rests. I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will give us the categorical assurance that for the sake of the city of East London he will see to it that the corridor will remain there, that it will remain a part of the White area and that East London will not become an isolated island. In conclusion I repeat that this policy of the Government, this policy of fragmentation, this policy of dividing the country and of cutting areas off the White area and adding them to the individual Bantu areas, is not a policy which the United Party can or will support. It is not necessary for the United Party, as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) has said, to draw border lines; it is the policy of the United Party to keep the 16,000,000 inhabitants of this country as close together as possible; people with a common loyalty to a common fatherland and not a divided loyalty to nine fatherlands.</p>

<p>We have for the past few days, and to-day again, been witnessing the final death throes of the United Party in this House. Hon. members of the Opposition are trying to make a final desperate attempt to thwart the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development and to put the last spanner in the works of the separation of residential areas here in the Republic of South Africa. Sir, the Opposition have failed completely, and the nation has rejected them completely. They have been rejected not only by the White people of the country, but also by the non-Whites. The National Party at the present time is emancipating the non-White races in this country, without the chaos that accompanies this process of emancipation in <span class="col_6147-6148" refersTo="page_407"/>other parts of Africa. Here in the Republic of South Africa we are now building up a new nation, and the Opposition are embittered because they are not sharing in this building up of this nation. We have for many years been struggling here in South Africa with this problem of race relations, and at the moment we are achieving fame in the world; we are proving to the world that we have a solution to this thorny problem. As against that, the United Party on the other hand are making belittling, disparaging remarks about the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development because they realize that the Government is now solving this problem in an orderly, peaceful way. They are jealous of that, because they realize we are finding a solution to the problem of peaceful co-existence. Sir, the nation has chosen, and the nation has chosen the way of separation. The people have chosen that there should be separation between the various races here in the Republic of South Africa, but instead of helping the Government the United Party is busy sowing suspicion and whipping up the emotions of the people outside. Instead of helping the Government, hon. members come along here with the kind of speech we had to listen to a moment ago. The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) has asked that the boundaries of the Bantu areas should be fixed. Sir, surely that is only a minor part of the great problem we are faced with. Instead of helping to solve the problem, he wants to drag us further into the mud. I want to tell the Opposition to-day that we no longer need their assistance, because we ourselves are busy solving that problem without their assistance. When the world accepted the policy of equality of nations, when it said that there had to be equality between all people on earth, we realized that we would have to heed the call and the demand of the Black man to be emancipated. The Black man also has certain national aspirations. We realized that if we wished to do justice to the Black man and simultaneously wished to protect the White man in the Republic of South Africa, we definitely could not adopt the policy of equality of the United Party. Being prepared to accept the policy of territorial separation, we at the same time secured the future of the White man here in the Republic. I should like to tell the Opposition to-day that the greatest step forward we have witnessed in the Republic was the recent opening of the Parliament of the Transkeian Government. I should like to say thank you this afternoon, on behalf of the people outside, to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and all his officials who had a hand in that great step forward. We have taken a step here for which posterity will be thankful to us, because we are establishing racial peace here in the Republic of South Africa. I enjoyed the privilege of attending the opening of the Transkeian Parliament, and I should like to tell hon. members of the Opposition that the Bantu in the Transkei are imbued with the idea of building on the foundation laid by this Government, for the benefit of the inhabitants of that territory. When we as Whites are helping to bring about this process of emancipation without chaos being created, it is treachery on the part of the Opposition to try to put this last spanner in the wheel of territorial separation. I want to tell them that they can no longer stop this wagon; the wagon is going on; the inhabitants of the Transkei have accepted territorial separation. They regard it as the only solution; they regard it as the only way to be followed if they wish to achieve something of value to themselves.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) referred to the figures quoted here by the hon. the Deputy Minister. The hon. the Deputy Minister has stated here that he would like to refer to the state of affairs in 1948 when the United Party was in power, and he then compared the position under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime with the position under the regime of the Nationalist Government. I should like to ask the hon. member whether he can compare the industrial development that took place before 1948 with the industrial development that has taken place under this Government. Sir, if their policy had to be applied today, what chaos would there not have been in the Republic of South Africa! I should like to read what has been said by a prominent person who knows something about Bantu administration in this country (translated)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unfortunately the policy prior to 1948, except for the corner-stones laid by the late General Hertzog in 1936, was so vague, watered down and discouraging to the official striving to find a solution to our racial problems, that it gave rise to the utmost frustration. Fortunately the present Government since 1948 formulated and defined a policy, gradually and with singleness of purpose, which can to-day be pursued without despair.</block>

<p>This policy we have pursued will see to it that there will be racial peace in this country. It is a policy which will ensure that White and non-White will be able to live together in peace and in harmony in this country. I should like to put this question to hon. members opposite who refer to the establishment of border industries so disparagingly: Is it not a fact that the Government is busy developing the Transkei to the utmost? Is it not a basic fact that one first has to reclaim and build up the agricultural land of the Transkei? Is this Government not now developing the agricultural areas of the Transkei into one of our best agricultural regions in the Republic of South Africa? Is it not a fact that all the other things will then automatically follow? But the United Party wishes to create chaos there at the present time. They desire border industries to come into existence overnight, and that factories should be established overnight in the Transkei, without the Bantu having acquired the requisite knowledge and skill. This Government <span class="col_6149-6150" refersTo="page_408"/>will solve the current problems without the co-operation of the United Party. They are merely jealous because they had no share in this tremendous step forward taken by the Government. I should like to tell the Opposition that the world will still come to us to learn how to live together in peace in a multiracial country such as South Africa, and we shall gladly give that recipe to the outside world.

<p>Let me amend that then by saying &#x201C;the hon. gentleman&#x201D; who represents Marico (Mr. Grobler). Before I reply to the hon. member I would like to say that I appreciate the explanation to-day by the hon. member for Rustenburg (Mr. Bootha). But at the same time in offering that explanation the hon. member said that he had his doubts about the evidence which I had placed before this Committee on Friday when I said that there was discontent and dissatisfaction amongst organized agriculture at the attitude which is at present adopted by the Minister. Sir, I wanted to spare the hon. member for Rustenburg this evidence in the debate on Friday but in view of the fact that he has now doubted my words I wish to place this evidence before the Committee and tell the Committee what document I was quoting from. I quoted from a memorandum submitted by the District Agricultural Union of the hon. member&#x2019;s own constituency to the Bantu Affairs Committee of the Transvaal Agricultural Union. I am sure the hon. member will not be pleased now when I tell him what organized agriculture, representative of all farmers&#x2019; associations in his constituency, think of the attitude which the hon. gentleman adopted in respect of this very important matter. Sir, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency as well as in the Marico constituency in regard to the fixing of the boundaries of the proposed Tswanaland. I just want to quote one or two extracts from this memorandum submitted to the Transvaal Agricultural Union on 30 October last year. They refer here to the undertaking which was given by the hon. the Minister in October 1960 that before the boundaries were fixed for these proposed Bantustans he would take into consideration the views of organized agriculture, and that the consolidation of these areas would take place on a basis of co-operation with the farmers in the areas concerned. This is what the Rustenburg District Agricultural Union says in that regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Intussen het die Distrik-landbou-unie weer met die betrokke boereverenigings onderhandel en is &#x2019;n ander aanbeveling gedoen wat in ooreenstemming was met die Departement se sienswyse.</block>

<p>In other words, they arrived at an agreement with the Minister&#x2019;s officials in regard to the fixing of the boundaries of the proposed Tswanaland in the Pilansberg area. Then they go on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Voordat hierop &#x2019;n antwoord ontvang was het die plaaslike L.V. in opdrag van die Minister ontvang om te kyk of hy &#x2019;n skikking kon kry.

<p>Sir, that fully substantiates the point I made that the Minister was ignoring the views of organized agriculture and making use of Government members in an attempt to get what he wants, and that is to fix the proposed boundaries of the Tswanaland homeland unilaterally, both in the released areas and outside of the released areas. Sir, if there is any doubt about that I want to ask the hon. member for Rustenburg why when the Minister went on a personal inspection of this area he ignored him, the public representative of the area concerned. The Minister did not even take the hon. member for Rustenburg with him when he made this personal inspection; he took Senator Combrinck with him. Why did the Minister not take the hon. member for Rustenburg with him? Because the hon. the Minister knows that the hon. member for Rustenburg has been completely discounted by all agricultural unions&#x2026;[Interjection.]</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Marico says that I must not poke my nose into the affairs of his constituency. Let me tell the hon. member that I sat here in this debate waiting for him to raise this matter in the debate in the interests of his constituency, but since he failed to do so I raised the issue across the floor of this House at the request of members of the hon. member&#x2019;s own party, at the request of members of his own <i>Dagbestuur.</i> They know that it is quite useless to come to the hon. member for Marico because he simply says &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to every view expressed by the hon. Minister. The hon. member tries to cover two sides of the picture here to-day. He says it is unrealistic not to recognize that there is a demand that the boundaries of the proposed Tswanaland should be fixed so as to remove the uncertainty in the minds of the farmers in that area. He therefore by this statement admits there is discontent. He refers to the visit of a former Bantu Affairs Commissioner. Mr. Mentz was there on one occasion. Why did Mr. Mentz go there to inspect the position? The hon. member was not even a member of this House at the time. I know very well why Mr. Mentz made that inspection? He went there because there have been numerous promises in the past by the Minister&#x2019;s Department to remove those Black spots like Stephaniakraal and Selonstat. Undertakings to the effect were given at the time. Have any steps been taken? Why have no steps been taken? For the simple reason that there is a strong rumour in the district that the proposed boundary of Tswanaland is going to take in some of the best farming land in the area surrounding these Black spots. And the hon. member for Marico knows this. But will he get up to defend those boundary lines here? Of course not, because that will affect his party&#x2019;s standing. [Interjections.] I challenge the hon. member to appear with me on the platform at any meeting in that area and to tell the people where the proposed boundary of Tswanaland is going to be. Why did the hon. member not hold any public meetings last year? Because of the seething discontent in his area; he cannot face the people of his own constituency. The hon. member talks about United Party members attending meetings; I was present at a certain meeting of the Agricultural Union of the district in which the hon. member himself farms. In my presence he got telephone calls to come and attend that meeting because the farmers wanted to know what the position was but the hon. member said he could not attend the meeting.</p>

<p>I hope that disposes of the hon. member. I now want to return to the hon. the Minister. [Interjections.] I know the hon. member for Marico is concerned about a certain gentleman who wants to stand for the nomination against him. What he is trying to do here is to set his own position right. I can tell you the name, Sir, but I do not want to drag his name across the floor of this House.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>After all this hullabaloo in which nothing was actually said, I think it is necessary for us to state this matter in clear language so that we may know what really happened in Marico and Rustenburg. In the first place that memorandum to which reference has been made is one which we do not have at our disposal. It appears to be a memorandum which was sent to the Agricultural Union of the Transvaal by a certain branch. That is what I understand. Let me now put it clearly: There have for several years been negotiations in regard to the Pilansberg area. It extended over a period of three to four years. There was an investigation during the time of Mr. Mentz. Agreement was then arrived at between the Department and the farmers of Pilansberg and the District Union, in which the hon. member for Rustenburg (Mr. Bootha) had a large share, because those people had confidence in him. It was through his mediation that an agreement was reached. That agreement was embodied in legislation last year, when that area was declared a released area by means of legislation in this House. If the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) wishes to make the allegation he made here this afternoon, the proper time to have done so would have been last year when that area was declared a released area. But at that time the hon. member apparently did not yet have that memorandum at his disposal, on which he has now built up a false case. However, I have heard that in the meantime he has acquired a small piece of land in that area and it seems to me he is now trying to set afoot an agitation there in order to get rid of his small piece of land.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not weak; it is the truth. When one speaks the truth, the hon. member can only laugh it off. As regards the Marico district, I can testify this afternoon that, apart from the Mentz inquiry of several years ago, I made a tour of the whole district last year, at the invitation of the hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler). I visited all the places and held meetings. I held meetings together with the farmers&#x2019; associations, and I submitted a full report to the Minister. I did not come across any dissatisfaction anywhere. Representations were made for the purchase of certain farms and the excision of other farms. We investigated that matter and submitted a report.</p>

<p>As regards the elimination of Black spots, I may just say that most of the Black spots in the district of Rustenburg have already been eliminated. The hon. member referred to Selonstat. The hon. member does not even know that Selonstat ceased to be Bantuland a long time ago already. The hon. member is not even aware that that Black spot has already been eliminated and that the Bantu inhabitants <span class="col_6153-6154" refersTo="page_410"/>are to be placed in a Bantu area. I know what is going on in the Rustenburg area at present. There is a certain farmers&#x2019; association whose chairman is a member of the United Party. That chairman is extremely anxious to sell his farm to Bantu administration. Those United Party members just cannot have their way, because in regard to both the Mentz Report as well as the report I submitted to the Minister last year, the Minister said he was not interested in purchasing those White farms for a Bantu area. That is the reason for the agitation in which the hon. member also participated this afternoon. I think it is wrong to do so for the benefit of a small group of people who wish to sell their land to Bantu administration. We are not interested in that land. Now the hon. member for Turffontein makes charges against the hon. member for Rustenburg and the hon. member for Marico. He says now that they are so unpopular in their districts. I went around, as I have said, Mr. Chairman, and nowhere did I find any signs of that unpopularity. In fact, the farmers&#x2019; associations did not go over the heads of those two hon. gentlemen in any way. That shows the great confidence they have in those two hon. members. I hope this is the last we shall hear of the story of the hon. member for Turffontein.</p>

<p>In view of the importance of the portfolio of Bantu Administration and Development I think the ignorance the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has displayed is tragic to behold. He says the reason why I have raised the question of the extent to which the hon. the Minister consults organized commerce in determining the boundaries of proposed Bantustans is because of the fact that I have a farm in that area. The hon. member said he toured the area last year but my farm is 55 miles away from the area we are discussing at the moment. The hon. member says he knows all about Selonstat. He said he was there last year. He says all the Bantu of Selonstat are already inside a Native area. That is an amazing piece of news, Sir, I am quite sure even to the hon. member for Marico. Selonstat falls in his constituency. As far as I am aware Selonstat is very much alive and kicking, so is the captain and so are all the Bantu in the area concerned, so is the school which has something like 180 pupils. I can tell the hon. member quite a lot about Selonstat. But he makes a wild statement to the effect that the majority of the Natives are inside Native areas. The hon. member obviously knows nothing about the workings of the Department. Then the hon. member for Heilbron tried to save the faces of the hon. members for Rustenburg (Mr. Bootha) and Marico (Mr. Grobler) by making the wild statement that what I raised here to-day was simply in regard to the discontent expressed by the chairman of a certain small farmers&#x2019; organization who belonged to the United Party. What I quoted were the views of the Rustenburg &#x201C;Distrikslandbouunie&#x201D;, according to the hon. member for Heilbron, the views of a small discontented farmers&#x2019; association. If the hon. member knew anything about organized agriculture he ought to know that the &#x201C;Distrikslandbou-unie&#x201D; had as many as 30 to 50 branches. Let me quote again the heading to the memorandum&#x2014;</p>

It means that the Minister has not got a policy in regard to fixing the boundaries of the Bantustans. There has to be uncertainty. The Minister dare not say where they are going to be placed because the Prime Minister may disagree with him. Nobody knows. My province is only one example.

<p>I did not propose to speak, but so many wrong things are being said that I feel constrained to rise. The hon. member becomes as excited as I sometimes become when he raises my ire. The questions he puts are so foolish and senseless. Surely the Government cannot be expected to delegate its powers to a humble farmers&#x2019; association. Surely it is very clear that the advice of the farmers&#x2019; associations is called for, in the same way that the advice of a Member of Parliament is asked, but it does not mean that a farmers&#x2019; association has the right to take a decision which is like the law of the Medes and the Persians. The hon. member now wants the hon. the Minister to give an assurance that he will act in terms of the decision of a farmers&#x2019; association. I then asked by way of interjection whether the Minister should also accept the decision, although it may be against the wishes of some members. He then replied in the negative.</p>

<p>What happened is this: The farmers&#x2019; association fixed a boundary across the mountains. A hundred members then signed a petition in which they asked that the recommendation of the farmers&#x2019; association should not be accepted because of the difficulty of controlling a boundary across a mountain top. What was the Minister to do then? Should he have satisfied the 100 dissatisfied members, or should he have followed the views of the farmers&#x2019; association or should he have tried to do something in order to get co-operation? It should be remembered that the Farmers&#x2019; Union is used for the very reason that its members belong to both parties, and in order to achieve agreement between the groups when land is purchased, namely those who wish to sell and those who do not wish to sell. The Farmers&#x2019; Union is not consulted because of their wonderful knowledge, but in order to secure the co-operation of both groups, otherwise it may begin to look like a party matter. The Minister consulted the Agricultural Union. But when the members of the Agricultural Union take the field against their own Agricultural Union, must the Minister sit still or should he try to obtain co-operation? The hon. member said on Friday that the Minister sent an agent to the Agricultural Union there. That agent was of course I.</p>

<p>I accept that, because I did not go there as Member of Parliament; I went there as a delegate of the Minister. I went to see whether the group who signed the petition and the District Agricultural Union could not come to an agreement. The District Agricultural Union adopted the point of view adopted by the hon. member for Turffontein now, namely that they are the boss, and what they say is the law of the Medes and the Persians and everybody must subject themselves to that. That was the attitude they adopted. They did not attend that meeting. I reduced to writing everything that happened between me and the farmers and between the farmers and the Agricultural Union. They must always regard the Agricultural Union as the body they have to consult. That was proved in every discussion and in <span class="col_6157-6158" refersTo="page_412"/>every letter. The Agricultural Union has those letters in its possession. We then met. Those who did not wish to sell stated their case and voting took place on it. Those who wished to sell moved their motion, and voting took place. The two groups voted together and there was not a single dissenting vote at that meeting. At the commencement of the meeting I protected the Agricultural Union and said that after the decision was taken, the Agricultural Union would make a proposal and explain it, but that no vote would be taken. I said that their resolution, together with the explanation, would be submitted to the Minister as it stood. I wanted to avoid having the members of the Agricultural Union who signed the petition voting against their own organization. I merely wanted an explanation as to why they desired to have a boundary across a mountain. That explanation, together with the decision of the Agricultural Union, was then submitted to the Minister by me. Does that seem such a corrupt business to the hon. member? Does that look like the act of a stupid person?</p>

Because of the schism between the Agricultural Union and its members, I was asked to try to bring about agreement. I hope the hon. member understands that now.</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>There is one section of the community which must rely on a reliable labour source in order to maintain a decent standard of living. That is, of course, the dairy farmer. Over the last few years the dairy farmer has been plagued by unrealistic prices laid down by the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. He is now going to be plagued by the new action to be taken by this Minister under the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill which is going to interfere with his labour. When we discussed the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill in this House the hon. the Deputy Minister did not give us a satisfactory reply on questions in relation to labour, particularly the labour of the dairy farmer. He did not satisfy me or the country as a whole, I think, as to the availability of labour for agriculture in two respects. Firstly, from the angle of the farmer and secondly from the angle of the Bantu himself. He did not tell us where he was going to put the Bantu; he did not tell us how he was going to accommodate the Bantu and their cattle and families.</p>

<p>Let me deal with the problem of the dairy farmers. The unrealistic prices have made it very difficult for him to make ends meet. Many of them have gone insolvent and some have had to sell out in order to save themselves from going insolvent. Whole herds have been disposed of and they have taken up other types of farming. Those who have kept going are now faced with the difficulty of labour. The hon. the Deputy Minister tried to pooh-pooh the idea that they were experiencing any labour difficulties. I pointed out to him that in some parts of the country they were already having labour problems and I pointed out that that was proved by the fact that this Government had erected farm prisons so that farm prison labour could be available to farmers. I think we are the only country in the world in which prisoners are used as farm labourers. I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question. I want him to reply to it and not the Deputy Minister. My question is this: Will the hon. the Minister tell us that he will see to it that the farmers of this country, particularly the dairy farmers, have a regular supply of good labour, that that supply will be constant without any interference by his Department? In a statement by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Development we were told that the Department was going to do away with all tenant labourers within seven years and that in future all labour would have to be recruited through the labour bureaux. I pointed out that the farmer wanted to recruit his own labour. He does not want to take any labour offered to him, labour that may be unsuitable. The dairy farmer is a specialist; he must have regular labour, labour that likes that type of work and labour that is prepared to work in all weathers and be available always. He must have labour every day for milking purposes and for the delivery of his dairy products. Unlike many people in this country who seem to think so, including the hon. the Deputy Minister, it is not every Native who can handle dairy stock. Thousands of Natives have not the first idea of how to handle a dairy cow. It is essential for dairy farmers not only to have a constant supply of labour, but specialized labour, labour that will remain in his employ for a long period. On top of that it is essential that his labour is so organized that he produces the bulk of his own food to-day. At the prices he is allowed for his products it is quite impossible for the dairy farmer to feed his stock on purchased food. He has to produce the bulk of his food, if not all of it. If he has to try to produce that food with poor labour handed out to him by these labour bureaux, he will find that he will be forced out of business quicker than ever. What affects the dairy farmer affects the whole country. We know what has happened in the past. We have had to import butter and cheese and what does that cost the consumer? As from to-day the price of cheese and butter is going up in this country considerably because the products now being supplied have been imported from hard currency countries.</p>

<p><span class="col_6159-6160" refersTo="page_413"/>In that debate the hon. the Deputy Minister did not reply to the question where he was going to accommodate all these Natives who were to-day on the farms with their families and their stock. I want to ask the hon. the Minister where he is going to put these Natives and their families and stock? Will they be forced to get rid of their stock? We hear to-day that farm labour does not receive very high cash wages but their stock is at least running on good land. The Natives cultivate sufficient crops to feed their families well over the year. They cannot take their cattle to the reserves as the reserves are already overstocked. I doubt whether they will be allowed to take any of their stock into the reserves. I would like the hon. the Minister to reply to this question: What are they going to do, also in regard to the families? What are they going to do about hospitalization for those families? To-day where they are on European farms and hospitalization is required, they are adjacent to European areas and adjacent to hospitalization, and the European farmer sees to it that the families and children get the necessary treatment. If they go further into these reserves who is going to look after them in these already overcrowded reserves, reserves which are already eroded through soil erosion? Practically every reserve I know of is overcrowded, and, as I said, the over-stocking is something that leads to a lot of trouble. And if they have to reduce stock, there is immediately an upheaval among the Bantu. I would like the hon. the Minister to give us a full reply on these questions, particularly in regard to those two main questions of fundamental principle, firstly where is he going to accommodate these Natives? He says he cannot even get rid of small Black spots to-day because he has not got more land to accommodate them. How is he going to accommodate these tens of thousands of Natives with their families and their stock? Secondly, how is the farmer going to be able to teach and train his labour properly, especially the dairy farmers who are already getting uneconomic prices, and who in many instances are facing ruin? If there is going to be further interference with these people by them having to accept any labour that is meted out to them by a Department that does not understand their labour problems at all, many will have to throw in the towel.

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) uses the labour problem as a pretext for retaining squatters on the farms. The whole tenor of his speech was that he desires that there should be as many squatters and labour tenants as possible, which incidentally is the most expensive kind of labour and frequently is the most inefficient labour. He is keen to retain them on the farms. But now he does not tell this committee that that is what he desires. No, he uses the pretext of the labour problem; he hides behind the labour problem in order to keep the squatters and the labour tenants there. I wish to tell the hon. member if he will only read the report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Depopulation of the Rural Areas, he will see that the great problem is not rural depopulation but rural blackening (becoming Black) and this Government, and this Minister is now implementing the new labour policy and the new labour pattern to put a stop to that. Hon. members cannot have both things simultaneously. Hon. members rise here and accuse the Minister and the Government and allege that the Bantu are not being removed from the White areas fast enough. They point out that the numbers continue to increase. And then the next speaker rises, as the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) did, and says: &#x201C;No, they must stay, because this is the labour we wish to keep there.&#x201D; One cannot have both things simultaneously. You must decide what stand you are going to take. Mr. Chairman, I doubt whether we should be so concerned about the labour problem. I should like to mention an example: The wool-growers of South Africa have for years been struggling with the problem of shearing. They could not secure the right type of labour to do the shearing, and the only solution found was to establish a proper system of organized shearing teams, which do this work in the form of migrant labour. So the sugar farmers may do the same thing in the sugar-cutting season, and they are doing so already. The farmers who have to harvest cotton, and who surely also have a season, could manage to do the same thing. Very few of these kinds of jobs cannot be done in the same way. Even in connection with dairy farming you can get migrant labourers who will be prepared to leave their land for six months and sometimes longer, especially the young Bantu, to go and work for a proper wage. I think it is necessary for us to tell the farmers of South Africa that the best and most efficient labour is not the labour tenant, not the squatter, but a man who knows that he will receive his wage for every day&#x2019;s work, because then he completes a day&#x2019;s work and he sees to it that he works full-time. I do not think we should become too obsessed with that problem.</p>

<p>I really rose to discuss another matter here. The United Party is always worried that race relations will be disturbed. What is the greatest wrong in South Africa which gives rise to the breakdown and disturbance of race relations? It is when a political football is made of the Bantu problem. I should now like to charge the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) with having made himself guilty of that again to-day. He went along and interfered in the political quarrel between Poto and Matanzima. For instance, he tried to drag in the election manifesto of Matanzima. This habit of continually making a political football of the Bantu, a bone of contention, so that he does not know whether the White man wishes to take him in South Africa, is the greatest cause of doubt and chaos and has given rise to the position in which the White man in the whole of Africa has landed himself, because the Black man has never known <span class="col_6161-6162" refersTo="page_414"/>where he is being led. Now the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) comes along and tries to drag across the floor of this House the recent election, an election of the Transkei, with two political parties, in order to make a political football of it. Do hon. members opposite not think they should put their hands in their own bosoms and tell the English language Press to keep out of the political quarrels of the Transkei, and that they should not prepare speeches for Poto and incite him to fight with his own people there rather than subject himself to the constitution of that territory? I should like to put it clearly: These hon. members of the United Party again want to make the borders of the area of the Transkei a political ball. The hon. member for East London comes along with a corridor story, and another hon. member says that the Bantu do not know where to turn. They should go and look at the Transkei Act, then they will see that the boundaries are properly defined there. But when we refer to these boundaries, whose sins are they? Is it not perhaps one of the greatest sins perpetrated in 1936 to some extent, that some areas were released without proper planning? I should like to give an example. In my own constituency there are Daggakraal, Vlakpoort and Driefontein, and then the released area between Piet Retief and Pongola. When I look at Daggakraal and Vlakpoort, they are areas which were specifically released in 1936; they were the property of the Schlesinger company, and the land there was sold throughout the years on a hire-purchase system. When the people were unable to make the final payments, the holdings were repossessed and then resold to another purchaser on the hire-purchase system. In this way they began to settle numerous squatters on the smallholdings sold there. But worse still, one is there faced with the difficult position that in Daggakraal and Vlakpoort, the two which are contiguous, there are three different ethnic groups. There is a South Sotho group in that area, as well as a Swazi group and a Zulu group. That was the unplanned and ill-considered manner in which things were dealt with in the past, and that is one of the problems we have inherited. We are still bound by the 1936 Act which provides that before you can put these places right, you have to acquire compensatory land. Now I cannot expect the Ermelo constituency or the Standerton constituency to give me compensatory land because my area has to be rendered White. I am mentioning this problem so that the committee may realize the magnitude of the problem, and that one cannot just move farms around in the way in which one can move cattle about. Here you are dealing with people with ideals, and if for instance you wish to take away the people of Daggakraal or Vlakpoort, you have to have regard to the fact that you will have to take the Basutos presently living there to a Basuto area, where they can once again join their ethnic group. But this still means that in the Transvaal you are making an area White, and you have to go and look for compensatory land in the Free State. These are all the thorns of this prickly pear you are dealing with here. So let me say this, that hon. members such as the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) who ought to be aware of all the problems, merely come along and raise the dust here in putting the matter in such a way that they may make some political capital out of it. The hon. members ask what assistance we are giving for the development of the Bantu areas. That is what they are saying here in the cities. But in the rural areas the hon. member for Turffontein and the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) go along and say: &#x201C;See, the Government have now become negrophiles (kafferboeties), they want to do too much for the Bantu.&#x201D;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry to tell the hon. member for Wakkerstroom that I find myself obliged to do, what he calls &#x201C;stof opskop&#x201D; in connection with a matter that I had hoped the hon. member would raise, and that is the position of certain Bantu in certain areas of the Northern Transvaal. About a month ago there were reports circulating in the Press, more specifically in what the hon. member referred to as the &#x201C;Engelstalige pers&#x201D; about the conditions of hunger and privation which were worse than they have been for 25 years in that area of the Northern Transvaal and the statement by certain authorities in Pretoria that large parts of the district were permanently depressed and large-scale action was needed to rehabilitate them, and that the temporary measures instituted up to now were inadequate, that the problem should be tackled at the root, and that the drought was the worst in five years of successive droughts. According to this quotation &#x201C;&#x2018;starvation in some parts is the fearful possibility which has to be faced especially amongst those African families where no wages are coming in&#x201D;, and that furthermore the need for hunger relief measures would be greater than ever this year, because up to 90 per cent of the African crop in some of these areas in the Northern Transvaal had been destroyed as a result of the drought. And this was confirmed by a discussion of the Transvaal Agricultural Union Congress in Pretoria, about 10 April of this year. This being a rather serious matter, about which we have heard before, and about which I satisfied myself as recently as 16 months ago, I asked the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development a question on 24 April drawing his attention to this particular report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> asking whether he had received reports, etc. He said: Yes, he had received reports about the existing drought conditions in certain areas. He said he was in the Northern Transvaal the week before, that is the week before 24 April <span class="col_6163-6164" refersTo="page_415"/>and that he had discussed the matter with chiefs of the Venda national unit and that he had seen officials of his Department, and then he went on to say &#x201C;a Press statement will be issued shortly&#x201D;. That was on 24 April and to my surprise, having received that reply in Parliament on Friday morning at about 10.30, when the newspapers the following morning Saturday 25 April came out, they carried a statement by the hon. the Minister, a statement which he should and could have given this House at that time. Surely Parliament had the right to this information, and even if the hon. the Minister did not want to give it to me for political reasons, he owed this Parliament the same statement that he made on the same day to the Press for general publication. However, this is a lengthy statement which consists, in my view, of a mass of generalizations about the aged, the sick and the disabled who are getting help, and informing us that certain peoples and instances in South Africa had exploited the situation and had blackened South Africa&#x2019;s good name, and that the system of assistance of his Department had been so effective that there was little hardship and that the old cause of illness, namely dietary habits had claimed its victims, and so on. Having received this kind of public reply from the hon. the Minister, I put another question on the Order Paper on Tuesday 5 May because it stood over from the previous Friday, and I asked for details about how many adults were being helped, how many children, and so on, how many schools were being supplied with food, how many pupils were being fed. I got a very lengthy answer and it was again a mass of generalizations: There were no statistics kept about the people who were getting assistance under the system of assistance of his Department. But when you talk of a system of assistance, you assume that system includes such a thing as a cost structure, how many people have to be provided with food, how much money is available for the purpose? Depending upon the circumstances in each case, assistance was being rendered&#x2014;a two-page answer, but no reply to my question: What are the names of the people and instances in South Africa referred to in the Press statement of the Minister who were exploiting the situation? You know what the hon. Minister said to me? He said &#x201C;the hon. member is referred to Press reports in certain newspapers in South Africa and overseas&#x201D;. I would draw the attention of this very amiable hon. Minister to the fact that in the five-year period during which drought has been maulding those areas of the Northern Transvaal, overseas and in South Africa, having regard to the daily issue of one newspaper, by a particular company that owns a newspaper, there were probably 2,000,000 newspapers issued in that period. Does he seriously suggest that it is my function, when he makes allegations of exploitation as an evasion to the question I put to him, that I must now go and procure 2,000,000 newspapers from all over the world, including South Africa, and read them all carefully in order to find out where it was said that somebody was exploiting the situation? Would it not have been more accurate for the hon. the Minister to say to me and the House: The exploitation has taken place under these circumstances and these are the people who are guilty of it? If he knows that the position has been exploited, I say again, without any reference to the personality of the hon. Minister, that his two answers as well as his Press statement constituted no more than an evasion of his responsibility to state the facts clearly to this House, if not to me.</p>

<p>I want to give an example of what the hon. Minister calls exploitation. There are many, many bodies who are assisting the people in the Northern Transvaal because of the drought conditions. The hon. the Minister knows who they are. The y are church bodies, welfare bodies, public organizations, among them Kupagani. Now if that is a body which is exploiting the situation let the hon. Minister say so. But then at least we can measure that against the facts, as it is commonly known that Kupagani is a non-profit organization whose function it is to provide food free of charge by procuring it at the lowest possible rates from the producers, including such foodstuffs as oranges, in regard to which they made a deal recently under their scheme, and then making sure that at least a minimum of food is supplied. Does the hon. Minister suggest that these people are exploiting the position, because if he does then I would like him to explain this to me&#x2014;if he says Kupagani is exploiting the position, and the church bodies are exploiting the position&#x2014;what about the Native Recruiting Corporation. This is not a political body. It is the recruiting organization of the Chambers of Mines. How is it then that they recognized the seriousness of the conditions in the Northern Transvaal among the Bantu and that the week before I put my question to the Minister, the N.R.C., which is not a political organization or a philanthropic body but a labour recruiting body, made available a gift of R100,000 to Kupagani? You know what the hon. Minister has on his Estimates under the heading &#x201C;Relief of Distress&#x201D;, and this is the only related item of expenditure that I can find in this Budget &#x201C;Relief of Distress&#x201D;, on page 126, R10,000! And the hon. Minister talks about exploitation, so much so that one is appalled to learn that on 15 May according to Press reports, the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> was advised that permission had been refused by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development to send a reporter to the African areas in the Northern Transvaal to study the Government&#x2019;s and other relief measures. Now the obvious question is: &#x201C;What is there to hide in the Northern Transvaal, that a newspaper may not be allowed to send anybody in?&#x201D; Will the hon. Minister when he replies to that question deal with this question and tell this House why certain conditions are <span class="col_6165-6166" refersTo="page_416"/>known, and since we assume that both the Government and the Opposition and all well-meaning people and bodies are anxious to avoid hardship being suffered by people because of drought in the Northern Transvaal, will he explain why a particular newspaper, or all newspapers, cannot obtain permission to send representatives in to do a survey there? If this is the position, then I must say that once again it is the Government, and in this case the hon. the Minister and his Department, who create this unfortunate and unfavourable image that we &#x201C;enjoy&#x201D; in the outside world. Because I want to tell the hon. Minister something: Whether it is a question of the depressed areas in Britain, or whether it is a question of the deep South, which is in terms of the American economy, a depressed area, there has never been a case where a Government Department has refused newspapermen and others to go into those areas. In fact they have co-operated and encouraged them to go there so that the public can be informed about the seriousness of the problem and so that the public can assist, and so that all sectors of the public can understand and assist in this problem. But here we have a situation that the hon. the Minister does not want to discuss it in the House, and when he gives an answer he sidesteps it twice, and then he makes a Press statement which gives exactly no factual information about (a) the extent of the problem and (b) the extent of the support and the help the Government is giving, and where finally, because a report appeared in a particular newspaper, that paper is debarred from sending anybody to the area to study conditions there.

<p>I want to revert to what was said by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher). He said that this border problem could yet cause the biggest explosion in South Africa, but he never said why. He did not mention a single reason to support his statement. I want to tell the hon. member that that is typical of United Party propaganda. It is just a bogy. Thereafter every speaker wanted to know where the borders of the homelands were and why they were not being announced. Surely hon. members opposite know that this Government has announced, not only through the hon. the Minister but also through the hon. the Prime Minister, that this side of the House stands by the 1936 legislation. Another 1,000,000 morgen has still to be bought for Bantu homelands. Surely it is obvious that no homeland border can be determined before all that land has been bought. This is a promise which that side of the House made in 1936, but they do not abide by it. They have broken their word, and their party has already split as the result of that promise. We are going to implement it. But surely the borders can only be ascertained after this land has been bought. Hon. members opposite are omitting one thing. If they are in such a hurry in regard to the determination of the borders, why has not a single one of them ever attacked the Government for being too slow in buying that land? That would be the right thing for the Opposition to do if it were worth its salt as an Opposition, rather than tilting at windmills for propaganda purposes.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred here to the agitation which some members of Parliament set afoot in the Western Cape in regard to the removal of the Bantu here. Now I do not know where the hon. member got his information from in regard to an agitation. We on this side of the House are not agitators who set agitations afoot. The fact is that we had a case which we stated and the Prime Minister accepted it as party policy. But it has always been party policy to clean up the White areas. It has always been the policy of the National Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member is still wearing short pants. It has been National Party policy since 1948 to clean up these areas. Only one thing was decided, and that was also confirmed by the Cape Congress of the party, namely that the Western Cape would be the first area to be cleaned up. Now the hon. member speaks about sharp division in the Western Cape. That statement is devoid of all truth. I can give him the assurance that there is no division in regard to this matter in the Western Cape. I will meet him in regard to this matter at any place in my constituency. The fact is that there is the greater measure of unanimity in regard to the matter. The steps that have already been taken evidence it. Certain steps have been taken, and the hon. member knows about them. I hope he has taken note of the Central Committee which was appointed, and of the people who were prepared to serve on that committee. Commerce and industry and organized agriculture are represented on that committee. Those people accepted the invitation to serve on that committee because they were prepared to implement that policy. The hon. member knows what important people serve on that committee. He says that uncertainty prevails. I want to tell him that there is no uncertainty at all in regard to this matter in this area. Every man in this area, whether he is a farmer or an industrialist or is engaged in commerce, knows that this Government is not one which breaks things down, and the National Party is not a party which does that. For the past 50 years since it was established, the National Party has just been constructive. This Government will not break down what it has built up. Therefore the assurance was given from all sides that very cautious action would be taken in regard to this matter. That is the policy and it will be implemented because it must be implemented, but it will be done in such a way that nobody will suffer harm. The fact is that in this area there is superfluous Coloured labour, but another fact is that as the result of circumstances and the course of <span class="col_6167-6168" refersTo="page_417"/>history, and also as the result of the ineptitude of the United Party during the years it was in power, this labour is not suitable; it is not skilled. In the first place, it must be made suitable. And now there are two matters which should receive attention, and those are the matters which the main committee and also the local committees will have to investigate, and which the Government will have to consider. The Government is serious in regard to this matter and therefore not only a Central Committee has been appointed, but also a Cabinet Committee which has to devote attention to this matter.</p>

<p>There are two steps which should first enjoy attention, and the one is the training of this Coloured labour which is available but not suitable, and it is receiving attention. Land has been bought by the Departments of Community Development and Coloured Affairs to establish training centres in order to train the superfluous Coloured labour in the Western Cape. The second step&#x2014;and this has often been said already&#x2014;is that one cannot simply put these Bantu on trains and dump them somewhere else. That would not be humane, and it is not the way in which this Government is tackling the matter. A livelihood must first be provided in those areas to which they have to return. Therefore these two matters are receiving attention simultaneously, the training of the Coloureds and the provision of a means of livelihood for the Bantu who are to be removed, and it is also receiving attention in the form of border industries. The hon. member referred to the Orange River Scheme. Some of the people who are fit for that sort of labour and who are to be removed here will certainly be utilized to assist in that great project.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to say anything in connection with the rural Natives; I wish to devote my attention to the urban Natives. I want to talk about the advisability of making the Reef one area for purposes of influx control. I have spoken on this subject before, and on the effect of the present policy on industry on the Reef. I pointed out that a certain cement factory at Roodepoort wanted to expand but was prevented from doing so because its labour force was limited to Roodepoort and they could not engage labour from elsewhere on the Reef. As the result they opened another factory at Rosslyn. Of course Roodepoort in this case suffers particularly because the Consolidated Main Reef Mine, its last remaining mine, is closing down, and industries are required to take its place. Had the factory been allowed to employ labour residing elsewhere on the Reef, there would have been no need to go to Rosslyn, so Roodepoort is the loser. The hon. the Deputy Minister is of course the member for Roodepoort and no doubt he will assure his constituents that they have come to no harm. Of course too, at present, with the colossal Government Defence expenditure, there is little unemployment in that area, but times will change and Roodepoort will then realize what was done to it.</p>

<p>I want to show how another industrialist, this time in Boksburg, has fared, and I want to quote from the <i>Manufacturer</i> of April 1964&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A few years ago the Federated Chamber of Industries had a discussion on the question of whether a Native worker living in Benoni could not work in Boksburg or <i>vice versa.</i> He understood at the time that some arrangement would be made whereby various municipalities would reach a general agreement on this aspect. Now it appeared as if it was going the other way. You may say this is a parochial matter, but I understand it applies to other centres in South Africa as well, and I think it is a very important matter. I am a manufacturer in Boksburg and quite a few of my workers live in Benoni. That is because Boksburg was not able to accommodate these people. Now all my workers who live in Benoni have received letters saying that they must now leave their residence in Benoni and go to Boksburg. Some of these are valuable people to me. They have been with me for ten or more years, and the restrictions that are being imposed on these people make it impossible for them to move. For instance, Boksburg is only able to accommodate people in hostels, so that if they were living as married people in Benoni they now have to go to Boksburg as single people, unless they can prove that they have been married for so many years. You know how it is with a lot of Native workers. They have not got certificates, and so on, with the result that the families are just being split up. I think that this is an important matter and I think that we as the F.C.I. should try and get these water-right compartments removed.</block>

<p>Now I know personally that the Benoni officials are the most humane men that can be found anywhere, but their hands are tied by the law. They have to administer the law as they find it. In plain language, they must do what the Minister tells them, so these African men must move or lose their jobs. The fact that their families might be broken up is, of course, of no consequence as far as the Minister is concerned, and we know that if they lose their jobs their future and that of their families is indeed murky. Where they will finish up, nobody can say. Where does this policy bring us from the practical angle. Industry as a whole wants to build up as stable a labour force as possible. What earthly reason is there for stopping a man living in Benoni from working in Boksburg or Springs or Brakpan? He is unlikely to seek work further away unless forced to because of the cost and the time taken in travelling. The Chambers of Industries and the Chambers of Commerce all agree that the Reef should be one influx control area. The Minister may say in a horrified voice that they are thinking only of themselves and of money, but this is not so. They are thinking of their businesses on which the livelihoods of their employees, White and Black, depend. If you <span class="col_6169-6170" refersTo="page_418"/>cut their labour forces or restrict them in this peculiar way, you affect detrimentally all persons, White and Black, who work and live in that area and who should have more freedom of movement between home and employment, particularly as the gold mines are closing down. It is very difficult to understand what is behind this policy. Influx control is of course to a certain degree necessary, but surely it must be relaxed on the Reef with all the difficulties we are having at the moment, and I hope the Minister will tell us why, in an area where the municipal boundaries practically adjoin each other, such areas should be dealt with as if each municipality is a separate economic unit. It just does not make sense to me.</p>

<p>Now I want to turn to another matter. Late on a Friday afternoon in 1963 I received an urgent wire from the secretary of the non-European Golf Union saying he was awaiting the permission of the Minister to hold the non-European Golf Championship on a course on the East Rand. Application had been made weeks before. It was late on Friday, and I was unable to make contact with anybody in the Department until Saturday morning. The championship was due to start on the Monday. The course committee had approved the event, and the Benoni City Council had approved, but not the Minister. Fortunately I came across someone, a humane official in the Department on Saturday morning, who took it upon himself to give the necessary permission. I wired the authority and the event duly took place. I think you will agree, Sir, that that is shocking treatment, but wait for the next one.</p>

<p>Late on 4 March this year, a Wednesday, I received the following wire&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Please contact on our behalf Minister Bantu Development and Minister Community Development granting permit for Gold Championship Benoni Country Club Monday Tuesday Wednesday next week. Benoni Council agreeable. Awaiting only Minister&#x2019;s approval.</block>

<p>This wire was sent by the Secretary of the Transvaal non-European Golf Union, Daveyton. The following day I interviewed the Minister for Community Development in the lobby, and he kindly handed me over to his Private Secretary, who later in the day gave me the following note&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister of Community Development approved the application on 24 February, and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development approved to-day.</block>

<p>This was on a Thursday, and the event was due to start on the Monday. I accordingly wired on the Thursday, and in reply to a subsequent question to the hon. the Deputy Minister said that the permit was issued on 6 March two days before the competition was due to start. It is quite obvious that if I had not been in possession of the information and had not acted, the unfortunate non-Whites would not have received their permission until much later, if at all. It is quite obvious to me, too, from these two successive occurrences, that this mode of action was deliberate and from the way in which the Deputy Minister handles non-White affairs I can assume that this is his forte and his pleasure, but to me it is inhuman conduct. We all know that the Government regards these people as ciphers with no human feelings or rights, but I want to ask the Deputy Minister to clear the air in regard to these matters and tell us, firstly, whether he is against such events being held in White areas, and whether he is against non-Whites taking part in organized golf; secondly, whether he considers it fair, right and just that non-Whites should be deliberately kept waiting until the last minute before they know whether or not they can hold their contest; and, thirdly, whether this is his method of showing who is the boss in these matters. In conclusion, I must say that I consider the handling of matters in this manner as most un-Christian. I think it is too terrible for words, and I hope that in the future the Prime Minister will arrange for matters like this to be handled by somebody with a just regard for human rights and human dignity.</p>

<p>The only thing on which I can congratulate the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) is that he has now got a second theme on which to talk, because the other theme which he touched on to-day has already been discussed by him six times in this House, and each time worse than before. That is the cement factory at Roodepoort. Sir, what does one call that mental condition? Please help me to find another word, otherwise I must just say he is stupid. But I want to reply to the hon. member, and I shall start with the last point he raised.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the reply to the application to hold a golf tournament was &#x201C;deliberately kept back&#x201D;. [Interjection.] Now he says &#x201C;obviously&#x201D;. Does the hon. member wish to intimate that I held it back?</p>

<p>I ask whether the hon. member has enough integrity to accept my word? I say I knew nothing at all about that tournament until I received his telegram, and I immediately made inquiries about it telephonically, and that is why I gave approval for it here in Cape Town, and the Department issued a permit. [Interjection.] The hon. member says it was sent to our Department on the 24th, but the Department has various offices. There is an office at Benoni and one in Pretoria and during the Session there is also one in Cape Town. I do not know where that application was lodged. The person who had to decide on it was the Minister, or I on behalf of the Minister, and I could not decide before I knew about it. I do not know where that application was addressed to. The hon. member accused me of having kept it back deliberately, but I did not delay the matter for even half a day. But the hon. member does not have the integrity to accept my word when he makes such false accusations. That does not surprise me because we know the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member put a general question to me in regard to the golf tournament. He ought to know that our policy is that the Bantu and other non-Whites should play golf on links established for them as groups. For as long as there are no links for them to play on in their own areas, the two Departments concerned in the matter, our Department and Community Development, are prepared to treat every case on its merits when they apply to play on the golf courses of the Whites, and permission is granted subject to certain conditions. As soon as separate courses are available to them, such applications will no longer be granted. I hope the hon. member understands it now. Next time we will hear all about it again, just as in the case of the cement factory. I am sick and tired of discussing that matter, because it cannot penetrate the hon. member&#x2019;s mind. I should like to have his attention just once more, and he should really not make a fool of himself by continuing to talk on that subject. Even the people of that cement factory know what nonsense the hon. member talks about it. He reproaches me every time and says the factory is in my constituency, although I have repeatedly stated that it is not in my constituency.</p>

<p>The position is that that cement factory wanted to expand and they want to enjoy the benefits of a border industrial area, and they opened in Rosslyn, and the day the factory was opened&#x2026;[Interjections.] Will the hon. member now please keep his mouth closed and open his ears? When that industrial area was opened at Rosslyn the people of that factory were also there together with me, and they themselves boasted of the fact that they could be pioneers in the Rosslyn area. They were not forced to go there. They went there for obvious reasons, but the hon. member for Benoni continually tells this old story. It reminds me so much of Leipoldt&#x2019;s little song&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Op my ou ramkiekie<br/>Met net een snaar<br/>Speel ek in die maanskyn<br/>Deurmekaar.</block>

<p>The hon. member asked why the Witwatersrand could not be made into one big influx control area, but at the same time he let the cat out of the bag and said that influx control to the Rand area should be relaxed so that more Bantu workers could enter. We are opposed to the whole of the Rand, with its various municipalities, being made one controlled area. They want to make it one area for obvious reasons, but for precisely the same reasons we do not want to. The hon. members want to make it one large area, with the deliberate object that the benefits conferred by Section 10 (1) (a) and (b) of the Group Areas Act will then be doubly applicable, because that Act provides that a Bantu can live in a place where he was born, and there is another provision which says he can stay there if he has worked for one employer continuously for ten years or has lived there for 15 years. The hon. members opposite want to have the position where a Bantu can have his birth qualification in one area and his long residence qualification in another area, because then he qualifies for the whole large metropolitan area. We do not want that. Apart from certain problems which we may perhaps still be able to solve by means of legislation, there are still the problems of housing and transport and like matters. Does the hon. member want one municipality to provide housing on a large scale, with the people going to and fro to work in other areas; they live in one place and work in another, and the place where they live is really a &#x201C;dormitory town&#x201D;? We have problems in regard to transport. Railway lines have been built to serve the resettlement areas and bus subsidies are paid. Are we now to disturb all those arrangements in order that these Bantu may move about freely all over the Witwatersrand? The hon. member may accept it as a fact that administrative arrangements are made for an employer who <i>bona fide</i> goes from one area to another. If an industrialist goes from Germiston to Benoni or Springs, the necessary arrangements are made for his Bantu workers to go with him, and if necessary, for them to travel up and down temporarily. Consideration is also given to mobile industries, such as the building industry, which is not place-bound. The building contractor builds houses in the area of a certain municipality to-day, and in six months&#x2019; time he goes to another area, and in that case we make arrangements. During recent months I still made specific arrangements to assist such people in regard to the transfer of their Bantu workers. [Time limit.]</p>

<from><span class="col_6173-6174" refersTo="page_420"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I think one of the most urgent problems facing our country to-day is the question of race relations in the urban areas. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) also raised this matter in regard to the welfare of the Bantu in those urban areas. I believe that this particular problem is one which the Government should tackle on a more realistic basis so as to bring about an improvement in the living conditions of the urban Bantu. I think it is a pity that in this House, in discussing these matters, the loss of having elected persons as Native representatives to speak about a number of the everyday problems of these Bantu, is not appreciated. However, the position of the urban Bantu, particularly in relation to the increased cost of living, is a matter which requires the urgent attention of the Government. We know that with the present economic conditions in South Africa the lower income groups are the ones which are most detrimentally affected when it comes to any increase in the cost of living, as it means a further lowering of their standard of living. As far as the Bantu people are concerned, it is an acknowledged fact that the vast majority of Bantu fall in the strata of the lowest income groups. Therefore there are certain vital problems affecting these people which I believe should be relieved by the Minister. We know what a fertile breeding-ground for dissatisfaction and Communism unsatisfactory living conditions can be. That is why it is imperative that attention be given to some of these every-day matters affecting the Bantu. I realize that in our country the Bantu is provided with housing to a great extent, but there are many other factors involved concerning the economic position of the Bantu worker. The present policy of the Government whereby many of the Bantu are now housed some distance from their place of employment brings about a worsening of their economic position. With the improved housing, we find that rents have increased and the costs of transport have increased, and with these increases, in addition to the increases that occur from time to time in the cost of food, it is found that many of the Bantu people have to economize on food because that is the only thing left to them to economize on. Economizing on food brings about a more severe social problem, that of malnutrition. Although the Government, after considerable persuasion by this side of the House, introduced a feeding scheme to combat malnutrition and kwashiorkor among these people, we find that in spite of the improved housing there is still a considerable incidence of kwashiorkor in some of these housing schemes. A survey undertaken by the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Natal showed that in Kwa Mashu 25 per cent of the children attending the clinics are malnourished. We know that surveys have been carried out also by the Faculty of Medicine in Natal, which gave some alarming figures in regard to the incidence of malnutrition. This memorandum stated that totally inadequate wages, ignorance and, above all, the concomitant problems of the migratory labour system all contribute to the prevalence of malnutrition in the difficult and complex sociological structure of this country. I think that is a Clear indication of the serious problem facing us in regard to the health of the Bantu.</p>

<p>Following on the question of malnutrition, there is the other aspect of caring for those Bantu who are aged or disabled and unable to fend for themselves. If we look at the Estimates before us, there is actually a decrease of R600,000 under sub-head &#x201C;H&#x201D;, which provides for pensions and other financial assistance such as pauper relief, etc.</p>

<p>But surely you know that the Transkei Government is looking after its own people now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am only saying that the figure shows a decrease, and I will deal with it further, because the question of increasing the allowances made to the Bantu is the next point I wish to discuss. If you look at the figures provided, in regard to social pensioners, we see that there was an increase last year of R5.10 which was a special allowance paid to Bantu social pensioners. In assessing this increased amount of R5.10, which I might add was long overdue because the previous increase they had had was in April 1962, and then it was only R1.80 per annum, or 15c a month, it was therefore very welcome to see that there was an increase of R5.10, part of which came about last year. Now the point is that with this special allowance in regard to the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians, those Departments handling the payment of these amounts surveyed the position and paid the persons who were entitled to it in terms of the legislation passed last year, but my efforts to try and assess the figure of the payment of this allowance to the Bantu social pensioners have been unsuccessful. I was told that they did not have a record of those figures. So from the figures supplied in the Budget debate it appeared that approximately 50 per cent of the Bantu pensioners receive that special allowance, and they total 317,314, and by deduction it appeared that some 160,000 received the extra allowance of R5.10 per annum and 156,000 did not receive that increase. Now I should like to know from the Minister whether it was brought to the notice of these Bantu pensioners that they could qualify for this extra R5.10 per annum, because that is a considerable amount of money to them. It would appear that these pensioners have now lost the R5.10 because they did not receive the special allowance last year. So it would appear that those who are to receive it this year will have lost exactly one year&#x2019;s allowance, R5.10, which they might have qualified for during the course of last year. That amount has now been lost to them. The amounts that are being paid to them, even in spite of the increase, are still negligible. Divided into the three sections, the city Bantu will receive R3.52&#x00BD;, the town <span class="col_6175-6176" refersTo="page_421"/>Bantu will receive R3.2&#x00BD; and the rural Bantu R2.52&#x00BD; per month. These three amounts is another matter which I believe should be considered by the Minister. In regard to the social pensions of the other racial groups, that has now been consolidated into one amount. But as far as the Bantu are concerned there is still this wide discrepancy in payments. Sir, I intended to deal fully with the question of the care of the disabled Bantu. That is another aspect which I believe should receive the Government&#x2019;s attention. While I am dealing with the question of the payment of these special allowances to all social pensioners, I think the question of making these payments on a bi-monthly basis should also receive the attention of the hon. the Minister. Two months is a long time for these Bantu people to have to go without any means of support. There are certain aged and disabled Bantu who are cared for by the relatives, according to Bantu tradition, but there are others who are not cared for and who have to depend upon the State and the Government for their existence. Incidentally, in reply to a question which was put to him on the 8th of this month, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development stated that the question of establishing settlements for the care of aged Bantu was receiving attention; that the question of establishing such settlements in the ethnic homelands was under consideration. I do hope that it is not going to be the policy to establish these homes only in the ethnic homelands, because there are many Bantu who have settled permanently in the urban areas and who can no longer fend for themselves. If those Bantu were sent to the ethnic homelands in terms of Government policy they would find that they are complete strangers there, completely unfamiliar with the way of life in those ethnic homelands. I trust therefore that the Minister&#x2019;s reply does not mean that no State-aided homes for the care of the aged or disabled Bantu will be established in the urban areas. Sir, it is no easy matter for the relatives of these people in the urban areas to care for them. I have reports here from Bantu social workers in this regard, but I do not wish to quote them at this stage because I am sure the hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that the relatives who care for the aged and disabled Bantu are often placed in a very difficult financial position because they cannot afford to assist these pople.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>I propose in the course of my speech to refer to certain observations made here by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). I am thankful for the fact that the hon. member did not follow the pattern which this debate followed in general, and in the circumstances I am not going to reply to him immediately. I think the pattern of this debate was laid down by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) who obviously set out to ridicule the Government&#x2019;s policy in connection with the urbanization of the Bantu in his homelands. In my mind&#x2019;s eye I can still see the well-cared-for hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) rocking with laughter at every feeble little joke of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories. After him speaker after speaker on the Opposition benches stood up and tried to ridicule this policy. I am sorry that hon. members on the other side did not set out to state their policy against ours and to criticize our policy in comparison with theirs. But, Sir, this is not the first time that tactics of that kind have been used in a debate in this House nor do I think it is the first time such tactics have failed in this House. I still recall how the United Party in the &#x2019;fifties ridiculed many aspects of Government policy. I want to mention a few of them. I refer in the first place to the so-called site and service scheme. I recall very vividly how Opposition members at that time tried both in this House and outside of the House to ridicule this policy and to create the impression that this was something ridiculous which was being embarked upon by an impractical Government. I also recall very vividly how they fought against the Native services levy, which was designed to make provision also for transport services&#x2014;the matter to which the hon. member for Umbilo referred here to-day. I wonder what the hon. member had in mind when he raised this matter here; I wonder whether he would be prepared to propose that the levy be increased so as to make it possible for the Bantu living outside of the cities to be transported more cheaply to their places of employment. I should like to hear whether he would be prepared to suggest that the levy be increased with a view to making transport facilities more readily available to those Bantu. But I also recall how the Opposition launched an attack upon the Natives Resettlement Act. Sir, I want to say to hon. members on the other side that if they are really concerned about harmonious relations between White and non-White they should try to turn over a new leaf; they should try to be positive in their approach to this important issue; they should not adopt a negative attitude, as they have done in this debate. I wonder whether hon. members on the other side do not feel ashamed when they look at the results of these measures to which I have referred here in passing, results which are discernible throughout the whole of South Africa. I wonder whether they do not have a guilty conscience when they adorn themselves with borrowed plumes and proudly show overseas visitors all these miracles which have been achieved thanks to the National Party. I agree that what has taken place is indeed a miracle, and perhaps we should not begrudge hon. members of the Opposition the privilege, as fellow-citizens of this country, of revelling in what this Government has achieved through its practical and efficient measures. I think instead of ridiculing what the Government has done members of the United Party ought to bow their heads in shame before the damning facts that I propose to mention here with reference to the remarks made by the hon. member for Umbilo. The hon. member talked <span class="col_6177-6178" refersTo="page_422"/>about the conditions under which the Bantu have to live in the cities. I want to ask him whether he has forgotten that under United Party rule the cost of constructing a four-room house of the standard type in 1948 was R800, whereas we have now succeeded, by means of standardization and labour-saving methods, in bringing down the cost of the same type of house to R420. If he has forgotten it, I want to remind him and his colleagues of it, and I want to ask them whether they do not agree that this Government has contributed towards the alleviation and improvement of the circumstances under which those people live in the cities. I also want to ask him whether they are not put to shame by the fact that this Government has succeeded in placing the financing of Bantu housing on an economic basis whereby the capital, together with the interest, is redeemed over a period of 30 years by the monthly payments of rental. Sir, I want to mention a few figures to you: In 1948 99 per cent of the moneys appropriated was for sub-economic housing, that is to say, only 1 per cent was for economic housing. In 1962 only 2 per cent of the moneys appropriated was for sub-economic housing and 98 per cent for economic housing. What right have the hon. member for Umbilo and his colleagues to say that if this Government is sincere it should try to alleviate the lot of the Bantu in our cities? Is the United Party not ashamed to adopt this attitude having regard to the fact that in Johannesburg alone this Government, without striking a blow, re-settled 90,984 Bantu and that to-day those people are all grateful residents of Bantu residential areas around Johannesburg?</p>

Sir, I say that when we bear these things in mind, as well as many other matters that I could mention, we must admit that a miracle has indeed been accomplished. I want to say to the Opposition that if they do not deliberately shut their eyes to what goes on around them they will agree that at this very moment another miracle is being achieved in the Bantu homelands. I foresee, without wishing to assume the role of prophet, that the day will come when they will have to admit, as they do in this case, that they were wrong and that the Government acted correctly and revealed more vision than they did.

The sentence should have read as follows, &#x201C;In the Transkei alone 3,226 Bantu labourers are employed on fibre processing&#x201D;, and not 10,000 as mentioned by me, &#x201C;and 788 in the higher posts&#x201D;. In other words, more than 4,000 are employed in the fibre industry in the Transkei. Then in the second place I want to give this explanation: I referred here this afternoon to Selonstat. Selonstat was a scheduled area but it is no longer a scheduled area to-day. It is State-owned land to-day but there are still Bantu on it but those Bantu are to be removed.</p>

<p>The Government has laid down its own yardstick and that yardstick is this, &#x201C;I am following the policy of separate freedoms, of separate states, in an attempt to protect the White man&#x201D;. That is the one and only yardstick. Every step that this Government takes in the name of apartheid must he measured in terms of this one and only yardstick: Will it or will it not ensure the survival of the White man in South Africa? Sir, I want to make use this afternoon of the yardstick which they themselves have placed in my hands and examine to what extent their policy is succeeding.</p>

<p>It is not a difficult matter to apply this yardstick, for the simple reason that if you want to ensure the survival of the White man in South Africa by means of this policy, then you must comply with certain definite requirements. There are numerous requirements, but the first requirement is certainly this: If you want to turn apartheid into a policy which is to ensure the survival of the White man, then you must carry it through to total apartheid; there is no such thing as partial apartheid. The whole philosophy of separate states is inconsistent with the concept of partial apartheid. Sir, within the framework of this philosophy there is no alternative; it must either be total apartheid or else the whole philosophy simply breaks down in the present situation of multi-racialism.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I ask myself to what extent the Government complies with this cardinal requirement; to what extent it seeks to achieve this goal of total apartheid. The reply to that question is this: The increase in the numbers of Bantu in the urban areas over the past ten years is in direct conflict with the basic philosophy of the Nationalist Party. The increase in the number of Bantu, even here in the Western Cape, about which hon. members on that side are so very perturbed, is in direct conflict with the philosophy of total apartheid. It will not avail the hon. the Deputy Minister to say, &#x201C;Yes, I admit that the numbers of Bantu are increasing but they are increasing in terms of the policy of the Nationalist Party&#x201D;. That does not help him. As long as the Bantu are here, whether permanently or temporarily, as long as they are here on a basis of inter-dependence between the Bantu and the Whites, as long as the Bantu are in the majority here&#x2014;as a matter of fact even if in time to come they are in the minority&#x2014;the Government is keeping a process going which is in direct conflict with the principle of total apartheid. When one looks at the deeds of this Government over the past ten years and when one applies their own yardstick, that is to say, the survival of the White man, one finds that they are failing year after year; that they are throwing overboard and ignoring their own philosophy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is a second requirement which the policy has to comply with, and that requirement is the time factor. No person who reads the report of the Tomlinson Commission can but be impressed by the urgency of this matter. It cannot but be urgent. Every single day that the Brown man, the Black man and the White man participate together in building up the structure of South Africa, the Black man becomes more and more interwoven in that structure. And with every day that passes the unravelling process becomes more difficult. That is why the Tomlinson Commission says that this is a matter or urgency; that is why the Tomlinson Commission says, &#x201C;This is an act of faith; it is a challenge; you will have to spend so many rand in so many years&#x201D;. The Tomlinson Commission even goes so far as to compare the idea of apartheid with the reconstruction of Europe which took place in a very short period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, all I am doing is to tell the hon. member what his policy ought to look like if it is to save the White man. Actually his policy is entirely different, but he thinks he is deceiving the public. Sir, I pose the question again: What has this Government done?</p>

<p>Is the Government aware of this time factor? We ask the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;What have you done; how many cities have been established in the Bantu areas; how many factories have been established there?&#x201D; The hon. member for Westdene says that we are ridiculing their policy. No, what we are doing is simply to apply this yardstick, and then the hon. the Minister comes along, as though he has a lifetime ahead of him, and tells us that Rome was not built in one day. Does the Government imagine that time is going to stand still for South Africa; that the inexorable march of history will halt and give the hon. the Minister time to carry out his policy at his own leisure? Sir, this is a serious matter, and as long as hon. members on the other side, including the Minister and the Deputy Minister, try to satisfy us with the type of answer that they have been giving us here, so long will they be deceiving the public. If there is one thing which the public of South Africa cannot afford&#x2014;I can think of no greater danger&#x2014;it is to believe that this Government&#x2019;s policy will ensure the survival of the Whites when in actual fact it cannot do so because what the Government is doing is to ignore every single requirement of that policy. Mr. Chairman, no nation can do anything more <span class="col_6181-6182" refersTo="page_424"/>dangerous than to be content with a policy such as the policy of apartheid, a policy which holds out no hope for its own future. It is a policy which is designed to ensure the survival of the Whites but which, as I see it, in spite of all the efforts of the Nationalist Party, still remains a policy on paper only, a policy in theory, a policy in the imagination of the Nationalist Party. The sands of time are running out for the White man and with every day that passes, we are further reducing the dwindling period which was left to us to ensure the salvation of the White man in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member has again come here with the old cry that we always hear from the United Party, and that is that the policy of the National Party visualizes the application of total apartheid in South Africa.

<p>Let me first finish what I was saying. I have just started and the hon. member is already beginning to ask questions. The first person who rejected that proposition unequivocally in this House was Dr. Malan, and since then it has been rejected by every subsequent Prime Minister. The National Party said that total apartheid was an ideal which one could strive to achieve, but it went no further than that. Moreover, the present Prime Minister and I myself have always stated that for generations to come there will still be millions of Bantu in the White areas of South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member has not taken the trouble to read the report of the Tomlinson Commission. The Tomlinson Commission stated that there were only two policies, which were diametrically opposed to each other; the one was eventual total apartheid, if it could be brought about, or apartheid, and the other was the policy of integration. There is no middle course. Is there anybody here who would suggest that there is a middle course? I want to make it perfectly clear again that the National Party visualizes that for generations to come, and far into the distant future, there will always be Bantu in the White areas. If it does prove possible at some future date to bring about total apartheid, then nobody would welcome it more than we would, but at the present moment it is altogether unpractical. Then I come to my second submission, which is clearly borne out by the report of the Tomlinson Commission, and that is that there is no middle course. Just as the policy of the Liberal Party and of the Progressive Party will eventually culminate in total integration between White and non-White, in all spheres, so the policy of the United Party will eventually culminate in full integration; it is merely a matter of time. Sir, two very important statements were made here this afternoon, and I am very pleased that they were made here. The first was made by the hon. member who has just spoken. He said that the present situation was one of multi-racialism. Sir, I reject that in principle. What does multiracialism mean?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I said here on Friday in the course of my speech that the Opposition accepted integration but that they were not prepared to accept the full implications of integration; if they now accept a policy of multi-racialism then I assume, of course, that they accept the full consequences of such a policy, and in that case I should like to know what the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) thinks about it. The policy in South Africa is not one of multi-racialism. It is true that we have economic integration, but that is not multi-racialsim. If our policy was one of multi-racialism then we would find in this country the sort of thing to which a Native has just objected in Lusaka in Northern Rhodesia. I refer to the objection which has just been raised by Solomon Kalula. I just want to remind the House what Kalula said; here we have further proof of the correctness of the policy of the National Party. Kalula said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Night partnership with African women is not the way to build the new nation we want here in Northern Rhodesia.</block>

<p>That is multi-racialism, Mr. Chairman! Here we have evidence which clearly shows that the Bantu in Northern Rhodesia object to this sort of thing. This only goes to show how far the United Party has already gone. The policy which they now admit they accept therefore is one of multi-racialism&#x2014;and that includes all the implications of multi-racialism, of course. But there is a second important statement which was made here by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), who was supported by the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman). That statement was acclaimed by the Leader of the Opposition, and what it amounts to is <span class="col_6183-6184" refersTo="page_425"/>that they now reject the principle of territorial separation. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West), to use his precise words, said: &#x201C;As far as we are concerned boundaries are of secondary importance.&#x201D; The hon. member for East London (City) wanted to enlarge upon that and he said: &#x201C;As far as we are concerned boundaries do not count at all.&#x201D; What is the implication of that?</p>

Mr. Chairman, I can only say that their policy is becoming &#x201C;grensloos&#x201D; (without limits).

He has the ugly habit of trying to make others out to be liars. That memorandum from which he quoted was submitted to the congress of the Transvaal Agricultural Union.

<p>Listen to that, Mr. Chairman! What does one do with a man who is so ill-mannered? The hon. member is known as the most ill-mannered member in this House. There are certain elementary principles of decency which one at least observes, but the hon. member does not even do that.</p>

<p>I have already replied to the other matter which he raised in this connection. It is unnecessary therefore to deal with it further.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) expressed his concern over the &#x201C;corridor&#x201D;. Sir, I find that very strange, because a little while ago he said that boundaries did not count as far as they were concerned, and now suddenly he wants boundaries. How can one understand such a person? One moment he is a general of the Ossewabrandwag and the next moment he is a general of the Black Sash. I just want to tell the hon. member that according to our policy East London will never become an island in a Black sea. I give him that assurance. Once our policy has been implemented those Black spots around East London will have been removed. The East London area will be Whiter than it is to-day. In this connection we have the co-operation of the Bantu. They fully agree with that. Under his policy East London would not only become a Black island but it would become a Black area. There is not the slightest doubt about that. I can give him the assurance in writing that under our policy, East London will always be safe.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) expressed his misgivings in connection with labour for the dairy farmers. I want to make it clear to him that our policy is to give priority to labour for our farmers. In this connection I receive very fine co-operation from the agricultural unions. The agricultural Unions will be able to testify to the fact that we are doing everything in our power to give effect to that policy. But there are two types of labour in South Africa that we want to abolish as soon as possible, not only at the unanimous request of all the agricultural unions in the whole of South Africa but also at the request of the Agricultural Union of Natal. The first type is the squatter type of labour; the second is the labour tenant system. We are doing this not only at the request of the agricultural unions but at the request of the Bantu themselves because this is a type of labour which is scandalously exploited. I agree with the hon. member that the dairy farmer must have the right type of labour. I myself grew up on a farm where my father went in for cattle farming: I know how necessary it is to have good milkers. The hon. member may rest assured that we will do everything in our power to look after the dairy farmer. Wherever I can help, I shall do so. The hon. member need have no fears in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kuruman (Mr. du Plessis) has asked whether we cannot erect fencing around all the Bantu areas at the expense of the Department of Bantu Administration. That is an attractive idea but I do not think it is practical. The fact of the matter is that we do erect fencing as far as possible and we do so in terms of the Fencing Act. Where farmers approach us to erect fencing in terms of that Act, we assist them, of course, as far as possible.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) has suddenly emerged here as the stout champion of the people who are supposedly <span class="col_6185-6186" refersTo="page_426"/>dying of hunger in the Northern Transvaal.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the impression which the hon. member created here. The same sort of thing was done in this country a few years ago. At that time the newspapers were full of stories about people succumbing to hunger in the Northern Transvaal. Mr. Chairman, those stories were dragged before UNO to show how badly we were treating the Blacks in this country. But there was not a single word of truth in those stories. I went out of my way at the time to look into this matter; I took about 15 journalists along with me. I left it to them to decide where they wished to go. They accompanied me through the whole of the Northern Transvaal. Mr. Chairman, they were honest enough to testify to the fact that there was not a word of truth in the propaganda of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> and its kindred spirit.</p>

<p>The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> now comes along with the same story and what the hon. member for Hospital does is to encourage it. When there is good work to be done one is surprised at the absence of people like the hon. member for Hospital, but when there is an opportunity to besmirch South Africa&#x2019;s name then they are always in the vanguard. I just want to say that there is no single word of truth in it. I admit that the position is serious. We have been taking good care of those people in the past. We have taken such good care of them that I receive letters every day in which these people express their gratitude. We have looked after them so well that the Bishop of the Anglican Church&#x2014;I do not think he will mind if I mention his name&#x2014;has done me the honour of visiting my office personally to thank me personally for what I have done to assist these people. I have had expressions of gratitude not only from him but also from the Bantu. Why start besmirching this country again? The hon. member says that I should have issued a statement in this House. Surely that is nonsense. Surely the statement which appeared in the Press was just as good. The hon. member wants to know how many Bantu I fed and in which areas, etc. The fact that he put such a question to me shows how little he knows about conditions in the Northern Transvaal. It only goes to show his ignorance and the wilfulness which motivates that question. [Interjections.] I can only give him the assurance that we have the position well under control. We have seconded an official on a full-time basis to see that nobody suffers want.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital wants to know why a certain journalist was not allowed to enter that area. There is one thing that I want to make perfectly clear here: I will never allow that type of blackguard (&#x201C;smeerlap&#x201D;) to enter the Bantu areas again. I do not know who he is, but I have instructed my officials not to allow these blackguards to enter the Bantu areas again because all they do is to send a lot of lies out into the world. When one asks them to go and point out these things to one, then they are unable to do so. There was the case where a certain doctor made allegations of this kind and he was repudiated by his fellow-doctors. We then took the matter further. One of the doctors took him along in his motor-car and asked him to go and point out the area in which these people were starving. Mr. Chairman, he is still searching! That is where the hon. member gets his information from. I honestly admit that the situation is serious, but I want to give the assurance to the House that we will see to it that those people do not starve.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) talked about the economic position of the Bantu in the cities. Sir, the economic position of the Bantu in the cities has never been as good as it is at the present time. In the days of the United Party Government the Bantu had to live in hovels. Their economic position has never been as good as it is to-day, but I am one of those people who have repeatedly appealed to the people who talk this way to pay their Bantu decent wages. I do so again to-day in all seriousness. There are some people who do not pay their Bantu workers decent wages, and I want to make an appeal to them once again to-day. It is strange, Mr. Chairman, that these are the people who are always the first to say that the Government should increase the wages of the Bantu. Our policy is to ensure as far as possible that the rental which the Bantu has to pay does not exceed 20 per cent of his income; that is the basis which is accepted throughout the world, and we try as far as possible to work on that basis. The hon. member also points out that the amount provided for pensions has been reduced. That has already been replied <span class="col_6187-6188" refersTo="page_427"/>to by one of my hon. friends on this side. I might just point out that the sum which is being granted to the Transkei amounts to, I think, R1,400,000. If everything is added the amount will be higher, of course; I believe it would be at least an additional R1,000,000. That figure therefore does not reflect the true position. In this connection too I want to make an appeal to people to look after their former Bantu servants who have become too old to continue to work. I simply cannot bring myself to cast aside a Bantu servant when he becomes too old to continue to work. What I am accustomed to is that these old Bantu are cared for just as well in their old-age, if not better, than they were cared for in their younger days. Sir, here I want to mention the fine example of the late Oom Jakob Wilkens. When his Bantu workers reached the retiring age they returned, as usual, to their Bantu area, but Oom Jakob saw to it every year that they received a pension and he also provided them with food. I can personally testify to the fact that at his own expense he used to send two to three ox-wagons loaded with bags of maize to the Bantu areas to deliver food to them. Do any of these people who criticize our policy do so much for their Bantu? Very few, Mr. Chairman. There is another thing that we might bear in mind; it is the one thing which I have always warned against. The Bantu have a very fine custom of taking care of their aged and disabled people, and anybody who does anything to destroy that fine system will be rendering a disservice to the Bantu. It is our duty to see that they do not suffer.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half an hour please? The prime mover of the increased rate of economic development that we have witnessed in recent years has clearly been the manufacturing industry. There is little doubt that in future South Africa will have to look more and more to the manufacturing industry for rapid economic growth. What is more important it will also be the manufacturing industry to which the country will have to look to provide employment for its rapidly increasing population. For the manufacturing industry to grow rapidly it is necessary to increase export earnings from industrial products otherwise the country will require a considerable inflow of foreign capital. The ideal position would, of course be, if we could get both a rapid increase in the export of industrial products and an inflow of foreign capital. This is so, Sir, because all economic studies have shown that as a manufacturing industry develops rapidly so does the demand for imported goods, particularly capital goods, semi-manufactured goods and raw material for the manufacturing industry itself. In an article in the South African Journal of Economics of 1962, on page 301, it is shown that the import requirements of the manufacturing industry were far greater than its export earnings because the imports for the manufacturing industry were far greater than the exports of that industry itself. The rapid growth in our manufacturing industry was made possible by the rapidly increased export earnings of the gold-mining industry and agricultural exports and also, of course, because of the rapid inflow of capital until about five years ago. It is quite clear that the foreign exchange earnings of the goldmining industry have reached their peak. I think everybody is agreed on that, in the absence, of course, of a considerable increase in the price of gold. But I do not think that is something on which one should gamble today. There is also a limited rate at which agricultural exports can be increased. I think the Minister will agree that if we are to continue our rate of development the export of industrial products will also have to increase rapidly. Unfortunately the record of industrial exports has not been very good over recent years. This has been due mainly to the falling off in exports to the African markets which are, of course, the natural markets for our industrial products. The official figures show for instance that exports to African markets have declined from R155,600,000 in 1957 to R12,000,000 in 1962. The monthly figures for 1963 seem to indicate that this declining trend is going on.</p>

<p>If for reasons beyond the control of the Government we cannot increase our industrial exports to Africa we shall have to make it up in our exports to other countries. In the first place, this can only be done by means of the active promotion of exports and, secondly, of course, by keeping the cost structure of our industries as low as possible. The duty to increase exports naturally rests on the industrialists themselves but they can only operate in a complex created by the Government. They are therefore entitled to as much assistance as possible from Government side. Other speakers on this side will show how our exports have already suffered in the past as a result of Government inefficiency, non-co-operation, and, of course, because of some of the policies they have followed and on which I shall touch in a moment. Another important factor that will influence our industrial exports in future will be the tariff structure of world trade. The hon. the Minister has recently been to Geneva and I understand he is on the point of departing again to Geneva to attend the conference of GATT and also the United Nation&#x2019;s conference on trade development. I trust he will tell us what the Government&#x2019;s approach will be at these talks. I understand it was decided recently to recognize the special <span class="col_6189-6190" refersTo="page_428"/>position of countries like South Africa, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. If possible I should like the Minister to inform us what is meant by this special position; what special advantages or disadvantages will flow from it. I do not wish to say much more on that subject. I am sure the hon. the Minister will tell us what is happening in that regard.</p>

<p>Of course, overhanging the whole question of exports from South Africa, is the threat of economic embargoes. We know already to what extent it has developed in certain African countries and in certain Asian countries. Although the affects have been minimal they have certainly hit certain industries hard. More alarming is the news which appeared in the newspapers this morning in regard to what the Ambassador of the United States Government at the United Nations said in Sweden. He is reported to have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have used diplomatic persuasion and pressure as effectively as possible to induce South Africa to change its ways. Beyond this the most effective measure will be some sort of economic embargo.</block>

<p>They go on to quote him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the situation may change and make such sanctions the appropriate remedy for a situation which threatens to blow up&#x201D; after he had first of all said that the United Nations Charter did not provide the strongest sanctions as these could only be instituted in the event of a threat to national security.</block>

<p>We on this side of the House would like to tell our Western friends that if they are interested in retaining democracy in this part of Africa the most certain way of destroying it would be to apply sanctions to South Africa. To anybody who has any knowledge of the situation in South Africa it must be clear that in a multi-racial country like this the misery and poverty and the bitterness that will follow as a result of sactions applied to South Africa will not strengthen democracy but will more likely destroy it. Instead of improving race relations, which is apparently the object of the people who make these threats of economic sanction, they will embitter race relations for generations in this country. If the aim of those people who threaten economic sanctions to South Africa is to remove apartheid the obvious way of doing that is to encourage rapid economic development in this country. If they had any knowledge of what had happened in South Africa over the last 10 or 15 years they would realize that the more rapidly the country developed economically the more of a myth the policy of racial separation had become in South Africa and the policy of apartheid. They should realize that every new factory makes apartheid and Government policy that more unreal. It is only a question of time, and a very short time, when the electorate of this country will suddenly realize how completely impractical the road is on which this Government is trying to take the country. I know they always refer to the erosion of the civil liberties and the political rights of the non-Whites over the past 15 years. But what they overlook is that over this same period the economic and social position of those non-Whites has increased tremendously. In the long run that is surely the only way in which you can develop people politically and civilly. That is exactly what is happening in South Africa. If we had a spell of rapid economic development in this country of the same order we have had over the past few years, it is inevitable that civil and political rights will have to be extended to the non-Whites, no matter what Government is in power.</p>

<p>It is not only the tariff structure that exists in the world, and the artificial barriers, like boycotts which our exports will have to overcome. The volume of our exports in future will basically and certainly in the long run depend very largely on South Africa keeping the cost structure of its industry as low as possible. For that to happen one must obviously follow certain policies. We on this side feel that unfortunately some of the Government&#x2019;s policies militate against that. Take one example; take the Government border area development policy. We are told that the Government&#x2019;s policy of border area development is justified on both economic and political grounds. We are told that our industries have already become too concentrated and that decentralization will be economic. We are told that political border development is necessary to separate the races and to keep the Republic White. We realize, of course, that social and political reasons must frequently override economic considerations. Let us therefore consider to what extent border area development will separate the races and keep South Africa White. In the first place if border area development is to have any dramatic effect on the South African scene it will have to be massive. The great bulk of future industrial development will have to take place in the border areas. There will not only have to be the small marginal development we have at present. This must of necessity mean that the existing industrial complexes will have to develop far more slowly. I know the argument is frequently advanced by hon. members opposite that border area development will somehow or other stimulate the development in existing centres as well. Of course, Sir, this is a most dishonest attitude to adopt. It is wrong to say that because you develop areas like Hammarsdale and Rosslyn and the other border areas very rapidly you will also get more rapid development in the Southern Transvaal, Durban and the West Cape. That is simply not so. Everybody should realize that the country only has a limited amount of capital and a limited amount of technological manpower. If you employ these in new growth points the other industrial areas must of necessity suffer.</p>

<p><span class="col_6191-6192" refersTo="page_429"/>The question therefore arises whether such massive border area development will separate the races and keep the Republic White? What will massive border development in fact mean? It will mean that the bulk of the industrial development must in future take place in areas like Hammarsdale, Rosslyn and East London for example at the cost of the slower development of Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth for instance. But what will happen at these new places? White capital, White skill and Black labour will make manufactures for all the people of South Africa as is happening to-day in the case of the existing industrial centres. It will just mean a shift of economic integration from an area like Johannesburg, for instance, with Blacks predominating in numbers, to areas like Hammarsdale, East London, Pretoria (North) where the Blacks are even more predominating. That will be the only end-result. It will simply mean shifting South African industries to areas that are even blacker than the existing industrial areas. However, by some strange political alchemy we are told that this will keep the Republic White. I have never been able to understand how that can be brought about. May be the Minister can elaborate further on this.</p>

<p>This side of the House are therefore convinced that there are no over-riding political or social reasons for border development. It will not stop South Africa from being a multiracial society in which White capital and skill and Black labour make for rapid economic development to the benefit of all races. Let us see if there are any economic advantages. Let me clearly say that we are not against decentralization for economic reasons. A limited number of industries lend themselves to economic decentralization of which the most obvious example is the textile industry but there is no reason why they should only go to the border areas. There are many suitable areas which hon. members on the other side like to call the White heartlands, i.e. the smaller villages in the area which they consider will remain the White Republic, areas which we know are at the present moment becoming depopulated very rapidly. Surely those areas should also receive encouragement under the policy of decentralization. But large-scale decentralization is certainly not justifiable on economic grounds. None of our big industrial complexes has reached the size of those of the leading industrial countries of the world, even those of Canada and Australia. Our biggest industrial complex is not nearly as big as some of the industrial complexes in Canada and Australia for instance. Big industrial complexes lead to economies of specialization. This explains the fact of course that some of the cheapest industrial products in the world are produced in the greatest industrial complexes in Japan, Germany, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, to give just a few examples, and not in small decentralized industries. The stage in which the industrial complex becomes so big that social and indirect economic disadvantages clearly outweigh direct economic advantages to the investor has not been reached in our existing industrial centres. There seems to be little doubt that if they grow even bigger, they will become more economic and more efficient because of the bigger-scale operations that become possible, greater specialization; and of course the external economy becomes of greater and greater importance the greater your industrial complex becomes. Any large-scale diversion of industrial growth from our existing industrial centres to the new border areas can therefore only increase our cost structure and militate against the export of industrial products in future. The very fact that the hon. the Minister has to offer such substantial inducements to intending border industrialists, shows that this is not an economic development. As long as the development takes place on a small scale and as long of course as what is happening in the three places that I have mentioned, Hammarsdale, Rosslin and East London, where you decentralize not too near the borders where you have your greatest concentration of Native population, but where you decentralize to existing industrial cities in the so-called White areas in South Africa, not much harm is probably done, because they are still so close to the existing industrial complexes, that they still have the advantages of the services and the other benefits that are derived from the nearness to industrial complexes. But if the development is to take place on a scale that makes political sense in nationalist terms, there is not the slightest doubt that our whole cost structure will be pushed up, and who will have to foot the bill if you really get a massive development in the border areas and the Government has to pay out millions and millions of rands for these inducements that are being offered? Who will have to pay those taxes? The existing industries in the existing industrial centres, and not only the industries, but also the farming community and the mining community, thereby pushing up your whole cost structure of your economy. Because if over-centralization is a danger, and we hear such a lot about that, there is also a danger in over-decentralization.</p>

<p>It is of course not only the border development policy of the Government that tends to push up industrial costs. There are also other aspects of the Government&#x2019;s racial policies that push those costs up. If you look at our past development, the expansion of the agricultural and mining industries, (our great export industries up to the present) could take place largely on the basis of unskilled Native labour. But rapid industrial development requires a far higher percentage of skilled and semi-skilled labour. And whilst this requirement grows that, we will have to provide from our existing population, (far greater numbers of skilled workers and semi-skilled workers), we have a policy of separate development which makes this very difficult. How is one to build up a stable labour force with <span class="col_6193-6194" refersTo="page_430"/>a policy that regards the great bulk of industrial labour, Bantu labour, as merely temporary sojourners in the White man&#x2019;s cities? Migrants that can be shuttled back and forth at bureaucratic whim! If what the country requires is far more skilled labour than what the White section, even with immigration, can provide, what sense does job reservation make? What justification is there for instance for job reservation as far as the Coloureds and Indians are concerned, population groups which are now regarded as permanent and not merely temporary sojourners in the White man&#x2019;s cities? Those groups have reached a stage of educational development that they can form a vast potential for the extra number of skilled and semi-skilled workers which our future rapid industrial development will require. Now of course, Mr. Chairman, I am well aware of the fact that the effect that job reservation has up to the present had on our economy is probably exaggerated, because the Minister of Labour frequently defends his policy of job reservation on the basis that it affects so few workers and that it has not really affected adversely any racial group. If that is so, why continue with such a futile policy. Because despite the fact that probably it has not had any great adverse effect on any population group, which shows that it is not necessary, in any event, it has a tremendous effect on our so-called international image. It is the one thing that is awfully hard to defend if you are overseas why you should have job reservation. You can explain to Westeners why one must discriminate politically between the different racial groups, but if they ask you why you have to discriminate as far as the acquirement of skill is concerned, between the different racial groups, I want to tell the hon. Minister that it is one of the hardest things to try and defend South Africa on that basis. So here we have a futile bit of ideological policy which is being made more and more futile by our rapid economic growth and yet the Government persists with it. I wish the Minister would use his influence with his colleagues to get job reservation recalled. It would be one of the steps that would greatly assist to restore the confidence of the overseas investors and industrialists in South Africa. Rapid industrial and economic development, Mr. Chairman, after all does not only mean capital development and the development of the country&#x2019;s natural resources&#x2014;it also means the rapid development of the skills of people, and the freedom of workers to develop their potential abilities to the full. This is hardly possible if the country treats the great bulk of its labourers as foreigners. Rapid industrial development becomes even less likely if the location of industries is based not on economic factors but ideological considerations which in the end solve nothing. That is the whole tragedy of the policies we are pursuing in this country at the moment. They solve nothing basically in the long run. All they do is to destroy South Africa&#x2019;s good name and destroy the confidence of our overseas friends in South Africa and destroy the confidence of investors and industrialists in South Africa. As long as the Government carries on with the myth of apartheid and does not enforce it too severely we will continue to develop as in the past, if not as fast as our potential justifies, but the moment you start to apply the policy more vigorously, the slower will the rate of growth of South Africa be.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member concluded his speech with the old tale of woe that the more apartheid we have&#x2014;if I may put it this way&#x2014;the slower will be our economic growth. We have been hearing that same refrain now for the past 16 years. One would have thought that by this time the United Party would admit that that story is entirely without substance. Our economic growth in South Africa is more rapid than that of any other country in the world, whatever the United Party may say.</p>

<p>I want to discuss one of the statements made here by the hon. member. The hon. member says that we are now moving economic integration from the urban areas to the border areas. I simply cannot understand how anyone can make a statement of that kind. The hon. member ought to know that the Bantu live in their own reserves in the border areas; they leave those areas for the day to go and do their work and they sleep in their own areas at night. They do not have as far to go as a Spaniard, for example, who has to cross the border to work in France, or an Italian to work in France or in Switzerland. That statement by the hon. member is an irresponsible statement therefore. These people leave their own areas to go to work; in this regard they are vitually in the same position as the Bantu in the compounds on the mines. Those Bantu live in compounds at their place of employment; they never leave the surroundings of the compound.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words in regard to decentralization as such, in pursuance of what the hon. member said, and I want to tell the hon. member that he is completely wrong if he believes that only border industries are going to be developed and no industries in other parts of the country. There is no such thing. We want a balanced development of industries wherever they are needed in the country. We cannot allow industries to continue to grow in one spot or in a few spots to the exclusion to the rest of the country. That is why I want to discuss the question of industrial decentralization from a broader angle than from the angle of border industry areas. I shall say about border industries at a later stage if I get the opportunity to do so. At this stage I just want to mention that the position in South Africa is that our industries are concentrated chiefly in the Vaal triangle. Our water supplies there are diminishing. There is no room for unlimited expansion there; at some time or other we are going to run into trouble. We must have decentralization. But we must also have decentralization in the Rand area, in the <span class="col_6195-6196" refersTo="page_431"/>Rand-Vereeniging-Pretoria area. The hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) continually makes the complaint in this House that not enough industries are being established in Springs. But the Government does not tell industrialists that they must establish their industries in Springs or Johannesburg or any other centre. If industrial land is available in a particular area, any person is at liberty to establish an industry in that area. But what is the position on the Rand? I have here the latest available figures&#x2014;those for 1962. These figures refer to the industries which have been established there and which have to import raw materials. I do not have the figures in respect of other industries which have been established there; these figures only relate to industries which are permitted to import raw materials. They were all free to go to Springs if they wished to do so.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>They were at liberty to go to Springs but 89 per cent of them were established in the central Rand area, in Johannesburg; only 8 per cent were established on the East Rand and 3 per cent were established on the West Rand. The point that I want to make is that we are faced here with the problem that even within that industrial complex people still want to establish industries in the most concentrated industrial areas. That is not a sound state of affairs. We must have decentralization both in that area and in other areas. The point I actually want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister is that if a city wants additional industrial land to-day, or if a municipality wants land, it cannot purchase that land if the provincial administration does not approve. The matter is referred to the provincial administration. The city council usually says that that land is required with a view to future industrial development, even though it has no intention to use that land for a considerable time to come and may eventually use the land for housing purposes. This matter is referred to the provincial administration which in its turn first has to obtain the approval of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. That Department then says: &#x201C;No, we do not want you to have more land for industrial development in the urban areas. We reject the application.&#x201D; The provincial administration therefore turns down the application of the municipality concerned to purchase that land. As a result of this we find that a considerable amount of land which municipalities could obtain at a reasonable price is lost to them. They may need that land for a housing scheme at a later stage and then it is no longer available to them.</p>

<p>I want to ask this question: &#x201C;What plan can we make in order to obtain that land?&#x201D; Our difficulty is that if we say that a municipality can buy land freely and there is no other method of control over industries, this may lead to industrial development in that area contrary to our policy. That is why I want to say that our control to-day in respect of the siting of industries is not as effective as it might be. Once industrial land is available it is very difficult to say to an industrialist: &#x201C;You cannot go to that area because you need too much Bantu labour&#x201D;. That is extremely difficult. As I see it, the only thing to do is for the hon. the Minister to assist us to work in the direction of the licensing of industries. After all, that is the system that is followed in England. No industry can be established in England to-day unless a licence is produced to show that that industry may be established at a particular place. As I see it, this is the most effective way in which we in South Africa can exercise proper control over industrial decentralization. Let us abolish control over land which a municipality wants to purchase but let us then institute control by requiring every industry which is sought to be established to be licensed. Then the State can come along and say: &#x201C;We will give you the licence on condition that your labour pattern complies with the conditions laid down in the licence&#x201D;. It will then be the easiest thing in the world to provide for the establishment of capital-intensive industries in the urban areas and for the establishment of labour-intensive industries in the border areas. That is the whole position in a nutshell. I have omitted all the frills and all the arguments for and against this proposition; I have merely contented myself with a bare statement of the case. Perhaps I shall be able to give more details at a later stage. I want to come back to what the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) said. I agree that our exports of manufactured goods to the Africa States have decreased but in the nature of things our policy is such that those states do not see eye to eye with us. We cannot settle that dispute in any normal way. I think at this stage we should forget about that market to a certain extent. A climate may develop in the future in which we may be able to develop those markets once again. As far as the marketing of our products abroad is concerned, depending of course upon whether we can market our products at prices which are competitive with those on the world market, I see no difficulty. I want to tell the hon. member that the story in connection with embargoes and so forth which had its origin in America is not worth the paper on which it is written. My honest opinion is that America realizes as well as any other responsible country that she cannot afford to lose the South African market. England realizes this too. If they do lose this market and they are responsible for losing it, the people who will suffer most in the first instance will be the three British Protectorates which lie adjacent to and within our borders.

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister whether he can tell us why he has not consulted with organized industry in regard to his coming meeting in Europe. Surely this should have been regarded as essential? I <span class="col_6197-6198" refersTo="page_432"/>understand it has not been done. I think it would have been a great help to him. Mr. Chairman, we all remember the statement by the hon. Minister some time ago to the effect that if the future of a nation is at stake economic laws must be broken. At that time he was referring to this vexed question of industries on the borders of the reserves. We do not agree. We differ entirely in our views on this matter. I say that the chickens have not yet come home to roost, but they certainly will. As the hon. member for Jeppes has said, our export of manufactured goods has dropped and is still dropping. As he said, our natural markets in the North are boycotting us and I think it is fairly reasonable to say that if it were not for the colossal war expenditure of the Government many of our industries would be finding themselves in serious difficulty. If the hon. Minister does not agree with me, let me refer him to remarks made by Dr. Rabie, the Director of Export Promotion of the Department of Commerce and Industries as reported in the <i>Star</i> of 16 September 1963. In this he said that South Africa&#x2019;s exports to Africa fell by R35,000,000 from 1957 to 1962 mostly, of course, occasioned by the 1960 Trade Agreement with Rhodesia. These figures were mentioned also, I think, by the hon. member for Jeppes. It must be obvious to anybody that this trend of a drop in manufactured exports, combined with an increase in the number of factories, must increase competition for the local market. I should like to tie up this particular breaking of economic laws with the encouragement of industries away from the great industrial area of the Rand, where mines are closing, to other areas near towns, in the name of the dispersal of industries to the borders of the reserves. We have told the hon. the Minister before that the cost per White employees in the new areas is twice as much as it is on the Reef, because of all the benefits which are already there. The Minister knows this, and he also knows that these diverted industries are being helped in many ways. He has just given us a White Paper and he has given us a statement on the benefits that they can give to them, and they are not bad. I have here the <i>Benoni City Times</i> of 15 May. Look at the headlines: &#x201C;Harder fight foreseen in struggle to win industry. Government generosity body blow to Benoni.&#x201D; This does not only apply to Benoni. It applies to Randfontein, Springs, Nigel and the lot. The effect of this general policy of the Government is particularly noticeable in the case of a cement factory in Roodepoort. I mentioned this to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. This factory was forced, through lack of Native labour, to open a branch at Rosslyn. It was not allowed to expand in Roodepoort just when a local gold mine, Consolidated Main Reef, was closing down. This factory was told there was no more Native labour available in Roodepoort, although there was plenty on the Reef. This hon. Minister and his Department have acquiesced in the action of his hon. colleague in refusing additional Native labour, and as I said the branch factory was forced away from Roodepoort to Pretoria just at the time when a local mine was closing. In addition at present a very great effort is being made to create the impression that there is a shortage of water on the Reef and that it cannot carry more industries. Their hearts are sore at the foolish things economically they are being forced to do by the Prime Minister, and this is the latest excuse. I am afraid they cannot get away with this one. I should like to quote from the report by the Natural Resources Development Council on the water supplies of the Vaal River in relation to its future development, which is dated February 1953. On page 4, it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In assessing the water requirements of the gold-mining industry, the sub-committee has based its estimates on the assumption that the price of gold will warrant the sustained development of the gold-mining industry. The sub-committee, however, considers that an increase in the price of gold may not bring about an immediate, large-scale expansion of the gold-mining industry, but rather an extension of its life&#x2026;Water saved on this estimate could easily be put to good use in other fields, especially in the field of irrigation and agriculture as will be pointed out later on.</block>

<p>On page 10 it reads as follows:</p>

<p>The sub-committee is of the opinion, however, that the creation of new industrial areas within the Vaal River Catchment Area should be discouraged, and that the creation of new industries should only be encouraged&#x2014;(a) in those areas where existing labour forces are concentrated in the vicinity of short-life mines, so as to provide new avenues of employment to the labour forces which are at present dependent on employment provided by the mines and allied industries, and which may otherwise become a social problem; and (b) where the geographical location of raw materials necessitates the placing of an industry in a particular vicinity. The subcommittee feels that it would not be unwarranted to assume that the above can be attained without unduly restrictive control, and that planned development of industrial expansion in the whole area can be attained.</p>

<p>On page 12 it is stated:</p>

<block name="quote">The sub-committee, therefore, feels that it is fully justified at this stage in budgeting for an increased gold price.</block>

<p>On page 17 this report refers to an address on the re-use of water by Dr. G. J. Stander. Dr. Stander&#x2019;s report is attached to this report. The final quotation I should like to make from this report is found on page. 6. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6199-6200" refersTo="page_433"/>&#x201C;It appears therefore that there need be no cause for undue alarm as to the water supplies of the future as far as the Vaal River is concerned provided certain precautions are taken. These may be enumerated as follows&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">No industries requiring large quantities of water and which do not for geographical reasons require to be placed there, should be permitted to establish themselves in the Vaal River basin.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Then, further in a paper delivered by Dr. H. H. McGregor to the Southern Transvaal Regional Development Association in May 1963 it was stated:</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Water Availability</i></block>

<block name="quote">From time to time, planning authorities have drawn attention to a degree of doubt as to the availability of water from the Vaal Basin for the supply of the future industrial requirements of the Witwatersrand Complex.</block>

<p>I am not going to read it all, but he goes on to say that it must be remembered that at present some 40,000,000 gallons of Rand Water Board water per day are used by the mining industry, and that this water will become available to the new industries which I hope will be established there in due course. Mr. Chairman, this question of there being a shortage of water on the Rand just will not wash. This technical report says that it is not correct. Mines are closing down. Mines use very large quantities of water which will become available for industry. I hope the hon. Minister will not try to hide behind a shortage of water on the Reef, because this shortage just does not exist. To try and solace his conscience in this way is futile. The Minister knows that economic laws are being broken. He knows that the Reef is being sacrificed. He knows that this industries on the borders of the reserves policy of the Prime Minister is doing absolutely nothing to keep the Africans away from White areas. I should like to ask him: &#x201C;Why does he acquiesce in this nonsense?&#x201D; We finally managed to get him to see the light in regard to assistance to low-grade mines in the area. Why does he not take the same common sense approach to industries in the Reef area? I do not know how he got that past the Cabinet, but he got it past anyway, so he must have something. I am talking about the gold-mine assistance. I hope he will do the same in regard to industries on the Reef because it is no use blinking this question. The Reef is being sacrificed for the benefit of this ideological nonsense of calling Pretoria a border area.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to say much about the economic progress on the Rand but it is far greater than it ever was. It is absolutely nonsensical of the hon. member to say that the economic progress on the Rand is being sacrificed because of the ideological policy of this Government. The hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) is in some difficulty. His difficulty is that a &#x201C;boom&#x201D; has caught him. An economic upsurge has caught him. He sits here in a dual capacity. I want to ask him whether he knows Dr. Frans Cronje, the Chairman of the Netherlands Bank, and what he thinks of him as an economist? I think a great deal of Dr. Cronje, the Chairman of the Netherlands Bank, as an economist. I think far more of him than I think of the economic knowledge of the hon. member for Jeppes. As I say, his difficulty is that that economic upsurge has caught him. When there was an economic slump, when there was a certain amount of unemployment, when we were struggling to get this economic development moving, the hon. member for Jeppes stood up in this House year after year and said: &#x201C;You will never succeed in starting the ball rolling as long as the policy of apartheid is followed. As long as you have job reservation, as long as you continue with your ideological policy there will be no progress in South Africa in the economic sphere. It will remain in this state of depression. It will remain just as static as it is and until you obey the economic laws, the economic laws of supply and demand, the economic laws of the free flow of labour, White or Black labour, we will never experience an economic upsurge in South Africa.&#x201D; We are experiencing an economic upsurge at present, an economic upsurge such as has been seldom experienced in this country, an upsurge greater than ever before, and what does the hon. member for Jeppes have to tell us now? He says that this economic upsurge could have been far greater if we had not followed a policy of separate development. The fact is that this economic upsurge has accompanied our policy of separate development; it has accompanied increasing separate development and it has accompanied the increasing application of the policy of the Government. I appreciate what the hon. member for Jeppes has said about the latest threat of Mr. Adlai Stevenson and I want to congratulate him on what he has said. The hon. member pointed out that if they apply economic sanctions, the first people to suffer under those sactions will be the Black people and that if those sactions are applied successfully, that state of affairs will greatly aggravate race relations in this country. I agree with that, but what did he say next? He said he wanted to tell Mr. Stevenson that the economic upsurge in South Africa would destroy separate development. I fully agree with him that this would be the case if we were to follow their policy. Not only would separate development be destroyed, if their policy was applied, their policy of <i>laissez-faire,</i> but the position of the White man in South Africa would also be destroyed. If they have their way and we experience the type of development which he has mentioned, they will have to concentrate all that development on the Rand, and no matter how much I want those areas to progress&#x2014;and they will progress as <span class="col_6201-6202" refersTo="page_434"/>swiftly as economic conditions permit them to progress&#x2014;if we experience an economic upsurge on the basis on which they want it, I have no doubt that it will destroy not only the whole policy of separate development but the position of the White man as well. The Whites will simply drown in a Black sea and the right of survival of the White man will be destroyed.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes has also said that border industries will increase the cost structure. But last session the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) warned us that these border industries would compete too strongly with industries on the Rand; he said that they would compete on a far cheaper basis because they could produce far more cheaply. How can both these arguments be correct? The hon. member for Yeoville says that they will produce cheaply and the hon. member for Jeppes says that they will increase the cost structure!</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes also told us that we must abolish job reservation. He said that there was a shortage of manpower. He asked why we could not make use of the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu for semiskilled and skilled work. This is the easiest thing in the world to say during a period of prosperity but once we have trained a vast army of Bantu to do semi-skilled and skilled work and we experience a period of low conjuncture, which is unavoidable in the economy of any country, we will be handing over our White workers to a veritable army of semi-skilled and skilled Bantu workers. The White worker will be the first to suffer when there is the slightest recession. We can only train the Bantu as semi-skilled or skilled workers in their own areas and in the border industries. Industrialists would, of course, welcome the abolition of job reservation, just as the mine-owners would welcome it. It would result in an immediate decrease in production costs. But it would be holding a dagger at the heart of our White workers and this Government would certainly not consider it.</p>

<p>I am in full agreement with the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) in connection with exports to Africa States that we must at the moment simply forget about the Africa States that are boycotting us. It is not our fault that they are doing this. They are doing it deliberately and it is an economic fact which we simply have to accept until such time as the attitude there changes. Why has the hon. member for Jeppes made a point of saying that our exports to those countries have decreased? There is nothing that we can do in that regard. We export to those countries via other places but obviously our exports have been affected to those areas. We have to face the economic fact that at the moment and as far as we can see, for the next number of years, we will not be able to develop markets in Africa. We will simply have to find markets elsewhere. Nobody can accuse this Minister and the Government of not having done everything humanly possible to expand our markets abroad. He sent missions to America, to Europe and to the East, all of which were very successful. All those missions did very good work and succeeded in developing our markets in Europe and particularly in the East. What greater success can we have than that achieved particularly by the mission to the East? Our trade with the East is more than it ever was before. Not only is it more than it ever was before but it is still increasing by leaps and bounds. Thus, instead of bemoaning our fate and instead of wasting our energy and time trying to make a breakthrough into the markets in the African States, even though they do not want to trade with us, it appears to me that it will be far better for us to concentrate all that energy upon other parts of the world. I think that the hon. the Minister deserves the congratulations of the House for the successful way in which he has done just that.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by associating myself with the plea of the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) in connection with the licensing of industries. Because we have a combination of municipalities on the one hand and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development on the other hand, all of whom have a say in regard to the siting of industries, our present system is extremely unwieldy. I cannot see why a formula cannot be found in this regard. For example, we can say that if an industry employs a certain number of Whites as against a certain number of Bantu, then that industry must be established in or be moved to the border areas. We can say that if the ratio of labour to capital is a certain figure, then the industries involved can be established in the present urban industrial areas. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I think the whole of our industrial development in this country is assuming a new pattern. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) says that in spite of the prophecies of doom of the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) as to the economic future of this country, we are experiencing boom conditions in this country to-day. Sir, we have a boom here at the present moment but let us examine the position. Do not forget that at the moment we have currency restrictions and we are restricted in cerain other ways. In addition to that we are spending a lot of money on Defence. When the hon. member talks about boom conditions he must ask himself how long these boom conditions will last. Sir, no country can live as an industrial country unless it expands its export markets and its internal markets. It has been pointed out here to-day that our exports are actually falling.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging talked about our trade with the <span class="col_6203-6204" refersTo="page_435"/>East. Sir, I would like to tell him that the tragedy of the situation is that enormous shipments of raw material are leaving this country every day. We are proud of the fact that we are exporting millions of tons of manganese ore and iron ore from our various ports to the Far East and other countries. Do hon. members opposite realize that this raw material is processed overseas? We buy some of it back in the shape of finished goods, but the rest goes on to the world market. The question has been raised as to why we ourselves do not process our own minerals. If other countries can find markets for the processed goods, why cannot we do so? Let me give hon. members one of the reasons. The hon. member was talking about job reservation. Does he realize that a lot of the raw material which leaves this country goes to a country where there is no job reservation, where the whole nation is able to play its part in the industrial expansion of that country, and does he realize that this country, Japan, has become one of the most prosperous countries in the world?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to say to the hon. member for Vereeniging that he must remember that it is absolutely necessary for us to increase the exports of our secondary industry. We have heard a great deal about our dying mines. It will still take a long time before our mines die, but as a growing country we must make provision for secondary industry to take the place of our gold mines. We cannot live in our own fat; we must have new and fresh capital coming into this country. We must export; we must export or die; that is the position of this country. Sir, we have some very big factories here but when we compare their output with that of other factories overseas, it is just like a drop in the ocean. In the motor industry we are to-day manufacturing parts, and we will probably reach the stage where eventually we will be able to build cars in this country. The factories which we are erecting can produce very much more than they are producing at the moment, but the cost structure will increase if we cannot at least export some of the parts that we are manufacturing. The motor industry cannot absorb all the parts that we are manufacturing in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#von_moltke">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>How many parts are we importing?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I know that manufacturers to-day are desperately trying to increase the export market, but it is not easy. We must realize that in order to be able to manufacture economically, whether it be tractors or any other article, you have to produce on a large scale. At the moment we do not have the export markets and our own population is not big enough. When I talk about our population I refer to the White population because unfortunately our non-White population has not been allowed to develop to the extent where they can become customers of our manufactured goods. Our small White population cannot absorb the terrific volume that these factories will eventually produce. Sir, that is the only way in which we can hope to go ahead in this country.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to say a few words about our fishing industry. This is one of our industries which has a terrific export market. We eat relatively little of the fish that we catch in this country. The bulk of it is exported. In order to develop this industry to the fullest extent we must naturally have the necessary harbour facilities. Apart from harbour facilities we must have cold storage facilities and we must have repair facilities. We are one of the largest exporters in the world of fish meal at the present moment, but except for Cape Town we have no cold storage facilities. I would like to tell the hon. member that at our small fishing harbours there are no cold storage facilities, apart from facilities which may be provided privately. I hope that the Government will do something in this connection. We have had statements in the Press and questions have been asked for years as to what is happening to the Cape Town fishing harbour. We have been told here that the Department of Commerce and Industry themselves are taking over the planning of this particular harbour, and they will eventually let us know what they propose to do. Sir, as you know it takes a long time to build a harbour; it takes a matter of years after the planning has been completed, and one is a little disappointed to see that the hon. the Minister has only made provision for R5,000 on his Revenue Vote for investigations of this harbour, but he has provided no capital funds even if he decides to build a harbour to-morrow. So it will be another year before we come back to this House in order to vote the money for this particular harbour. When it comes to the other important harbours along our coast we find that provision is made for something like R4,263,000 of which the hon. the Minister is only going to spend R734,000 this year. That is a drop in the ocean, of course, because harbours take time to build and are expensive. We find that the fishing industry itself has the greatest confidence in that industry. They are spending millions of rand on the erection of factories and processing plant but you find that the Government is lagging behind. I can only appeal to the hon. the Minister to do something about it. He has stated that he has a project in connection with these harbours and I wish to ask him whether he cannot, at this stage, table a White Paper so that we can know what he intends doing for this industry.

<p>I see. It is a border area but not a border industry area. That is fine. We are getting this split personality again of the Bantu Administration Department and the Department of Economic Affairs. I want this point cleared up by referring to the Minister of Economic Affairs the situation as revealed by the hon. member of the Bantu Affairs Commission and the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I see. I want to ask the hon. Minister for Economic Affairs whether he will now tell us the difference between a border area and a border industry area. I know all about the benefits attaching to a border industry area. But I want to know what is the difference between Pietermaritzburg which is a border area and Hammarsdale, for instance, which is a border industry area? Or what is the difference between Hammarsdale and East London and Pinetown for instance. They are all border areas. But what is the factor which differentiates between a border area and a border industrial area? We know the benefits of being a border industry area but we want to know why some places are classified as border industry areas and others only as border areas. If they are all border areas then they are serving the same purpose politically, in terms of the Bantustan philosophy, wherever they may be because they are providing employment to Bantu living in the Bantu areas. Therefore a border area, whether it is classified as a border industry area or not, is serving exactly the same purpose. Are we then to assume that the difference and the reason for not classifying Durban as a border industry area is purely one of arbitrary decision. What does an area have to do, what does it have to have to get the favour of being classified as a border industries area? What has East London got that Durban has not got? Durban has got a lot more industries. Why should she be penalized because she has got industries? We on this side of the House have always been absolutely clear in regard to this. We are in favour of the decentralization of industries and the growth of industry in any area and at any centre where it is justified, where it is economically justified, where it can survive as an economic entity. But we are opposed to the artificial use of the economy of South Africa in order to try to carry out a hare-brain political philosophy or ideology, and the more we go on with the debates in regard to this situation, the more utterly crazy and hare-brained the whole position appears to be. This position of borders that are not borders, industrial areas which are not industrial areas&#x2014;the whole thing is becoming a mockery! And this hon. Minister is the Minister who is being made the tool of the policy of the Prime Minister and the ideology of the Prime Minister. He and the whole economy for which he is responsible is being used as a tool to make political capital in order to further a political philosophy. We believe that is not in the interests of South Africa, it is not in the interests of the economy of this country, and it is not in the interests of the future security of this country. That is why we on this side of the House plead with the hon. the Minister, as we have pleaded before &#x201C;let us put first things first&#x201D;. We want South Africa to go ahead, we want and we support the decentralization of industries.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>When the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) spoke yesterday, his opening remarks were that he had heard the same story from the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) that he had been hearing for 16 years. Now this is true; he has been hearing the same story. He has been hearing the story of how to keep South Africa on an even financial keel, despite the actions of the Government, because every year the Government has either introduced legislation or the Ministers by way of statements have indicated policies, the effect of which, if they were properly carried out, would have radically interfered with the normal expansion of industry in this country. But the putting into effect of these grandiose schemes of the Government has been so ineffective that they have neither achieved what they have set out to do, nor, unfortunately, have they interfered with private enterprise so drastically that the forward march of the economy of this country has been stopped. But, because of the poor results achieved by the measures the Government has promulgated, each year we are faced with a little more and a little more in an attempt to achieve what they have set out to do, and a typical case is that of border industries.</p>

<p>In reply to a question put on 21 April this year, the hon. the Minister told the House that from 1961 to date, a period of three years, some R65,000,000 had been spent on border industries by private enterprise and by the State. Presumably a fairly large portion of this amount had been spent prior to the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy of the establishment of border industries. He also told us that some 12,786 Bantu were employed in these industries. It therefore becomes quite clear that this sort of development is far too slow really to mean anything in the policy of the Government, and therefore it is quite obvious that they have to take further steps to try to ensure that more than 4,000 Bantu per annum can be diverted and employed in Bantu industries. This is confirmed by the report of the Permanent Committee for the Location of Industries and the Development of Border Industries for the year ended 31 December 1963, which was tabled on 10 April this year. This report tells us that during the year 72 applications for assistance were dealt with, 18 were approved, 28 were receiving attention and 26 were withdrawn or refused; that R3,600,000 had been made available in eight cases through the Industrial Development Corporation; that in ten cases income-tax concessions to the extent of approximately R45,000 had been granted on investments to the value of approximately R1,500,000, and that investments to the extent of about R2,300,000 were still under consideration for tax relief. Then, finally, the report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Substantial progress has been made &#x2026;</block>

<p>Of course the interpretation of &#x201C;substantial&#x201D; varies according to the way one looks at it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in connection with the development of the border areas during the year under review. It is, however, clear that the rate of development will have to be accelerated if it is to afford a major contribution to the solution of the country&#x2019;s social and economic problems. With this end in view, the assistance that can be extended to industries in the border areas has been reviewed by the Permanent Committee in the light of the experience gained in the past few years.</block>

<p>The Government has been quick to take note of this general paragraph in the report, because on 30 April this year the Minister announced additional help for the border industries. It is interesting to note that, although Parliament was sitting, the Minister did not find it necessary to report to Parliament, but he made this statement externally, which is becoming a habit of Ministers. All these statements of policy are not made in the House any more, but at the opening of shows and at banquets, etc., and the first the House hears about these statements of policy is when hon. members read about it in the papers. In any case the Minister was good enough to give us not a White Paper but a statement of the measures approved for border industries. Here the policy of the Government continues as I originally set it out. There is a statement of what is to be done, failure to achieve anything, and then further steps are taken to set things right. We find that to-day a great deal of very valuable assistance is being given to border industries by way of tax allowances, cheap electricity and water, special railage rates and special allowances which, in some cases, can amount to no less than 72 per cent in the first year, of the amount invested. So we find the situation whereby, slowly but surely and progressively, bolder industries are becoming an increasingly greater threat to the normal industries of this country.</p>

<p>Here I want to refer again to the hon. member for Pretoria (Central). He said yesterday that this question of decentralization did not mean that all decentralized industry was going to the border areas; that an industry could be decentralized anywhere in South Africa. I want to ask the hon. member a very simple question: Will he tell this House that the benefits offered to border industries in terms of this statement by the Minister <span class="col_6221-6222" refersTo="page_444"/>will apply to industries which are decentralized to non-border areas? In other words, if someone wants to decentralize to Bultfontein or any other small town, will these benefits which are being given to border industries also be given to the industries in those small towns? Because that is what the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) tried to tell the House. We know it is not correct, and that nothing will be offered to these industries, and it is no good the hon. member coming to this House and talking a lot of nonsense.</p>

<p>If we are to increase the volume of industry in this country, it has to be done not only by increased internal consumption but by export. I think the time has come when we can expect from the Minister a full statement as to what is happening on the export front; what steps he has taken to increase our overseas trade representation and what the position is with Safto, because Safto receives a fairly large subsidy from the Government, and it is working very closely with the Department, and I think it is doing very good work. I must give the Minister credit for this: that, since 1961, when the three missions went abroad, much has been done, but much still remains to be done. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to raise two matters. The first is in reply to the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) in connection with border industries. He alleged yesterday that it was nonsensical to contend that there were border areas and border industry areas. I want to say that the policy in regard to border industries must be seen against the background of the broad framework of the decentralization of industries. When we talk about the decentralization of industries we realize that a prerequisite for the decentralization of industries is that there should be no further centralization of industries. Take an area like Durban, where industries are already centralized. It would be silly to classify Durban as a border industry area. This would simply mean that that would be a greater centralization of industries in that area. This would, therefore, wreck the policy of decentralization. But that does not mean to say that, because Durban cannot be classified for the decentralization of industries, it is not a border area as far as the Bantu are concerned, because there are Bantu areas abutting the industrial area of Durban. Those Bantu living there can, as is the case in regard to the border industries, also live in their own area but work in the centralized industries in Durban. Surely it must be clear that this is also the case as far as Pietermaritzburg is concerned. The hon. member said that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) had apparently overstepped the mark, but that he had not advocated Government policy in asking that industries be established at Pietermaritzburg. Pietermaritzburg is also a place in which industries are centralized and therefore, if one advocates the establishment of more industries there, that is not decentralization. As it happens, Pietermaritzburg is in the same position as Durban and industries there are well situated as far as the Bantu are concerned. These are two areas in which industries are centralized, and if more industries are established there, those industries will simply become more centralized.</p>

<p>I come now to the second point in regard to the decentralization of industries to the border areas. In this regard the decisive factor is that these industries must be labour-intensive industries; in other words, industries employing a large number of Bantu labourers. That is a requirement. Those industries using a large number of Bantu labourers will then move to those areas, to the borders of the Bantu areas, in order to provide the Bantu there with employment. The hon. member for Durban (Point) asked; Why East London? I want to mention East London as a specific case. East London has stagnated for the past 20 years; there has been hardly any industrial expansion at East London. It has stagnated. But there is a Bantu area at East London in which many Bantu live, and that is why it is a suitable area to which to attract border industries because the labour is available there. But when one talks about a border area which has Bantu living close to it, but which is centralized as far as industries are concerned, it does not mean to say that the Bantu there cannot work according to the same pattern as that followed in the border industry areas.</p>

<p>This bring me to the second point mentioned by the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin). He said that it was stated that there are now 12,000 Bantu employed in border industries. The Department of Commerce and Industries makes concessions for border industries according to certain norms which it sets, and it is the industries in which those 12,000 Bantu are employed which it has classified as border industries. But, according to the survey made by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, if we take the number of Bantu employed in industries, not only in those industries which have been classified as border industries by the Department of Commerce and Industries, but in all industries in areas bordering upon Bantu areas, thus including the centralized metropolitan areas, the Bantu working in the industries, but living in the Bantu areas, we find that there are already 42,000 Bantu employed in this way. These are Bantu living in their own area but working in the industries close to the Bantu areas.</p>

They think that when we speak of a border industry we are referring to an industry which is always in the &#x201C;Bundu&#x201D;, away from all civilization. But that is quite the wrong attitude to adopt.</p>

<p><span class="col_6223-6224" refersTo="page_445"/>I want to come to another point. I want to refer to Phalaborwa, and I want to ask a question in this connection, because I am particularly interested in this matter as the representative of a platteland constituency. A fertilizer factory has now been established there in which three important undertakings have an interest. I understand&#x2014;I do not know whether it is true or not&#x2014;that that fertilizer factory will start producing early in 1965. They are going to produce phosphates, a fertilizer which will be used by the farmers. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether the policy is going to be to pack those phosphates at Phalaborwa and to distribute them from there. I mention this, because there is talk that the phosphates will be produced there, but that it will be transported in bulk to Sasolburg or to the Rand to be granulated and packed there and also distributed from there. I think that it is a wrong policy to transport phosphates in bulk to the Rand and to have it granulated, packed and distributed from there. I think that the Northern Transvaal ought to obtain the artificial fertilizer from Phalaborwa direct. I should like to have clarity in regard to this matter.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has now highlighted what we on this side have been trying to emphasize for a long time, that the control of the economy of South Africa is passing out of the hands of the Minister of Economic Affairs and is now being controlled by the Commissioner for Bantu Affairs. It is now he who is to determine what is a border industry, and he who makes policy statements on Phalaborwa, an industry in which the I.D.C. is concerned, and he who tells this House what is a border and what is a border industry, and not the Minister or his Deputy. They have become pawns of the ideological obsession of this Government and they are now being told by Bantu Administration how they are to run the industrial affairs of South Africa. The Minister can pretend still to control his Department, but the fact that the replies to my questions to him are given by Bantu Administration is the evidence. What were the questions I asked? I asked what the difference was between a border area and a border industry area. The hon. member told us that the distinction is going to be decided apparently by the number of Bantu in any industry and how it fits in with their political pattern. What he has disclosed is exactly what we of the United Party have maintained. We have maintained that there are double standards, and in this case treble standards, making up the gigantic bluff of the policy of the Government, because we have been given three sets of figures in regard to the employment of Bantu. We have one issued by the Minister&#x2019;s Committee for the Location of Industries and the Development of Border Areas, which indicates that 4,389 Bantu have been employed in border industry areas as the result of Government assistance, and that is the figure that matters. The effect which Government policy and Government assistance have had on the employment of Bantu is that 4,389 Bantu have been employed at an expenditure of R12,900,000, at a cost of R2,700 per Bantu employed. That is what is important and what South Africa must know, that the taxpayer is paying R2,700&#x2014;that is the average over three years&#x2014;per Bantu employed in a border area. But then we get a second set of figures supplied by the Minister of Economic Affairs in reply to a question on 21 April. There the Minister added to the figure given by his Committee; that figure became 7,700, and he added 5,000 Bantu from what he said were the 50 existing industries which had expanded. So he got a figure of 12,000, including the ordinary employment as the result of industrial expansion without Government assistance. Then the hon. member for Heilbron, and the Minister of Bantu Administration, comes with a third set of figures, and those are the figures they want South Africa to believe, a set of figures indicating that 42,000 Bantu are employed in border areas. But where does that figure of 42,000 come from? We have just been told that all the Bantu of Durban, working in Durban and living in Umlazi, are included in that figure, but they are not employed as a result of Government policy. They have been employed all along&#x2014;ever since there has been industry in Durban. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Heilbron clearly stated that that included Umlazi. It includes areas such as Durban and Pietermaritzburg and it includes all the industries which in the normal course have developed as part of the economic growth of South Africa. That establishes the fact which I stated last night and which I now want to emphasize, that the United Party has always been in favour of the decentralization of industry in terms of sound economic laws and principles.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to reply to the accusations of the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) to the effect that the control over industry has now been taken out of the hands of the hon. the Minister and has now been vested in the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). I can only say that a remark of that nature is so petty and cheap that it does not warrant a reply.</p>

<p>I want to bring a matter of the greatest importance to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot perhaps give us some information in this regard. It is contended that in the not too distant future there will be a shortage of water in the Vaal basin. If this happens I can imagine what the position will be in regard to our industrial development in those areas which are to-day supplied by water from the Vaal River. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister, if there is any real danger of this happening&#x2014;and I believe that there is&#x2014;what steps are going to be taken in order to overcome that shortage of water. If the areas that are to-day being supplied by <span class="col_6225-6226" refersTo="page_446"/>water from the Vaal River experience a shortage of water and if the industrial development there, which is going to increase far more in the future, continues, a position will arise which it will be difficult to overcome. This will affect the whole of the Witwatersrand; it will affect the Free State goldfields as well as the industrial complex of Vereeniging. It will affect Vanderbijlpark; it will affect Sasolburg and it will affect the Vaalhartz settlement about which I am particularly concerned. The Vaalhartz settlement is an area which has a tremendous future potential and I should like to know what is going to happen there. If there is a water shortage it will mean that an area of between 45,000 and 48,000 morgen of land will be affected; that is, apart from the industrial development that may take place in that area. This shortage will affect the Kimberley diamond fields and it will also affect the possible industrial development of the Northern Cape. It is difficult for one to predict to-day the extent of industrial development in that area. Apparently the surface has not yet even been scratched in this regard. These are all matters which make it necessary for us to give attention to the water supplies of the Vaal basin. Other areas too will be affected. There is Pretoria which falls outside of that area and there are the mineral riches of the whole of the Cape which will be affected thereby. If this is to happen and there is no prior planning in order to combat this state of affairs, one can imagine what the position will be in the foreseeable future. I am aware of the fact that a conference was held at Potchefstroom on 3 February at which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs was present. It was decided at that conference to appoint two committees, a general aid committee and a work committee consisting of technical persons, to give specific guidance in connection with this matter. I should like to know whether those two committees are already operating and, if so, who the members of those committees are. I should also like to know from the hon. the Minister further what policy is going to be followed in those areas. Can a policy of the centralization of industries be followed or will a policy of decentralization be followed? I want to associate myself with the suggestion made here by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) in connection with the licensing of industries. I want to say that if this is done there is the possibility of our being able to ascertain more or less where industries should be established. But if this is not done and industries are centralized it appears to me as a layman that this may constitute a danger in time of trouble from a strategic point of view. I should like therefore to know from the hon. the Minister whether a policy of decentralization will be followed there. If a policy of decentralization is to be followed there I feel that it is highly desirable to draw up a long-term plan. There is the area of the Northern Cape, for example, which has tremendous potential as far as industrial development is concerned. Practically everything needed for industrial development is available there. There is power, there are raw materials and there is water, provided that the Vaal basin can always supply it. All that is needed is coal but I contend that coal will in the foreseeable future be replaced by nuclear power. If coal is replaced by nuclear power then there will be nothing to prevent tremendous expansion taking place in the whole area of the Northern Cape. Sir, I should like to make this suggestion in regard to the potential of the Northern Cape: It is contended that a country can never be completely independent unless it can provide its own steel requirements. We know what Iscor is already doing to-day but I predict that Iscor will still have to undergo tremendous expansion in order to provide the future steel requirements of the Republic of South Africa.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has made a special plea for the small towns. I would like to draw his attention to a report which appeared in the <i>Burger</i> of 30 April 1963 of a speech made by Dr. Norval, in the course of which he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Gee voorkeur aan blanke dorpe: Hulle moet die geleentheid gegun word om nywerhede te lok sodat hulle die trek na die stede kan teenwerk en gunstiger toestande kan skep vir die groei van die blanke bevolking.</block>

<p>Sir, that is our case. We have said that we are not against decentralization as long as it is economic, but what we are opposed to is decentralization for the purpose of establishing border industries, which is not based on economic lines but which is resorted to merely in order to fulfil Government ideology. Sir, I want to come back to the speeches made here yesterday by the hon. members for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) and Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), both of whom advocated the licensing of industries. The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) advocated the licensing of industries and he was supported in that plea by the hon. member for Vereeniging. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister, particularly as he has indicated that he champions free enterprise, whether that is the policy of his Government; whether the hon. members for Pretoria (Central) and Vereeniging were merely flying a kite or whether they were speaking on behalf of their party in advocating the licensing of industries. It seems to me that what the Government is doing, through the Minister, is to offer inducements to private enterprise to establish industries in border areas, and now the Minister is taking further powers, if these hon. members are to be relied upon, to coerce industry by licensing, thus ensuring that only certain industries can be established. I would like the hon. the Minister to make it quite clear whether it is the policy of the Government to license industries in the future; whether he has had any discussions with the Federated Chamber of Industries along those lines, and <span class="col_6227-6228" refersTo="page_447"/>whether that is going to be the policy of his Department, because it does seem to me that he is going to run into a lot of difficulty if that is going to be his policy. Or is he going to ignore the suggestions made by those two hon. members? I would like to know from the Minister what his policy is with regard to the question of markets. The hon. member for Vereeniging indicated that for the foreseeable future the markets in Africa can be ignored. He indicated that there was very little prospect of developing those markets. Let me quote the hon. member&#x2019;s own words; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar ons moet die ekonomiese feit in die gesig staar dat ons op die oomblik en sover ons kan sien vir die volgende aantal jare, nie uitbreidende markte in Afrika het nie.</block>

<p>The Minister has indicated that he is interested in developing markets in all parts of the world. He has been particularly active in the East. The Minister is shortly going to a conference in Geneva and I would like to know from him how he is going to deal with a country like Japan which is to-day treated in the highest brackets as far as duties are concerned. With the development of the market in Japan and with the development of markets in the East, is the time not going to come when they are going to demand a <i>quid pro quo</i>? Has pressure not already been brought to bear on this country to lower the duties on certain textiles to give Japan more favourable treatment than she is enjoying at the present time, in return for the large volume of business which Japan is giving us to-day? I submit that that is an important factor which must be taken into account. The Japanese businessmen who are touring Africa with full order books are not going to take kindly to duties which exclude them. As the Minister well knows, they are in the highest duty bracket at the moment and I should like to know from the Minister whether as a result of this trade with Japan South African industries, who will have to face competition if the tariffs are reduced, will be called upon to make further sacrifices. I think those are factors which will have to be taken into account and on which the hon. the Minister owes a reply to this committee.</p>

<p>The Minister has also indicated in this paper which he has made available to us, &#x201C;Measures Approved by the Government for the encouragement of industrial development in the border areas&#x201D;, that one of the factors taken into account in establishing border industries is the number of Bantu employed. I should like the hon. the Minister to let us know what factors are taken into account. Is it the number of Bantu employed in relation to the capital cost of the machinery, or is it just a total number of Bantu employed? Because this Paper indicates that there is going to be an investment allowance of 25 per cent on buildings and an initial allowance of 30 per cent on machinery and an investment allowance of 35 per cent on machinery, in those cases where industries are established in the border areas. I understand from the remarks made by the hon. member for Heilbron that the Minister will take into account the number of Bantu employed. What happens in this case when an industry is established in a border area, based on a certain number of employees; that industry gets the investment allowance on buildings, the investment allowance on machinery, and then after a reasonably short time the industry introduces automation. It is then able to run its industry with a considerably reduced Bantu staff. What happens then? You see, Sir, it is quite easy for an industrialist to establish a factory requiring, say, 3,000 employees. By the introduction of automation it can cut that figure down by 75 per cent. If the Minister goes to my own constituency, Hammarsdale, he will see a factory there making canvas and making extensive use of automation. Very few Bantu are employed in that particular factory. In some of the factories there there is a high degree of Bantu labour in relation to the number of European employees, but in one factory particularly there is very expensive machinery and very little Bantu labour indeed. Because the factory is one of the latest of its kind there is a high degree of mechanization in that factory. I am not suggesting for one moment that that factory started in that way. It has not cut down its employees. But I can conceive of a factory of a similar nature, particularly a textile factory, using hand-supervised looms, as against a factory with automatic looms. Such a factory could start with an investment allowance on its factory building and then get hand-supervised looms where a considerable amount of manual labour is required, and then after a year or two that factory could introduce further machinery, claim the investment allowance of 25 per cent, claim the additional depreciation because it is in a border area, and then as soon as its labourers finish their terms of contract, dispense with their services. It could cut its labour by as much as 75 per cent and get all the benefits of a border industry and all the benefits of automation. I should like to know whether the Minister has given his attention to this particular problem. I should like him to tell us whether he decides whether an industry is a border industry or not or whether that decision is taken by his colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, because I submit that the Minister of Bantu Administration does not have the technical knowledge in his Department that the Department of Commerce and Industry does have at its disposal.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to deal with the question of the electrification of the rural areas. I take the liberty of raising this matter because Section 20 of the Electricity Act of 1958 makes provision whereby the Commission can make certain regulations, amongst others, regarding the building of powerlines and the fees to be imposed in this regard, and because the same section makes <span class="col_6229-6230" refersTo="page_448"/>provision whereby the Minister must approve of these regulations. I contend that people on the platteland and the farming community in general are not satisfied with the rate at which the electrification of the platteland is being proceeded with. In its report which was sent to the Minister in June 1963, and which was Tabled in this House, Escom has the following to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A great deal of work was done on schemes which did not prove successful because the farmers found the terms too high and so Escom had to shelve its plans.</block>

<p>The important reason why the electrification of the platteland is being proceeded with so slowly is because power is too expensive. The difficulty is that the building of powerlines is expensive not only in sparsely-populated areas but in reasonably intensive farming communities. Take an area like my own constituency which is a reasonably intensive farming area. Quite a few schemes have failed there over the past year because power would have cost the farmers as much as R30 per month, largely because of the large amount of capital required for the building of power lines. In this regard it is not simply a question of whether the farmers should be provided with electricity or not; it goes much further than that. Some years ago the commission investigating European occupation of the platteland found that if the platteland could be electrified swiftly and effectively, this would be one of the most important means of stimulating White occupation of the platteland. That is why I want this afternoon to urge the hon. the Minister most courteously to have this question of the electrification of the platteland further and very thoroughly investigated either by a commission of inquiry or a departmental committee of inquiry; that careful attention be given to specific aspects of the matter, in the first instance, the question of a reduction in the amount levied for expansion purposes or the capital costs connected with the provision of electricity. For example, attention can be given to the possibility of giving farmers more opportunity of undertaking the construction work themselves. Manpower can be saved in this way and large sums of money can also be saved by this means. In the second instance, attention can be given to the subsidization of the small-scale farmer in this connection. If a farmer can be assisted to improve his farm by the construction of dams and so forth, then it is my humble opinion that he can also be assisted to have his farm electrified, particularly as far as the capital works in this regard are concerned. In the last instance, attention can be given by a commission of inquiry of this nature to ways and means of accelerating and facilitating the supplying of electricity to the platteland in order to enable our farming community to enjoy all the fruits and advantages of our modern civilization.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to tell the hon. member who has just sat down that I agree with him that this Government has been rather remiss in extending electrification into the rural areas. Our neighbour, Southern Rhodesia, is much further advanced in that regard than we are, and I agree with the hon. member&#x2019;s plea.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the comments or rather the veiled proposals which were made by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) and certain speakers on his side who followed him when, under the pretext of speaking in the interests of the decentralization of industry, they put up a plea that their should be licensing of industrial development through some central authority. I think the hon. the Minister should tell the House precisely what his reactions are to that suggestion and to what extent he agrees with this newly suggested shackling of free enterprise in the country. Sir, it is noticeable that this is the second occasion recently on which a plea has been put up for some form of regimentation of private industrial enterprise, and I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he agrees with the views which were recently expressed by the Chairman of Sasol, only about eight or ten days ago, who is reported to have criticized South Africans for making what he called a fetish of private enterprise. He seems not only to have extolled the advantages of State-controlled enterprise but to have damned with faint praise the virtues of private enterprise. He reported to have concluded by saying this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Amongst the disabilities of private enterprise were that many small entrepreneurs and business managers&#x2014;and some large ones&#x2014;had no hesitation about exploiting the general public.</block>

<p>Sir, that is a very serious statement to have been made by a gentleman holding such high office in South Africa. I say therefore that if the Government is sincere about its attempt to assure foreign investors that the Government is in favour of expansion of private enterprise in South Africa, then there is a very pertinent obligation on the Minister today to repudiate, or at any rate to tone down, the views expressed by the head of one of South Africa&#x2019;s largest State-controlled industrial undertakings, and also to reassure private enterprise in regard to the suggestions made across the floor of the House yesterday and to-day in regard to this further shackling of private development by means of a new form of licensing through some central control.</p>

<p>Sir, I particularly want to get some information from the hon. the Minister in regard to the appropriation of funds to the I.D.C. for carrying into effect the Government&#x2019;s policy of promoting industrial development in the so-called border areas. Judging from the statement which has been referred to by other speakers and which the hon. the Minister made outside this House recently, it is evident that the bait which is presently being offered by the I.D.C. to industrialists is not tempting enough to land <span class="col_6231-6232" refersTo="page_449"/>the big fish that the Government needs for the success of its scheme. Reference has also been made to the report of the Permanent Committee for the Location of Industries for 1963, which also seems to confirm that there has been no great urge on the part of industrialists to accept the bait offered to them by the I.D.C. The report says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The rate of development will have to be accelerated if the scheme is to provide a major contribution to the solution of the country&#x2019;s social and economic problems.</block>

<p>Sir, I can forgive the Permanent Committee for attempting to view the problem from the social and economic angles, but, of course, the fact of the matter is that what is motivating the scheme so far as the Government is concerned is politics and not economics, and therein lies the real rub. This is the fourth year in succession in which public funds have been placed in the hands of the I.D.C. to lure industrialists to the border areas, but in all that time this House has not had a single statement of account either from the I.D.C. itself or from the Minister or from his Department as to what use these moneys are being put. The House and the public whose money it is have been left completely in the dark as to what the money has produced in terms of industrial output or economic development, or as to how these moneys have been invested. When I raised this matter with the hon. the Minister on 31 January by way of question, all I got from him was a certain amount of vague information and some muddled figures. The information was minimal and as far as the figures were concerned the information was incorrect. When I drew attention to this some five days later neither the Minister nor the Deputy tried, or has at any stage since then tried, to correct the information and to say what the actual position is. Treatment of that kind may be contempt of myself, which is unimportant, but it is also contempt of this House. This form of development is not the decentralization of industry, of which the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) has spoken and for which the chairman of the I.D.C. himself has pleaded in his latest report. In his latest report the chairman of the I.D.C. spoke of the extension of the concept of decentralization to undertakings in other suitable areas of the country. He urges that that form of decentralization should be based on proper economic and practical grounds. He says the Government should develop a policy which is positively shaped to encourage industrial decentralization.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has not yet reacted to this suggestion by the Chairman of the I.D.C. He has left us completely in the dark in that regard. But I have said the policy for which public moneys have been voted in respect of the expansion of the industrial enterprise in border areas is politically inspired. Dr. van Eck points out in his report &#x201C;that the scheme postulates the offer of financial benefits to the entrepreneur to off-set the disadvantages which he will encounter&#x201D;. He mentions two types of financial aid. He says it offers fully-serviced factories built to agreed specifications and design and, secondly, it offers loans for equipment and for working purposes. One would have thought that in itself would have been a substantial inducement, but the Minister now tells us that these benefits are still not enough. When the Minister now tries to make the bait still more attractive in order to land the bigger industrial catches in the border areas then I, for one, should like to have information as to what has happened to the millions of rand that have already been sunk into that development [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I think we are all glad to see that the Opposition has undergone a change in regard to their approach to economic problems. We all remember that in former years they repeatedly told us in this Commitee of the deplorable economic position in which the country found itself and of the dark days ahead of us. We have now seen in this debate that the Opposition felt it should realize that South Africa is experiencing a period of unprecedented prosperity. The Opposition has realized that South Africa&#x2019;s economy to-day is perhaps developing faster than possibly that of any other country in the world; that our economy to-day is the one with the greatest dynamic force, and can perhaps be compared only with that of Japan; that we have succeeded in achieving tremendous economic development, in spite of the jeremiads, and in doing so without inflation and with only a slight increase in prices. I am very glad to see that hon. members of the Opposition now realize this.</p>

<p>I regret to see that the Opposition, in respect of one important problem, has now come along for the umpteenth year with the same complaints and the same criticism, viz. in regard to the development of industries along the borders of the Bantu areas. I want to predict, Sir, that the day will arrive when the Opposition will also surrender on that point and realize that its criticism and its present attitude was wrong. It will not surprise me if the day arrives when the Opposition, as it has done in other respects, tells us that they, and not we, are the father of this scheme. The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) spoke about &#x201C;the grandiose schemes of the Government&#x201D;, which were all failures. I wonder whether he referred to Iscor, or to Sasol or to Foscor, or to any other scheme of the Government which resulted in failure, so that the Government later had to put an end to it?</p>

<p>There is already a change of attitude in regard to border industries on the part of the Opposition, but we notice that certain prominent industrialists in the country, who formerly were critical of the border industry policy, have changed their minds and now agree with us that this type of industry should<span class="col_6233-6234" refersTo="page_450"/>be promoted. I think a gradual change is also coming about in the minds of the Opposition in this regard. It was no less a person than the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who, during the no-confidence debate at the beginning of the Session, like other hon. members, referred to the speech of the Chairman of the Industrial Development Corporation. The Leader of the Opposition asked whether we would not consider decentralizing to rural areas, to White areas. He pointed out the necessity for decentralization to the rural areas because, as he said, it appeared that the rural areas were becoming increasingly Black. It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition and other hon. members opposite thereby admitted that there was a danger in the over-concentration of industries and that it was essential to guide industries away from the urban areas to other areas. The hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) says that there is no over-concentration. But one hon. member after the other pleads for decentralization. They thereby concede that they believe it is unhealthy for all industries to be concentrated in a few large areas and that it would be advantageous to the country to send certain industries away from the urban areas to the rural areas.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went even further. He spoke about sufficient encouragement. There was reference to encouragement on the same basis as that which is given to border industries. Now I ask you, Sir: The argument is continuously being advanced that border industries are uneconomic. This proposition is proved, according to the Opposition, by the fact that special concessions are granted to them. Now the Leader of the Opposition pleads that we should grant the same concessions to the rural areas. Now I want to ask this: If one has to make concessions there also, are those industries not uneconomic too? Do they not now recognize the principle that it is justifiable for a country under certain circumstances to grant concessions to industries in order to decentralize them? Initially they may be uneconomic, but it is in the interest of the country to draw them away from the large urban areas to the rural and other areas. Are we to accept, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, that certain parts of the country will become increasingly Black and that that is dangerous, or are we to accept that it is the policy of the Opposition to prevent the Whites from flocking to the cities, and that we should allow as many Blacks as possible to go to the cities? Is that what the hon. member for Jeppes meant when he asked what was the use of making certain areas Whiter and others Blacker? Are we to infer from that that we should try to keep the White man out of the cities by decentralizing to the rural areas; the White man should not go to the cities, but the Black men can go there in unlimited numbers?</p>

<p>Then it is argued that the areas to which we want to send these people are uneconomic areas from the point of view of the establishment of industries. I want to refer here to the Viljoen Report, which we all know. A few years ago I was attacked in this House because it was alleged that we did not implement the recommendations of the Viljoen Report. Hon. members opposite assured me that they accepted the recommendations of that report in regard to the establishment of industries. This report says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the important industrial areas that can be developed in this country lie in the area between the eastern escarpment and the sea, and therefore in the immediate vicinity of Native areas, the policy of encouraging the decentralization of industries conforms broadly with the policy of the Government of developing industries near the reserves.</block>

<p>In other words, we are told in that report that the areas where industries should be established on the ordinary basis of decentralization are more or less the same areas which also come into consideration for border industry development because they have the natural resources available. We do not send the border industries into the &#x201C;bundu&#x201D;, as someone said here. Those particular areas which now come into consideration for development, particularly in Natal, are areas richly endowed with water, agricultural and other raw materials, coal and iron ore, phosphates, platinum, copper, chrome, and particularly labour, which is the greatest asset. Those are not uneconomic areas. They are areas which would also have been considered in an ordinary programme of decentralization, apart from border industry development.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes said that there was no over-concentration of industries in South Africa. The hon. member compared us with other countries in Europe. Because there is no over-concentration&#x2014;just the opposite of what his Leader said or implied&#x2014;it is not necessary to decentralize industries. We admit that the same position does not exist here which exists in, e.g. Paris or in London. We do not have those large urban areas, but are we now to wait until we have reached that stage? Are we to wait, as those countries waited, until it is too late? They now find that they made a mistake in allowing their areas to develop in that way, and to-day one may no longer establish an industry in London or in Paris. Is that not overconcentration? When 76 per cent of one&#x2019;s industrial workers are concentrated in four areas in South Africa, and when one considers the industrial production, I want to say that, relatively speaking, South Africa&#x2019;s industries are more over-concentrated than those of most countries of the world. I want to concede one point that the hon. member made, namely that concentration in the economic sphere has a certain value. Industry likes to be settled in groups because that results in certain services and benefits which lead to economies. That is called the external economies or the external savings resulting from the concentration <span class="col_6235-6236" refersTo="page_451"/>of industries. I concede that. That is why in our border industry development we do not spread industries all along the length of our borders. That is why we select areas and create the potential for development and see to it that small concentrations take place, and that is why we select areas which potentially have raw materials, areas where it is easy to build up the infra-structure, areas where the maximum labour is available, and areas which in general have the greatest potential for development. That is the reason why we have established nuclei such as Rosslyn, East London and in the Northern Transvaal. We do not just send these industries anywhere. We will try to have a concentration of industries in all these places.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) asked for more assistance to be given to the Witwatersrand. As the result of the fact that there are dying mines, problems arise which, he says, can only be solved by greater industrial production in those areas. We are aware of those problems. We are continually studying them. We have already taken certain steps to try to prolong the lives of those mines. We try to point out to industries the possibilities which exist along the East Rand and along the West Rand. But we will no more compel industries to go to the East Rand or the West Rand, than we will force any industry to go anywhere. I continually point out to industries what the possibilities of the East Rand and the far West Rand are, but it is for them to decide whether they want to go there or not.</p>

<p>Do you grant all these benefits to the new industries?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad the hon. member mentions that. We grant benefits to the border industries because at the moment there are disadvantages in establishing industries in those areas. There are generally disadvantages attached to new areas. But take a place like the East Rand. There we have a market, there is transport and there are all the essential services; there are housing and schools and public bodies. Having all these things, one does not have the disadvantages existing in a new border area. The only object in granting the benefits is to neutralize the disadvantages connected with establishing an industry in a border area instead of in a metropolitan area. Hon. members should remember that it is wrong to regard the Witwatersrand as an area which is dependent on the continued existence of the gold mines. There was a time when Johannesburg was established as the result of the gold mines, and when its development flowed from gold, but that time is past. Not much gold is being produced in Johannesburg to-day, and still it is developing tremendously. It is an industrial city, it is the financial capital, it is a city with the head offices of business houses, and where services are rendered. It is a city which is progressing under its own steam, without the help of gold. The industrial growth in Johannesburg and on the Rand is so fast, in spite of the diminishing gold production, that it causes us concern; we try to persuade industries to go to other areas. Already since 1940 more Whites have been employed in the manufacturing industry on the Rand than in the gold-mining industry. In addition, there are the tertiary activities. In 1960, for example, 79,000 Whites were employed in factories on the Rand, 75,000 in commerce, 62,000 in the various services and only 21,000 in the mines. So out of a total working population of 237,000, only 21,000 or 9 per cent were employed on the mines. I think we are grossly exaggerating the position if we say that the Rand or Johannesburg will be endangered by the closing of the mines, because the influence of industry and of service organizations is much stronger than the effect of the dying mines. How else could the hon. member explain that, in spite of the fact that very little gold is being mined along the central Rand, this tremendous development is taking place there?</p>

<p>Hon. members have asked why we do not go in for general decentralization, apart from the border areas? I just want to say that our primary object is to decentralize to the border areas, thereby taking the factory to the worker, because we believe that that is the best socio-economic policy, because in that way not only economic problems but also social problems are solved. We do not stand alone in adopting this policy. The entire world does the same. There is hardly any country in Europe which is not busy with precisely the same thing, viz. taking the industry to the worker instead of bringing the worker to the industry. We know of the tremendous plans and activities in progress in Italy to start development in the south. Large amounts of money are being spent to initiate development in the south. The same principle is applied by Holland, Germany, Spain, France, Britain, etc. viz. decentralization, by taking the factories to the workers. In South Africa the labour force consists of the numerous Black workers. Instead of allowing the Black worker to leave his area and to go to an area where he becomes completely detribalized, it is better to take the factory to the worker so that he can live as a human being in his own area. That is the principle which is accepted throughout the world to-day. I ask my hon. friends opposite to prove that that is not so. That is the principle which is accepted internationally. Hon. members know that a World Conference is at present in progress in Geneva in which 122 states are participating. What is the object of that conference? It is to see how the less developed areas of the earth can be developed. The industrialized countries of the world are prepared to make great concessions, to grant large amounts to develop those countries where there is plenty of labour, to get a distribution of labour right throughout the world. The same principle that we are applying here is being applied in all countries, nationally and internationally. It is the principle <span class="col_6237-6238" refersTo="page_452"/>of taking the factory to the worker. In view of the fact that this applies particularly to the non-Whites, I am prepared, if similar problems arise in the White areas, problems of a superfluity of White labour and unemployment, to work in the same direction. But, just as in the case of the border industries, we must remember that we should not simply spread individual industries all over the country; we should not just establish a factory in this or that town. Then they will not be economic. In the case of the Whites also, we shall have to select the areas. We shall have to establish small concentrations of industries in order to bring about external savings, thereby reducing the costs of those industries.</p>

<p>Hon. members have often spoken about the high costs of such industries. I just want to ask what costs are higher in the case of border industries? This has been mentioned so often already that it is almost tedious to do so again. There is no reason for telling me that if we build a factory at Hammarsdale it will be more expensive than to build it on the Rand, or that if we establish an industrial area at Hammarsdale or at Pongola North, the provision of water and transport and power, roads, streets, public buildings, schools, hospitals and all these concomitant things will cost more than in the heart of Durban. That cannot be said, because it is not true. The cost of erecting factory buildings is generally lower at places like Hammarsdale; land is cheaper. Let us take it further. Let us, for example, take the social costs connected with the Rand, for example; the transport of workers from one place to another; the costs resulting from crime; the concentration of traffic in the streets; the unhappiness of the worker who has to sever his tribal links. Take all these social consequences, together with the direct expenditure in regard to the building of the factory and the infrastructure which accompanies it, and then hon. members cannot tell me that the costs are higher in the case of a border industry than elsewhere. On the contrary, LJN&#x2014;and perhaps hon. members will now listen&#x2014;came to the following conclusion with reference to an investigation made in Italy, that the larger a centre is, the higher are the overhead social costs of establishing an industry there. UN found that if it cost 100 to establish an industry in a centre with 30,000 inhabitants, it would cost 158 to establish an industry in a centre with between 30,000 and 200,000 inhabitants, and above 200,000 it would cost 290. Those are investigations made there; they are not our investigations. It proves that if the population in an area is above 200,000, it costs practically three times as much as in an area with only 30,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to point out something else, too. Hon. members will perhaps be impressed by the fact that it is not only we who realize the social cost involved in the removal of workers from their tribal connection to a strange area. The International Labour Organization says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is highly important that the development policy should discourage excessive horizontal mobility by all means at its disposal and should provide more satisfactory alternatives to the towns, otherwise even a high rate of growth of the national income may be accompanied by such deep disturbances and suffering that the majority of observers will lose sight of any positive results.</block>

<p>The International Labour Organization says that we must prevent horizontal mobility; this movement of labour from one area to another should be prevented because it may result in great suffering and inconvenience to those people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes spoke about integration. I do not think I need go too deeply into that argument. There is a difference of opinion between the hon. member and his party and us. The hon. member asked what the sense was in making certain areas Whiter and other areas Blacker. In our opinion there is very much sense in it.</p>

<p>I now want to pass on to another subject before dealing with individual members, and that is in regard to our exports. Various members on both sides said that it was essential that we should do our utmost to promote South Africa&#x2019;s exports, and particularly the export of manufactured goods. I agree with those hon. members. If we take into consideration that for generations or decades our gold production may fall and that South Africa will have to become an industrial country, and that her industries will not only have to earn foreign currency but will also have to supply work for her people, then it is clear that we should concentrate on promoting our exports, particularly of manufactured goods. I may say briefly that my Department does everything in its power to promote exports to other countries. We do it, <i>inter alia,</i> through a reorganization of our own offices to make the work much more effective. We do it by increasing and improving our foreign representation, and by raising the status of our foreign representatives. It will interest hon. members to know that we have recently opened new offices in Beirut (in the Middle East), in Milan (the northern triangle of Italy), in Madrid (for Spain and Portugal), and in New Orleans (for the southern area of the United States). I can also inform hon. members that our Trade Office has been transferred from Ottawa to Montreal in Canada, and that the one at Canberra has been transferred to Melbourne. We are trying to strengthen the network of our representation throughout the world in order to promote our export potential. In the past my Department made a thorough study of import-replacement industries, but now we are also devoting attention to export-promoting industries, in other words, the type of industry we are trying to establish in South Africa which has a comparative advantage over other countries, industries whose products can compete in several countries <span class="col_6239-6240" refersTo="page_453"/>of the world. In this regard I want to say that the promotion of exports is not merely the task of my Department and of the Government, whether we do it ourselves through our representatives or whether we do so by assisting Safto, but the industrialist and the producer should do the actual exporting. We will assist wherever possible, but they must do the actual work. Now I must say that there are several of our industrialists and producers who have acted very vigorously in this sphere, and we want to congratulate them on the results they have achieved. Here I have in mind the fishing industry, the sugar industry, the manufacturers of spare parts for motor vehicles, and the clothing industry, all of which are industries which have achieved splendid results as the result of their own activities. But there are also certain industrialists who do not want to take the trouble to export. There are certain industrialists who are doing so well in South Africa to-day that they do not want to take the trouble to seek markets abroad. I want to appeal to our South African industrialists not to be so short-sighted as just to concentrate on the local market, but to be prepared to explore the unknown territory of the export markets. I want to point out that South Africa to-day is a strong exporting country, a country which obtains 33 per cent of its net national income through exports, including gold. I think there are very few countries in the world which can claim to have such a high export percentage. And the total export figure is increasing, and last year it was R35,500,000 more than for the preceding year. Now it is true that there is not the same growth in respect of manufactured goods. We should have liked to have seen more growth there. But hon. members should please remember that if the export of manufactured goods has not increased tremendously during the past year or so, and has perhaps fallen somewhat (it is very difficult to ascertain it at the moment), it is largely due to the increased domestic demand. The local demand for capital goods and consumer goods in South Africa has increased so tremendously in recent years that producers who formerly exported their goods cannot do so to-day because they can barely satisfy the domestic market. Just consider how tremendously our sugar consumption has increased in the past six months&#x2014;fantastic! I have in mind the consumption of steel in South Africa by our growing engineering industry, with the result that we can no longer export steel. I understand that certain manufacturers of spare parts who operated overseas can no longer export because the internal demand has increased so much. Therefore if there was not a great increase in exports, I repeat that it was to a large extent due to the increasing domestic consumption of those goods.</p>

<p>Hon. members have asked me what the position is in regard to boycotts. There are some countries which boycott us officially, and some groups which boycott us unofficially, but hitherto it has not had much effect on our economy. I think many of the boycotting countries are to-day themselves suffering from the effects of their boycotting of South African goods. I can mention various countries in Africa which are suffering tremendous damage, which have unemployment on a large scale, and where certain industries have had to close down because they boycotted South African raw materials, with the result that we are now able to capture their markets overseas. Some of these countries are gradually beginning to change their minds, and I think the day will still come when sober commonsense will prevail with most of them, and when they will be prepared to resume trading with us.</p>

<p>There was reference to sanctions against us. We hear a lot about that. We have heard of a congress which was recently held in Britain and to which authoritative names were coupled of people who spoke about the practical application of sanctions against South Africa. We must regard these matters soberly. We must remember that these things are given prominence in the Press, overseas and also here, out of all proportion to their actual meaning. I do not believe that sanctions of the kind threatened will ever be able to be applied to South Africa. In the first place something like that has never succeeded yet. It is practically impossible to apply sanctions of the nature envisaged by certain organizations. It can only be done at tremendous cost, and even then it would not succeed. In the second place, South Africa is fortunate in being blessed with a wealth of natural resources. If something like that were to happen, we could keep going for a long time. We are busy building up our own industries and particularly diversifying them, so much so that we are becoming self-supporting in many important respects. I must say that these threats of sanctions and boycotts are compelling us to diversify our economy as far as possible and to build up our own industries. It now appears that many industries which were formerly considered to be uneconomic can in fact be economic if they are developed properly. People are also realizing, in the third place, that sanctions, as hon. members opposite also said (and I appreciate the fact that they did so), result in more harm than good to the people whom they want to assist. In the fourth place, South Africa is of too much value to most of the countries in the world who count. South Africa is too valuable as a provider of raw materials, of gold and other minerals, and it is too valuable as a market for other countries. We are amongst the first fifteen markets of the entire Free World, and for many countries in Europe we are their greatest market outside Europe, and perhaps Asia as well. In the last instance, I think that the people of Europe are beginning to realize who are behind these boycott agitations. They are beginning to realize that it is the leftist elements, often communist inspired and financed, which want to promote Communism <span class="col_6241-6242" refersTo="page_454"/>by using other people in an underhand manner to create disorder in South Africa and then to get in here themselves. My experience is that the public of the Western world, the great majority of them, are absolutely opposed to any boycotts and sanctions of this nature being applied to South Africa.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it is our task in South Africa to develop our country and to strengthen our economy. We dare not become apprehensive. We should realize that a psychological war is being waged against us, and we should never lose confidence in the future of our country and in the development of our economy. I believe that to the extent to which we confidently continue to expand and to develop, to that extent we will force other nations to respect us, and they will be less inclined to take such steps against us.</p>

<p>I now come to a few odd matters I want to mention. I will perhaps leave out some, because many points have been raised here, but the idea of the licensing of industries has been expressed here. I want to say immediately that this idea which was expressed by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) and the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) as well as other hon. members is one which I am not prepared to accept at this stage. I think at this stage it would be dangerous to accept something like the licensing of industries in our country which is already being accused unjustifiably of so many things, because it would be regarded as a method adopted by the Government to obtain a greater hold and control over the economy of the country. As a State we will stand by the principle of private initiative and we want to maintain that principle as far as possible. We do no want to create any impression that we want to force industries either to go to the border areas or to any other areas. We want to keep out the element of compulsion, and I am afraid that the licensing of industries will lead people to think that we are using compulsion, and we do not want that. But if we do not license industries, there is in fact another harmless method which we might consider, namely the registration of industries. If it is practically possible to do so, I think we should try to register all industries, so that we can have a proper record of them all, their type and of what value they are to the country. But of course that has nothing to do with the licensing of industries.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) asked, in connection with the conference in Geneva with which I shall deal in a moment, whether we had consulted commerce and industry. Now I want to say that in connection with the World Conference of UN, that is not necessary. At that conference we are not busy negotiating and making concessions. It is a discussion of broad principles within the framework of G.A.T.T., and as to whether we will grant slight relaxations in respect of the G.A.T.T. principles. It is not necessary to consult there. Where we will perhaps have to make concessions will be in the case of the G.A.T.T. negotiations which are taking place at present. I shall come to that in a moment, and I will then tell hon. members that we shall have to submit certain proposals to G.A.T.T. in September, and in this case we shall be prepared to consult with organized industry. Where real concessions may be considered by us in terms of tariff agreements, we shall consult industry before making any such concessions or making any offer. But in regard to the International Conference sitting at present under the aegis of UN, there is no necessity for consultation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hope-well) referred to Japan. Japan is to-day doing very good business with South Africa, and does so in spite of the high tariffs which exist. Nor do I think Japan can complain, because I think Japan does better here as compared with its business with other countries, particularly in regard to textiles. We also do good business with Japan through the sale of large quantities of raw materials, and I think it would be wrong of Japan, as I have already stated here before, to exert pressure by telling us that South Africa has a large favourable trade balance with Japan, in the sense that we sell much more to them than they sell to us. In the first place, we had an unfavourable trade balance with Japan for 17 or more years; it is only during the past three years that they have had an unfavourable trade balance with us. I think that if we go through the figures for all those years we will find, to use a popular expression, that they perhaps owe us another R90,000,000, which is the trade balance in their favour. But of course one does not set to work in that way in international trade. One does not weigh one country against another. That is wrong. One takes the globular trade. Further, Japan sells us manufactured goods which can compete with our own factories. We do not intend letting our factories be harmed by competitive Japanese-manufactured products. Japan buys raw materials from us, which does not deprive it of its labour, but creates employment there. That is quite a different thing. Even though we buy less from Japan, we are buying manufactured goods, whereas it buys raw materials and primary materials from us. One cannot compare the two. I think that if we put these thoughts to Japan, it will also be clear to them. Our relationship is particularly good, and I really do not expect any difficulties to arise in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) asked several questions regarding the I.D.C. and the utilization of funds. I shall give the hon. member all the details we can give him in writing. I cannot just work out all the figures for him here like an accountant. I regret that once in a reply I gave the hon. member a mistake slipped in when an amount of R2,000,000 was mentioned instead of R1,000,000. It was a mistake made in transmitting the information to us from the office, and I apologize for that mistake. The hon. member will receive a full exposition in <span class="col_6243-6244" refersTo="page_455"/>so far as we are able to give it. The hon. member asked what my opinion was in regard to what Dr. Rosseau is alleged to have said. I just saw something in the newspaper and I hesitate to judge from a Press report. From the very nature of the matter it cannot be complete. I have not yet seen the complete speech. I do not know what he said, and therefore I do not want to attack or criticize him. But as far as the Government is concerned, we stand by the principle of private initiative in commercial life. In the past we stepped in only where private initiative could not or did not want to act, but in the first instance we maintain the principle of private initiative.</p>

<p>I want to pause to deal briefly with the last important question in connection with the conferences at Geneva. The hon. member for Jeppes referred to it. Other questions will be replied to by the Deputy Minister. At the moment two conferences are being held in Geneva. The one is the UN Conference on International Trade and Development which commenced in March and will end in the middle of June. The first part of the conference was held on a ministerial level and the last part of it will also be on that level. It is being attended by more than 122 countries, and the object of the conference is to find means of promoting the development of under-developed countries by increasing their international trade. I do not want to give a full report in regard to that matter, but the whole theme which is being discussed at that conference is what is called the trade gap, the trade gap which exists between the exports of these under-developed countries and their imports, In recent times the under-developed countries have found that they are selling increasingly less of their primary products at an increasingly lower price, and that they have to pay more for the manufactured goods they import, so that there is an increasing gap between their revenue and expenditure, with the result that they are unable to continue with their development. The object of the congress is to see how this gap can be bridged, and how the developing countries can be given greater access to the markets of the developed countries. Many proposals have been made, like the one that greater preferences and free access should be given in regard to the products of developing countries, that there should be compensatory funds, that there should be commodity agreements, that G.A.T.T.&#x2019;s framework should be changed to make certain things possible. That is being proposed by the developing countries, and on the part of the developed countries favourable sentiments have been expressed, but also criticism of those proposals. I cannot go into details, but I just want to say that in three weeks&#x2019; time the Ministers will meet again and in the meantime certain proposals have been worked out by committees of officials in regard to the broad principles as to how the developing countries can be assisted, and during the latter part of the conference the Ministers will decide in regard to the proposals of the committees of officials. Another conference which I should like to mention briefly is the G.A.T.T. Conference, the so-called &#x201C;Kennedy Round&#x201D;. There the proposal is being discussed that all tariffs should be cut by 50 per cent, with few exceptions. They are now discussing whether that 50 per cent cut is the right one to make. That has practically been accepted as the basis of discussion. But now the problem of the disparities is being discussed&#x2014;of certain countries which have 80 per cent protection against other countries which have 10 per cent or 15 per cent, and whether it will be fair to cut them all by 50 per cent, and how those disparities should be dealt with. There is talk of exceptions which should be made in regard to the 50 per cent cut. Agricultural problems are being discussed and the admission of some countries to the E.C.M., for example, agricultural countries with high protective tariffs. Those things are being discussed at the G.A.T.T. Conference. Hon. members will be interested to know that we have managed to succeed in having South Africa not classified in the group of highly developed or in the group of under-developed countries, but in recognition being granted to an intermediate group, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and as a member of this intermediate group with a special economic structure we are not expected to grant the same concessions that highly industrialized countries must grant. In other words, if they cut their tariffs by 50 per cent, we are not expected to do the same, but we should try to make an offer which will more or less balance the benefits we derive from a general 50 per cent tariffs cut. It is important to us that we are not compelled to do the same as the highly industrialized countries. We are now considering what offer we can make, and we have to submit it by 10 September, and in that regard, as I have told the hon. member for Benoni, we will consult with organized commerce and industry.</p>

<p>There is one point on which I think we can congratulate the hon. the Minister. One has to seek hard to find points on which one can congratulate Ministers these days. That is the way in which he put the suggestion of the licensing of industries straight into the waste-paper basket. We are very grateful to him that he has indicated that he at least is not infected like the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) by the clamping down mentality&#x2014;let us call it the Press Commission mentality&#x2014;that you have got to license everything.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What the hon. Minister has not done is to say to industry: I will not only not license you, and therefore I will not use force on you, but I will also curb my colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration, when he tries to apply indirect force by denying you <span class="col_6245-6246" refersTo="page_456"/>labour. Because that is obviously what is happening. The Minister says he is not going to use force, but the Minister of Bantu Administration and his Deputy Minister say: I am not going to give you permission to get your labour. If you have a labour intensive industry, then you have to take it to a border area. This Minister quite honestly says he will not use force, but I hope he will also prevent his colleague from using force to achieve the same objective. The Minister complained that we concentrated our debate on border industries. I notice that he did not deal with it at all except to talk in broad generalities of the socioeconomic plan. Of course we had concentrated on that. That is the crux of the whole of the Government&#x2019;s policy, because the future of apartheid and of the Bantustans depends on the realization of the economic target that has been set to absorb the labour of the Bantustans. If border industry cannot absorb the Bantu for whom jobs must be found, not only does the border industry policy collapse, but also the whole of the ideology of the Government. When we point out that obviously border industry is not meeting the demands made of it by that ideology, the Minister complains that we are in a rut, but surely that is the crux of the issue. Development inside the reserves obviously cannot succeed without White capital and skill. We have all the evidence in the world for that. Therefore if border industries cannot carry the population of the Bantu areas, the whole of the Nationalist policy collapses. That is what we are telling South Africa and will continue to tell South Africa until South Africa realizes the hoax that has been perpetrated by making these airy promises that the solution is just around the corner. The Minister complains that the Leader of the Opposition had appealed for the decentralization of industry. Of course that is our policy. I said so when I spoke earlier. That is the policy of the United Party. We have good witnesses. The Minister of Agricultural-Technical Services in his official organ, &#x201C;Boerdery&#x201D;, has a leading article supporting the view of the United Party and pleading for the decentralization of industry. It has always been our policy, and it was the point which we made in this debate that the Bantu now occupied in the so-called border industries&#x2026;[Interjections.] I wish this cackler would stop making a noise in the back here. We have been making the point that of the 42,000 Bantu alleged to be absorbed by border industries, the vast bulk, in fact 34,000 of them, are not employed as the result of this policy, but as the result of the normal decentralization of industries, like the Good Hope Textile Factory at Zwelitsha, which was a product of the United Party. It is our policy that where you can have economic industries decentralization is desirable, and therefore the Leader of the Opposition was doing no more than to state the policy of this party. But what is happening is that the Minister is now accepting as economic gospel the pseudo theories of the extreme left wing economist groups at UN. He is holding UN up to us as the body to which we must listen in regard to decentralization. Is he now accepting that as the economic doctrine we have to follow? I do not think so. He was trying to score a debating point and it should be made clear that if anyone was being misled by that committee it was the Minister and not this side of the House.</p>

<p>The last point I wish to make is that the Minister does not say one word of thanks to us on this side for making the only approach to the world which will have any effect in stopping sanctions, as was done by the hon. member for Jeppes. The Minister waved his arms with bravado and said: They cannot hurt us; it will never happen to us. The hon. member for Jeppes put the point of view of the Opposition very strongly and showed the world that they faced a united South Africa which is opposed to interference in our domestic affairs. We need friends in the West. That is the one hope the Minister has&#x2014;not to beat his chest and say that the world cannot impose sanctions against us. Why not pay tribute to our international friends in Britain and America who stood by us in this regard, instead of saying: We are not grateful to you; they could not hurt us anyway?</p>

<p>Then I apologize. I did not hear it.

At least tribute should be paid to them.</p>

<p>The other points which the Minister raised will be dealt with by other speakers. I think I have just time to deal with one point, and that is to debunk the comparison which the Minister tried to draw between rural development and decentralization in Europe, and what is being done here. How the Minister can compare what is being done overseas, in completely different circumstances and with a completely different objective, with what we are doing here, I do not know. There are areas available like Durban, but he says that is not a border industry area and he does not want industry there because there will be too much concentration. He is using decentralization not as an economic policy but as a political policy. Then the Minister tries to make out that he is doing no more here than the rest of the world is doing.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deviate somewhat from the trend in which the hon. member who has just sat down spoke. It is peculiar how these hon. members always claim everything that happens as being due to their policy. The hon. member has claimed the policy of decentralization of industries as their policy. I well remember, even before I came to Parliament, <span class="col_6247-6248" refersTo="page_457"/>the Minister of Bantu Education introducing a private motion in connection with the decentralization of industries and it was wholeheartily supported at the time by the National Party. It sounds very Russian. Everything that happens in the scientific field to-day Russia claims for herself. The hon. member should rather confine himself to those subjects he knows something about.</p>

<p>I wish to deal with a few bottlenecks in our economic development, bottlenecks in the actual capital formation which will in future determine our success or otherwise in the economic struggle in which we are involved. I want to pose 11 problems which confront us in South Africa in connection with our future economic development. The first is that the Republic of South Africa is destined, not only in the political field but also in the economic field, to play a role in the international field which is completely out of all proportion to our small numbers. Just on account of our gold production we have acquired the leadership in the world and when our gold production drops we shall not be able to afford sacrificing that leadership. We shall therefore have to establish other industries to replace that gold production, because it will be our duty to retain that leadership.</p>

<p>The second problem is this. In solving our economic, scientific and technical problems we cannot depend much on the sympathic assistance of the world outside. Thirdly, we have a battle to fight against prejudiced opposition of an aggressive and negative nature. Fourthly, we shall have to depend on our own ability if we want to maintain our leadership. We are not in a position where we receive gifts and favours like other under-developed countries in Africa. Fifthly, we must accept the fact that the responsibility for developing the White and the large non-White communities within the borders of the Republic will be placed squarely on the shoulders of us Whites for the foreseeable future. We shall have to accept it or die. Sixthly, the interests of the Republic of South Africa are inextricably tied up with the trend of development in this Continent. We cannot untie ourselves. Seventhly, where passion and emotion influence the judgment over South Africa to-day we must not allow our vision to become blurred but we must equip ourselves so that future achievements in the scientific and technical fields will be the deciding factor. We have to face up to that squarely and that places a great responsibility on our shoulders. Eighthly, our great problem&#x2014;and it in this regard hon. members opposite fail lamentably&#x2014;is to identify the elements of the deathly struggle in which we are involved. It is not a physical struggle, but at this stage it is a struggle between the intellect of the world. Ninthly our problem lies in the fact that our struggle for existence has to be fought over a wide field. We have to fight that struggle in the scientific field, it concerns our defence and our industrial development, and in the economic field we have to face up to ever increasing price competition. The tenth point is that our small numbers create a real problem. In the eleventh instance, unparalleled industrial development has been switched on in South Africa. Fantastic riches in natural resources await development. This development will depend on our scientific and technological achievements. There can be no question of going back or of remaining stationary or of remaining on a plateau. I want to give an example. Ten per cent of the total turnover of products sold on the American market in 1960 were products which had not even made an appearance on the market in 1956. The influence of scientific and technical development is the prime factor; it dominates everything. [Interjections.] Accepting these submissions I wish to plead for a greater acknowledgement of our intellectual giants in this country. We have a National Education Advisory Board. I do not wish to place this matter at the door of the Minister of Education. The Minister on whose shoulders the duty will in future rest to develop and to use our scientific, technological and intellectual forces is the Minister of Economic Affairs. I want to ask that the Education Advisory Board should be instructed to make a survey of the total number of intellectual giants at our schools and that a thorough investigation should be conducted into the reasons why these intellectual giants are not trained more speedily. We do not have too many of them. The intellectual force of any nation is only between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of the entire nation. Their training should be expedited so that they will receive advanced specialized training sooner. It is urgently necessary that the potential talent be discovered and exploited at an early stage. The creative spirit does not live long. I once read a book by Leman on his monumental study of intellect and achievement, age and achievement. I want to read the following from the criticism of Terman on that book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The striking thing about Leman&#x2019;s age curve is how early in life the period of maximum productivity is reached. In nearly all fields of science the best work is done between the ages of 25 and 30, and rarely later than 40. The lesson for us from Leman&#x2019;s statistics is that the youth of high achievement potential should be well trained for his type of work before too many of his creative years have passed.</block>

<p>We should face up squarely to this need for expediting their training and the removal of all possible stumbling blocks delaying the training of these intellectuals so that they do not reach the productive stage. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DODDS</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow him. I am very glad the hon. the Minister is still with us to-day. I want to raise a matter I have raised on previous occasions. It is one I know the Minister must be very closely associated with, and he is probably disturbed about. That is the position with regard <span class="col_6249-6250" refersTo="page_458"/>to the import of jute goods such as woolpacks and grain bags as against the product of local manufacturers. We realize that some years ago when sanctions were applied against us by India we had to give consideration to establishing our own mills in this country. Today it seems that many hon. members are of the opinion that sanctions are still possible, although listening to the Minister himself today it seems that it is not very likely. But the point that arises is this, that we have these mills which are producing woolpacks and grain-bags of all varieties, but unfortunately the cost at which the local mills produce is nearly double the cost at which the same commodities can be imported. I have figures from the Minister&#x2019;s office which prove this. Grain-bags cost 19c to import, but the same article manufactured here costs 36c. Woolpacks can be imported for just over 80c, whereas the local product is 177c. It stands to reason that this position cannot be justified. I have looked at it from every angle. I feel that we must have security in case sanctions are imposed against us. Surely we must look upon it in the light that if sanctions are imposed on us by countries producing jute, where will we get the material from to manufacture bags? Fibres are being grown here, but at a pace so slow that I do not think that in ten years&#x2019; time we will produce sufficient fibres to satisfy our requirements. Actually, at present the position is that the local fibre content in the manufactured jute goods is only 2.6 per cent, and I think that supports my argument that, unless we can produce fibres on a massive scale it will take us a very long time to satisfy our needs. I think the time has arrived when even the grain farmer, as well as the wool-grower, should know what sacrifices they ar making to maintain these mills. I have figures here in connection with the import of grain-bags for 1962-3, comprising 65,708,000 bags. These cost 19c each, whereas the local manufacturers have an order for 27,828,000, at a cost of 39c. Compare the cost of the locally manufactured bags with what it would cost us to import that quantity of bags. I calculated that it costs the producer R4,333,000, which is the difference between the cost of manufacture and the cost of importation. Further quantities were imported, approximately 90,000,000 of miscellaneous bags, for which the Department could not give the cost. But taking it again that the imported cost is about half the manufactured cost, it is easy to calculate that it costs South Africa an enormous amount of money to maintain our local mills. I feel that the Minister is probably in a position where to some extent the Government can be called upon to pay a subsidy, because at the moment it is actually the producers who are subsidizing the industry. In 1962-3 a total of 1,249,194 woolpacks were imported, at a cost of 88.75c. Locally we manufactured 987,850, at a cost of 177c. Here again the farmer had to contribute R869,803 over two years. That is a big amount for the farmers to contribute. I would suggest to the Minister that it is high time that our wool-farmers should be allowed to import their woolpacks and not have them manufactured here. [Interjection.] The hon. member says that is a drop in the ocean as compared with the grain-farmers, but that is why I say the Government should pay a subsidy. The wool-farmer does not want a subsidy; he just wants to import his packs. This position has obtained now for ten or 12 years. What has the Government done in regard to producing fibres? Practically nothing. This position cannot continue, and I appeal to the Minister to give this matter his attention. I mentioned this matter last year, too, but I got no response, because I think the Minister was away at the time, but I think the time has now arrived to look this problem straight in the face, and not to continue to call upon the producers to subsidize the industry.

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow him on what he has said. I want to say something about motor vehicles. It is very clear that one can approach the subject from many angles. There are many aspects of the subject which one can hardly talk about without developing a sob in the voice or the lump in the throat but because I do not wish to introduce a note of sadness I shall rather leave the subject of motor repair work and the trade in second-hand vehicles at that. I shall rather talk about new motor vehicles because a new motor-car is at least something one can be proud of.</p>

<p>The manufacture and assembling of new vehicles with an ever-increasing percentage of local content has already enjoyed the attention of the Government for a considerable time. I want to read from a brochure issued by the Shell Company which contains interesting information in connection with the motor assembling industry in South Africa. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On an average about 28 per cent of every vehicle assembled in South Africa consists of locally manufactured parts. It is Government policy to increase the percentage of local content and over the past 20 years it has been stepped up from about 15 per cent. The Government has three reasons for doing this: Tariff protection in respect of certain locally manufactured parts; progressively increasing the rebate on excise duty as the local content increases in weight; a system whereby local motor assemblers earn additional permits by using locally manufactured parts.</block>

<p>I am pleased about this development. By making these concessions the Government shows that it is serious in developing our own motor industry and that it wishes to develop it to the maximum. They also talk favourably about the manufacture of spare parts in which respect a great deal is being done. I read the following from the same source&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6251-6252" refersTo="page_459"/>The spare parts are manufactured strictly according to specification and competes on an equal footing with imported articles of high quality.</block>

<p>Furthermore, the Bureau of Standards says the following in their 1963 annual report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the appointment of a technical liaison officer for the motor industry every effort is being made to serve this industry during a period of rapid development, a period which is unavoidably accompanied with problems. A comprehensive series of spare parts that are produced locally have already been tested according to manufacturers&#x2019; specifications or compared with the overseas product.</block>

<block name="quote">A start has been made by the introduction of an inspection service whereby the bureau controls the quality of the motor spares produced locally.</block>

<p>This fact, Sir, denotes enterprise and an ever-increasing emphasis on quality. Without sounding too disparaging or too critical I want to bring a few matters to the notice of the Minister particularly in regard to the quality of certain spare parts that are manufactured in South Africa. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that I, and possibly every other hon. member of this House, know of shocking cases concerning the quality of the spare parts used in our vehicles. I am not going to give examples because I do not want to do any company an injustice; nor am I going to mention the name of the assembly factories because I do not want to do them an injustice either but I have surprising information at my disposal. I have reason to believe&#x2014;and I think I can prove it&#x2014;that certain problems we encounter in respect of spares for 1964 model motor-cars will be minor in comparison with the problems we shall encounter in respect of 1965 model vehicles. I shall leave the matter at that but it is very clear that as far as certain spare parts manufactured in South Africa are concerned we are going to have trouble. Then I just want to ask the Minister this: In view of the policy to which I referred at the beginning is it the policy of the Government to make concessions to every company, irrespective of the quality of the parts it uses in its vehicles, and are we only going to take into account the percentage of South African manufactured parts used?</p>

<p>The manufacturers in this field must remember that the public of South Africa is prepared to pay, but they are only prepared to pay for quality. The demand for motor vehicles is exceedingly high. I know the manufacturers and the assembler try to meet this demand but if they are trying to do that they should not simply throw quality overboard in their effort, as has been the unfortunate experience of many buyers recently. It is all the more important to control quality when we bear in mind that there is talk that South African manufactured spares will be used in motor-car engines as well. We want the South African product but that South African product must be of undisputable quality. I mention this matter because I do not want South African motor manufacturers to lose their reputation right from the word go because certain manufacturers ignore quality.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down must forgive me for not replying to his contribution to the debate but I want to return to the replies given by the hon. the Minister to certain members who have already spoken. I want to refer in particular to the fact that the hon. the Minister, as far as commerce and industry were concerned, painted a particularly rosy picture to us without dealing with the problems we have to contend with in that respect. The hon. Minister must not hold it against us if we deal with those problems and he must not say that we are so critical that we spread untrue stories in the world outside. In a country which has to face up to the problems the Republic of South Africa has to face up to people are obliged to go into the question of what the Department and the Government are doing to stimulate trade. The hon. the Minister told us that 33 per cent of the products of the country were already being exported and that we were one of the first 15 countries in the world as far as our exports were concerned. Unfortunately the hon. the Minister made no mention of the fact that had the standard of living of all sections of our population been as high as the standard of living of the other 14 countries, we would have had very little to export. The hon. the Minister, however, did say that to the extent to which local consumption increased to that extent would our production increase. The hon. Minister then made a statement which always frightens me. As soon as a Minister of Commerce and Industry in any country maintains that his country is becoming self-sufficient, as soon as he says that the industrial growth is of such a nature that the country can practically meet all its needs, I get frightened. A country cannot be self-sufficient because it has to trade and those countries which are most self-sufficient, like America, are countries that have to depend on trade. The moment a country becomes self-sufficient, the moment its industrial production reaches the maximum tempo&#x2014;and we have not yet reached that stage by far, as the hon. the Minister himself said&#x2014;it has a tremendous amount of articles to export and if there is no reciprocity of trade it simply cannot export those articles. It is ludicrous to talk about the possibility of a country becoming self-sufficient. America is a country which is self-sufficient; she can practically meet all her needs but she is also the country which has to do the most trade, so much so that she has to lend dollars to a multitude of countries so that they can trade with her. That is the position in which a country which is self-sufficient finds itself. Mr. Chairman, I go further. The <span class="col_6253-6254" refersTo="page_460"/>hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department encourages the establishment of industries, whether it be in the border areas or somewhere else. I do not want to go into that matter but the fact remains that industries in a country reach the maximum stage of production when they start working two or more shifts. While I am on this subject I want to ask the hon. the Minister how many of our industries already work two shifts; what percentage work two shifts? Is an industry working at capacity and is a nation fully employed unless it works on the basis of two shifts and eventually on the basis of three shifts? If we have not as yet reached that stage we are entitled to ask the Department why it does not do everything in its power to encourage the establishment of as many industries as possible.</p>

<p>I want to come to another matter referred to by the hon. Minister. The hon. the Minister said his Department did everything in its power in regard to export markets. He went further and referred to a series of foreign trade services in overseas countries which have been augmented. If I understand the position correctly it seems to me that in the past year no fewer than four foreign trade offices have been closed down, namely, in Central West Africa, Nairobi and Kenya amongst others. We have withdrawn five members of our trade personnel in Singapore. The hon. Minister referred to Beirut but that service was already in existence last year. I want to draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that we do not have a trade representative in Spain. That nation consists of 30,000,000 civilized Whites but we do not have a trade representative there.</p>

<p>I expected that reply. The hon. the Minister must not tell me that a trade attache in Spain can also cover Portugal. Just as little must he tell me that a trade representative in Beirut can also cover Turkey and Syria and other countries of the Near East. It is simply impossible. Nor must the hon. the Minister tell me that a trade representative in Sweden can cover Norway and Denmark. If the hon. the Minister knows what the position is there as well as I hope he does he will know that a trade representative in Sweden hardly does any business in Norway. Although the Department does everything in its power, according to the Minister, to extend our trade I do not notice any new trading offices in this long list. Let us summarize the cardinal things the Department of Commerce and Industry must do in connection with the promotion of trade. Surely the first prerequisite is the appointment of a trade representative, and surely the second is the spending of money at international exhibitions and shows to display one&#x2019;s country&#x2019;s products. We did little in this regard in the past. As far as Spain and Portugal are concerned the Minister now assures me that there is a trade representative in Spain and I am pleased to hear that. There is no trade representative in Portugal as yet but the Minister says our representative in Spain covers both countries. I want to go further and deal with a country like Israel. In the first place a large section of our population is closely linked with Israel and in the second place we know that Israel requires a vast amount of raw materials for her own industrialization. Israel is highly industrialized today and can use large quantities of our raw materials. Is it not worthwhile appointing a trade representative in Israel? Is it not worthwhile appointing one in Turkey? I want to go further and deal with Latin America. The hon. Minister must not think that a trade representative in the Argentine and in Brazil can also cover Uruguay and Chile and Peru and Venezuela and all those countries which trade on a large scale. Those are countries which want manufactured goods above anything else. Their manufacturing industries are not as strong as ours. It is no use the hon. the Minister saying that the sanctions and boycotts that are being applied to us have no effect. Say what you like, Sir, but there are countries which do not trade with us. The entire Africa to our north, with the exception of Southern Rhodesia and the Portuguese territories, no longer trades with us. But it goes much further than that: We find it difficult to trade with the Near East; India no longer trades with us; we no longer trade with the majority of countries in the world.

<p>I do not wish to accompany the hon. member who has just sat down on his world tour; I should like to take off the lid in respect of another matter and say something in connection with our fishing industry. The tremendously big catches of anchovy fish off our west coast during the past weeks have once again focused the attention on one of the biggest industries, one of our most valuable assets in the Western Cape, namely, our fishing industry, an industry which is to-day already earning us more foreign exchange than our important wine industry in the Western Cape; an industry which is also in strong competition with our fruit-growing industry in this regard. I maintain that this new discovery, these catches of anchovy, will once again stimulate our fishing industry to reach new heights. Catches of this type of fish during the last few years have been the cause of the total revolution which has taken place in the fishing industry of Peru. That has led to Peru being the world&#x2019;s greatest producer of fish meal to-day. I trust <span class="col_6255-6256" refersTo="page_461"/>the Government will give this new feature in our fishing industry all possible assistance. Over the past 15 years our fishing industry has in general gone ahead by leaps and bounds. The tale of our fishing industry is a tale of great progress. Not only has the State given sufficient assistance but it has given a great deal of assistance in this connection. Think of what the industry itself has done; think of the contribution which a body like Fishcor has made to our fishing industry. In spite of this, however, I wish to make two points: In spite of all this I maintain that the time and circumstances have never been more opportune for greater thinking and greater action in respect of our fishing industry and sea research in general than the present. At the present moment there is, what I shall call, world-wide interest in the possibility of utilizing the unexploited areas of the sea for the benefit of mankind, and it is logical that that should be so, because I think the sea comprises nearly 71 per cent of the earth&#x2019;s surface. When we think of what is being done to-day in the field of space research, what is being done in the direction of sea research is only a drop in the ocean. I think we can expect the State to do even more in this respect. In these days when an interest is being taken in oceanology the State will have to see to it that we are scientifically and technically equipped and in this respect there is still unlimited room for greater assistance on the part of the State particularly in view of the fact that we in South Africa have a coastline of approximately 2,000 miles. I am convinced that the oceans which surround our large country hide the secret of great riches, riches which wait to be discovered and I think the State can afford to do still infinitely more in this regard.</p>

<p>As far as the fishing industry as such is concerned I wish to refer to three aspects, without having any motive for doing so, aspects to which I should like the Minister to give his attention. In the first place I wish to refer to the technology of fishing. When we look at the large and well-equipped fishing vessels of Russia and Spain and Japan which touch at our harbours it is obvious that, as far as the technology of fishing, equipment and fishing methods in general are concerned, we are lagging far behind these countries. It is felt in all quarters, for instance, that our tuna fishing industry will not develop to its fullest extent unless more economic methods of catching are evolved. Then I also want to refer to the incidence and catching techniques of shrimp in our South African waters. These are only two aspects in respect of which I think the State can be of great assistance to us.</p>

<p>The second aspect I wish to mention is the possibility of building a factory ship for South Africa. I think this is a matter which the State can no longer overlook and that the time has arrived for us to give attention to the building of a large factory ship. I should like to learn from the hon. the Minister what the Government&#x2019;s attitude is in this regard.</p>

<p>The third factor I wish to mention and to which we should give attention is this: This huge industry deserves more assistance to-day; it particularly needs guidance from the State with a view to getting the people to make better use of the rich crops we gather from the sea. The State will have to make a bigger contribution so that we can make the people aware of the benefits they can derive from using sea products. It is estimated that we are only eating 8 per cent of the fish that are caught. Ninety per cent of the industry is based on export. It is an asset on the one hand but on the other hand this is a matter which ought to receive our serious attention and which cannot simply be left to the industry as such. It is remarkable that the Bantu labourers on the mines, apparently as a result of proper enlightenment, are the biggest consumers of fish products in the country to-day. Fifteen years ago less than 2,000,000 lbs. of fish were consumed by these people, and to-day they consume more than 20,000,000 lbs., i.e. approximately 40 lbs. per person per annum. The consumption in Japan, Iceland, Norway and Sweden is more than 50 lbs. per person; in the United States of America and Portugal it is 30 lbs. per person per annum at the moment, and in this country it is only approximately 12 lbs. per person. One can become lyrical about the benefits which flow from using fish in preference to meat products, particularly in the case of ladies who want to lose weight and persons who have heart trouble. This is a matter in regard to which the State can definitely also do its share instead of simply leaving it to the industry as such.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude my plea for greater thinking and greater action with a quotation in this connection which I regard as very imaginative. The quotation reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One could envisage future development in regard to the exploitation of the sea as a process which will, after the present period of hunting, entail the establishment of fields and gardens in the sea where sea animals and plants will be cultivated in optimum circumstances to serve as food for man and beast&#x2026;artificial fertilization of the four oceans in order to increase their carrying capacity, fencing off of ocean beds with electrified or air-bubble fences to promote protective farming and the processing of ocean algae to serve as a substitute for bread count amongst the imaginative projects which are to-day being studied in the world by sea biologists. The following stage, namely, mining under the sea and sea industrial development also looms on the horizon. The process followed by man on land to produce food and to develop his minerals, will be repeated by him in making the oceans useful.</block>

<p>These imaginative words were used in a speech made by the Deputy Minister last year when <span class="col_6257-6258" refersTo="page_462"/>he opened the Harvest Festival of the Sea in my constituency. I want to conclude by saying that I hope his wonderful imagination will soon take him further so that, with the guidance of the State, he will be able to do infinitely more for our fishing industry than is being done at the moment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) has advocated certain new developments in the fishing industry. I can only say that as far as anchovy is concerned certain experiments were made some months ago by Fishcor in co-operation with the fishing companies. Six nets of finer mesh than the ordinary mesh were used in these experiments, with considerable success, and the result is that representations were made for the number of nets to be increased. Permission was granted for the acquisition of an additional 20 nets, which will bring the total to 26. It looks as though this experiment was a success, and it is &#x2018;possible that this anchovy industry will be able to supplement our catches of larger fish. The experiment has not yet reached the stage where it is possible to determine the constancy of the shoals and to what extent we can build up our fishing industry on this, but we hope to have more clarity in this regard in the near future.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to sea research. I can only say that the C.S.I.R. has an Oceanographic Division which devotes its attention to sea research but there are also other groups which are interested. Discussions were also held recently with other bodies and further discussions will take place again early next month. The Universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch have also indicated that they would like to participate in this further investigation.</p>

<p>As far as a factory ship is concerned the position is that Fishcor, in co-operation with a committee representing certain fishing concerns, investigated the possibility of acquiring a factory ship and manufacturing fish meal. There are many problems attached to it. That committee reported last year but it looks as though the bodies concerned are not very enthusiastic about this idea. It may be much more economical to do this on land rather than at sea. There is always the danger, if these factory ships are allowed to catch fish, even if it is laid down that they may only do so outside of our traditional waters, that they may insist later on, when the fish become scarce, on the right to catch within our traditional waters and perhaps even within our territorial waters. Our existing factories on land would then be adversely affected. It is felt that further experiments should be undertaken; that a factory ship should perhaps be hired jointly by the interested parties to determine what the possibilities are in this connection.</p>

<p>As far as fishing harbours are concerned the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) asked what the position was in connection with Cape Town. He referred to the small amount of R734,000 which will be expended this year. But this forms part of projects which will cost more than R4,000,000. As far as Cape Town itself is concerned the C.S.I.R. is at present instituting investigations into the question of erosion on the Table Bay beaches. The first phase of this research is designed to determine what the effect of erosion is on the coast. The present constructional work on the coast has almost been completed and it is expected that the first report will be completed in June. Thereafter a start will be made with the next phase which is to determine what protective works should be erected in the case of further harbour construction and what the costs are likely to be. The question of determining the terrain, whether it should be Paarden Island or Rietvlei, is also closely connected with the possibility of ship building. This whole matter is at present being investigated by the hon. the Minister of Transport and as soon as the investigation has been completed we may perhaps have more clarity with regard to the question as to what would be the obvious site for this fishing harbour.</p>

<p>Other important work to which Fishcor is giving its attention is the question of a central haven for the large fishing boats in the area of St. Helena Bay. The report has already been completed. Certain negotiations are being conducted at the moment, and it is possible that this matter will also be cleared up in the near future. As far as Saldanha Bay is concerned, negotiations are going on with the Department of Defence, and there too certain extended facilities are being contemplated. As far as Mossel Bay is concerned, a committee consisting of representatives of my Department and the S.A. Railways has also been appointed to determine what can be done to improve the harbour facilities there. There are quite a few other harbours which are insisting on the provision of facilities, but all these things have to be tackled systematically. It is impossible to meet all the requirements immediately.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) asked what the intention was in establishing the fertilizer factory at Phalaborwa. The reply is that the double-phosphate will be packed and also granulated at Phalaborwa. That is the latest information at my disposal.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) has asked whether the committee has already been appointed. A meeting, under the auspices of the Council for the Development of Natural Resources, was held in February of this year at Potchefstroom where all interested bodies, including the three Provincial Administrations, were represented. Instructions were given that the whole of the Vaal basin was to be investigated&#x2014;its potential, the possibilities of expansion, its water problems, its developmental possibilities, etc. There is a broad auxiliary committee as well as a technical committee. The bodies concerned were approached and <span class="col_6259-6260" refersTo="page_463"/>asked to let us have the names of their nominees for this committee. I do not have the names of the persons who were nominated but I shall let the hon. member know who they are as soon as I have obtained that information.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kroonstad (Mr. A. L. Schlebusch) asked for the supply of electric power in the rural areas. He referred to the annual report of Escom for 1962 in which it is indicated that 786 farms were linked up in 1962. More and more farms are being linked up every year. In 1957 only 273 were linked up; in 1958 490 were linked up; in 1960 the number increased to more than 600; in 1961 there were 734 and in 1962 786. Quite a number of other schemes were investigated but, as the hon. member correctly mentioned, the farmers do not always go in for these schemes because of the cost involved. Section 4 of the Escom Act lays down the general principle that the commission, as far as practicable, must conduct its undertakings in such a way that it makes no profit and suffers no loss, and that it must adjust its charges accordingly from time to time. The fact of the matter is that there are sufficient economic schemes which are waiting to be tackled by Escom. The demand for power is constantly growing. I can refer the hon. member by way of example to Viljoenskroon, which is near to the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency and where very many farms have been provided with electricity. I am aware of the investigations which were instituted in the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency and I am aware of the fact that the farmers were not prepared to go in for this scheme because of the cost. If such a scheme has to be subsidized, the question always arises to what extent it should be subsidized. The same representations were made by the S.A. Agricultural Union. Those representations were referred to the Electricity Control Board to investigate this whole matter. A circular letter was drawn up in co-operation with the Agricultural Union and Escom. This circular was sent to all the agricultural associations. The reason for that is set out in the circular itself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before the Government can consider the possibility and the desirability of subsidization, certain information is required with regard to the scope of the problem, and the Electricity Supervisory Council has been charged with the duty of collecting that information.</block>

<p>A questionnaire was drawn up and the assistance of the farmers&#x2019; associations was invited. We have now been informed by the S.A. Agricultural Union, however, that this attempt failed dismally and that they were unable to rely on the assistance of the farmers&#x2019; associations to make the necessary information available to them. Hon. members will appreciate that before any form of subsidization can be considered the scope of the problem must first be determined. If we embark on a scheme of subsidization then practically all rural electricity schemes will also have to be subsidized, and in the nature of things it may assume very large proportions.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) has referred to scientists. A register of scientists is at present being compiled. The method of compiling it has already been agreed upon, and the bodies which have been charged with this responsibility are giving their urgent attention to the compilation of a register of scientists. The promotion of scientific education is also a matter which has been entrusted to the Scientific Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister. They are already engaged, in co-operation with the Education Council, in establishing educational facilities and drawing up recommendations as to what should be done in this connection.

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) spoke very eloquently about the achievements and the prospects of the fishing industry in South Africa. I subscribe wholeheartedly to every word he has said. Both he and the hon. the Deputy Minister, who followed him, spoke of the important part the State and the companies had to play and of the valuable asset the country had in the fishing industry. I think, however, that they omitted to mention possibly the most important part of that great industry, the fishermen themselves. I have always thought that we had as valuable an asset in the fishermen who fish off our coasts as in the fishing industry itself. I have always felt that we should have recruited from them for our naval force; we can give them and their sons opportunities in the navy. In addition to that they could be trained as a naval reserve during the periods when the fishing industry is not active.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>He is not a fisherman, he is an angler.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to a question I asked the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs at the beginning of this Session. I asked whether it had come to his attention that an announcement had been made by the banks to the effect that they were going to impose a 2c levy on all cheques paid in, over a certain number. The hon. Minister said in his reply that he had obtained the necessary information and that he was carrying out an investigation. I pointed out to him that the building societies had announced that they were passing that extra levy on to the public. The hon. the Minister said this afternoon that we had prosperity without inflation. I am going to deal with two simple cases of inflation. The hon. Minister should ask the ordinary housewife whether we have inflation. He should ask the Native worker whether he can come out on his pay at the present time. Why did we pass a Rents Act through this <span class="col_6261-6262" refersTo="page_464"/>House if there were no inflation? Of course, we have inflation. We are paying the price for the prosperity we are enjoying to-day. I did not get a reply from the hon. the Minister to my question. He only told me that he was carrying out an investigation. A month later I asked him again whether he had completed his investigation and he said &#x201C;No&#x201D;&#x2014;that was all. I should like to assist him in his investigation by telling him what happened in Australia. In Australia they do not have a flat rate of 2 cents per cheque but the banks agreed, after discussion, that they would have a sliding scale so that the big institutions which deposited thousands of cheques would not pay 2 cents per cheque but a smaller amount. I can give him the actual scale if he is interested. That is one suggestion. But together with that it was suggested and agreed that a new system be introduced for the whole of Australia, that inland exchange&#x2014;we call it commission on country cheques&#x2014;should be abolished altogether. It has always seemed absurd to me that in our country, which is not a great country geographically, we should have to pay 5 cents or 10 cents or 20 cents commission on a country cheque because it goes from one part of the country to another. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that in any adjustment that is made in regard to this 2 cent levy he should consider the total abolition of commission on country cheques. That is my first point.</p>

<p>My second point is this: I should like the hon. the Minister to use in influence with the Minister of Transport to give us in the interior a fairer deal in regard to the price of petrol. I know the hon. the Minister has not the final authority in the matter but he can certainly use his influence. In reply to a question I put to the hon. Minister of Transport he told me the price of transporting a gallon of petrol through the new pipeline was estimated to be less than 1 cent per gallon from Durban to Johannesburg&#x2014;.92 cent per gallon, and that the cost he was going to charge would be 7 cents, i.e., a profit of 660 per cent! Well, Sir, I think the interior is being asked to pay too much. The hon. the Minister mentioned last year that Sasol had to be protected. I have no objecting to helping Sasol. It has a certain strategic value. We thought at one time that more Sasols were to be established because of the strategic value they would have. I have no objection to that. But if there is to be a subsidy for Sasol it should come out of general revenue, probably out of the Defence Fund, because I think it is chiefly maintained for that strategic purpose. That is my second point.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to deal with the Minister&#x2019;s announcement this afternoon that we are living in very prosperous times; that we were in fact enjoying a boom and that there is great prosperity in the country. Why have we that prosperity? Why is South Africa prosperous? I think because the Bantustan apartheid policy has broken down. The answer is this: We have been asked in the past to make great sacrifices to carry out the Bantustan scheme. We were told that the Whites in the White areas would have to do their own work. In fact we had two members of this House setting an example by doing their own cooking and washing up to show that we could get on without Natives. If you say you can get on without Natives in the White area the obvious thing is to try to do so. But what we are doing to-day is to bring in more and more Natives. It is an inevitable process. If you want prosperity you must have this extra labour. We did the same thing with the Whites. We had a Carnegie Commission. It considered the depopulation of the platteland. We had a special commission to consider that problem. They sat for several years but we did not succeed in keeping the people on the platteland. Farmers came to town; the children came to town. Where are the children of those children? They are the leaders in industry, in commerce. I am sure my hon. friends know many of them. The same process is now taking place in the case of the Native population. It was all foretold. There is nothing new in it. It was foretold by that commission that was known as the Industrial and Agricultural Farmers&#x2019; Commission, generally referred to as the van Eck Commission. This was what the van Eck Commission had to say before this process had developed as it has to-day. Discussing this movement of the Natives to the cities they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In these circumstances a further type of movement into other occupations is considered to be an economic necessity. This movement will be mainly a transfer of Natives of whom 82 per cent were still on the land in 1936 as against 33 per cent in the case of Europeans, Coloureds and Asiatics, including a disproportionately high number of European farmers over 50 years of age. If migration were correlated with the expansion of other productive fields hardship would be avoided and the income level of those affected would be raised. By increasing the internal market for farm products the position of those remaining on the land would also improve.</block>

<p>It is a perfectly natural process. It has taken place in Europe; it has taken place in the United States of America. In the U.S.A. only one man in 12 works on the land. Eleven out of 12 are in occupations other than farming. We in our country can naturally not develop in that way, not for many, many years. But the process that took place in the movement of the White population a generation ago is now taking place in the movement of our Native population. On that rests our prosperity and on that rests the boom we are enjoying in South Africa. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has referred to the 2c levy on cheques. Negotiations have been conducted <span class="col_6263-6264" refersTo="page_465"/>with the banks to ascertain whether they are not prepared to reduce the levy. Their reply is that they need these additional funds because their expenses have risen enormously. It is not possible to exercise control over this 2c levy under the price control regulations. This Department, with the powers at its disposal under the price control legislation, is not in a position to reduce this levy. It may perhaps fall under the jurisdiction of the bodies under whom the control of financial institutions fall.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to inflation. According to the latest data made available by the Bureau of Statistics there is by no means as much inflation as he suggests. When we compare the consumers&#x2019; index for March this year with the index for March last year we find that in Cape Town, for example, the index in respect of all items stood at 107.4 a year ago whereas it now stands at 108.3, which represents an increase of .9 per cent for the year. As far as the Witwatersrand is concerned the index has increased from 105.6 to 106.6 that is to say, an increase of 1 per cent over a period of a year. In the case of food the figures are even lower. In Cape Town the index in respect of food over the past year has risen from 106.6 to 106.7. In the case of the Witwatersrand it has risen from 102.7 to 102.9, in other words, there has been an increase of .2 per cent over the past year. There has not been such a sharp increase in food prices and in the prices of domestic commodities as the hon. member suggested here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) wants to know why trade offices are not being opened in a number of countries which he mentioned. He mentioned about six countries in South America. He said that we ought to have a separate trade office in each of the Nordic countries and one in Spain and one in Portugal. The fact of the matter is that it is impossible to appoint a trade representative in every country, firstly because of the manpower position and, secondly because of the costs involved. The Department has no alternative but to work on a selective basis and that is why we only have representatives in those countries where there is the greatest need and in those countries with which we do the greatest volume of trade or which offer the greatest possibilities of expansion.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Mr. Dodds) has referred to the price of imported bags. We are making provision for the stock-piling of a considerable number of additional bags, but this naturally involves expense. There are insurance charges, storage charges, etc. All these charges affect the internal price of bags. Our policy is to keep these industries going and to import jute. The Pakistan Government have imposed a substantial levy on raw jute because they are anxious to protect their jute industry. The result is that the raw jute costs more than bags delivered here, where those bags are manufactured in Pakistan. But we want to encourage our own bag industry and our own fibre industry. That is why we entered into agreements about a year or two ago with 109 individual farmers, as well as with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, for the cultivation of Phormium tenax. Hitherto they have been paid R126 per ton but as from 1 January 1964 they will only be paid the guaranteed price of R130 and R70 for web-thread and woof-thread respectively. This will possibly bring down the costs. It is essential to encourage the local industry. We may be placed in the position that jute supplies are cut off and we must then be able to produce substitutes locally. There are also other bodies which are producing kenaf. Great headway has already been made with these experiments but it is still not possible to produce bags economically. The investigations are nevertheless being proceeded with. In these circumstances it is not desirable therefore to do away entirely with the manufacturing of bags locally but rather to encourage it because we are making progress in this direction.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I claim the privilege of the half hour? I should like, in opening the debate on this Vote, to record a very special word of thanks to the Chamber of Mines for having made it possible for members from both sides of this House to visit various mines. They showed us some of the old mines; they showed us the newer development on the Far West Rand and in the Free State. I believe that they have rendered a very valuable service to this House by making it possible for us to learn a little more about this very great industry of ours. For my part, Sir, I say we owe them a very great debt of gratitude. I hope they will from time to time make it possible for hon. members of this House to see the ramifications of this tremendous industry of ours. All of us were tremendously impressed by the new training methods which are being used, by the precautions which are being taken in respect of safety. I believe we acquired valuable knowledge&#x2014;I certainly did&#x2014;not only of the extent of the industry, something which one does not realize from merely seeing the mines around you as I have done for such a long period of my life, but of seeing how fortunate we were in having this widespread gold producing industry which is unparalleled in the world. Mr. Chairman, I therefore record the thanks of myself and, I believe, of all other hon. members for a memorable tour which I hope will continue to be of value to each of us in making what contribution we can.</p>

<p>I wish to deal more particularly with a subject which has often been under discussion in this House. The question is that of marginal mines and the problems arising from them. I think all of us are pleased that the Government, which has been urged over a long period <span class="col_6265-6266" refersTo="page_466"/>of years by this side of the House to do something about preserving these mines as payable units as long as is possible, has at last started doing something in regard to the matter. I am very glad that the Minister of Finance referred to this matter in his Budget speech. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As mentioned in the discussion of the Loan Account I propose to ask for a further sum of R600,000 on Revenue Account in order to continue the scheme for assisting certain gold mines with the pumping of water.</block>

<block name="quote">Including this R600,000 and the R5,100,000 required for concessions to pensioners, total expenditure on Revenue Account is accordingly estimated at R1,019,500,000.</block>

<p>This shows how fortunate we are in this country in being able to spend that sum, because when one looks at the figures we realize what an enormous proportion of this revenue comes directly or indirectly from this great industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very glad that when the Government found a further nest egg, and that further steps are contemplated. The hon. the Minister said the Government would consider making further provision in this regard. All of us welcome that. My plea to-day to the hon. the Minister and to the Government is that the Government must not continue to deal with this matter on the basis of a hand out here and there. I wish to make an appeal that they should approach this matter scientifically; that this matter should be thoroughly investigated; that we should see to it that we keep our mines producing as long as we possibly can and that, in respect of the areas which have been developed largely through the mines, we encourage industries so that the prosperity of those areas will be maintained. I hope we shall continue to make use of the very valuable assets in the form of electric power and water supplies which are already available in the areas where mining is coming to an end. I also hope that we shall make full use of the housing. It is known that in establishing a new industry in a new area the cost of establishing a new industry with European labour is never less than a figure in the neighbourhood of R9,000 per man. In respect of these areas where mines are gradually going out of production the facilities required, to a large extent are already there. Obviously they are part of our national assets. I wish to quote from the presidential address for 1963 of the then President of the Chamber of Mines, Mr. P. H. Anderson, which was delivered on 24 June, last year, in which I think he put the position very, very well indeed. I would like to read a short extract. Under the heading &#x201C;Marginal Ore&#x201D; he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The problem is not only one of marginal mines but also of marginal ore, for all mines to a greater or lesser degree contain quantities of ore that is only marginally payable. The greater the proportion of marginal ore in a mine, the more vulnerable that mine will be to increases in working costs. In any mine, whether it be marginal or highly profitable, an increase in working costs, even though small, will generally transfer a quantity of ore from the payable to the un-payable category.</block>

<p>Here I would interpolate that we know that the costs of mining in this country are gradually rising all the time. Mr. Anderson proceeds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The life of a mine will be shortened and a quantity of gold will remain in the ground instead of being extracted and used to the benefit, not only of South Africa, but also of the whole world. It has recently been estimated that in so far as the whole industry is concerned, an increase of 5 per cent, that is 25 cents per ton milled on the present average working cost of R5.18 per ton milled would reduce subsequent gold production by 11,500,000 ounces valued at R287,500,000. If costs were to rise by R1.25, roughly 25 per cent, some 50,000,000 ounces of potential gold production valued at R1,250,000,000 would be eliminated.</block>

<block name="quote">The magnitude of the problem of marginal mines will be appreciated when it is realized that seven mines operated at a loss in 1962 and eight more mines operated at working profits of less than R1.50 per ounce, equivalent to 6 per cent of working costs.</block>

<p>Then he goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some of these mines are dying mines in that the ore-body has to all intents and purposes been mined out. The extension of operations by these mines beyond the profitable stage would be unwarranted even in the event of a subsequent change in the price of gold.</block>

<block name="quote">The remainder can be classified as marginal in that although they too are operating at a very small marginal profit, they have large quantities of ore relatively close to the pay limit under present conditions. Should one of these mines close, this ore would probably be lost for all time, for the cost of bringing it back to operation after it has been stripped of equipment and allowed to flood would almost certainly be prohibitive.</block>

<p>In the course of our tour, we saw a very good example of a mine of this type in the Crown Mines, one of the great mines of this country, where there are enormous quantities of ore which can only be mined if there is a realistic attitude on the part of the State and ways and means are found to make it possible to continue extracting that ore&#x2014;to get the benefit of the gold which is there. We were assured that in that particular case once an area has been bypassed and that section has been closed&#x2014;and there are very big areas which fall into this category&#x2014;it would never again be profitable to seek to extract that ore. This is a serious matter so far as this country is concerned <span class="col_6267-6268" refersTo="page_467"/>and from a long-range point of view it is of the utmost importance to the future of this country.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that we have additional gold mines which are yet to be opened up. It is possible that we will have the fortune to find new fields, although intensive search over quite a lengthy period has not been as successful as had been hoped. But it is quite obvious that if South Africa is to maintain her present prosperity, if she is to continue to progress economically as we all hope she will at the same rate at which she has expanded in recent times, then obviously we cannot afford in the years which lie ahead to allow the eyes to be picked out of the mines and to find in the end that a great deal of marginal ore remains which can never be mined.</p>

<p>This is a matter of the very greatest importance, and the plea that I wish to make today is that the Government should face up to the responsibility which is undoubtedly upon it to examine this matter scientifically, to drop this idea of doing something in this Budget and something in the next Budget. My submission is that the time has come when the Government with the full advice of the Chamber of Mines and the various mining groups should get down to this problem and try and work out a national plan which will ensure that South Africa will get the maximum benefit, firstly from the ore which is there and secondly, the maximum benefit of the very great assets which have been built up in various areas through the development of the mining industry in those areas. This will ensure that the assets will be preserved by making it possible for those areas to remain productive areas, to remain prosperous areas through the gradual replacement of the mines by the industries which are essential if the prosperity of those areas is to be maintained.</p>

<p>It was mentioned earlier to-day by the hon. the Minister that so far as Johannesburg is concerned, mining is coming to an end. We know that that is so. But we must remember that in respect of the old Witwatersrand, that is from Springs to Krugersdorp the mining production, even at the present time, is greater than that of any country in the world other than South Africa. The enormous production in that area is shown by the fact that countries such as Russia, with all the efforts that they have made, even at this stage, cannot produce the quantity of gold which we are producing to-day in the old Witwatersrand area which has been worked out to a very large extent. We know that in that area industries have taken over to a very large extent. It is absolutely essential that that process should be continued, and I hope that one of the things which the Government will adopt as its policy that in all circumstances the prosperity of the areas where mining is gradually disappearing will be maintained at the present level. In that way the prosperity of those areas can be maintained; not to do so would be a blow not only to those areas but to the whole of the national economy.</p>

<p>It is my submission that the Government should take steps for this matter to be examined thoroughly, so that there can be adequate planning. I submit that the aim that we should have is that we should mine all the gold that we reasonably can. Already over the last few years, mines have closed which could have been kept going for quite a time had a different policy been followed. Secondly, I submit that we should especially endeavour to make the maximum use, that is to extract the maximum amount of reef which can be extracted, while it is possible to do so, for in a very large number of cases once a section has been closed or a particular mine has been closed down, it will not at a future stage be possible to arrange for the mining of that area. Apart from ensuring that we do not leave large quantities of gold in the ground, we must exploit those mines to the greatest extent we can in every respect. Above all, I believe that there rests an enormous duty on the Government, and I repeat it because I believe it cannot be repeated too often, to maintain the prosperity of the present mining areas, whether in the old central Witwatersrand area, on the wings of the Reef, or in the areas further to the West and the areas down into the Free State&#x2014;the maintenance of the prosperity of those areas is of the utmost importance to the future of South Africa. I hope that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to consider this matter and that the Government will be prepared to act. I am quite sure that the very great ability of those who have been responsible for the building of this great industry can play a tremendous part in helping the Government in making plans to maintain the prosperity of these areas. I believe we should do something more than merely to maintain the present prosperity. The towns should be alive and thriving and should be kept as such. If this is done, then gradually of course there can be a change over to industry; that can take place over a long period. The process of further industrialization need not be so rapid if the Government realistically faces up to the problem of the relatively low-grade pre which is available for the taking and which cannot be mined unless a realistic policy is followed in regard to this matter. I believe it is a matter of enormous public importance. I believe we in South Africa do not realize just to what an extent the whole of South Africa owes a great debt of gratitude to those who have developed our mines to the extent that they have. It is on that to a very large extent that our present prosperity has been based. The growth of our industries has been possible because of the mine development and the further industries and the growth of our agricultural industry have to a large extent been placed on the sound footing they are by the great market which we have in this country for their products. Thus the maintenance of the prosperity of these older mines, the exploitation of the resources there are in gold under the ground to the greatest possible extent to the benefit of this country is something of the utmost importance to all sections <span class="col_6269-6270" refersTo="page_468"/>in South Africa, and I repeat, requires the most earnest consideration of the Government. If one of the Reef towns at some time in the future becomes a ghost town our experience will parallel what has been found overseas: namely: Once you allow one area to cease to be prosperous, lack of prosperity spreads to the adjoining areas. We have the resources in this country through proper planning to ensure that there will be no retrogression and no ghost towns and that rather in place of possible ghost towns, we will retain a thriving area which will continue to play an enormous part in maintaining the strength and the prosperity of this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) has raised a matter here about which everybody in this House is apparently concerned, and I want to congratulate him on the objective way in which he approached this problem. The question of marginal mines has often been discussed in this House, and the irony of the situation is really that once the stage has been reached where the gold in a mine has been exhausted, there is no single measure which can assist that mine. But it is important to ensure that every ounce of gold which may still lie hidden underground should be brought to the surface. I agree that the economic growth, the economic upsurge, the economic stability in our country, is due in very large measure to gold-mining development in our country. There we are all agreed. The Government has always in the past adopted a very sympathetic attitude towards our marginal mines. The hon. member for Germiston (District) has referred here to the fact that provision has often been made in the Budget in recent years for assistance to the marginal mines, but we agree, as I have already said, that when there is no longer gold in payable quantities in a mine, there is nothing that can be done to assist such a mine. We also agree and indeed advocate that scientific methods should be devised to keep such a mine going as long as possible and to bring every ounce of gold which may still be underground to the surface before the mine is closed. In that regard I want to associate myself with the plea of the hon. member for Germiston (District.) I think the Minister will be prepared to cause a scientific investigation to be instituted to determine what methods we can apply.</p>

<p>But we must not lose sight of the fact that the mines themselves also have certain obligations; that they will also have to keep abreast of the times and make use of the scientific methods which have been devised for the mining of gold; that they will have to introduce mechanization and bring down their costs of production. Much can also be done by the owners of mines to prevent mines reaching the stage where they are no longer sufficiently payable to warrant the extraction of all the remaining gold in the mine. We are not concerned so much about the closing of mines because it has already been proved in practice on the Rand that where mines have closed it has not led to a reduction of the population in those towns. The assets to which the hon. member for Germiston (District) referred in the shape of existing services, housing, power and water are very great assets which can be harnassed for industrial purposes in those towns. On the East Rand, for example, we know that industrial development has always followed where gold-mining development has come to a standstill. We would advocate therefore that attention be given to the question of encouraging industrialists to give priority to the establishment of capital-intensive industries in those places where gold mines are closed. I know that the Government is sympathetic and that there will be no difficulty in this connection.</p>

<p>The decision of the Government to help certain marginal mines by granting loans to cover losses up to 10 per cent of revenue and approved capital expenditure has been well received. I think that the hon. the Minister of Finance acted wisely when he made these loans facilities available to marginal mines. This concession has given these mines the opportunity to open up and exploit large deposits of ore which in normal circumstances would have been unpayable. My criticism of the Minister and the Government, however, is that these facilities have been made available at too late a stage and to too small an extent. Too little has been done too late. When we criticized the hon. the Minister earlier this year on this matter we were informed that our criticism was not justified. If that criticism was not justified, may I in justification quote the chairman of the City Deep who, in his report a few weeks ago, at the Annual General Meeting of the City Deep, said:</p>

<block name="quote">Had the recently announced scheme of Government aid to marginal mines been in operation in 1963, City Deep would not have had to curtail shaft sinking operations and drastically restrict development.</block>

<p>Similarly, the chairman of the Crown Mines pointed out that 2,000,000 tons of ore just below the pay limit would never have been available for exploitation unless this concession had been made available and that that mine would have had to close prematurely. Similarly, the chairman of the Robinson Deep said that 1,250,000 tons of roughly 4.6 pennyweights would not have been exploited and could not have been used, if Government assistance had not been available and that the hoisting of the ore would not have been able to continue after June 1965. These are authoritative and expert criticisms of the actions of the Government which have come practically too late in order to save the situation. We ask of the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Had these facilities been made available earlier, would mines such as Brakpan, Modder East, Government Gold Mines, Rietfontein Consolidated, Dominion Reefs, Village Main Reef and Simmer <span class="col_6271-6272" refersTo="page_469"/>and Jack not still have been in existence to-day?&#x201D; The hon. Minister, when replying today to a question which I put to him enquiring as to what investigations were being carried out in order to prolong the lives of mines, said:</p>

<block name="quote">Investigations arising from research initiated in 1956 by the Department of Mines&#x2026;have resulted in two separate schemes whereby financial aid from the State is delaying the decrease in production by the older mines &#x2026;</block>

<p>Did we have to wait eight years to see the implementation of two simple suggestions such as those put forward by the hon. the Minister in order to save the lives of the mines to which I have referred? I cannot believe that if proper concentration, proper thought and proper application to the problems of these marginal mines had been applied in 1956 as it has been in the last two years, the situation on the Witwatersrand would not have been a totally different story. I want to say that, as far as the present Minister of Mines is concerned, I believe he has adopted a constructive, positive and dynamic approach to this problem because he has been made aware of what is at stake. I am, however, not prepared (and I think the country, as the years go by, will not be prepared), to say the same about the two former Ministers of Mines. I think they can be justifiably criticized for adopting a <i>laisser-faire</i> attitude and letting matters slide, resulting in the unsatisfactory situation on the Witwatersrand that we have to-day. If we have any cause for concern, I should like to refer to the concentrated mining methods that are now being applied particularly in the Free State and the Western Witwatersrand area. It was only 11 years ago that Saint Helena poured the first gold in the Free State. Since then the Free State gold mines have milled over 120,000,000 tons of ore, which incidentally is far more than was milled in the Witwatersrand in its first 25 years. We can thus realize the danger of the shortness of the lives in the Free State, the Western Witwatersrand and the Klerksdorp areas. I believe that we have to approach this whole matter in a more scientific, a more urgent and a more dramatic way than the present Government has done in the last 14 years. I associate myself with the hon. member for Germiston (District) in saying that some type of organization&#x2014;call it a &#x201C;Mining Development Corporation&#x201D;&#x2014;something similar to the Industrial Development Corporation&#x2014;should be set up immediately in order to act as a liaison between the Department of Mines, the Geological Department, the Industrial Development Corporation, the Government Metallurgical Department and Commerce and Industries in order to co-ordinate the efforts of our mining activities. I know that the hon. the Minister will reply that there is a part-time liaison committee in existence at the moment, but the technical services and the information available from that organization are not sufficiently well known and are not being sufficiently used. I think that full-time personnel&#x2014;a full-time organization&#x2014;has to be brought into existence in order to co-ordinate all these efforts and bring a more positive approach to our problems. In that regard too, one must bear in mind the mining exploration development work, which is being done in the Bantu territories. It becomes all the more urgent that some type of organization of this nature must be set up in order to have a more co-ordinated approach to our problems. I am of the opinion that the time has now arrived for the hon. the Minister to tell this House, and the country, what the position is and what the likelihood is of any increase in the price of gold. The hon. the Minister has had opportunities recently of being overseas amongst people who are dealing with this matter, and I think it would be most informative if the hon. the Minister could indicate to us what the possibilities and the trends in world financial circles are in regard to any possible increase in the price of gold. At this stage I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister if he can give an indication of what is happening as far as the exploration for oil in the country is concerned. We have seen a statement in last night&#x2019;s Press about a find of oil in the Dannhauser district. I think the people of South Africa would be most interested to know what the attitude of the Government, and the Minister is, as regards further oil activity and oil exploration in this country. Is the matter going to be handled by the Government, and are subsidies going to be made available? What is the method that the Government is adopting as far as the granting of concessions are concerned? What is the Government&#x2019;s approach towards encouraging local interests to exploit and explore the possibilities of oil in this country? [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I do not want to talk to the Minister to-day about the claims of the mineworkers or about marginal mines. I think it is fitting to-day, 66 years after the State first started to devote its attention to the problem of occupational diseases, to say a few words in connection with the relationship between the State and the worker as far as occupational diseases are concerned. The State first started in 1911 to turn its attention to occupational diseases and tried to regulate the relationship which had come into existence between employee and employer as the result of occupational diseases. Industrial diseases such as pneumoconiosis are socio-economic problems in which the State has a direct interest. Ever since 1911 the Chamber of Mines, in its capacity as employer, has never been able to tackle this problem effectively. As the hon. the Minister stated last week as well as last year when the Pneumoconiosis Bill was introduced, the authority which took an active interest not only in the treatment and the prevention of pneumoconiosis as an occupational disease but also in <span class="col_6273-6274" refersTo="page_470"/>the after-care of the mineworkers, was the State. As far as occupational diseases are concerned, the State has never thrown the mineworkers to the wolves, and the National Party in particular has never done so. The State has always endeavoured to place the control over occupational diseases on a sound footing. Sir, we have 332 controlled mines in the Republic of South Africa. The mining industry is a powerful organization. Thousands of mineworkers are employed in these 332 mines. There are tens of thousands of people dependent on these mines. They form a large section of our population, and the State has always adopted the attitude that these diseases must be viewed as a socio-economic problem to the community as a whole. We cannot help paying tribute on this occasion to the State which has always acted fairly and without discrimination towards citizens of ours who have become the victims of occupational diseases. In the eyes of the State the citizen is part of the community. He is not just an employee attached to a specific mine. The citizen is part of the community. I also want to pay tribute to the State because the State has always regarded occupational diseases as a national problem and not from the point of view of money or from the point of view of profits. The State has never hesitated to impose obligations upon employers where the interests of our citizens have been at stake as the result of accidents or where they have contracted an occupational disease. I just want to quote to the Committee what the Stratford Commission said in 1943 in connection with pneumoconiosis and in connection with the relationship between the State and the worker. The commission said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now in fact the social problem resulting from the indigence of those who have suffered a loss of wages or earnings owing to industrial accidents or occupational diseases was not solved as long as it was left to employers and employees to make their own arrangements to cope with the situation. The State had to step in in order to compel provision on behalf of those likely to become indigent as a result of industrial accident or occupational disease.</block>

<p>The State has constantly guarded against any misuse of pneumoconiosis or other occupational disease as a bargaining factor or for the purposes of exploitation. It is the protection afforded by the State which has prevented the reduction of compensation for occupational diseases and therefore the victimization of employees in times of a surplus of labour. It is the State which has guarded against unfair demands by employers upon employees. It is the State which has ensured that it has not been possible for employers to use the question of pneumoconiosis compensation as a lever in wage negotiations. Our workers can never be grateful enough for this relationship which has developed historically between our employees and the State. A particular relationship has grown up here in South Africa between our workers and the State, and many of our workers in the mines are content because they know that the State is sympathetic towards them, and where there have been individuals or companies or other interests which have sought to make use of the weaker position of the worker, the State has intervened and prevented it. What about the dependants? There are thousands of dependants who have always shared in the benefits resulting from this relationship between the State, the employer and the employee, and those people will always be infinitely grateful to the State. Sir, I am not talking about the National Party only; I am talking about the State as such which throughout the years has taken an active interest in this matter. The State has prevented the misuse of a dangerous disease such as pneumoconiosis as a political football or as a bargaining factor in the relationship between the employer and the employee. That is why we have so much industrial peace and quiet in South Africa. This protective hand which the State extends over the interests of the worker, is also extended over the relationship between employer and employee. Sir, if anybody were to ask me to what I attribute the comparative peace and quiet in South Africa in the industrial sphere, to what I attribute the almost complete absence of strikes, I would say that basically it is attributable to this fine relationship which has been built up throughout the years between the State, the employer and the employee and to the sympathetic interest which the State has always shown in the relationship between the employer and the employee.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>The previous speaker is always somewhat of an individualist, but I should like to get back to the gold-mining industry. The importance of this industry, as everybody who has spoken before me has said, cannot be over-emphasized. Gold is the one product we have which is always saleable, and it gives us more than 50 per cent of our foreign exchange. We are all very worried about the industry. We cannot do anything about the worked-out mines, but the marginal mines have large tonnages of ore and that is of concern to all of us. Last year the Government allocated an amount to assist them with their water troubles and this year we have had an additional amount to help the marginal mines, and in addition the Minister of Finance provided R15,000,000 reserve, part of which can be used for helping the marginal mines to keep going and to get the gold out. The value of the gold mines to the Witwatersrand is well known, but having said that, I want to say that there are a few factors relating to the industry which are not as well known. The University of the Witwatersrand Research Unit predicted in 1962 that of the 35 existing mines on the Rand eight will have closed down by the end of 1964, eight more will have closed down by the end of 1966, four more by 1968, five more by 1972, and nine more by 1982, and they reckon that the last will have closed down by 1987. Their predictions <span class="col_6275-6276" refersTo="page_471"/>so far have not been proved very far wrong. The Springs mine has closed, Ellaton has closed, Brakpan has closed, and sundry small mines have closed. Simmer and Jack is closing and the C.M.R. is closing. Some of the others would have been closing down also, but this new assistance will help them. The Government at last, under great pressure from this side of the House, has decided to assist these marginal mines financially in order to keep them open, but they have been advised to do this for many years, and as the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) has said, a great deal of blame can be laid at the door of the two previous Ministers of Mines. They paid no attention to this matter at all, and it is a most difficult thing to get a mine going again once it has closed down. Even when notice of closing is given, the staff disperses all over the place. These mines employ a large number of people. If you add to them the industries dependent on these mines, I say that the effect on the Reef will be catastrophic, and all the honeyed words of the Ministers that they will not permit Reef towns to become ghost towns will remain honeyed words. The Government is obviously very interested in this problem now, and it is now taking action, which is very belated indeed, but I hope that the Minister will listen very carefully to the proposals put forward by the hon. member for Springs. Government assistance to marginal mines would obviously lengthen the life of some of the mines, but they will still be worked out in a very few years, and the industry must start taking their place now in these areas. Sir, it is rather extraordinary that there is not a single Reef member on the Government side in the House at the moment. You see, Sir, the mining industry now seems to accept that increases in costs are unavoidable, and as the hon. the Minister of Finance told us last year, a rise of 25 cents in costs would mean a loss of 11,500,000 ounces of gold worth about R287,500,000. The hon. member for Springs gave the Committee other figures relating to the gold which is still underground. Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister in his reply this afternoon airily stated that industries on the Reef had already to a large extent taken up the slack caused by the closing down of the mines. Sir, that statement is not correct. Let me tell the Minister that at Springs more than 50 per cent of the residents two years ago, according to a report, were directly or indirectly dependent on the mines in that area. Government officials in an attempt to minimize the difficulties point out that only one-third of the Native workers on the mines are South African Natives, the others being migrant labourers from Portuguese East Africa, the High Commission territories and so on. Sir, it is not a question of those labourers at all; what is at stake here is the future of the settled communities White and Black, in these areas. Not much time remains for action. The assistance granted by the Government to low-grade mines is a step in the right direction, but it is quite obvious that even this step will not keep the mines going for more than 6 or 7 years. You cannot go and look for more gold when there is no more gold left.</p>

<p>Sir, that is all I want to say about the gold mines. There is one other matter on which I would like the hon. the Minister to give us some information. I want to ask him to give us his views on our uranium production, which is at present worth about R110,000,000 to us annually. There is no doubt about it that the secrecy with which this subject has been shrouded is in the main now unnecessary; the Minister&#x2019;s tongue is no longer tied. We had certain difficulties with the Auditor-General with regard to this matter, but every day one reads reports in the newspapers in connection with uranium production. We know that it has been published that in 1960 an agreement was negotiated with the United Kingdom for the deferment of deliveries of uranium oxide to Britain, and a further arrangement was made last year. This information all comes out in the mining reports and it is public knowledge. Will the hon. the Minister please tell us what the present arrangements are with Britain and when shipments under the original agreement to the U.S.A, will cease. As I have said, every day one sees Press reports to the effect that production is being cut down in Canada and the U.S.A. and, speaking from memory, other places, and there is no question that the public is worried as to whether the production of saleable uranium oxide is going to end soon or whether there is a future for the metal. If we are going to lose a product which is worth R100,000,000 a year to us it will be a very heavy loss. Our foreign exchange will be very seriously affected. The Minister must obviously have intimate facts governing this somewhat complicated matter and I hope he will see his way clear to clear the air a little bit for us, particularly in regard to the use of this product in our own country. There has been much talk in the past few years of giving the Western Cape its power through atomic energy on the ground that the Cape people feel that their coal is extremely expensive because it has to be transported over such long distances. This is obviously something which has to be dealt with at some stage in the future. I hope that it will not be dealt with in the dilatory manner in which the marginal mines were dealt with. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister or the Deputy Minister will not tell us whether they are considering the utilization of atomic power in our own country. Will they give us some indication as to what their plans are. There is no necessity whatever to be secretive any more. I hope that the hon. the Minister will heed my plea and give us this information.</p>

<p>I should like this afternoon, having regard to the future industrial development, to bring to the notice of the <span class="col_6277-6278" refersTo="page_472"/>hon. the Minister a matter which is very important to the north-eastern Cape area. What I want to advocate here is a geological survey in the area between the Orange River scheme and the Transkei. I think I am correct in saying that this area can be regarded to-day as the key area. In the development which flows from the Orange River scheme the emphasis should perhaps be placed on the western areas as far as agricultural development is concerned, but I think as far as industrial development is concerned the emphasis should be placed on the eastern areas. The Free State University is at the moment making a survey of natural resources in the eastern area, but unfortunately the area of Griqualand-East is not included in that survey and I would therefore urge the hon. the Minister this afternoon to see that a proper geological survey is made there, not only a surface survey but also a depth survey, because if raw materials are discovered in that area it is going to give a tremendous economic fillip not only to the White areas but also to the Transkei and to the Herschell area, and at this stage it is extremely important that we give our attention to these matters because a prosperous White community and flourishing border industries will mean that both the Herschell area and the Transkei will be able to develop with very great success in the future.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>In the short time left I want to make a few observations relating to the pneumoconiosis report for the year ended 31 March 1963. Paragraph 3 of this report is probably one of the most significant paragraphs we have had in reports relating to pneumoconiosis. Up to September 1962 it would appear that there were 1,609 people who were receiving a lump sum benefit. During the following six months another 767 qualified for a pension. This means that in a period of six months there were 767 miners who had gone through an examination and were found to be suffering from a stage of pneumoconiosis greater than they were up to September 1962. From 31 March 1963 to 31 October 1963 this figure had again jumped from 767 to 1,264. That is really very, very significant because it means that previous to the new examinations it was possible that a large number of miners who were suffering from pneumoconiosis were not certified. It seems strange that there should be such a rapid jump from September 1962 to October 1963. Of the original 1,609 we find that 345 miners were not receiving the pension that the others were receiving.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he would not consider giving these 345 miners who only received the lump-sum payment the pension as well. It is quite obvious that they must be border-line cases. Judging from the figures that I have read to the Minister I feel sure that these 345 miners should be given the benefit of the doubt because in my mind there is a grave doubt as to the stage of pneumoconiosis they have reached. I now ask that these people should also be given the pension the others are receiving.</p>

<p>I want to go further. 267 miners were not certified at all as suffering from any stage of pneumoconiosis. By March 1963 these people were found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis or tuberculosis or both. On going through the figures again I find that eight of those people were actually suffering from tuberculosis. They were missed previously. That was March 1963. But by October of the same year the figure had jumped from 267 to 859 and 52 of those were found to be suffering from tuberculosis. What surprises me is that there should be three and a half times as many people found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis during this period and six and a half times as many people suffering from tuberculosis. This is a very, very serious position. I think the time has come for every single mineworker to undergo special tests to find out whether or not he is suffering from tuberculosis. I do not like this sudden rise in the number of mineworkers who are suffering from tuberculosis. How is the Minister going to tackle this problem?</p>

<p>I would suggest to him that every mineworker be tested preferably by means of a skin test&#x2014;either a patch test or by injection. This will entail a great deal of work but, as I have said previously, the panel doctors must be asked to co-operate. I am certain that the panel doctors will co-operate in trying to detect tuberculosis in the mineworkers. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he issues the necessary equipment to the panel doctors and issues an instruction to the mine managers that each and every mineworker on their mine must, within a certain space of time, visit his panel doctor and be tested for the possible presence of tuberculosis. This is very important in view of what the hon. Minister has just asked us to pass in this House. He has asked us to allow those people who are cured of tuberculosis to go back to the mines. Let us at this stage tackle the question of tuberculosis which is not found by the ordinary normal examination. These people must be examined now so that the tuberculosis will not be discovered only when it is too late. It is tragic that a man should be allowed to work underground and not receive a pension at all because he has not been found to be suffering from any pneumoconiosis but is suddenly found to be suffering from what used to be the fourth stage of pneumoconiosis, without going through any of the other stages; that is, he will be suffering from pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis. It is a very serious position. The Minister must take note of these figures appearing in this report.</p>

<p>I am sorry I cannot go into this in greater detail with the Minister. I want to bring another matter to the notice of the hon. Minister. I am perturbed about the question of residences in the areas of asbestos mines. I cannot ascertain whether or not there is any regulation which sets out how far a residence may be built or how near people may live to an <span class="col_6279-6280" refersTo="page_473"/>asbestos mine or to an asbestos working. The Minister knows how dangerous asbestos dust is. He knows it is a very potent cause of cancer of the lungs. He knows it attacks not only those people who are working in the mine but those people who are working with the asbestos and it can attack those people in close proximity to the mine. He must immediately, if he has not done so yet, institute some regulation whereby the siting of residences must be in an area which is considered safe. It is possible that new asbestos mines may be opened shortly. With the opening of those mines it will be necessary to provide married quarters and I want to ask him to have those residences built not nearer than five miles from the workings. Those residences which are already in existence should not be used by the families of asbestos workers and new residences should be built, if possible, for these people. It is quite reckless to allow these people to live in the vicinity of an asbestos mine. I know every precaution is taken as far as the dust is concerned. I know what the mine owners are expected to do at the moment. But even so no precaution is taken to protect those people living in the area.</p>
