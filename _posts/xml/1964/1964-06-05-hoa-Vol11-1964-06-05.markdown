<heading>Reinvestment of Loan Levy Repayments</heading>

<question by="#taurog" to="#minister_of_finance">

<num>*VII.</num>

<from>Mr. TAUROG</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Finance:</p>

<p>Whether he has considered the granting of special facilities for the reinvestment of the current loan levy repayments; and, if so, what facilities will be granted; if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_finance" to="#taurog">

<from>The MINISTER OF FINANCE:</from>

<p>Yes, but I have come to the conclusion that, in view of the large number of small amounts involved, it would not be practicable to offer special facilities for the reinvestment of the loan levy repayments falling due this year. Excellent facilities for reinvestment are already available, e.g. in taxfree bonds, national savings certificates, and the Post Office Savings Bank, and I hope the public will take full advantage of these facilities.</p>

<li>(2) whether steps are taken to trace the whereabouts of the taxpayers to whom these amounts are due; if so, what steps; and</li>

<li>(3) how is it intended ultimately to dispose of these unclaimed amounts.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_finance" to="#taurog">

<from>The MINISTER OF FINANCE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) 1953&#x2014;R1,053,525.<br/>1957&#x2014; R1,372,562.<br/>1958&#x2014; R4,781,871.</li>

<li>(2) The holders of unredeemed loan levy certificates are reminded periodically through the medium of the Press and the radio that they should claim the amounts due to them. No special steps are taken to trace the whereabouts of individual taxpayers who have not as yet claimed the amounts standing to their credit.<br/>Loan levy certificates are posted to taxpayers by registered mail. In those cases where certificates are returned undelivered, all reasonable steps are taken in an effort to effect delivery of the certificates to their rightful owners.</li>

<li>(3) No decision has been taken in this connection. The unclaimed moneys will probably remain in the Loan Account <span class="col_7253-7254" refersTo="page_960"/>in the same way as the unclaimed amounts of Personal and Savings Fund Levy which were collected during and shortly after the Second World War and have not yet been claimed by the holders of the certificates.</li>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>We propose to discuss the Income Tax Proposals in greater detail, when the Bill comes before the House, and we understand from the hon. the Minister that the Bill will be available as soon as the Committee of Ways and Means has been disposed of. But the hon. Minister knows that his surplus in respect of last year was far bigger than he announced when he made his Budget Speech. We propose to test the matter by showing our disapproval of the Income Tax Proposals by introducing an amendment to the second portion of the proposal, that is to say in paragraph (a) of the proposals as they appear on page 507 of the Votes and Proceedings. The hon. Minister will see that there is a provision there in respect of the taxable income of any other person other than a company, and it says: &#x201C;Provided that there shall be deducted from the amount of tax calculated in accordance with the said tables a sum equal to five per cent of the net amount arrived at after deducting the rebates provided for in Section 6 of the Act&#x201D;. I propose to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph (i), in the fourth line, to omit &#x201C;five&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;ten&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It is quite clear, Mr. Chairman, that in the past year the country was over-taxed and the country continues to be over-taxed, and by proposing that the deduction should be 10 percent <span class="col_7273-7274" refersTo="page_970"/>instead of 5 per cent, the taxpayer will get an additional 5 per cent deduction. As the hon. Minister knows the administrators in three of the provinces have had the courage to reduce taxation in their provinces. They have realized that the taxpayers have been overtaxed, and I hope that the hon. Minister at this stage, where he knows that he has got far more than was intended and the country has been over-taxed and when he knows that the total amount of tax collected from individuals is approximately R158,000,000, an increase of 5 per cent in the deduction will not embarrass the hon. Minister in any way. We know that he has a tax reserve fund and that he has a substantial amount available, and we suggest that this is an opportunity for the Minister to put something into the pockets of the taxpayers. I suggest that this is a reasonable proposal and I hope the hon. Minister will recognize that something is due to the ordinary taxpayer, and for that reason I move my amendment in the hope that the Minister will give it sympathetic consideration if there is any sympathy in his heart at this stage of the Session.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>I am surprised that the hon. member should have moved this amendment. This is the sort of cat-and-mouse game they have been playing in this House for a few years now. They tell us that the country is over-taxed and that income tax should be reduced. But it is those same hon. members who always express the fear that we will have inflation in South Africa. They know just as well as anybody else that if an additional amount of money is put into circulation in the country, inflationary tendencies in South Africa will be encouraged, not discouraged. In every address given by chairmen of companies nowadays one finds that they issue a warning against the danger of inflation. The hon. member has moved an amendment which is directly opposite to the constructive idea that if we want to keep that industry in which those hon. members are very interested&#x2014;the gold-mining industry&#x2014;in operation in South Africa, we must do everything in our power to combat inflation. I want to put a question to the hon. member. Who are the people who are going to gain most by a reduction of 5 per cent in income-tax? Let the hon. member tell us who the people are who are going to gain most by this. Hon. members on the other side posed as the champions of the poor man during the Budget Debate but the income-tax paid by the poor man is such a small amount that a reduction of 5 per cent in this income-tax would simply be a drop in the ocean. The poor man pays income-tax on the basis of about 5 per cent or 6 per cent of his taxable income, after all the deductions which are allowed to him. But the rich man is in a different position. A 10 per cent reduction means a great deal to him. The person who has a taxable income of R10,000 or R12,000 or R20,000 is the person who is going to gain by an amendment of this nature, not the poor man. In this case once again hon. members are fighting for the Hoggenheimers. It is the old story of the &#x2019;twenties and &#x2019;thirties. The Hoggenheimer Party is coming to the fore once again and that is why they have moved an amendment of this nature. But hon. members cannot have their cake and eat it. They told us during the course of this Session and also during previous sessions that certain social services were not being expanded sufficiently. Why have they not rather suggested that some of the money should be used to provide the poorer section of the population with additional social services? One could then have said that they are honest in their view that the poor person should enjoy a greater share of the prosperity that we are experiencing in the country at the moment. But they have not done that. They have moved an amendment which is to the advantage of the rich man. They have destroyed the whole argument which they used during the Budget Debate by adopting the attitude which they have adopted here this morning. I could have accepted the fact that those hon. members were sympathetic as far as the poorer section of the population were concerned if they had suggested that something more should be done for the old age pensioners or the war veterans, or for all pensioners. But instead of doing that, they have moved an amendment the effect of which will be to make greater concessions to the rich, not to the poor.</p>

I want to refer to page 508 of the Minutes of Proceedings, the taxation of gold-mining companies. The formula is y = 60 - 300/x. It is a formula which <i>x</i> has been in operation now for 19 years, and the hon. Minister will know how that formula came into operation. It came as a result of a departmental committee&#x2019;s inquiry. The departmental committee was really what I described on a previous occasion as a drum-head court martial. The members of the committee were: the Secretary for Finance, the Government Mining Engineer, the Commissioner for Inland Revenue, and another official from the Inland Revenue Department. They were the committee that advised the Government, and they introduced this principle which is a grossly unfair principle. They said that the rate of taxation (I do not mean the amount of taxation) should depend on the profit derived by a company. Now we have a company tax. We say it will be 30c in the rand for all companies, and according to the amount of profit, we derive a certain amount of taxation. But that is not the case for the goldmining companies. I know the argument against the gold-mining companies being treated <span class="col_7275-7276" refersTo="page_971"/>as ordinary companies. It is what has been called the &#x201C;hole-in-the-ground&#x201D; theory. The theory is that gold and diamonds are the patrimony of South Africa, they belong to the people. Those of us who are citizens of this country are privileged to exploit that wealth and are naturally taking that wealth out of the ground. I agree with all that. We all accept that. It is no new conception, but I want to say that on the lease formula, the Government comes in at the beginning as the biggest shareholder in a mine. It has nothing to do with taxation.</p>

<p>I should like the hon. member to take part in the debate. Let us thrash this out once and for all. The Government comes in under the lease system with the result that in the case of one mine that I have in mind the taxation is not 30c in the rand, but 52c, and above that the Government has another 20c as its share in the lease: 72c in the rand in lease and taxation! I think it is unfair. My appeal to the Minister is that he should reconsider the whole system and tell us if it is not possible to have another inquiry. I cannot give him an immediate solution, but I have a suggestion. I am not the first person to suggest this. It was considered by the Social and Economic Planning Council, and they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council does not, however, endorse the committee&#x2019;s approval of the formula for income-tax on the gold mines.</block>

<p>They say we should not have that formula&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These considerations reinforce the council&#x2019;s recommendation in the seventh report: &#x201C;That the income-tax on gold mining be progressively revised so as eventually to bring it into line with the tax on the income of other public companies.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was a Government council. In addition to that we had the Steyn Commission of which the late Mr. Raymond Steyn was the chairman. They were asked to advise on income-tax.</p>

<p>When they were just ready to start their work they received a second directive from the hon. Minister of Finance of those days, Mr. Havenga, to exclude the gold mines from their considerations. But although they were excluded from their consideration, the Steyn Commission felt bound to say that they could not carry out a thorough inquiry without considering the gold mines as well. They said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We regard the application of differential rates of taxation to different enterprises as unsound in principle. It is our view that as far as income-tax is concerned, the nature of the taxpayer&#x2019;s business should not be taken into account in fixing the rate of taxation, but that in relation to each special class of taxpayer, uniform rates should be applied to all types of businesses.</block>

<p>In the old days we were told that the investors in gold-mining shares were the rich men overseas who were exploiting South Africa. Who is the investor to-day? The poor man in this country, the man of small means, the man of moderate means.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I will try to help the hon. member in his education about the gold mines and gold-mining investment. To-day we have a new development in South Africa. This development has taken place over the last ten years. We have what is known as institutional investment. A man says: &#x201C;I am going to insure my life so that my widow will have something to live on.&#x201D; He buys an insurance policy. Where is the money invested? To-day it is not only being invested in preference shares and in government loans. It is being invested in gold-mining equities and other equities. In other words, the whole of the community in South Africa to-day is interested in gold-mining investment. I want to say this to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;I want to give him a solution, an approach. My approach is that he should work gradually, as the Social and Economic Council said, towards 30c for all companies. I am not speaking of the companies that the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) has been interested in. They fall in different categories. We are keeping them alive, it is a subsistence vote in their case. But there should be a gradual change and the first step should be that the hon. Minister should introduce this formula: y = 50-300/x as a start and gradually from that work back to one level system of taxation for all companies in South Africa. I think that is a fair suggestion. I ask the hon. Minister to do this, and to appoint a commission. They can report within six months so that in his next Budget the hon. Minister can make the change. There is no reason whatsoever why he should not do so. I don&#x2019;t mind what commission is appointed. I do not want the officials of the Department to have the final say, as they did 19 years ago. I want us all to have a chance to give evidence if necessary. But I think it is discriminatory, grossly unfair to say to one group of private investors that they will be taxed differently from other investors. The hon. member for Krugersdorp regards an investment in gold mining as being something that is anathema to him. Any other type of investment apparently is acceptable. Think of diamonds. Diamonds are also part of the patrimony, and hon. members opposite perhaps can tell us something about diamonds.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I rise not to reply to the questions of the hon. member for <span class="col_7277-7278" refersTo="page_972"/>Kensington (Mr. Moore) because I am sure that the hon. the Minister will reply to him. Hon. members opposite have mentioned the question of mine taxation&#x2014;this was also done in the past&#x2014;and have made it out to be a tax which is disproportionate in its application. The hon. member has tried to make out now for the umpteenth time that the tax paid by the investor in the mining industry of South Africa is not the same as the tax which other ordinary companies have to pay. But what the hon. member does not want to appreciate&#x2014;and this is something which is clearly apparent from the Budget every year&#x2014;is the fact that large concessions are made to the investor in the mining industry, particularly in regard to new mines. Why does the hon. member not mention the concession by the Government to the investor in gold mines&#x2014;a concession whereby the development capital and the cost of sinking shafts can be written off completely? Why does the hon. member not mention this fact? I think that the ordinary farmers and small shop owners would like to be given this concession because then there would be far fewer bankruptcies amongst the farmers and new small undertakings. Do the small investors in industry and in the factories receive this privilege? Certainly not. But the hon. member does not want to appreciate that concession to the mines. When are the mines taxed? They are only taxed when they reach their final production stage. Let me tell the hon. member&#x2014;if he will listen to me&#x2014;how mining profits are often not reflected for income-tax purposes. It is very easy to do this. You probably know, Mr. Chairman, and I am sure many hon. members here will know, that as far as many of the mines are concerned, the same shareholders or the same controlling bodies also have an interest in materials which are used in those mines. At a certain stage in the development of the mine it happens that where, for example, they have an interest in cement&#x2014;I can mention many more examples but time does not permit me to do so&#x2014;as much cement as can possibly be used is used, because this increases expenses, and the people who have interests in the mine then make a profit on cement. I wish that a commission could be appointed to investigate all these integrated interests. One would then realize that the mining industry in South Africa has nothing to complain about. On the contrary, they are given preferential treatment in comparison with the vast number of investors in South Africa. I remember the days when I sat where the hon. member for Kensington is sitting now. Sir Ernest Oppenheimer sat a little way from me. He told us the same story the hon. member has told us to-day&#x2014;about the widow who invested her savings in mines&#x2014;and he said that the Minister was unjust in taxing her in that way; she did not know of the high rate of taxation when she invested her money in mining shares. Mr. Chairman, you know that they are the people who lose in the process of the manipulation of the mines. It is the small investors who lose; there are probably a large number of them sitting opposite; there are a few on this side as well. There is the odd person on this side of the House too who is silly enough to invest his money in that way. They are always the losers, always the victims of this manipulation. It is the few who do the manipulating who know the precise limit of the mines and who know when the shares in the mine can be expected to rise&#x2014;this can be done on instruction&#x2014;who make the large profits. There may be certain parts of the mine in which high grade ore is found. They can leave this ore undeveloped for a year or two. As the grade of ore deteriorates, so the shares start falling. At a certain stage, when the shares are very low and the small shareholder has become discouraged and has disposed of his shares, there is a sudden rise in the price of the shares because instructions will have been given for that part of the mine producing the low grade ore to be closed and the part of the mine containing the high grade ore to be worked. Then the price of the shares skyrocket. The manipulators of the mines therefore know that they must buy when the shares are at their lowest.</p>

If we really want to do ourselves a good turn we must appoint a com mission to investigate this question of manipulation&#x2014;in other words, the arbitrary raising or lowering of the grade of ore mined. It is certainly not the widows of whom the hon. member spoke who can make those shares rise or fall to that extent. It is those few individuals who can manipulate the shares. I am sure that it will have a salutary effect upon the mining industry in South Africa if a com mission is appointed at some stage or other to investigate this matter so that we can put an end to the stories about the poor widows and the poor shareholders who lose their money in this way.</p>

One often finds when one sees a man walking about with a long face that he is a person who has had a little money saved up and who has invested it ip a mine. The next thing he knows, the shares have fallen resulting in his having to dispose of the few shares that he has. But that does not happen to the important people.</p>

<p>I shall abide by your ruling, Sir. I was merely replying to the argument advanced by the hon. member that the Government applies an unfavourable method of taxation as far as the mines are concerned in comparison with the taxation on other companies. I say that one has to consider the picture as a whole and also consider the many concessions to the gold-mining industry. When we do so, we find that the gold mines have nothing to complain about. I just want to remind you, Mr. Chairman, that there were times when it was difficult to obtain capital for the mines. But it is no longer difficult to find that capital to-day. Only yesterday we noticed from the newspapers that Mr. Oppenheimer has said that other spheres of investment will have to be found. They no longer complain that they cannot find the money for investment purposes in the mines. The position to-day is just the reverse. If those concessions had not been made by the Government, people would not have been in the favourable position of having so much capital available that they no longer know what to do with it.

<p>Two hon. members on the other side have so far entered this debate. The first was the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) who accused us of representing Hoggenheimer, and he went on to say that that was all we did. Well the end of the Session is not yet here and we have continually fought for the poor man, the war veteran, the war widow and the people in the lower income group, and the hon. member will have the opportunity later on to support us or not in regard to this. He has committed himself to support us in future debates.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) made certain wild statements, but he apparently does not appreciate how our mining taxation is determined. Our mining taxation is really founded on the desire to stop the mines from picking the eyes out of the reef, and where people are told to leave the rich pockets alone, then that is done, because it is not government policy, nor mining group policy to pick the eyes out of mines. The lower the grade, the lower the tax.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one matter that I tried to deal with before and that is the relief given to the American-South African Investment Trust Company whose income is exempt from taxation and which has entered into a special arrangement with the Government in regard to the repatriation of its capital. Last year, in February, the hon. Minister told me in reply to a question that the amount covered by the Reserve Bank guarantee to this company was R35,000,000, but he refused to say what amount has been exempted from taxation. Mr. Chairman, this exemption was brought into the Act five years ago with the object of encouraging the inflow of foreign capital. We were always vehemently opposed to this particular concession, but our protestations had no effect whatever. The notice in regard to this arrangement with the American-South African Investment Company was gazetted on 28 November 1958 a little over five years ago, and the last paragraph (d) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The company does not intend to buy and sell shares purely speculatively for the purpose of deriving its main profit from short-term price fluctuations on the Stock Exchange.</block>

<p>In reply to a question this Session, the Minister said to me &#x201C;No special investigation has been made, but from information at the disposal of my Department it appears that the company has complied with all the relevant conditions&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman, the taxation benefits to this company must be very large. I will give a couple of examples of taxes paid by similar companies in 1963, and I took these figures from the <i>Mining Journal</i> in February 1964: Anglo-Vaal paid R333,000, Consolidated Gold Fields paid R2.619,000, the J.C.I. paid R446,000, and in 1962 they paid R2,592,000. Things have improved immensely on the share market and in business generally and I do suggest that these figures will be far exceeded this year, and that the American-South African Company may probably have saved tax to the tune of R3,000,000 during the last financial year. Mr. Chairman, surely conditions have changed since this concession was granted. We are on a war footing. There is tremendous Government expenditure on Defence and Police, resulting in the so-called &#x201C;boom&#x201D;, and we have all been taxed excessively in the name of the safety of the State. Why then should anyone be allowed to get away with profits which are not taxed? Surely this enormous expenditure on Defence is to protect the assets and capital of all of us. Nobody is entitled to receive such preferential protection as this American-South African Investment Co. enjoys. The concession was granted to entice capital to this country. That I accept. Now we are told that we are so prosperous that overseas capital is largely unnecessary and may even become an embarrassment. I do not accept the embarrassment part of course. But I do want to point out what the Minister could do with the taxes which he should get from this company. In the last two years R3,000,000 has been estimated to have come from estate duty. The tax on the profits of the American-South African Investment Trust Co. would probably be big enough to enable the Minister to wipe out estate duties completely without affecting this Budget, and surely that <span class="col_7281-7282" refersTo="page_974"/>under present conditions would be a better way of bringing foreign money to South Africa. I am not suggesting any retrospectivity in regard to the taxation on this company. Surely the Minister was not so foolish as to enter into agreement without making provision for cancellation. Surely he is not in a position where he has to come back to this House to give him authority to cancel. I hope he will let us know whether or not that is the position. I say that this company has had vast benefits from this contract and cannot have any complaint whatever if the contract is now altered on reasonable notice and after discussions as between ordinary business men. I suggest to the Minister that he take immediate steps to bring this arrangement to an end and also to abolish death duties entirely. Such an abolition would be a magnet to overseas investors and would take us out of our embarrassing currency controls. If the one concession is granted and the one removed it is quite possible that on balance there would be no diminution of the revenue of the Minister. Here is an opportunity I am handing to him on a plate. He can get the tax from this company and use it to wipe out death duties and in that way bring enormous benefits to the country. Conditions have changed. Our enormous expenditure on Defence calls on all to contribute towards the cost of protecting what is theirs in whatever form.</p>

<p>Ever since the hon. the Minister introduced his Budget, we have been trying to get some relief for the taxpayer of the country, but unfortunately not very successfully. So we use this occasion to make one further attempt to have the rebate increased from 5 to 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Now, one expects from the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) to shout the word &#x201C;inflation&#x201D; at us, but we are reaching the stage where if the economy of this country continues to prosper and the so-called boom expands, we are going to have to get more and more by way of taxation to take care of the inflation created by the boom in our economy. And eventually we will have the vicious circle where eventually everything we earn will have to be paid in taxation if what the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) says is correct. But where is this boom? I think we all agree that conditions are good, but the bulk of the benefits that are being derived from conditions in this country goes to businesses operated as companies. We are, of course, not asking for a reduction in companies tax and the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) must not come here and talk about Oppenheimers because if he will look at the breakdown of taxation he will find that the bulk of the taxation is being paid by the middle group of white collar earners, people who have had no benefit from the boom and no relief from taxation. So when we come and ask for a further rebate of 5 per cent these are the people who will benefit most. The entrepreneurs or capitalists, whatever you like to call them, may make their profits through the companies which they administer where there is a fixed rate of taxation. It is true they pay on dividends and on salaries but that is infinitesimal in relation to their normal income through companies. But to the white collar worker who has had no relief from taxation, such an extra rebate will bring some benefits.</p>

<p>But there is also another facet to this question of inflation. One thing that one is entitled to expect is a certain amount of consistency in Government taxation. The hon. the Minister says he cannot give any further relief because he must guard against inflation. But the Administrators of the four provinces may have different views on the subject. They may say that as far as they are concerned, there can be some tax relief&#x2014;relief on personal tax, on entertainment tax, etc. That then will not affect inflation. But I wonder whether the fact that there are going to be four provincial elections next year had anything to do with the fact that the relief there was in taxation was given by the provinces and not by the Central Government. Not even the Minister can tell us that there is no co-operation between the provinces and the Central Government when it comes to the question of taxation on the provincial level.</p>

<p>But I hope, although I suppose it will be a pious hope, that the hon. the Minister will soften his heart and give us this very small modicum of relief&#x2014;just another 5 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down was apparently not fully convinced that what he had to say was correct because if he had been, he would have put more fire into what he had to say. When asked who the persons were who would derive most benefit from a further concession of 5 per cent, he said that it would be the people in the middle income group, but he did not define the middle income group for us. He did not specify who these people are. Are they the people earning more than R4,000 per year or more than R6,000? Or are they the people earning less than R2,000 or more than R10,000? You see, Mr. Chairman, it is very easy to make a statement without explaining what one means. It is possible for anybody to make any statement in this way and by so doing to succeed in misleading those people who are not acquainted with the position.</p>

<p>I reject his statement that it will be the middle income group which will derive most benefit from this fact. But let us imagine that they are the people who will derive most benefit from it. They will then be the people who are going to spend an additional amount of money on consumer goods and by so doing encourage inflationary tendencies. Many of them still do not enjoy the highest standard of living possible and therefore they can always increase their standard of living a little. But, after all, it will be the rich man who will derive most benefit from this amendment of the United Party, not the poor man who needs <span class="col_7283-7284" refersTo="page_975"/>it most. If the yardstick is to be who needs it most, then I say that the poor man, who does need it most, will derive no benefit from this amendment.</p>

<p>I also want to say a few words in connection with the plea made by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) in regard to mine taxation. I cannot agree with everything said by the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) in this regard. The manipulation of mining shares has already been eliminated to a large extent. That is a thing of the past. I agree with him that the South African life insurance companies and other institutions&#x2014;let us call them group savings institutions&#x2014;have a large share not only in mining companies but also in industrial companies in the country. The important factor as far as they are concerned is to invest wisely and well. They have made their investments well knowing what the present tax rate is and what the profit is which they are going to receive on their investment. So they have not invested with the idea of receiving concessions in regard to taxation. But there are a few things which I want to tell the hon. member for Kensington in regard to our tax structure for the gold mines. He spoke about the quantity of money which the mines pay in mining rentals. He regards that as taxation. But a mining rental is not a tax. If it is, one may just as well say that a person who rents a farm from the State and pays a rental of R2,000 per annum for that farm is paying the State tax for that farm. That is a silly argument. The correct position is that it is only what one receives that is subject to income tax. That is the case throughout. The hon. member must therefore not confuse the two. If he does confuse the two, he will only spoil his argument, that is to say, if he has a good argument. He may perhaps have an argument which one can consider, although not from the point of view from which he considers it. The mines do not pay tax until they have shown a profit. In this way, therefore, the mines are given better terms than the man who rents a farm from the State because the man who rents a farm has to continue paying his rental whether he makes a profit or not.</p>

<p>If the hon. member really wanted to make out a case, he should have told the hon. the Minister that other companies pay 30 per cent of their taxable income in tax while the mines pay on a variable basis&#x2014;some less than 30 per cent and others considerably more. The basic idea here is, however, that the gold mines are a disappearing asset. The extra income which the State derives from the goldmining industry has to be used to finance new developments and to set up new industries which can one day replace the worked out mines so that the economy of the country can continue once the gold mines disappear. Where mines pay more than 30 per cent, therefore, the logical thing to do is to pay that money over into Loan Account because it is that Account which is used for all the development projects in the country. If the hon. member had adopted this attitude, one could have said that there was a certain amount of logic in his arguments. But I want to tell him in all honesty that we cannot agree with the attitude that he has adopted.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down at least could follow the argument I have put forward, although he does not agree with the point of view I have advanced. I am, however, afraid that I cannot say the same with regard to the hon. member for Krugersdorp. That hon. member is living in the days that have passed. We have since seen a revolution in South Africa as far as investments are concerned. In the olden days arguments were thrown across the floor of the House here about the ownership of mines, of the Hoggenheimers, the rich people, who were exploiting South Africa. The argument against this exploitation was that we should build up our secondary industry. That period has arrived. The boom that has been taking place for the last two years is not a boom in gold-mining shares. It is a boom in secondary industry. South Africa is not yet a fully developed country. It is, however, no longer an undeveloped country. As a matter of fact, it is one of the most rapidly developing countries in the world. Our wealth is now being directed towards secondary industry. When I speak of investors, I do not speak of a widow as a widow but as a person whose money is invested in an insurance company. Has the hon. member for Krugersdorp not heard of the South African Mutual, Sanlam, Santam? How grateful we should be to these companies for the part they played in 1961 and 1962, when they came to the rescue of South Africa when overseas countries lost all confidence in us! But these people through institutional investment were prepared to say that they had confidence in the country. Many people overseas adopted the same attitude.</p>

<p>To-day I am speaking of the gold-mining industry as an investment similar to secondary industry. I am not concerned with the fact that a company which is interested in the development of a gold mine may also be interested in a cement company. That is true of all interlocking companies, of farms and implement makers and in whatever industry. It is therefore not an exceptional thing. To the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) I want to say that I am not putting forward any fixed plan. I have merely made a suggestion for a gradual change. What I should like to ask the Minister is to have a fresh investigation. Surely after 19 years and with recent developments in South Africa, the time has arrived when a fresh appreciation should be made? Military people say you should appreciate a situation regularly and frequently. Such an appreciation should be undertaken now. As far as the goldmining industry is concerned, it will be very difficult to find an investment company interested only in gold-mining shares. You may find some, but not many. To-day every great investment <span class="col_7285-7286" refersTo="page_976"/>company looks for a spreadover. They are to-day investing in equities, and because they are going in for equity investment&#x2014;or what we in South Africa call the ordinary shares of companies&#x2014;every citizen of the country is concerned. It is a recent development. Everybody is concerned, not only the man who has 300 or 400 shares in a goldmining company; everybody is concerned through his investments in institutions&#x2014;in pension funds for instance. He is concerned how his money which he contributes to a pension fund is invested. I can give you the assurance that it is invested in gold-mining shares, in industry, in equities, in addition to Government loans, and in addition to preference shares. This mode of investment is to-day regarded as the correct method of investment of these funds. And we know that the industrial boom has come because there has been a demand for these shares. That is the cause of it. The hon. member referred to Mr. Oppenheimer and what he said at the annual general meeting of his company. He said there that they were looking for fresh fields of investments. They wish to help South Africa forward and the more they want to do this, the better.</p>

<p>I feel that the gold-mining industry is now the orphan of the storm. To-day gold-mining companies are no longer those privileged companies they were supposed to be a generation ago. To-day they are in a most difficult position.</p>

<p>I am surprised at the attitude of the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) particularly when one has regard to the constituents he represents. He said a further rebate would only affect the rich people and that the people of the low income groups would not benefit at all, or if they would receive any benefit, it would be so small that it did not really matter. I hope he will go and tell that to his constituents in the recess. To me the hon. member has talked without looking at the relevant schedules. Now, if we look at these, we shall see that the proposed tax a person with an income of R600 will have to pay is R34. Surely a reduction of 10 instead of 5 per cent would make a difference to that man? The tax in the case of an income of R600 to R1,000 is R64; on R1,000 to R1,200&#x2014;R80 &#x2026;</p>

<p>There are rebates I admit, but the hon. member should stick to the rates. No doubt the hon. member has read the report of the Secretary for Inland Revenue, although I doubt whether he understands it. According to that report there are 31,000 taxpayers in the income bracket R1,800 to R1,899; and 230,140 in the income bracket R2,000 to R2,999. Surely this is a significant number of people who have to be considered. But the hon. member dismisses any concession to these people whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Minister was completely out in his original estimates and he has a substantial surplus. Now, here is the opportunity at the end of this Session to do something for the ordinary taxpayer. I suggest to the Minister that he ignores the suggestions made by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) because this hon. member is obviously not looking after his constituents. The Minister should instead consider the proposals we have made and increase the rebate from 5 to 10 per cent. By doing that he will give a welcome relief to a vast number of taxpayers. What is more, the Minister will merely be following the excellent lead by the Administrators of three of the provinces, who were quite satisfied that by giving a small measure of tax relief would not be inflationary.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Unlike the hon. member for Pretoria (Central), I am not at all surprised at the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pinetown. I credit this hon. member with a well-developed sense of humour. If I did not give this charitable interpretation to the amendment and to the hon. member who moved it, I would have had to accuse the hon. member of being extremely irresponsible. But that I do not want to do and am glad therefore for the alternative. I am quite prepared to give sympathetic consideration to his amendment when the economic and fiscal conditions warrant the letting loose of almost R8,000,000 for spending purposes during a time of prosperity as we have now. But if circumstances warrant it, I shall do so. I am also taking this into consideration in the tax reserve proposals I have made.</p>

<p>Now, we in this country have a proud record, a record based on the fact that we have contained inflation more successfully than most other countries in the world. And I think it would be highly irresponsible if we were now to put that proud record in jeopardy by making a concession of the nature proposed by the hon. member. I think it will be irresponsible <span class="col_7287-7288" refersTo="page_977"/>of a Minister of Finance under present economic conditions to accede to the suggestion made by the hon. member. In this country we want growth with stability and it would be unwise for me to be a party to frittering away the prosperity which we are now enjoying, frittering it away by encouraging inflationary trends. As a matter of fact, I considered very seriously whether the existing 5 per cent rebate should continue under the present economic and fiscal conditions. In the end I decided that in view of the country&#x2019;s highly developed sense of stability, I could venture it but that I certainly could not go further.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Pinetown comes along and says that we must look at what the Administrators have done. But the Administrators have not to regard the general economic position of the country. They are not entrusted with the task of ensuring the financial stability of the country &#x2026;</p>

<p>When the time comes and when the fiscal and economic conditions permit it, further reductions can be considered, because I am not the one to withhold anything from the taxpayer. I have always said that if conditions favour it, he should be the one who should get whatever can be given. But when there is a danger, I must withhold.</p>

<p>Then there is the perennial subject of gold mine taxation. The hon. member for Kensington has painted a very one-sided picture in this connection. I wonder whether there is another company that only comes into the taxation net when its profits exceed 6 per cent. I wonder whether there is any other company, this point was made by the hon. member for Krugersdorp also, which is allowed to write off all its capital expenditure before it becomes liable to taxation. These are concessions which the hon. member did not mention. I know of a company with a profit of over R3,000,000 without having to pay a cent in taxation under the formula. So the position is not as difficult as the hon. member tried to make it out. There is another side to it. I would have thought that the hon. member would have employed his ingenuity to much better purposes. He should have given me some guidance on how to encourage the gold mines not only to work the richer but also the lower ore deposits. When my Vote was under discussion, I said I was proposing setting aside R15,000,000 for a national strategic resources fund for the prospecting and development of oil and other strategic minerals and also for prolonging the lives of marginal profit mines and also for providing an incentive to gold mines not to leave the lower grade ore resources untouched and to take out only the higher grade ore. That is more the type of relief, the type of use to which I could put any available money, in the interests of the country as a whole and of the gold-mining industry.</p>

<p>Well, if you look at the dividend declarations on the profits, then this is really not a poor relation clamouring for a little bit of help in order to keep body and soul together. I do not think that is their attitude. As far as the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) is concerned, I want to point out to him that ordinarily a company which does not buy and sell shares as a business does not pay any taxes on capital profits. That is the ordinary position, and in the case of the American-South African Company on this principle is admitted without any new concessions; it is granted to them as it is granted to any other company, and I think the hon. member is not entitled to estimate the amount of tax relief to the American-South African Company by reference to the taxes paid by other financial companies. It depends on the circumstances and policy of each individual company; it depends on what its profits are from the sale of stocks and shares and whether or not it makes a practice of selling and buying shares for the profits involved; in other words, whether the profits made by it on the sale of shares are taxable profits. It depends on the policy of the company.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the half hour. I think it is wise at this stage of our development, with this opportunity having been created to debate the portfolio of labour, that we should very briefly review the position as it exists to-day, particularly in relation to our manpower problem, and thus give the Minister an opportunity of telling the country what he has in mind by way of solutions not only in relation to the manpower problem but in other directions as well, particularly in respect of Bantu wages. I think if I briefly sketch what we know and then ask the Minister to fill in the gaps, we will get a complete picture as to what the problems are, and that will give us an opportunity of appreciating the position that exists to-day. Sir, the hon. the Minister is Minister of Labour as well as Minister of Immigration. I am not going to deal with the immigration side; that will be dealt with under a later Vote and the Minister will be able to give us the latest <span class="col_7293-7294" refersTo="page_980"/>figures in relation to the immigration position as it affects the manpower position, particularly in the skilled trades. As far as the Apprenticeship Act is concerned I think the Minister should indicate to what extent the amendments which were introduced last year have assisted in meeting the difficulties which the amendments were designed to overcome, and I think he should indicate how many inspectors have been appointed in terms of that Act to go into the apprenticeship difficulties in relation to their training, etc., and then I think he should tell us how the new provisions with regard to the registration of workseekers and aptitude testing is progressing; whether they have proved to be effective, and whether the new system of determining the wages of apprentices is in force yet. By that I mean that we would like to know whether a percentage of the artisan rate is now being applied to the apprentices. I know that there have been delays but I would like the hon. the Minister to give us a complete picture in that regard at the present time. Finally as far as apprentices are concerned we would like to know whether or not there have been more contract registrations as the result of the amendments made to the Act. Then in regard to the Training of Artisans Act, has there been an increase in the allowance paid to trainees and have employers co-operated in this regard in making it possible for more trainees to be trained in terms of the Act? As far as the Native Building Worker&#x2019;s Act is concerned, has the Minister accepted the fact, as stated by his colleague, the Minister of Bantu Education, that we can expect no relief as far as Bantu artisans are concerned in respect of building activities in the so-called White areas. The Minister of Bantu Education says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All the Bantu trained under the Native Building Workers Act will be required to work in the Bantu areas. He cannot get enough trained Bantu workers for the volume of work offering.</block>

<p>Sir, I mention this because there has been an appeal to the Minister to allow Bantu artisans to come into the building industry, but from what the Minister of Bantu Education has said that is not going to be possible because he is extremely short of these workers for the Bantu areas themselves.</p>

<p>Then with regard to the training of operatives and the pilot scheme introduced in Pretoria, has this been successful and will it be extended to other areas? We would like to know what the position is in that regard, because I think this scheme showed some promise of meeting some of the difficulties that we are facing. Sixthly, now that the Minister&#x2019;s Department has control over the manpower board we would like to hear from him what his policy is in regard to the release of certain apprentices who are desperately required to complete their training to help to meet the skilled labour needs in this country. The point I want to make here is this: To me it appears to be nonsensical to interrupt an apprentice&#x2019;s training period and to send him to the army for nine months when there are still thousands and thousands of young men who have escaped the ballot and who are neither doing work in industries in which there is a shortage of manpower nor are they making a contribution as far as the army is concerned. It does appear to me to be ridiculous to interrupt the training of apprentices for military training while other youngsters who have escaped the ballot are being allowed by the military authorities to continue in occupations in which there is no shortage of manpower. I should like to hear what the Minister&#x2019;s policy is in this regard.</p>

<p>The next issue is the greater employment of White females. I know that here we face the difficulty that we also want to increase our White population and that should be the main objective of the Department of Labour as far as women employees are concerned. We have asked the Minister to consider the principle of equal pay for equal work in respect of White women and we would like to know what the Minister has in mind. Speeches have been made on the Government side in respect of the greater utilization of the services of White women and we would like to know what the Minister has in mind in that regard; whether he wishes to employ them in greater numbers and under what conditions he envisages they should be employed.</p>

<p>Those are the main Acts which are involved in the manpower position. Then on the other hand, as far as conditions of service and wages are concerned, there is firstly the Industrial Conciliation Act, and I want to quote one section of this Act because it has a bearing on what I want to say a little later. I refer to Section 48 (12). The end of that sub-section says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that there can be no differentiation or discrimination on the basis of race or colour.</block>

<p>I want the Minister to bear this in mind in the light of what I am going to say a little later, but I mention it now because it always has been part of our industrial code that any employee covered by Industrial Conciliation Act wage agreements shall not be discriminated against on the basis of race or colour. As far as the Wage Act is concerned I hope the Minister will be able to report that the board has been able to overtake most of the backlog in reviewing old wage determinations, and that he will be able to indicate what he has in mind for the Wage Board in respect of determinations which have become old since they started reviewing those which were old at the time they started their review. Is this work to continue at a more accelerated rate, or what is the position? The Central Native Labour Board, according to the figures which the Minister has released, has assisted 169,000 Bantu workers to have their wages improved at a total cost of some R3,300,000. This, of <span class="col_7295-7296" refersTo="page_981"/>course, is part and parcel of the Industrial Conciliation Act in that the Native Labour Board representatives are in on the negotiations in terms of that Act whenever their wages are under consideration.</p>

<p>As far as the Shops and Offices Act is concerned, the new Bill introduces the principle of collective bargaining in a modified form, and this Act together with the new Bill, linked with the collective bargaining proposals in the Industrial Conciliation Act, represent the main methods by which we get an improvement in wages and conditions of employment. Sir, that is a very sketchy review of what we know is happening, and the Minister can fill in some of the details to give us the complete picture. In 1956 when the Industrial Conciliation Act was introduced, the job reservation clauses were inserted against the strongest opposition from this side of the House, but I think it would be just as well to review the position in that regard so as to get a clear picture. Over a period of eight years there have been some 14 awards, nine of local application; two have been suspended from operation; then there has been one in the clothing industry and there have been two in the building industry. If we take the number of employees who are &#x201C;protected&#x201D; in terms of this job reservation provision I do not think it can be a figure of more than 5,000. In other words, where we have a most acute shortage of manpower job reservation has not played any part whatsoever. What has controlled conditions there has been the application of the principle of the rate for the job, which is the policy of this side of the House. I think the cry that we have had here about the value of job reservation can be discounted completely because in a period of eight years the tribunal has not been called upon to make any awards in respect of employees who have taken part in our main industrial development, in respect of employees engaged in the industrial sector in which this tremendous expansion has taken place. In other words, the application of the principle of the rate for the job through the Industrial Conciliation Act has proved quite satisfactory in all these respects, and I think that is something of which we should take particular note. The application of the rate for the job and the prohibition of differentiation on the basis of race or colour in wage determinations under the Act has, I believe, left a loophole and I want the Minister to tell us what steps he has taken to meet this position. I can best describe it by explaining what I believe is happening mainly in industry to-day. There has been a breaking-down of skilled work to semi-skilled work, and semiskilled work to unskilled work. There has also been the introduction of automation. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether the principle of the rate for the job is being applied where Bantu workers are employed in this breakdown? In years gone by this work was done by Europeans at fixed rates in terms of Industrial Council agreements. Because of the breakdown from skilled work to semi skilled work, etc., and the utilization of Bantu labour in considerable numbers it does not appear as if the rate for the job has been applied in that breakdown. The result has been the employment of Bantu workers on work which was formerly classified as skilled and the employment of Bantu workers on work which was formerly classified as semi-skilled. Yet there has been no corresponding acceptance by the Department of Labour, as far as I can understand, of the principle of the rate for the job in respect of these jobs which have been broken down. In other words, where a White person or a Coloured person, in terms of the I. C. Act was being paid a certain rate for a semi-skilled job the Bantu who is doing that job to-day is not getting that rate. It may be that the Department is not aware of this factor; it may be that the Department have closed their eyes to it because they are not able to supply the necessary White labour. But whatever the case may be it shows, I think, a glaring weakness in the present system where we are attempting to close the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers.</p>

<p>We have this position that it is almost impossible for the Department of Labour to control this breakdown from skilled work which was formerly done by Whites to semi-skilled and unskilled work which is now being done by Bantu in increasing numbers. I am interested to know whether the manpower position is being met in this way while the wage structure is not being maintained at what it was? In other words, I do not wish to see the exploitation of Bantu workers because of a shortage of White workers. This has nothing whatsoever to do with job reservation because job reservation, where you have no reservoir of White workers, cannot meet the position which has developed as a result of our tremendous expansion.</p>

<p>The position I am putting to the hon. the Minister is one which, I believe, we have to meet and that is why I am raising it to-day. Tied up with this is the question of what is preventing a more rapid closing of the gap between the wages of Bantu workers and other race groups? Some of us hoped that the collective bargaining principle would be sufficient to meet the position but as the Minister knows the Bantu is not included in the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; in terms of the I. C. Act. They therefore fall outside the provisions for collective bargaining except where the Native Labour Board comes into the picture and negotiated on behalf of the Bantu.</p>

<p>I think the position is well illustrated by an article which appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 6 December 1963. Here we have the reactions of the employers in respect of this problem. They say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Accepted from the outset was the realization that any labour savings which could be made belonged morally to the workers and should be applied to raising rates of pay. Whereas the opportunities for advancement <span class="col_7297-7298" refersTo="page_982"/>of the European were limited by his own abilities, only those of the non-European were strictly limited by considerations beyond the employer&#x2019;s control or his own.</block>

<p>What is being referred to here is the fact that we have no labour machinery for dealing collectively with Bantu workers, machinery that is covered by the Industrial Conciliation Act or the Wage Board. Some employers are desirous of improving wages but because of the competitive factor cannot do so on their own. The Minister will appreciate that under collective bargaining all the employers in the particular industry are bound by the determination and the employees then get the benefit. But where you have an employer who wishes to improve the wages of the Bantu in his employ and he finds that if he were to do that he would be putting himself outside the competitive market in respect of other employers in the same industry who were not prepared to fall into line with the increase, you will find that he does not improve those wages. I say to the Minister that we have no machinery whatsoever to deal with this problem. When I suggested that we could possibly use the machinery which has now been set up in the Shops and Offices Act, as an illustration of how collective bargaining could be applied to meet this problem, the Minister turned round and said I was advocating the recognition of Bantu trade unions. That was a diversion, Sir, and I want the Minister to realize that that is not the attitude of the Opposition. What we say is that in the absence of Bantu trade unions machinery should be set up to deal with this problem of making it possible for employers to give effect to a policy of increasing Bantu wages without endangering their own position in respect of the cost structure. I think that position has to be met. We hear the cry for an increase in Bantu wages from all sides. We have also heard why individual employers are not in a position to do much about it. I believe the Department of Labour have got to find the answer in providing the machinery to deal with this problem.</p>

<p>The Minister will appreciate that Wage Board determinations are negotiated mainly by trade unions and employers but they do not deal with the problem of the employer who wishes to take a further step forward and give his Bantu employees wage conditions better than those laid down in a Wage Board determination. Because of the delay in the review of Wage Board determinations we get this time lag and the problem that is created by employers who wish to play their part and are unable to do so.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to say to the Minister that he has a duty in respect of his own Department. He also has a collective responsibility as a member of the Cabinet to see that the Government itself sets an example by increasing Bantu wages wherever it is possible to do so. It should be the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to set the pace. They are not doing so. I am not saying that the responsibility rests solely on the shoulders of the Minister of Labour but he as Minister of Labour has a responsibility in this regard. He should use his position as a member of the Cabinet to see that effect is given to the policy of increasing Bantu wages whenever possible.</p>

<p>I have emphasized this question of Bantu wages because I believe that unless we can create the necessary machinery to make it possible for an employer to adjust the wages when he wishes to do, so we are not going to get on top of the problem which faces us. Whether we like it or not there are not going to be sufficient Whites in South Africa in the foreseeable future to take care of our present industrial development and the future industrial development which we all envisage. It is no use trying to apply the general rate for the job principle until such time as we have closed this gap between Bantu earnings and those of other race groups. That represents the bottleneck that we are faced with. The hon. the Deputy Minister has said on many occasions that there cannot be an increase in Bantu wages without an increase in productivity. He has indicated that productivity could be improved by the introduction of incentive schemes. The report to which I have referred earlier on dealing with Bantu wages has this to say about incentive schemes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The company stated yesterday that it had discarded individual bonus incentives with their heavy clerical role and risks of personal dissensions and the inevitable return to a slow pace by the worker whose starting personal performances to earn a bonus could not be maintained for long. Instead it launched a policy of using work study to determine the minimum practical process where direct labour operations were concerned to control labour strength at a predetermined and acceptable level of performance.</block>

<p>The Minister has had experience&#x2014;I think the Department will be able to advise him on this&#x2014;of this that to talk about incentive bonus schemes is easy; to put them into operation is difficult and costly. It does appear to me that if we are going to increase the productivity of the Bantu worker so that he will be in a position to come up somewhere near the earnings of other race groups, we have to consider things other than incentive bonus schemes. The suggestion by the National Chemical Products Company, I think, illustrates that the difficulties are there and that the solutions are there if industry together with the Department of Labour are prepared to tackle this problem in a realistic way. It is no use talking about improvements in Bantu wages without at the same time thinking in terms of how to increase their overall production. A the same time we have to agree that because the Bantu earn Black and pay White they are at a continual disadvantage in respect of the rising costs. It is this basic factor that is causing so much trouble. The Minister <span class="col_7299-7300" refersTo="page_983"/>will appreciate that the subsidies that are paid in respect of the provision of sub-economic housing and transport are two factors which have to be offset against the earning Black and paying White. I do say this that unless we tackle this problem, and tackle it realistically, we are not going to get on top of our manpower shortage problem.</p>

<p>As far as the border industries are concerned I want the Minister to know that there is considerable dissatisfaction mainly due to the fact that there is no control whatsoever in connection with knitted goods. There is a measure of control in respect of clothing, but as far as knitted goods are concerned there is none whatsoever. This is causing considerable dislocation and can cause unemployment in the areas where wage determinations are being applied. I want the Minister to look into this matter because I believe it is one of considerable importance.</p>

<p>I have not dealt with the question of unemployment but as far as that is concerned we only have the problem of the Asiatics in Natal to meet. As far as I can understand, in the case of those other than Bantu, there is only 1 per cent unemployment in the Republic. That may be so but it can be that that 1 per cent can be made up of a considerable number of Asiatics in Natal. I should like to hear from the Minister what plans he has to meet this problem of unemployment in Natal. I am not going to dwell on it but I think the Minister should indicate what his plans are; what his Department is going to do to meet the position in view of the fact that the provincial boundaries operate against them. That does not mean that we are advocating the removal of provincial boundaries. I am mentioning it because it is a factor which is present and is the cause of unemployment as far as Asiatics are concerned.</p>

This is the Labour Vote; the removal of the boundaries does not fall under this Vote whatsoever. I told the Minister that because of these boundaries we have this problem of unemployment amongst Asiatics in Natal. The Minister should tell us what he is going to do as Minister of Labour. The Progressive Party may say &#x201C;abolish provincial boundaries&#x201D;, but they want to abolish practically everything that is designed to safeguard the position of this country. I am not concerned with that aspect. What I am concerned about is the real fact that there is unemployment amongst the Asiatics, particularly in Natal.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>If ever we need proof as to how well things are going with the workers in South Africa, we have it in the speech of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton). He devoted a large part of his speech to questions which he put to the hon. the Minister. He would have obtained a great deal of that information if he had read what the hon. the Minister has already said in the Other Place and if he had read the reports which are available.</p>

<p>I just want to say a few words about a few points which the hon. member made. Firstly, there is the old story of job reservation. In the first place, I think that the Opposition must be honest with the country and the workers of South Africa and tell us whether they want to abolish the colour bar or whether they want to retain it. They must tell us whether they are in favour of abolishing the colour bar, for example, on the mines. I think that the United Party must tell the country quite clearly what attitude they adopt in this connection. It is of no avail to advocate the abolition of the colour bar in certain respects and to want to retain it in other respects. One has to be consistent in one&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>I want to say to-day that the great advantage of the job reservation clause in the Industrial Conciliation Act is the psychological effect it has on the workers. The employers know that it is Government policy that Whites shall not be forced out of their labour circles unfairly. They know that the Government will make use of the provisions of this Act if that happens. If any legitimate complaints are made that Whites are being forced out of some industry or other, the Government can make use of the provisions of this section to protect the Whites. And so it has a braking effect upon the head-over-heels attempts of employers in many instances to force Whites out of certain categories of work.</p>

<p>The hon. member has once again made a plea for the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;. That is another hackneyed argument. It has already been pointed out that wages are not the same throughout the country. When a large number of non-Whites are employed in a certain industry, this results in a drop in wages. It has the effect whereby the Whites leave that industry. I want to take the example of the building industry in the Cape. When we consider the wages that are paid in the building industry, we find that the wages paid in the Free State and the Transvaal are far higher than the wages paid in the Cape because there is a very large percentage of Coloureds in the building industry in the Cape. Not only have the Coloureds in the Cape succeeded in forcing the Whites out of the building industry by working for lower wages but they are now moving into the other provinces. If the Government does not protect the Whites there, it will mean that the Coloureds will also gradually force the Whites out of that employment in the other provinces. Let me give another example. For example, in the clothing industry j on the Witwatersrand, where a large <span class="col_7301-7302" refersTo="page_984"/>number are still in the industry, the wages are far higher than in Cape Town, and the wages here are far higher than in Durban, for example, where Indians are employed in the industry. If we permit more and more non-Whites to enter certain industries it will mean that wages will drop and that the Whites will eventually be forced out of those industries. That is why the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; offers no protection to the White workers in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member did not again go so far as to do what he has done in previous years, and that is to say that we should give some recognition to Bantu trade unions. The United Party held this view in the past but as far as I can make out the hon. member did not make a plea in this regard although he did ask us to tell him what our policy in this connection was. I just want to point out that our policy was reaffirmed by the I.L.O. recently as far as the question of Bantu trade unions in South Africa is concerned. A commission appointed by the I.L.O. to inquire into the question of Bantu trade unions reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indeed one of the most serious obstacles of effective bargaining in Africa lies in the limitations which are often discernible among trade union leaders. As already indicated this arises partly from the inability of many trade unions to appoint persons of the highest calibre. Other factors are deficiency in general education and lack of understanding of economic principles and practices as well as inexperience in the art of collective bargaining. Political activity would seem in many African countries to have affected the role of trade unions in collective bargaining.</block>

<p>In other words, the fact that we say that the Bantu in South Africa are not yet sufficiently mature to control their own trade unions and to manage them and that they will be exploited in those trade unions has been reaffirmed by a commission of the I.L.O.</p>

<p>I want to say something in connection with Bantu wages. There are a few interesting facts which have come to light over the past while. It is a fact that Bantu wages in South Africa have been increased.</p>

<p>According to the report of the Bureau of Statistics, the number of Bantu workers in the manufacturing and construction industry increased by 300 during the period 1959 to 1961 while their wage account increased by R16,000,000, or 14 per cent. Mr. Harry Oppenheimer made a speech two days ago. In that speech he said that we should do everything in our power to close the gap between the wages paid to Whites and those paid to non-Whites. And that is actually what is happening in South Africa. We must be grateful to the Native Labour (Settlement of Disputes) Board which is doing so much in the interests of the Bantu workers. They have succeeded in bringing about an industrial peace amongst the Bantu workers hitherto unknown in this country. I want to quote the figures to which Mr. Oppenheimer referred in his speech to the Anglo American Corporation. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the contrary, in the five years since 1959, the average wage of White workers in industry rose by 3.7 per cent per year and that of non-White workers by 5.3 per cent per year. In 1963 the increases were 5.3 per cent in the case of Whites and 6.6 per cent in the case of non-Whites.</block>

As far as I remember the extract he read from Mr. Oppenheimer&#x2019;s address to Anglo American showed an increase in wage rates and correctly so. But if I remember correctly the heading of that article was &#x201C;African Wages Still too Low&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But the hon. member did not point out that Mr. Oppenheimer&#x2019;s main contention was that there should be a general up-grading in wage rates of African workers so that the whole country could in fact benefit from the increased purchasing power and from the general activity which would evolve as a result.</p>

<p>The other thing the hon. member mentioned was the I.L.O. report. I do not happen to have read that particular report. But I am quite certain that the complaint against African trade unionists was in fact correct. That is something all of us have always known&#x2014;namely that there is a lot of inefficiency among African trade union leaders. But surely the I.L.O. did not go on to suggest that because of this it did not recommend African trade unions be given recognition or rather that African workers should not be allowed the benefits of collective bargaining? I challenge the hon. member to say that in fact that was the conclusion of the I.L.O.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member gave us the impression that the I.L.O. was not in favour of collective bargaining for African workers and that is absolutely incorrect. The real thing is that African trade union leaders must be trained to take on proper trade union <span class="col_7303-7304" refersTo="page_985"/>responsibilities, and certainly that is not what this Government is doing. It is doing its best to strangle the African Trade Union movement and it is doing it in various ways, apart from the fact that it comes down heavily on employers who use African trade unions for collective bargaining machinery instead of the management committees that are set up, and, secondly, a vast number of African trade union leaders who are able leaders have in fact found themselves under a political ban. That is what has happened. Many African trade union leaders have been taken either under the 90-day detention law or they have been banned or restricted under the anticommunist laws. So that where there is a chance of African trade unionists building up their movement, they find themselves immediately classified as political persons. That is one reason why the African trade union movement has done so poorly. I will leave the hon. member alone for a moment&#x2014;I will be coming back to him&#x2014;but I want to come to the speech of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) in which I was also very interested.

<p>I said under the control of the Industrial Conciliation Act. He knows that the Industrial Conciliation Act itself has strenuous control over the management and running of trade unions and that is the control I want exercised over African workers. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana as an old trade unionist knows perfectly well that there is no substitute for normal collective bargaining machinery, whether they be little management committees set up together with the Government&#x2014;there is just no alternative, satisfactory alternative for normal collective bargaining machinery, with the employer on the one side and properly organized employee organizations on the other side. He knows it. The whole history of trade unionism, of wage rates throughout the world has proved that this is the most effective machinery, and it is because of this, because the Government does not recognize that in regard to the African workers, that the wage rates for Africans remain scandalously low. I am not interested in percentage increases, because the wages were too low to start off with, and even if there should be a 50 per cent increase or a 100 per cent increase, ultimately they are still too low. If it is R1 per week going up to R2 per week, it is still not sufficient, and remains a bare minimum and in any way there is no general R2 wage. Indeed a survey conducted just recently by the Johannesburg non-European Affairs Department of the Municipality shows that of Bantu in weekly-paid jobs 90.82 per cent received less than R40 per month and 38.74 per cent less than R30 per month. This is after all these magnificent increases which the hon. member was so proud of and which the hon. Minister tells us about. There is no substitute for collective bargaining machinery; and if you add to that the tremendous new disability that African workers suffer from under the Bantu Laws Amendment Act that was passed this year, where under they cannot move freely around the place, and under which they have to take the job offered to them at the aid centres, if they do not want to face endorsement out, the position is still much worse. And when they are endorsed out to the Native reserves, they are bottled up there in reserves which do not even provide a subsistence income. If they do not stay with the employer who employs them, if they look for a better job, they run the risk of being endorsed out of the urban areas and they have not got a snowball&#x2019;s chance against the unscrupulous employer. They are tied to the employer by virtue of the fact that they do not have the right which exists for White workers and Coloured workers, and Indian workers (though in their case only in the province where they live), to seek better employment. Therefore the Department has a very much greater responsibility now in respect of African workers to see that the wage boards lay down proper <span class="col_7305-7306" refersTo="page_986"/>rates of wages, though I do not think for a moment that they do the work as efficiently as proper collective bargaining machinery could do, or the little management committees which are a poor substitute for proper trade unionism&#x2014;the Department has a far greater responsibility now, because I feel that with this tied labour situation under the Bantu Laws Amendment Act there is going to be no increase in wages, as a general rule, as far as the African workers are concerned. Despite boom conditions, despite the shortage of workers, Africans are restricted both horizontally from moving from one area to the next to look for a job and vertically from going from lower paid jobs to higher paid jobs by virtue of job reservation on the one hand, but most important by virtue of the fact that they are barred under industrial conciliation machinery from entering the skilled trades where there are closed shop agreements. These are the real factors that inhibit African productivity in South Africa, and until everybody in this House including the Official Opposition, has the honesty to admit this, we are not going to get anywhere with these arguments, with what I call paying lip-service to the ideal of better wage rates for the non-Whites in this country, more particularly for the Africans.</p>

<p>On the Indian question of course, I am in favour of the removal of the provincial barriers. How can anyone sit here quietly and say that the Indians are citizens of South Africa and on the other say that they may not move from one province to the other? It is a pious, unreal and dishonest political attitude to say that the Indians born in this country are citizens. If they are citizens they must have the rights of citizens. These are basic rights of citizenship. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I am sorry that I do not have the time to reply to the previous speaker.</p>

<p>I want to put a matter to the hon. the Minister and to make a plea for the better control of our labour, particularly for a stricter control over the registration of unemployed persons and for more positive efforts to mobilize White and particularly, Coloured labour. I consider it to be an important duty of the Department, particularly here in the Western Cape, to mobilize every available non-Bantu worker for the labour market. We fully realize that we will be largely dependent upon adequate alternate labour in the process of the systematic replacement of Bantu labour and in this process Coloured labour plays an important role. We also realize that a large mass of Coloured labourers are not ready for work. Thousands of them are unemployed on the labour markets to-day and the registration figures for unemployed Coloureds certainly do not reflect the true position at present. How can we ever prepare the Coloureds for work if the Department cannot lay its hand on the unemployed? How can we achieve this end unless we know the scope of the problem with which we are faced? The present system of the registration of unemployed persons, particularly the Coloureds, is, I think inadequate. In the Western Province we only have registration bureaux in Cape Town, Worcester and Paarl. There is also an official who makes periodic visits to Somerset West, Stellenbosch and the Strand. People find it difficult to make adequate use of these few offices and they find it even more difficult to maintain contact with these bureaux. An unemployed Coloured from Kraaifontein or from Bellville South or from Elsies River simply does not take the trouble or incur the expense of coming to Cape Town to register, let alone maintaining contact with the offices. The large mass of Coloureds who are unemployed are not enthusiastic workseekers. They are not at all enthusiastic in presenting themselves for registration. According to an estimate by the Bureau for Economic Investigation of the University of Stellenbosch there are at present about 480,000 Coloureds in the Cape Peninsula alone. During the first five months of this year, 10,159 adult Coloureds over the age of 14 years registered as unemployed persons at the four aforementioned bureaux. This figure is made up as follows. At Cape Town, 8,219; at Worcester 627, that is to say, an average of 125 per month; at Paarl, 1,238, that is to say, an average of 310 for the first four months; at Somerset West, Stellenbosch and the Strand together, 75, or an average of 15 per month. If there is an average of only 15 unemployed Coloured people per month in this area of Somerset West, the Strand and Stellenbosch, I shall eat my hat! During the first quarter, 2,238 juveniles between the ages of 15 and 19 years and altogether 3,380 unemployed women registered at these same offices. But these figures to do give us the full story in connection with unemployed Coloureds. A fact that is apparent from the following figures is the chronic workshyness of many of these Coloureds. Of the 10,000 adult men, only 5,393, slightly more than half, could be placed in service; of the juveniles, fewer than one-third, and of the women, far less than one third, could be placed in service. One reason for this low percentage of employment is attributed by the Department to the workshyness of numbers of these people. Many of them simply do not want to accept the responsibility and regular commitments in this regard. They only want the odd jobs which enable them to earn enough to buy wine but which is not enough to enable them to buy food. That is why I want to make a plea for three things to-day. Firstly, that the registration of unemployed persons should be made compulsory and that neglect to register should be regarded as an offence and be punishable. No new legislation is necessary in this regard. All that we need do is to put an existing law, which was passed by the United Party, into operation. I am referring here to Act No. 34 of 1945 which deals with the registration of unemployed persons. Section 4 (1) of that Act makes it compulsory for every unemployed person to register within seven days, if he is unemployed for longer than a week, and if he changed his address, to notify that <span class="col_7307-7308" refersTo="page_987"/>change of address within seven days and to remain in contact with the bureau for the full period during which he remains unemployed. What is more, if he then works for longer than a week, he must present himself at the office and return the registration card. If he neglects to comply with the requirements of registration he will be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of R20. What is more, the advantage of this Act is that the hon. the Minister can apply it to any area and to any category of workers within that area.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>When business was interrupted I was pointing out that we have the legislation available to-day to compel unemployed persons to register so that we can put our hand on the large number of Coloureds who are idle and who ought to be working. But then the hon. the Minister must also give serious attention to increasing the number of labour bureaux so that they will also be far more accessible to these people and so that it will be easier for unemployed persons to remain in close contact with those offices. In my opinion we should have a bureau of this nature at every place. There should be bureaux at central places in the Peninsula. The Department must provide that service itself at the larger centres where the density of population justifies the setting up of such bureaus but at other places the local authorities can act as agents for the Department just as they do in the case of Bantu Administration. This is the only practical way in which to control this labour problem properly. Bantu labour is controlled far more effectively to-day than that of the Whites and the Coloureds. Why should the Bantu in the Western Cape be given preference over the Whites and the Coloureds on the labour market today simply because his labour is better controlled and, therefore, more readily available? I think that the time has come for us to ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration, particularly as regards the registration of Coloured work-seekers and their employment, to the desirability of transferring this matter to the Department of Coloured Affairs, particularly as I want to ask in the third place that workshyness amongst the Coloureds should be combated positively. The State ought to consider it its duty not only to provide these people with information in connection with their employment but also to place them in productive employment and encourage them to work. The time has come when in the interests of this large number of unemployed Coloureds and their families, in the interests of the upliftment of the Coloured population as a group, in the interests of the economic development of the Western Cape where these people live and in the interests of South Africa as a whole, drastic steps should be taken to combat this workshyness amongst the Coloureds. One finds very few people today who are opposed to the fact that the State is doing so much to uplift the Coloureds as a population group but one finds that a number of people object to the fact that this upliftment work is done while there is such a large number of good-for-nothings who are continually undermining and frustrating all these efforts at upliftment, people who do little else but drink and keep the birthrate of their race group abnormally high.

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat will forgive me if I do not immediately react to what he has said.</p>

<p>I want to start with the point made by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) where he stated, I think, that there is no problem to-day as far as the White workers of South Africa is concerned, because we are living in a time of full employment where you virtually have an employees&#x2019; market. I think it is agreed that in an expanding economy at the rate of approximately 6 per cent per annum in the industrial sector, where I think it is acknowledged that there is a shortage of something like 25,000 to 30,000 White artisans, if the present rate of expansion is to continue during the next three or four years certain questions arise which, I think, should be put before the Minister. But before I do so I want to acknowledge that as far as the workers&#x2019; interests are concerned, we probably have one of the finest Departments of Labour as is evident from the report of the Department and the administration of the various Acts. I do not want to debate that aspect, however. What I want to debate with the hon. Minister is the other responsibility that I see the hon. Minister has apart from the normal administration of existing Acts. It is quite clear that the expansion of our country&#x2019;s productive capacity is dependent entirely not only on investment capital, but its future is dependent entirely on the productive capacity of our available manpower resources. So the question I want to put to the hon. Minister as far as his policy is concerned, because in my view he has a specific responsibility in this regard in view of the present rate of development of our country and if that is not to be slowed down and brought to a stage of stagnation, whether he is able in this economic explosion of ours to place before this House and the country his positive thinking and policy as to how he proposes to meet this manpower shortage in the future. I studied the report very carefully, and what is more I also studied the statements of the hon. the Minister made in the past months, but I could find not a single example or a single statement, either made by the Minister or his Deputy, placing before the country any consideration as to how to meet the manpower shortage and how to face up to this problem, except one suggestion and that was a suggestion made by the hon. Deputy Minister of Labour at a party meeting that the only choice if we want to meet <span class="col_7309-7310" refersTo="page_988"/>this problem, the only choice that lies before the Minister is immigration and that that is the reason why we are getting 2,500 immigrants a month. He saw no other method of meeting the manpower shortage. The question arises whether there is any other alternative. I think there are alternatives. I do not think it rests entirely on the immigration aspect in order to meet the needs of industry and the needs of our expanding economy in the future. That brings me to this point whether the Minister has got a policy in this regard. In this stage of our economic expansion I see his functions as more than those of merely an administrator of existing statutes as far as the Department of Labour is concerned. I think the Minister should act as the liaison between the other aspects of our social and educational life and his Department so as to make available at a faster pace skilled manpower for our industrial needs. I repeat that I have been unable to find a single example of where the Minister or his Deputy have come forward with any positive thinking in that regard.</p>

<p>How can the Minister play a part in meeting this shortage? Has the Minister a policy for making skilled manpower more easily available to industry? I do not think he has. I am going to ask the Minister whether it is not possible to have a review of our Apprenticeship Act. As the Minister knows, many apprentices have a very low educational qualification and because of that the period that is finally agreed upon by the National Apprenticeship Board or the local committee is a fairly lengthy one. Has the Minister ever consulted with the Minister of Education, with a view to laying down higher standards of education for men who wish to become skilled artisans in order that the actual period of apprenticeship can be shortened? Hon. members here asked what protection is afforded to the White workers, and the only protection they can see is job reservation. Is that really the correct way of protecting the White man&#x2019;s skill in industry? The Minister&#x2019;s colleague is presently raising the level of Bantu education and he is very proud of the fact that there are so many Bantu children in Stds. VI to VIII. If you allow the White apprentices to have such a low standard of education, the results are self-evident, to my mind, because I do not believe that any legislative barriers will stop the natural advance of the Bantu people. There is only one way in which to protect the White workers, and that is to raise the educational level and the level of skill of the White workers.</p>

<p>When I say that the Minister has not announced any policy in regard to how to meet this shortage of skilled manpower, I want to say that with a slight reservation, because the Minister opened a factory on the Rand, a heavy machinery factory, at Knights last year and he made a speech which was reported in the <i>Star.</i> When dealing with the shortage of skilled labour, the Minister had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He emphasized that means had to be found to avoid the slowing down of our industrial expansion because of the shortage of skilled workers &#x2026; Senator Trollip said that South Africa&#x2019;s labour problem was that the White population which traditionally provided the skilled manpower was increasing too slowly. On the other hand, there was rapid growth amongst the non-Whites, and efforts to raise their standards of living were hampered by the large number of unskilled and semi-skilled workers who entered the labour market &#x2026; It would take several years before their contribution to the manpower problem could be increased. Consequently, South Africa had to make use of the maximum number of skilled immigrants together with its own manpower. [Time limit.]</block>

<p>I think that one of the most noticeable characteristics of this debate up to the present has been the absence of the usual attacks by the Opposition on job reservation. Every year in this House we have had to endure the attacks of the Opposition on job reservation and their accompanying description of all the misery and trouble which this will apparently cause South Africa. I think now that after eight years&#x2019; experience of job reservation not even the Opposition can continue with that agitation because it has become apparent now after eight years that we have an industrial peace in this country of which any country can be proud. We have full employment and better opportunities for employment for Coloureds than ever before. All the things which the Opposition predicted would happen as a result of job reservation have not happened.</p>

<p>I am particularly pleased that we no longer hear the senseless accusation made by the Opposition in connection with job reservation to the effect that job reservation affects the non-Whites adversely. At the start of this Session I said in this House that the Opposition had not yet mentioned one proven case for us in which any non-White had been dismissed from his work as a result of job reservation. I asked them to mention any such cases for us. But apart from this, I also asked the Coloured Council, when I recently had the honour of addressing them, to lodge complaints if it appeared that there were any Coloureds who were being adversely affected as a result of job reservation The Council could not mention a single case in this regard. I told them moreover, if they knew of any such cases, to inform the Department of these cases. A few days later one of the councillors, Mr. Arendse wrote a letter to the <i>Cape Argus</i> in which he made an appeal to Coloured artisans and others to lodge complaints if they felt that they were being adversely affected as a result of the application <span class="col_7311-7312" refersTo="page_989"/>of job reservation. I asked the Department to keep a careful record of such complaints and up to the present we have not received one single complaint. So I want to express the hope that we will hear no more of these accusations against job reservation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Exemption is given regularly in any industry when circumstances justify its being given. This proves just how reasonably and sympathetically these measures are applied. Because they are applied in this way we do not experience the disadvantages which the Opposition have always mentioned. [Interjection.] I only have ten minutes in which to speak and I cannot reply to interjections. I want to express the hope that because of the absence of any legitimate complaints the Opposition will now cease to make job reservation out to be inhuman without proving their contention. That is simply an attempt to blacken the image of South Africa overseas. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>I want to discuss the plea made by the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) in connection with the employment of Coloureds in the Western Cape. He based his argument on the unemployment of Coloureds, or their workshyness, and he said that we should transfer the question of the employment of Coloureds to local authorities or to the Department of Coloured Affairs. These are matters to which we can give careful consideration. We are giving serious attention to this aspect of the matter together with our colleagues in Coloured Affairs and in other Departments. I can tell the hon. member that we have drawn up a proposal which we have submitted to the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, to the effect that the Department of Labour is prepared to increase its employment services further by means of the addition of a special section which will concentrate upon the employment of Coloureds. The idea is to establish something like a director of Coloured employment with officials, even Coloured officials, who can travel through the province tracing work-seekers. It is true that there is a percentage of Coloureds who are actually allergic to work; they are the workshy Coloureds. We shall try to contact them by this means and to give them work in this way. The question of whether something further should be done in the form of rehabilitation centres is a matter which can be considered by Coloured Affairs. Perhaps the hon. member will raise this matter under the Vote of that Minister. As far as the Department of Labour is concerned, the hon. member can rest assured that we are prepared to expand our employment machinery if our colleague in the Department of Coloured Affairs will assist us. The transfer of this work to local authorities creates a number of problems. We have considered it but do not find it feasible. Local authorities will have to expand their machinery, which will have to be subsidized by the State, to such an extent, that the cost will be prohibitive. The problem is whether the administration of this work will be as satisfactory as we want it to be. We think that this suggestion of the Department of Labour in connection with the expansion of our own services will enable us to overcome this problem.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the question of manpower and apprentices. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) quoted me as saying that the only way to strengthen our manpower is by immigration. I do not know what he was quoting from. In any case, I cannot imagine that I could ever have made such a stupid statement. The point of view of the Government has always been that we must strengthen our manpower, firstly, by making the best use of our own labour forces. That is fundamental to our whole approach to this matter. We must give our own people every opportunity to learn. That is our biggest source of manpower. Our second source is our immigrants and in this sphere the Government has achieved more success than any former Government has achieved. Over the past year we have had a net gain of 30,000 immigrants thanks to the energetic efforts of the hon. the Minister of Immigration. This figure exceeds the figure for 1947 by 10,000 and the 1947 figure was the highest figure achieved during the period of office of the United Party. These therefore are the two important means of strengthening our manpower. In the few minutes left to me I want to confine myself to the question of apprentices because this is one of the most important means of strengthening our manpower. The amendment of the Apprenticeship Act and the improvement of the training conditions has already had a good effect in strengthening our manpower. In this connection I may say that there are already five industries which have agreed to improve the training conditions of their apprentices. These industries are the motor industry, the sugar industry, the explosives industry, the metal industry and the footwear industry. There are also 15 other industries which are considering improved training conditions and we hope to make an announcement in this regard shortly. The success of these improved conditions is also apparent from the apprenticeship enrolments. In 1962, 6,306 were enrolled and in 1963, 6,611 were enrolled. I want to mention the fact here that the block training system which we advocated has found particular favour with industries. This is a system in terms of which they train their apprentices for four full months. It is a system which is being applied by more and more industries with great success and I want to repeat my request that industries apply this scheme on an even larger scale.</p>

<p><span class="col_7313-7314" refersTo="page_990"/>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) asked me about the posts of inspectors. In this connection I can say that the Department of Labour has asked the Public Service Commission to approve of the creation of 20 posts for inspectors. The Commission is at present working out the salary scales for those posts.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>It is not clear to me whether the hon. the Deputy Minister is now trying to take over the whole Department and usurp the Minister&#x2019;s position. He objected to my statement when I quoted that he had said that the only solution for South Africa&#x2019;s shortage of skilled manpower was immigration, but let me remind the Deputy Minister that he gave a statement to Sapa on a speech that he delivered in the Western Transvaal to the Rapportryersklub, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have no choice other than immigration, and that is why we are at present receiving 2,500 immigrants a month.</block>

<p>In that speech he pointed out that there was presently a shortage of 24,000 skilled artisans. The business men of South Africa are also objecting to the type of speech just made by the Deputy Minister, just as we do. I want to remind him what they had to say about him in one of the leading commercial publications in the country&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Business men sick of Mr. Viljoen&#x2019;s reckless mud-slinging: Do business men weep tears of bliss or anger? This question is asked in a scathing editorial attack on the remarks made by the Deputy Minister of Labour, Mr. Marais Viljoen, in which he accused the business community of encouraging South Africa&#x2019;s economic growth in order to destroy the Government.</block>

<p>This is the kind of irresponsible approach we have from this Deputy Minister. He can never rise above the political level. I want to tell him that as long as he keeps on this road he has not a hope of taking the place of the Minister of Labour. He must appear as a Minister and not as a party-political hack every time he speaks. [Interjections.] Here we try to approach the labour problems of the country in a responsible manner, and you get this typical type of platteland political speech. The Deputy Minister is not capable of taking an objective approach to the problems of the country.</p>

<p>Now I want to continue where I left off. I quoted from an extract of the speech that the Minister made. The point I want to make is this. What is the implication of his words? The implication is clear, that the Minister recognizes that it is inevitable, if we are to keep up the present rate of economic expansion in South Africa, that Native, Coloured and Indian labour will have to be used and will have to be taught skill in industry. At this very factory at Knights which the Minister opened and which I have also visited he must have seen for himself Natives operating highly technical machines. You can hardly call them unskilled labour, and I think it must have impressed the Minister. Now what I want to ask the Minister is this. With all this talk of job reservation, let me tell the House the facts of job reservation. The Deputy Minister knows that it is hardly being applied. He attacked my leader here for sabotaging South Africa for saying that what keeps foreign investors away from South Africa is when they read about job reservation. But what assurances has the Deputy Minister himself given to industrialists? What he told one of them was this: &#x201C;Look, this is on our Statute Book, but you must understand that we have to satisfy our party supporters. We have to placate the feelings of the unskilled White workers who largely support our party, and this is really a political gag because we realize that if it has to be applied South Africa will be brought to economic ruin, and we know that it is impracticable to apply it under these conditions, but as far as the Government is concerned it is a political necessity.&#x201D; That is the type of approach you have. It is a political bluff. I think the Minister will agree that what I am saying is true. Yet he makes this accusation across the floor of the House against us when he knows that to satisfy the potential investors he has to take this line which I have just quoted. The Minister faced the issue with a degree of honesty. He recognized that immigration can only partly fulfil the need and that unless we have a crash programme of training artisans to give greater skills to the White population, if the present rate of industrial expansion continues, it is inevitable that non-Whites will have to be taught a measure of skill. Now I want to ask the Minister: Is that his policy? Is that the policy which the Government will support? You cannot have it both ways. Either you put a stop to the economic growth or else you want to see it continue. But it must be obvious even to hon. members opposite that the more we expand, the more skills are given to the non-Whites, the greater is their income level and that of the White worker and the greater becomes the internal market and the greater becomes the industrial development. To stop this economic expansion, as the Minister himself said on one occasion, can only be done by restricting productive capacity. Economic expansion does not depend on the amount of capital you have, but it is based entirely on productive capacity, the production per man hour, and that is so whether it is in a capitalist society or in a communist society. But the Minister recognizes this otherwise he would never have made this statement before industrialists. Now I want to ask the Minister, apart from the obvious necessity of giving a degree of skill at the quickest possible pace to the White workers, has he any plans in regard to giving skills to the non-Whites? That is what the industrialists want to know. The Minister may think that he can make a little political capital out of this by asking what the attitude of the <span class="col_7315-7316" refersTo="page_991"/>trade union is. The trade unions are against giving skills to the non-Whites, according to him, but I want to ask whether there is a tittle of evidence where a trade union is against giving skills to the non-Whites. Because the trade unions recognize that if you go on the principle of the rate for the job, where a White skilled artisan is paid the same rate as a non-White skilled artisan, the White man need not fear for his job. I see the Minister of Railways is very interested. He is applying this policy on the Railways. He has admitted in this House that in order to keep the wheels rolling he has had to use non-White labour in semi-skilled jobs. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Of course one cannot take much notice of the previous speaker because he has just spoken a lot of nonsense. He wanted to intimate that foreign investors were not investing capital in this country as the result of work reservation. If we look at the pamphlet issued by the United Party in 1958 I just want to show what nonsense they spoke and that we need not take much notice of them. In this pamphlet they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">White workers, what will happen to you if the Nationalists come into power again? White workers, what will happen to your families?</block>

<p>Because they said there would be unemployment. Where is that unemployment to-day? Those same people who in 1958 predicted that there would be unemployment have now been crying ever since this morning that there is a shortage of manpower. How is one to understand that? Where is the logic? The trouble is that the United Party has never looked after the interests of the White workers. All day we have just heard pleas for increased wages for the Bantu, and not a single word has been said about the White workers. Only when an election is in the offing do they know the White workers, and then this type of pamphlet is issued, when they try to use the White workers as a political football, but the workers already know them.</p>

<p>What is the barometer which shows whether there is industrial development in a country? The barometer with which one can measure it is labour and industrial peace. These Jeremiahs predicted unemployment in 1958, but let us look at the position in 1962. In 1962 the unemployment figure was 29,160, or 1.98 per cent. It is generally recognized that if the unemployment figure is lower than 2 per cent of the labour force, there is full employment. At the end of December 1963 there were 15,185 registered unemployed, of which the Whites numbered 7,927 or .8 per cent. I say there is industrial peace. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana was a little concerned about the unemployment figures for Coloureds and Asiatics. For December 1963 the figure was 7,258 or 1.8 per cent, but that was eight months ago, and since then unemployment has decreased, and therefore the problem which the hon. member saw is disappearing. Further, in 1962 there were 56 strikes, in which two Whites and 2,155 non-Whites were concerned. Is that not proof of labour peace? The United Party should rather leave aside this cheap propaganda.</p>

<p>There are a few matters I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister of Labour in connection with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. If a worker is involved in an accident, his damages are fixed at 75 per cent of his normal earnings, or an amount not exceeding R120. In other words, an artisan who earns about R200 a month, if he is involved in an accident, will receive an allowance of approximately R90, with the result that there is about 60 per cent loss of earnings. A further aspect is that when a worker is injured he forfeits his wages for the first three days. I think that is something which should be stopped, particularly where we have now accepted in the Shops and Offices Act that someone who becomes ill receives his full pay. Therefore I want to plead that under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act there should not be a loss of wages.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further case. It will be found that if a person is injured in his work, he is compensated according to the wages he earns. If an apprentice should, for example, be involved in an accident and he earns R4 or R5 a week, then in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act he is entitled to about R2 to R3 a week. The same man qualifies as an artisan and receives a setback as the result of an accident. His normal wages are now perhaps R50 per week, but he is compensated on the old scale of R2 per week. In other words, such a person loses R48 of his normal wages. His loss in wages is therefore approximately 97 per cent.</p>

<p>There is a further case I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister, and that is where a person becomes permanently unfit for work, when he is entitled to a maximum of R90 per month. Here again I believe that the time has perhaps arrived for us to review this Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. Again I want to give the example of the apprentice who earns R5 a week and who is involved in an accident and then receives R3.75 per week as compensation. That person now qualifies as an artisan and later he becomes permanently disabled as the result of that previous accident. In that case he is again paid on the basis of the wage he earned at the time. I feel that these are a few defects in the Act and I want to ask the Minister of Labour to eliminate them. In the first place, one is very grateful for the fact that such an Act exists under which the worker is protected if he is involved in an accident while working, but I think it is also the employer&#x2019;s duty, in order to confer greater benefits, to make a larger contribution to the fund. Apart from the fact that there are certain employers who give their employees better benefits than provided for in the Act, I still think it is time for us to review this Act.</p>

<p>If the hon. member looks at his Hansard he will find that he said that he was referring to a pamphlet of 1948. I suggest that he should also look at some of the pamphlets issued by the present Minister of Transport and other members on his side, when they wanted to abolish trade unions entirely and do away with collective bargaining; when they wanted to have State-controlled industry and State-controlled labour. Sir, the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark must have very serious difficulty in finding things to talk about if he has to quote from a 1948 pamphlet when dealing with a debate in 1964. The hon. member did try at one stage to come back to the present when he quoted statistics of unemployment. But why does he, as the representative of a workers&#x2019; constituency, not tell the House and South Africa that it was his Government which changed the basis of unemployment legislation in order to limit the period during which a person can remain unemployed. The law now provides that if a person is unemployed for 26 weeks he ceases to be unemployed officially. Why does that member not stand up and plead for those people, as we on this side of the House plead for them, instead of saying that because they are no longer statistics on a piece of paper they no longer exist? The fact that workers are unemployed is immaterial to this Government as long as they do not appear as numbers on a piece of paper, as statistics, which may reflect discredit upon the Government. The group of workers who are most affected by this are a group of people for whom we on this side have pleaded year after year since this Government changed the procedure with regard to unemployment insurance benefits, and that is the group over 45 years of age who find it difficult to find employment. We have challenged the Minister year after year to tell the House what he is doing for that group, and year after year we get a deathly silence in reply. Because they can only be unemployed for 26 weeks they cease to be an embarrassing statistic and so they can be written off the conscience of this Government and its members.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the very vital statement made by the hon. the Deputy Minister this afternoon that job reservation has not harmed one single worker in South Africa. Am I quoting him correctly?</p>

<p>In other words, job reservation has not harmed a single worker in South Africa. Sir, I want to place on record clearly and unequivocally exactly what the implications of that statement are. Either the implication is that job reservation was never necessary or it is a gigantic bluff to mislead the White electorate of South Africa. If it was ever necessary&#x2014;and applied&#x2014;then somebody must have been harmed. You cannot apply the test of humanity to the legislative fact that this Government debars certain races from certain jobs and then grants exemption. Either that legislation was not necessary, since we have been told that job reservation is to protect the White worker, or if nobody has been harmed then no protection has been given by this legislation. If anybody was protected then somebody would have been harmed in the process. Since they have not then there was no threat to the White worker in the first place and therefore the legislation was unnecessary. If it was unnecessary then this Government has perpetrated a fantastic hoax on the White workers of South Africa by building up in their minds the fear that they may lose their jobs to non-Whites and promising them a so-called security through job reservation when in fact they knew in their own hearts that it was not necessary and was not needed. Otherwise there is a second alternative, and I suggest that this is the true alternative. That is that the Government is granting exemptions because i recognizes that unless it does so the industry of South Africa will grind to a standstill, and every industry that stops costs the White man his job as much as it costs the Black man his job. For every Black man who loses his job a White man loses his job too. This Government recognizes what we have said and what we have continued to say since 1957, and that is that you cannot apply job reservation to a modern industrial country like South Africa without harming and endangering the whole industrial future of this country. The fact is that this Government has had to grant exemptions in every case and have thus proved by their deeds that what we have always said is right. The time has now come for the Minister of Labour to stand up here and to say, &#x201C;I am withdrawing all job reservation because I have found that it is not necessary, and where it is necessary I have granted exemptions in order to keep industry going.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Sir, there we have yelps from members opposite who are afraid to face the voters in an election with the truth, but who know that what I say is right. They know that job reservation is merely a political gag which they are using to make people believe that they are protecting them. The Minister, however, has had to grant exemptions or, alternatively, see industry grind to a standstill. Sir, thank goodness he is granting exemptions. I want to quote one example and I want to ask the hon. the Minister when he replies to deal with this matter. I refer to the reservation of the job of barman in Durban and Pietermaritzburg. This is the most ridiculous of all job reservations. In Maritzburg there is not one single unemployed barman, and in Durban there were five registered barmen, all of whom lost their employment as barmen. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us now that he is going to grant permanent exemption to this particular occupation <span class="col_7319-7320" refersTo="page_993"/>because unless he does so he will be repudiating the Deputy Minister behind him who says that nobody has been harmed through job reservation. People are living under a sword of Damocles and this Minister owes a duty to the country to say clearly and unequivocally that he is not going to apply this legislation to the detriment of industrial progress. I hope the Minister will take advantage of this debate to make that statement so that people can proceed with development knowing that their labour force is not to be controlled by the Department of Labour and that every time they want an employee, if he is not a White man, they must go along, in the clothing industry, for instance, and apply to the Department of Labour. Every time a man comes to the door and says, &#x201C;I want work&#x201D; they must go to an official and say, &#x201C;May I employ this person?&#x201D; [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to make a positive plea to-day for a more determined and forward movement as far as job reservation in South Africa is concerned, more particularly in the iron and steel factories in South Africa. Before I make my plea I just want to reply briefly to the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) who very clearly alleged that if there was one thing which deterred overseas investors from coming to South Africa and to invest their money in industries here, it was job reservation. I want to tell him that the days are past that it is necessary for South Africa to approach any overseas investor hat in hand and to beg him to invest his money in South Africa. If there are investors in any part of the world who refuse to come to South Africa because of job reservation I trust they will stay away forever because South Africa does not want them and does not need them. But then I wish to add this, and I think this is a deadly answer, to the hon. member for Turffontein: South Africa is a member of the International Bank and what does the chairman of that institution say? I am not saying this, but this statement comes from probably the highest authority in the world. He says that from the point of view of investors South Africa is &#x201C;the best of the lot&#x201D;. Well, if you have any brains and you know that two and two make four that should be a clear indication that South Africa, with its job reservation and everything, remains the best country of these 64 countries as far as investment is concerned.</p>

<p>I just want to tell him why I wish to plead to-day for further positive steps to reserve certain jobs. Job reservation has been 100 per cent successful in respect of one industry in South Africa from the day the Act was placed on the Statute Book. Nobody can meddle with it and that job reservation stands as firm as granite to-day. I refer to Act No. 25 of 1926, the so-called Colour Bar Act in respect of the mines. It stands so firmly that if you ask the Opposition, in spite of all their pleas in this House, whether they want that job reservation to be abolished, they immediately take fright and act like a little puppy who curls up at the feet of his master. The reason why I ask that positive forward steps be taken in respect of job reservation is the following: Those industries to which I referred a moment ago and a series of others received a great measure of protection from South Africa and made tremendous progress. Mr. Chairman, the Opposition says one thing and does another. Although the United Party is slightly hesitant to attack job reservation to-day they know a struggle is being waged in industries in South Africa because Harry Oppenheimer, who is at the head of the biggest industries in South Africa, has a stranglehold on a great many of them; he exercises force on them and avails himself of every opportunity to harness them to agitate against job reservation. Sir, I am saying to you and I am saying to the hon. the Minister that we could get any number of workers from Europe and England if we knew that those White workers would not have to work cheek by jowl with the Black man in this country. Not one of them would come if he knew that he would have to work in those circumstances. There is room for thousands and those thousands will come. But why do they not come? Because Oppenheimer&#x2019;s influence is felt in those industries and he practically says to them: &#x201C;Do everything you can but prevent White workers from taking the jobs in this country.&#x201D; Their attitude is this: Do everything you can and impress upon the Government that there is a terrific manpower shortage. I say without any fear of contradiction that that is the biggest nonsense under the sun; there is no such thing. It is true that there is continual reference to a so-called shortage. If the industries cannot manage with the labour force available in this country they must slow down. It is necessary for us to expand industrially but we must at least see the matter in its right perspective. We must stop acting as though the people must dance to the tune of industry. My submission is that industry must adapt itself to the pattern of life of this country and if industry make demands which the people of South Africa cannot meet then industry must slow down. Surely we cannot be expected to sacrifice everything just for the sake of further industrial expansion. Surely the object is not to extract all minerals and all wealth from the soil of South Africa within 24 hours in order to make huge profits. Surely there are other interests as well that we have to protect. The industries of this fatherland of ours must meet the needs of our people and not <i>vice versa.</i> No industry has the right to expect us to change our pattern of life and our social order because of the demands of that industry.</p>

<p>What do you think solved the poor White problem in this country in the thirties if it was not industrial development?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I reply to that question with pleasure. What solved the poor White problem in South Africa so quickly? It is true that it was solved by industrial development; that provided them <span class="col_7321-7322" refersTo="page_994"/>with a way of earning a living but do you know who was the greatest opponent of industrial development in South Africa? Year after year I pleaded in this House for industrial expansion but the biggest opponent of that was the gold mining industry. The goose who laid the golden egg did not want those other little hens who could also lay eggs, eggs which the people preferred and which were better for them. The first big key industry we developed in South Africa was Iscor. I think the hon. member over there was still a little thing in those days. Does she know that the establishment of Iscor was strenuously opposed day and night under pressure from Oppenheimer? We had to have a joint sitting of both Houses in order to get that measure on the Statute Book. Does the hon. member not know that? Does that answer her question? As a result of that there was naturally a demand for White labour in South Africa. Of what use would it have been had we simply filled all those industries with Black labour like the Opposition wanted us to do? What would then have happened to our poor Whites?</p>

<p>There is something else I just want to emphasize before my time expires and that is the exaggerated value which is placed on collective bargaining. Collective bargaining sometimes makes things very easy for us, of course, and collective bargaining can serve a very useful purpose on occasions but in certain circumstances collective bargaining can be dangerous. Where trade unions in South Africa are divided into those which are inclined to the left and those which are inclined to the right, I am not sure that Oppenheimer has not half a dozen of those which are inclined to the left in his pocket. If that is the case you can undermine the policy of the Government and the Minister by means of collective bargaining; as a matter of fact, I think they are doing that to-day; that is why there are some people amongst those Leftists who, instead of pleading for work for the Whites, join the chorus, of course in a softer voice, and join the loud voice of Oppenheimer who sings: &#x201C;Away with job reservation&#x201D;.

<p>I do not want to deal fully with the speech made by the last speaker. I just want to remind him of one or two things. I want to remind him of the days when he had a good voice as a member of the Labour Party in fighting for the rights of the poor workers of South Africa. All I can say is that the hon. member has a bad memory, and I leave him there.</p>

<p>Sir, if you go into the question of job reservation you will find that it dates back to 1910. It reserves the most important work of this country for Whites only; it reserved membership of Parliament for Whites only. But, Sir, hon. members opposite will still change their minds; Coloured men will still sit here, whether they like it or not. That type of job reservation is also out of date although it is now entrenched in our Constitution. But just as easy as hon. members opposite found it to change the Constitution, so easily the future of this country will change the Constitution and the Coloured man will sit in this Parliament whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>I want to deal with job reservation and with the statement made by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister is sincere in his statement that job reservation has not prejudiced anybody in employment; in other words, no man in employment has lost his job as the result of job reservation. I think that is what the Minister stated.</p>

<p>If the Minister&#x2019;s statement is correct that no man has lost his job&#x2014;I do not want to argue with him&#x2014;job reservation has prevented Coloured people from entering trades and callings in certain areas. I refer, for example, to the posts of traffic constables and firemen in Cape Town. Sir, that is the complaint of the Coloured people. Why should the Coloured man who has done his job properly in Cape Town as a traffic constable be excluded from this sphere of employment as soon as the present 17 Coloured traffic constables leave these posts? The people of Cape Town have had nothing but praise for the work of these Coloured traffic constables. Sir, I want to say this to the hon. the Minister of Labour and to the Deputy Minister: For the purposes of argument and for the purposes of argument only let us assume that there is job reservation in what is now known as the White areas; how does the Minister expect the Coloured people, who will eventually have to be engaged in the Coloured areas under the Government&#x2019;s policy, be able to carry out the work for which their services will be wanted unless they are trained now in the White areas? Why should they not be trained here as traffic constables for eventual employment in that capacity in the Coloured areas? Why should they not be apprenticed in certain trades or callings in which they cannot be apprenticed to-day because they simply cannot get in? I do not think there is actually an embargo but the fact remains that they simply cannot get into these trades.</p>

There have never been any complaints. I am now going to make a statement and the Minister must correct me if I am wrong: In the evidence before the tribunal in regard to job reservation for the building industry not one employer asked for it; in fact they all opposed it. Despite that evidence and despite the appeal the tribunal made that there should be no job reservation the Minister introduced job reservation in the building industry.

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), who was the main spokesman of the Opposition, raised several matters, some of which are covered in the annual report of the Secretary for Labour. I do not think the hon. member can expect me now to go through the administration of every Act of Parliament which deals with labour matters. If members are interested, they can read the report of the Secretary for Labour. There they will get all the information they want in regard to the administration of the various Acts which govern our labour activities.</p>

<p>The problem of a manpower shortage, of course, is a universal one. It is a problem with which all countries are wrestling with to-day. South Africa is no exception.

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I am not talking about the Bantu; I know what the hon. member is referring to. By international standards the unemployment figure has now for some time&#x2014;for nearly two years&#x2014;been well below the percentage normally regarded as full employment. As hon. members know, 2.5 per cent is regarded as full employment. Our figure is, I think, almost less than 1 per cent&#x2014;again excluding the Bantu workers. I think it stands to reason, therefore, that, with the sudden upsurge in industrial activity which we are now experiencing, there will be a shortage of labour. I make the claim that those shortages cannot be met overnight. The only immediate relief I have been able to afford has been by way of immigration. As hon. members know, the Government has intensified its efforts in this direction. During last year over 12,000 skilled immigrants came into South Africa. Of course, I have long ago conceded that immigration alone will not solve the whole problem. We are, therefore, giving constant attention to measures whereby we can make the best use of our own manpower resources.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary to review, and, in the first place, to see this manpower problem in its right perspective. Despite what industrialists, economists, statisticians and others, with or without a knowledge of the subject, have had to say recently about the extent of the manpower shortage, I think there is a feeling today in the country that that shortage has been exaggerated. Progress and development in trade and industry generally are in a large measure dependent on the well-being of the building industry, which, I think, we always regard as the barometer of economic development. The views which have recently been expressed by the building industry on the question of manpower shortages should be noted, I think. In March the National Federation of Building Trade Employers expressed themselves as follows in their monthly journal <i>The South African Builder</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The building industry should wholeheartedly agree with the contention that while its operations would undoubtedly be hampered by a shortage of skilled labour, the magnitude of this problem should not be exaggerated. The shortage of skilled building labour is common to all Western countries and, no matter how irritating this may be, more particularly in times of increased demand, a responsible approach towards the affairs of the industry demands recognition of the indisputable fact that there is no immediate solution to this problem. In recent times publicity, inspired by sources which admittedly have the interests of the industry at heart, has perhaps gone too far in suggesting that the shortage of labour has assumed the proportions of a crisis. It is logically the responsibility of the Government to concern itself with crises, and if the building industry were, indeed, faced with a crisis, it would become the obligation of the Government to intervene. In other words, those who plead a crisis at a time when there is no crisis are inviting Government intervention at a stage in the development of the economy when there would be no justification whatever to introduce artificial means to restrict demand and to curb expansion. It cannot be denied that there is a shortage of skilled labour at the moment. We admit that. It is equally apparent that recruitment and development trends within the industry (i.e. the building industry) clearly point towards a greater disparity between skilled labour supplies and the demand for building services in the future. This problem is a complex one, because it is obviously a physical impossibility to step up recruitment to the extent necessary to restore the balance, but the Federation is aware of this problem and is doing everything within its power to provide for a long-term requirement by alternate means. The Federation subscribes to the contention that more efficient use should be made of existing labour resources by the introduction, <i>inter alia,</i> of organized systems of in-service training. The building industry is under the impression that, while in the final analysis the productive capacity of the industry must inevitably determine the magnitude of the development programme, there is no reason whatsoever at this stage to suggest that the position has assumed critical proportions.</block>

<p>That is a quotation from the report of the Federation of Builder Employers.</p>

<p>Hon. members will remember that it was only two years ago that the unemployment position in the building industry was fairly serious. According to a recent Press statement by the Director of the Federation, the industry has now succeeded in attracting back to the industry no less than 4,500 artisans who had been lost to other types of employment in slack times. It is, of course, quite impossible to have a pool of labour available on which industry can draw as and when required. But I think it is significant that they have succeeded in drawing back to the industry 4,500 artisans. A survey of shortages in the building industry was conducted by my Department towards the end of 1963. All the larger employers employing 100 and more workers were covered by that survey which also included smaller employers on a sample basis. A significant feature of the analysis of the survey was that the industry&#x2019;s requirements as far as apprentices were concerned were relatively low compared with the number of vacancies for artisans. The bigger employers estimated their requirements, as far as artisans were concerned, to be 1,221, whereas the number of vacancies <span class="col_7327-7328" refersTo="page_997"/>for apprentices totalled only 165. It is, of course, understandable that, where there is a shortage of labour, the immediate emphasis will fall on the skilled workers, but, as far as training is concerned, the figures quoted point to the necessity of a national approach on a long-term basis.</p>

<p>I think I am stating a commonplace when I say that the apprenticeship system will continue to be our main source of supplies of skilled labour in the future. I am very pleased to be able to say that there has been a steady increase in the enrolment of apprentices. Whereas 6,306 apprentices were indentured during 1962 the figure was increased by 305 up to 6,611 for 1963. So the tendency is for an increase in the number of apprentices.</p>

<p>It is also significant that there has also been an improvement in the percentage of apprentices who obtain artisan status by the passing of a qualifying trade test. While only 20 per cent were successful in their tests in 1961 the figure had risen to 27 per cent in 1962 and during 1963 the figure had increased to 30 per cent.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>No, these are apprentices generally speaking. The significance of this figure will be apparent when it is borne in mind that the trade tests are taken at the end of the penultimate year of apprenticeship. In other words, the apprentices concerned score a full year on their contract. In terms of skilled manpower it means that 30 out of every 100 join the skilled forces 12 months before their scheduled time. I think we have gained something there. I personally have every confidence that once the new apprenticeship procedures are in operation and once the employers decide to play their part and to co-operate to the full, this figure will be substantially increased. In this connection I think hon. members will be aware of the fact that the apprenticeship system has been reviewed and revised, not only with the object of attracting more youngsters to skilled trades but also with a view to speeding up the training, but ensuring that the best possible training will be provided by the employers.</p>

<p>Another field in which the Government has endeavoured to improve the manpower position is in the training of technicians. In a country such as South Africa where the economy has, during the past two decades, switched from one which has been largely on agriculture and primary industry, to one based on secondary industry, the technician, who has a status somewhere between that of the trained journeyman and the professional man, has today become indispensable. For this reason the Department of Education, Arts and Science in 1956 initiated steps to provide courses and facilities for the training of technicians. Attention was given to the training in the various fields where the greatest shortages were felt, for instance, mechanical, civil and electrical engineering, and clerical fields. These facilities are now being extended to the steel industry.</p>

<p>With the shortage of artisans which exists at present I think the Government can claim that we can look back with some satisfaction on the achievements in a field which has a profound bearing on this situation. I claim that, but for certain measures which have been adopted by my Department, the manpower shortage would have been much more serious than it is to-day. Quite apart from the fact that the Government considered it to be one of its first tasks to review the apprenticeship system, as evidenced by the Apprenticeship Amendment Act of 1951, two measures which were also placed on the Statute Book in 1951, have contributed a great deal towards alleviating the position. I now refer to a matter which was also raised by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, namely, the question of the operation of the Training of Artisans&#x2019; Act which came into operation in 1952. In terms of that Act White males of the age of 21 years or over can be admitted to a scheme for training in any one of a number of trades. They undergo intensive training over 12 months at a properly equipped institution conducted by the Department of Education. Thereafter they are placed with approved employers for a maximum period of three years. They are, however, entitled to apply for a trade test at any time during that period. And on passing that test they acquire artisan status. The Act also makes provision for trade testing men who have had experience in a particular trade but who cannot furnish proof of their ability as they have never served an apprenticeship. Since 1952 a total of over 1,200 persons have qualified in various trades under the training scheme. No less than 3,500 men have attained artisan status by passing a qualifying trade test. Hon. members will no doubt agree that these figures are significant and that the scheme has contributed very substantially to our skilled labour resources. I may tell hon. members that steps have already been taken to expand this training scheme and that the allowances payable to trainees at the various training centres have also recently been increased. Employers have also agreed to increase wages paid by them to these trainees. The response to advertisements for candidates to be admitted to the next course commencing next month this year has been most encouraging. Although the approved complement for the next course is 110 only no less than 592 inquiries have been received from potential trainees. Of this number a total of 363 persons have applied for admission to the course. I think it will be of interest to members to know that the cost to the State of the training provided at these training centres has been in the neighbourhood of R1,000 per trainee. With the increased allowances the costs will, of course, be considerably higher. The total costs until March 1964 amounted to R3,715,000. It is a matter of some satisfaction to me and my Department, not only that this scheme has contributed towards <span class="col_7329-7330" refersTo="page_998"/>an increase in our skilled manpower resources, but that an immigration scheme could be embarked upon in the knowledge that the needs of our less privileged people who had not previously had the opportunity of becoming skilled artisans, have not been ignored or neglected. In other words, our own people have been given every opportunity of being trained. I think that is one of the reasons why our country as a whole welcomes the immigration scheme, welcomes all these thousands of immigrants who come to South Africa. The people do so because they are not affected in their work. It does not affect our people; they are going on with their training. I think that is one of the reasons why we have had this tremendous support from all sections of our people for the immigration scheme.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana also raised the question of the Native Building Workers&#x2019; Act which was placed on the Statute Book in 1951 despite a lot of criticism from Opposition quarters. Under this Act no less than 3,600 Bantu have qualified as building workers. At the end of 1963 some 430 Bantu were still being trained; a grand total thus of over 4,000. Hon. members will, of course, be aware of the fact that while the Act prohibits the employment of Bantu on skilled work in the building industry within an urban area there is also a prohibition on the employment of Europeans in Bantu areas, except as supervisors or instructors, on any building in a Bantu area in connection with which a skilled Native building worker is employed. I think this is a form of work reservation in favour of the Bantu but it has conveniently been ignored by all those responsible for the agitation against job reservation. Many thousands of houses and other projects have been built in Bantu areas with this type of Bantu labour. Had such labour not been available the building industry would no doubt to-day have been faced with a much more serious shortage of skilled artisans.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What do they get?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know what their wages are but they are very good, they get much better wages than they get in quite a number of other industries. In addition to these I have mentioned, I cannot fail to mention the so-called orientation courses for operators which was commenced in Pretoria last year. The hon. member for Uhmlatuzana asked for information on this. There is a big demand for operators especially in the iron and steel industry but for obvious reasons these young men, some of them coming off the streets, have no idea as to what is expected of them when they start working as operators. In many cases they are difficult material to work on. The Government accordingly decided to embark on a pilot scheme at Pretoria where unskilled persons are enrolled at the technical college for an intensive course lasting three months. As soon as they finish there they are placed in suitable employment. Obviously they are able to go into production immediately. Some 23 persons have already completed their training and we have had so much success with this pilot scheme that it has been decided to expand it and eventually to extend it to other centres. That answers the question of the hon. member. He wanted to know whether it would be confined to Pretoria. It will now be expanded to other centres.</p>

<p>There are also many other divergent schemes which the Government has applied successfully. There are schemes for adapting, training and guiding elderly persons who suffer from numerous pscyhological and physical defects. I do not think I need go into the question of sheltered employment and employment for handicapped persons. We are also giving special attention to aged workseekers. We are aiming at placing them as selectively as possible. I may tell the Committee that we have considerable success in placing these so-called elderly people. In the light of the steps which I have detailed, and having regard to the fact that labour shortages have become world-wide, as I said at the commencement of my remarks it is an international phenomenon as far as the Western World is concerned, I think it is idle to attach any blame to the Government for the shortages which are being experienced in South Africa. There is of course still the question of the most effective use of the available manpower. This is a matter, as I have said, on several occasions in public speeches, that rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the employers, and it is trusted that they will also help by playing their part in a concrete manner rather than attempt to solve the problem from public platforms.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana made special reference to the question of the Bantu and Bantu wages, and the hon. member for Houghton just brushed aside the privileges and the assistance which Bantu have received under the Native Labour (Settlement of Disputes) Act. The hon. member for Houghton simply brushed that aside when she was talking about the recognition of Bantu trade unions. She said it was a very poor substitute and that it was really of no value as far as the Bantu was concerned. Let me just tell the Committee that in this latest report of the Board for the year 1963, I find this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu workers are realizing to an increasing extent that the Act was promulgated for their own benefit. They are relying more frequently on the services of the Native Labour Officers whose competent and expeditious handling of disputes has given them greater confidence in the Act. The settlement of disputes was greatly facilitated by the employers calling in the assistance of Native labour officers at an early stage. Stoppages of work and other threatening disputes could, however, in many instances have been averted, had employers and their supervisory personnel handled labour problems more sympathetically and efficiently. The continued propagation of the Act has yielded very good <span class="col_7331-7332" refersTo="page_999"/>results and it would appear that the majority of the employers of Bantu labour are now aware of the existence and the object of the Act. This is evidenced by the fact that it seldom happens nowadays that the Police are called before the Native labour officer and notified or consulted in connection with a dispute. The Board in its negotiations for higher wages for the Bantu continued to give effect to the existing policy concerning the wages of unskilled workers. The Board has insisted that industrial agreements should prescribe wages which are not lower than those fixed by wage determinations for unskilled labour in the areas concerned.</block>

<p>Then they give certain statistics. So that I say that this Native Labour (Settlement of Disputes) Act has served and is serving a wonderful purpose as far as the Bantu worker is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised one or two other questions. I have dealt with the training of operatives. The hon. member mentioned the difficulty of apprentices being called up for military service and having to undergo their nine months training. Well, Mr. Chairman, I might tell the Committee&#x2014;and what I am going to say also applies to university students&#x2014;that the policy is quite definite not to interrupt studies of <i>bona fide</i> university students and the training of apprentices. That policy remains unchanged. This year&#x2019;s ballotees for instance have not been called up for military training. They have merely been notified that their names have been drawn in the ballot. They have also been instructed to report for medical examination. Allocations for training in 1965 will be made approximately in September this year, and university students and apprentices who continue their studies and their apprenticeships next year, may, as in the past, apply for a postponement of their training.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>No, there is no change of policy. It represents a change in procedure in that they must now go for their medical examination immediately after being balloted.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of equal pay for equal work for women. I am sorry I cannot express any opinion on that. It is a matter for the employers themselves to decide whether they will pay equal pay for equal work. I am not prepared to express any opinion. The hon. member also asked me about wage board determinations and how far they have caught up on their back-log. I can tell hon. members that considerable progress has been made. During 1963, there were 16 references issued to the Wage Board in terms of the Wage Act and ten wage determinations were made and the board has practically reviewed all the older determinations. Great progress has therefore been made in going back to the old determinations and reviewing them.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the breakdown of jobs. He suggested that there was a dilution of labour in certain instances and a reclassification of duties. The whole purpose of reclassification of the duties attached to any particular post is to ensure that skilled workers should not be saddled with duties which can be performed by less skilled workers. What is the use of a highly skilled worker doing a job which can be done by a semi-skilled worker? The rate for the job in that instance is not in issue. Whatever new reclassifications are <span class="col_7333-7334" refersTo="page_1000"/>agreed upon by employers and the trade unions are subject to the minimum rates applicable to such classifications, irrespective of the race of the employees.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is an inspector. The process of reclassifying, of course, is by no means a new one. It has been going on for a long time. Without the operation of the Industrial Conciliation Act, industrial councils have from time to time submitted new agreements with amended definitions of categories of work for which the minimum rates are laid down.</p>

<p>The hon. member also dealt with the question of the recognition of Bantu trade unions, and then there was a little diversion by the hon. member for Houghton. I don&#x2019;t think I need say anything more about it really, because last year the hon. member for Houghton introduced a motion in the House to which I gave a very full reply on the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards Bantu trade unions. The hon. member also raised the question by way of a question this year, and I referred her to these debates of last year, but if the hon. member wants to come with it again next year, I can bring myself up to date and give her a full reply.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me a question about the control of the knitting industry and he suggested that there is no control as far as my Department is concerned. Well, we have received no representations from that industry, and if the hon. member wants to make representations I am prepared to go into it and see what can be done.</p>

<p>The only other question is unemployment among Indians. I gave a full reply to that too, some time ago, but I want to say that our trouble, of course, is that the Indians won&#x2019;t register. I know that the figures I give in reply to questions from time to time are probably not accurate, but they are the figures which we have got in our unemployment bureau. Unfortunately the Indians will not register. We have asked them to register so that we can assist in placing them in employment. It is obvious that we cannot place people in employment if they don&#x2019;t register. This question of Indian unemployment has been raised for the last few years, and I think it has been magnified to some extent by newspaper reports. Hon. members will remember that in January 1963 the <i>Natal Mercury</i> in a certain article stated that 78,000 persons were hit by a lack of jobs for Indians. I took up the matter with the news editor of the <i>Natal Mercury</i> and he informed my Department that the reporter who was responsible for this article merely multiplied the estimated number of unemployed, that is to say, 15,000, by 5.2, which he considered was the number of dependants of each workseeker and so he arrived at the figure of 78,000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I challenged the statement that there were 15,000 unemployed. As a result of investigations we found that amongst these people there were very few who would openly admit to not seeking work or wanting work. I think it must be pointed out that the survey which I have mentioned related to approximately 1 in 60 of the Durban Indian population and that it covered only 931 workers out of a total adult working force of 38,146. I submit that this is an extremely small sample. It is a well-known fact that Indians are most reluctant to perform manual work and they are more attracted to the commercial and distributive and to the catering trades. According to the unemployment statistics which are maintained by my Department 2,622 Indians were registered as unemployed in Durban as on the 30 April 1964, and for the whole of Natal only 2,999 Indians were registered as unemployed. I may say also for the information of the Committee that in 1963, my Department in actual fact placed 4,367 Indian adult males and 484 Indian adult females in employment. So I assure the Committee that we have this matter constantly before us and we are doing everything in our power to assist the unemployed amongst the Indians to get work.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein put certain questions: Has the Minister a policy in making available more skilled workers? I answered that. But I think I must just refer to the speech which the hon. member apparently found great delight in quoting, when I opened an extension of a factory at Knights, near Germiston. I take it he read from a newspaper report.</p>

<p>Why should I bother about that. I admit it is not very important, but for the purpose of the record let me read what I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although we know that according to our Western standards the birthrate of Whites is relatively high, it still compares unfavourably with that of the non-Whites. South Africa&#x2019;s labour problem is that the White population which has traditionally provided the skilled manpower is, relative to the <span class="col_7335-7336" refersTo="page_1001"/>country&#x2019;s development and possibilities, increasing far too slowly. This results in a shortage of skilled labour, more especially of technicians, executive personnel and artisans.</block>

<p>On the other hand, there is the rapid growth of non-Whites and our efforts to raise their standard of living are hampered by the large number of unskilled and semiskilled who enter the labour market yearly from within and outside our borders. In order to equip them better for the labour market, their training facilities are constantly being expanded, and although considerable progress has been made in this direction it will take some years before their contribution to the solution of the skilled manpower problem will be felt substantially. South Africa will therefore have to avail itself of the maximum number of skilled immigrants, together with its own skilled manpower, to maintain the existing rate of development and to prevent increased unemployment amongst the unskilled.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>As a matter of fact, at the moment there are 600 Coloured apprentices here in the building trade as against 100 Whites. But the point I make is that the Government is not against the training of non-Europeans for skilled work.</p>

<p>I want to answer the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Mr. Henning). His main plea was for a smaller gap between a workman&#x2019;s actual earnings and the amount of compensation he receives both during temporary and permanent disablement as the result of an accident arising in the course of his work. In support of the argument, he quoted the example where a workman earned over R200 per month at the time of the accident, and he receives only R90 per month by way of compensation. However much merit there may be in this argument, I think it should be realized that it is not a matter which can be dealt with administratively. It would require special legislation. That of course is not a serious obstacle. My main difficulty will be that his recommendations would have such far-reaching financial implications, I think we should remember that the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner&#x2019;s Office is a nonprofit making organization which must at all times maintain sound economic equilibrium between income and expenditure, and as hon. members know, its rates of assessment and of tariffs of payment must at all times remain actuarially sound, and it is a fact that before any tariffs are reduced or increased and before any benefits are increased, these actuaries have to be consulted. In any case, the Act provides that the assets and liabilities of the Accident Fund shall be valued by an actuary at intervals of not more than three years. A most important factor concerning the Accident Fund is the fact that employees do not contribute a single cent towards it but that it is exclusively financed by employers through assessments. Of course the Government also makes a contribution. Increased assessments on employers do not however necessarily bring about increased benefits, because each industry is expected to be self-supporting and tariffs are based on that industry&#x2019;s accident experience. The changes which are contemplated by the hon. member will not only affect the Accident Fund as such but will directly involve certain employers who are individually liable in respect of accidents to their workers. Let me give an example. In the building industry employers are not registered with the Accident Fund, but they have their own fund with the Federated Employers Mutual Insurance Company. Let us take the mining industry. They insure their workmen with the Rand Mutual Insurance Company, while all State Departments carry their own risk. In addition, the Act provides that any local authority employing 500 or more White workmen may be exempted by the Commissioner from paying assessments to the accident fund, subject to certain conditions, one of which is that they carry their own accident risk, and there are in fact quite a number of local authorities which have been so exempted. So that for these reasons increased benefits cannot be applied with <span class="col_7337-7338" refersTo="page_1002"/>retrospective effect. It is obvious that this matter cannot be adjusted so easily. Numerous factors will have to be taken into consideration and I doubt very much whether we will come anywhere near the hon. member&#x2019;s ideal in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless it is our policy that while on the one hand we try to keep the assessment rates as low as possible, it is equally desirable to increase the benefits as much as possible within the boundaries of sound economics. I can assure the hon. member that that will be done wherever practicable.</p>

<p>Then there was reference to job reservation in regard to Indian barmen. I have gone to some trouble about this matter. As the matter stands at the moment, I have asked for a report from Durban and Pietermaritzburg so that I could go into the matter again. I have had a look at the report of the Industrial Tribunal on the question of work reservation for bar-men and I find that after the Tribunal con-ducted certain inspections <i>in loco,</i> and after all the representations were received from all the interested parties, they came to the conclusion that work reservation was called for only in the two principal cities, Durban and Pietermaritzburg, and then only in respect of portion of the trade covered by its terms of reference. The Tribunal found that barmen employed in restaurants had always been of the Asiatic race and that it would be impracticable and undesirable to reserve such work for Whites in this section of the trade. The Tribunal also found that with the exception of hoteliers and licensees who acted as barmen in their own establishments, White barmen were not normally employed to serve in non-White bars, and this section of the trade was accordingly also excluded from there commendations for a work reservation determination. I find that a sizeable portion of the trade in the municipal areas of Durban and Pietermaritzburg and the whole of the trade in the remaining areas were left open for Indians, and the Tribunal confined itself entirely to barmen employed in White public bars in the municipal areas of Durban and Pietermaritzburg.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about the White public bars. Reservation does not affect the clubs. They can continue with their Indian barmen. I do not know whether the hon. member has read this report. If he has, he will remember that the views expressed by the General Secretary of the Trade Union representing both White and Coloured workers we reas follows, and he himself is an Indian. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been accepted as the policy in the large majority of public bars to employ White barmen only in White public bars &#x2026; Even in my own experience and knowledge, this policy has been maintained with a deep resentment of any development of Indians in White public bars by certain unscrupulous employers who are in a very small minority.</block>

<p>The reference to unscrupulous employers, I think, implies that non-Whites were being employed by the employers concerned at a lower wage than that paid to White barmen. How-ever, I think the crux of the matter was that all the parties testified to the fact that the number of non-White barmen in White public bars was really negligible.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I say the evidence was that the number of non-White barmen in White bars was negligible, particularly in Durban. The Tribunal, nevertheless,found that the percentage of White barmen had decreased, as against an increase in the number of Asiatics, and that White barmen in White public bars had, in fact, been replaced by non-White barmen in both Durban and Pietermaritzburg. The Secretary of the trade union, to whom I have referred, served as an assessor on the Tribunal, and in a separate report he expressed the view that there should be no work reservation, but that, if the Tri-bunal thought otherwise, the reservation should be confined to work of barmen in White public bars in the central area of Durban only. He explained that the reason for his request was that, due to the circumstances and the policy during the war years, there had been a constant number of White barmen employed mostly in White public bars, and, in conclusion, he used these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This, in fact, is a tacit and neutral acceptance of conditions which existed during the war years, and, if reserved, is not likely to bring any new set of circumstances which may have the tendency to disrupt the trade concerned.</block>

<p>I also find that during the Tribunal&#x2019;s investigation the view was advanced that suitable White barmen were not readily available, and it is common knowledge that employers had to con-tend with the shortage of labour also during the war years, and if they found it possible then to train and employ Whites, there seems to be no reason why they cannot do so now. From the replies in response to a questionnaire, the Tribunal concluded that few employers put themselves out to train White barment. I do not think I need weary the Committee with some of the other acts I have here. As hon. members know, we have granted exemptions on quite a large scale. But let me assure the hon. member that I have called <span class="col_7339-7340" refersTo="page_1003"/>for a report on this matter, and I will investigate it and see whether a change is justified.</p>

<p>There is only one other question I want to reply to. The hon. member for Krugersdorp is not here now, but I will just say that he was absolutely correct when he stated that, in regard to immigration, job reservation is a question they ask in overseas countries. They want to know, if they should decide to go to South Africa, whether they will be protected against unfair non-White competition. I think I told the House before that that question was put to me at two Press conferences I held, in London and in The Hague. In The Hague particularly the question was put to me that, if we want White skilled artisans to come to South Africa, what guarantee can we give them that they will not be pushed out of their work by non-Whites. I said I could give them the guarantee that in certain trades they would be protected. I think the reason why they asked that question was because hundreds of them had been pushed out of their work in Indonesia, and so they were worried. There were immigrants from Britain who posed the same question, as to what would happen to them in South Africa with the big majority of non-Whites. And it is a big question. Hon. members may say that they must take a chance and, if they are good workmen, there is no reason why they should be pushed out, but it is a factor in immigration. I want to say this in conclusion, that there is not the slightest possibility of the Government suspending any job reservations whatsoever. I am still going into the question of the barmen, but in regard to the other industries where there are reservations, it is definitely the policy of the Government to maintain those determinations. I have no intention whatsoever of departing from or suspending or amending those job reservations. It is definitely the policy of this Government to maintain and retain them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has dealt at length with the queries raised, but I do not think he has given us any new information in connection with the manpower shortage, other than to indicate that, because the building industry is satisfied that there is no crisis, therefore there is no crisis in regard to other industries, because the building industry is regarded as the barometer. I think that the position that has developed will prove whether or not the Minister is correct in his appreciation of the manpower position. We, on this side, hope sincerely that every means would be used to overcome the manpower shortage. We have no desire to see industry hampered because of the shortage of manpower. I think it is important that we should realize that there are still steps which the Government is in a position to take. I think, firstly, the Minister should ascertain how many skilled workers there are in the country who are not employed in their trades at all. I do not think it will be difficult to obtain that information. My information is that there are many. If the Minister gets into touch with the trade unions, he will find out that they maintain that this is because the wages paid are too low. It is not that the skilled workers do not want to work in their own trades, but because the wages are too low. The Minister cannot control that directly, but it would help considerably if he could establish the fact that there are considerable numbers of skilled men who are not working at their trades. The Minister said that 4,000 odd had been won back to the building industry because the wage inducements were correct. The level laid down by the Industrial Council Agreements have been exceeded, because the industry had to get workers, and they are now paid considerably more than the agreements laid down. That position is present I think, in other industries as well, and I think it merits examination.</p>

<p>The other point that the Minister has not touched on is the question of how wage adjustments are to take place other than by Wage Board determinations&#x2014;I am speaking now of Bantu workers&#x2014;and the activity of the Native Labour Board representatives at the Industrial Council discussions. The Minister has made it clear that the standard accepted is that laid down by Wage Board determinations. That is the norm, and if you ask what the Wage Board uses to discover what the adjustment upwards should be in the wages for Bantu workers, you will discover that they go by what is being paid in industry. I suppose that is the real reason why there has not been as big an increase in unskilled Bantu wages as employers would like to see. It seems to me that the Minister must ask his colleagues in the Cabinet to set an example in regard to Government employees, so that the Wage Board will have something other than existing wage rates to use in determining what the wages should be for unskilled workers. It is no use just accepting that the wage level must be laid down by the Wage Board, because the Wage Board is not in a position fully to appreciate what is happening in so far as all the employees throughout the country are concerned in the labour field covered by unskilled work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the Minister has made it clear that they do not set up a wage <span class="col_7341-7342" refersTo="page_1004"/>rate which is above that made by an Industrial Council determination, and they&#x2014;the Industrial Council&#x2014;in turn, will not go above the wages laid down by the Wage Board, so that there is no movement. I want to ask the Minister what machinery we can use in the place of collective bargaining. The hon. member for Houghton said there was no other machinery except collective bargaining, and to get collective bargaining you have to have trade unions. That is the challenge. If there is no other machinery other than collective bargaining, we are falling down on our jobs. I do not believe that is the position, and in the Shops and Offices Bill we have attempted to meet this problem by providing a measure of collective bargaining for Bantu workers in so far as their conditions are concerned, but not their wages. I think the Minister must meet this challenge. He cannot rely on Wage Board determinations to set the wages for Bantu workers generally. It is not dynamic enough to meet the position which is developing, particularly when the Bantu &#x201C;earn Black and pay White&#x201D;. That is the problem, and we have to meet it. At the moment it seems that it cannot be met in any other way than by recognizing Bantu trade unions. But I do not believe that is the Minister&#x2019;s outlook; it is the outlook of the hon. member for Houghton. But that will not resolve the problem, because we cannot allow the majority of Black workers in an industry to dominate the Whites. That is the practical difficulty. As an old trade unionist, I know what problems there are in White trade unions when an agitator wishes to gain control. He is often able to persuade people to support him. In any industry where the majority of workers are Black, if they were allowed to belong to the trade unions, they would control that union, and that would not necessarily mean that there would be an improvement in wages. But if we cannot find alternative machinery for dealing with this dynamic question of Bantu wages, then we are in trouble, and I say that the machinery of the Wage Board is not sufficient. It is too slow.</p>

<p>Yes, but can it be speeded up sufficiently to bring about a dynamic change in the relationship between Bantu wages and the wages of other races? The challenge is there. The hon. member for Houghton says only collective bargaining by way of recognizing the trade unions will solve the problem. The Minister says the Wage Board can do it, but neither of these will meet the position in the foreseeable future. That is why I ask what we are going to do to meet this problem, because we cannot have the dynamic change we want, and which many employers want but cannot get, because other employers in the same industry are not prepared to agree to it.

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>We have been discussing the labour position for hours and we have had repeated references to Bantu wages, machinery for collective bargaining by Bantu, work reservation and the manpower position, all the old complaints which have been continually voiced for the past year already. What have we had from the Opposition? They are angry about work reservation, but they are not really angry about it; they are angry because their predictions in regard to work reservation have not come true. Do hon. members still remember how in 1956, when the Industrial Conciliation Act was under discussion, the wildest predictions were made as to what the results would be if work reservation was applied? It was then said that it would disrupt our economy, but what has happened? In spite of all those sombre predictions, our economic development has increased on an unprecedented scale, in spite of the application of work reservation. I say the Opposition is not angry about work reservation as such, but because their predictions did not come true.</p>

<p>They made a second prediction in regard to work reservation, and they come here year after year trying to tell the country and the world that work reservation creates a tremendous injustice towards the non-Whites. But when the Minister and the Deputy Minister challenge them to mention a single case where a non-White was detrimentally affected, they cannot offer any proof. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Boland talks here every year with sobs in his voice about how the Coloureds are detrimentally affected by it, but he cannot adduce any proof either. The Deputy Minister told us to-day that he even asked the Coloured Council to lodge complaints, and members of that Council wrote letters to the Press and invited Coloureds to say how they had been harmed, but we have had no proof.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) said that the Government had <span class="col_7343-7344" refersTo="page_1005"/>really run away from work reservation; that it is being applied with all kinds of exemptions and that it is no longer really a protection to the Whites, but he does not know what he is talking about. Was the White worker in the building industry in the Free State not protected by it? Is the work reservation which was applied in the building industry in the Western Cape not protection for the White building worker, so much so that the White apprentices in the building trade here have since then increased in number? But take the clothing industry. In 1959 it was applied to the clothing industry. After the Whites had for years been increasingly squeezed out of that industry, there were then still 870 Whites, and those people wanted to work there. Then work reservation was applied to protect them. If that had not been done they would also have disappeared from that industry. But work reservation succeeded in so far that not only were those 870 able to remain in the industry, but their numbers have now grown to 950. Is that not protection for the Whites?</p>

<p>Now we come to the manpower shortage. I quite agree with the Minister that this is a matter which is being grossly exaggerated, but the hon. members opposite are masters of exaggeration. When once they have tackled a matter, one would swear that the world was coming to an end, and in the same way they are also exaggerating the manpower shortage in South Africa, a brief three years ago there v/as a degree of unemployment in South Africa. Do you remember, Sir, how the Opposition, which now makes such a fuss about the manpower shortage, then carried on about unemployment; how they predicted that unemployment would increase on an unprecedented scale, and how they saw only bankruptcy facing South Africa? Three years ago they completely exaggerated the problem of unemployment, and what happened? To-day they must admit that they were hopelessly wrong three years ago, and I want to predict to-day that just as they were wrong in their predictions about unemployment, so will they also be wrong in the predictions they are making in regard to the manpower shortage in South Africa</p>

<p>The hon. member says that the Nationalist Government is responsible for it.

Have hon. members of the Opposition complained here to-day that not enough training facilities are made available by the Departments of Labour and Education, Arts and Science? No, they cannot do so because the hon. the Minister of Labour and his Deputy Minister and the Department ensure that increasingly more training facilities for apprentices are made available. Have they complained about the wages and conditions of work of employees in industry? No, they cannot do that. As I told the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) this morning, her big boss, Mr. Oppenheimer, has told her that impressive wage increases are keeping South Africa stable. That was what he said. He showed how throughout the years the wages of workers, White as well as non-White, have increased in industry. Sir, have hon. members opposite complained about immigration? They cannot complain because the simple fact is that this Minister and his Department are making a great success of our immigration policy. They cannot complain. Then why are they complaining? They complain because there is a manpower shortage in the country and because we have such a good Government which ensured this splendid economic development we are having to-day.

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister of Labour has dropped quite a bomb-shell he does not realize it. He dealt with the position of the so-called immigrants. I do not call them <span class="col_7345-7346" refersTo="page_1006"/>immigrants at all. I call them imported labourers; they are not immigrants. They come here to work, not as immigrants, and then they say to the Government &#x201C;Will you see that we keep our job or that we get a job.&#x201D; The Minister must have said, &#x201C;Yes, boys, come along, we will keep the Coloured man and the Bantu out of a job and we will give it to you&#x201D;&#x2014;a new form of job reservation. That is why the hon. the Minister is so emphatic that the Government will not remove job reservation. Irrespective of the argument that could be used against it, the Minister says that they will not remove it. He cannot remove job reservation because all the 12,000 or 15,000 people who have come out here, to whom he has promised a job, must be protected. Sir the hon. the Deputy Minister of Labour has made an appeal to the Opposition once and for all to stop talking about job reservation. May I make an appeal to the Minister and to the Deputy Minister to stop quoting the building industry as an example of job reservation because that does not tarry with the facts. In the Cape the building industry has been the traditional sphere of employment of the Coloured people, and because it has been their traditional sphere of employment to some extent the Minister justifies job reservation in other industries by pointing continually and continuously to the building industry. Sir, I challenge the hon. Minister to have an investigation instituted into the building industry to see to what extent job reservation has affected the position. He would be surprised. Job reservation in the building industry has been to the detriment of the Coloured people.</p>

No, not one, except in the stone masonery undertaking. The Coloured people said &#x201C;That sphere of employment has traditionally been White; we cannot afford to go into it; we have not got the money; we have not got the skill for it&#x201D;. They had no objections therefore. But not one master builder, no other employer of labour in the building industry, supported job reservation.</p>

Sir, I will tell the hon. the Minister a few stories now about job reservation. A contract was handed out in respect of a building at the Foreshore, and I am told that the condition was laid down, at the insistence of the Government, that the ratio of employment should be 75 per cent Whites and 25 per cent Coloureds. That was the condition that was laid down because they wanted to give this work to Whites. Within one week after the commencement of building operations the ratio was 75 per cent Coloured and 25 per cent White because they simply could not find White employees. The White man in the Cape does not enter the building industry because he wants to do something better. Job reservation in the building industry has two effects: It protects the White man who lacks the ability to rise above the standard of the Coloured man. You are helping the man who is incapable of getting a job without the protection of job reservation. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>In regard to the reference again made by the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) to work reservation in the building industry. I really think it is necessary for me to draw his attention to a few facts. In the first place, I just want to refer to the trade unions, which in fact asked for it. He referred to the report of the Industrial Tribunal in regard to the investigation in the Cape. On page 27 I find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The members of the Western Province Building and Allied Trades Union insisted that the building trades be reserved for Whites.</block>

<p><span class="col_7347-7348" refersTo="page_1007"/>Then a little lower down on the same page&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The S.A. Operative Masons Society informed us that their society had been established in 1896 by White stonemasons. It has always been their policy that no non-Whites should be allowed as apprentices or as artisans.</block>

<p>Those are two of the trade unions which asked for it. But I want to hasten to deal with a few other aspects. The allegation was made here by the hon. member that the Peninsula and the Western Cape is the traditional sphere of labour just for Coloureds in the building industry. I think that is a totally wrong standpoint.</p>

But then the hon. member must surely also accept that this same building industry in the Western Cape is also the traditional sphere of work for the Whites. Before the Coloureds were building artisans in the Cape, the Whites were already here. The hon. member should study the history.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>They have been here for centuries, active in the various spheres of work in the building industry. Gradually the Coloureds came in. Their right to be here is also recognized. This whole report accepts the position as it has developed through the centuries, and that is the whole principle of work reservation. We do not try to turn back the clock; we try to maintain the <i>status quo,</i> after investigation has been instituted, after complaints have been received that the Whites are being ousted. The Whites in the Western Cape have as much right to work in the building industry, in their traditional sphere of work, as the Coloureds have. I put this same approach to the Coloured Council when I addressed them the other day on work reservation. I told them: &#x201C;We recognize your right to be in the building industry in the Cape; to-day you fill most of the artisan&#x2019;s posts in that industry. We accept it and recognize it, and therefore a determination has been made which recognizes your position to that extent, but at the same time, also in the interest of good race relations, in the interest of the goodwill which the White worker must have towards the Coloured worker, it is necessary that the Coloured worker and his representatives, like the hon. member for Boland, should also recognize the traditional right of the Whites to work in the building industry in the Cape; and when the White workers approach you, through the trade unions I have mentioned here, and ask for protection because they feel that they are gradually being ousted because lower wages are paid to the Coloureds, as this report clearly proves, and the White workers are then ousted in that way from their traditional sphere of work, work which they are just as keen on doing as the Coloureds are, then this Government cannot be deaf to those requests and pleas by the White workers.&#x201D; It is for that reason that this investigation by the Industrial Tribunal was instituted and that the recommendation was made and that this determination was made.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day the hon. member referred to East London. It is true that the work in East London is mainly reserved for Whites. But I think I should read to hon. members the last paragraph of the findings of the Tribunal, on page 27&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Tribunal therefore recommends that the work of artisans in all trades in the building industry, excluding asphalt work, should be reserved for Whites in this area, with the proviso that Coloureds who are at the moment working in this area may continue their work.</block>

<p>The same principle also applies to the other determinations in the Western Cape, and that proves the proposition I stated here earlier, that work reservation determinations are not made to kick people out of their work or to harm people. This determination which was made in the Cape and the one made in East London recognized the Coloureds now employed in these spheres of employment which are now being reserved for the Whites. Not a single Coloured man either here or in East London will be kicked out of the work which is now being reserved for Whites; he can remain there until the day he dies. In addition, the apprentice who is apprenticed in these few trades in the Western Cape which are being reserved for the Whites may continue in that direction; they may complete their apprenticeship and after that they may continue to work in those same trades which are now being reserved for Whites. The Coloureds who, after this determination, want to be trained in those trades reserved for Whites in the Cape can be apprenticed and trained in those trades, and after having completed their apprenticeship they must just go and work in other areas.</p>

<p><span class="col_7349-7350" refersTo="page_1008"/>We make no excuse for that. It is a very fair arrangement. I put it to the Coloured Council precisely like this, and they accepted that this was the way in which they wanted to play their part to retain the goodwill of the Whites, which is of as much importance to them as the goodwill of the Coloureds is to us. I think that in regard to this determination we may say that it is one based on reasonableness; it is based on the <i>status quo</i> and it is applied with the greatest degree of humaneness. But what surprises me is this: While the hon. member for Boland has now grasped at East London as a stick which to beat the Government, and to show how unreasonable the Government is, he could at least have mentioned Kimberley also, just to be fair. But do you know why the hon. member did not mention Kimberley? In Kimberley no determinations have been made. There no work is being reserved for Whites in the building industry&#x2014;not a single trade. If he wants to paint the picture correctly to his Coloured audiences, he should tell them: In East London this is the position, but in Kimberley the <i>status quo</i> has been accepted to such an extent that this Government has not reserved a single trade for Whites there. But, Sir, the object of work reservation is not only to protect the Whites; it is also to protect the Coloureds. This same determination in the building industry in the Cape also looks after the interests of the Coloureds; it protects them too. By way of influx control we ensure that the Bantu do not oust them here. Fortunately the Coloureds are increasingly beginning to realize the advantages to themselves of work reservation. I should like to read a letter written to Minister Trollip by a Coloured man, dated 3rd June, 1964. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Mr. Trollip, I am a Coloured worker working at a tobacco company in Johannesburg.&#x2026;</block>

<p>I will not mention the name of the tobacco factory&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and I am writing to you, Sir, to see if you cannot help us. We have heard so much about job reservation and we are wondering when you are going to introduce it in our industry, because if ever there is an industry which needs job reservation it is the tobacco industry. They are employing more and more Natives and it seems that one of these days only Natives will be employed.</block>

<p>I quote this with but one object, to show that the Coloureds are also now beginning to see through the propaganda continually being made by hon. members against work reservation. They are also beginning to realize and to appreciate the positive aspects of it. They are beginning to realize that it is also in their interests.</p>

We know that the hon. the Minister has had to grant nearly 40 exemptions already under the determination.</p>

<p>Well, possibly the Minister replied when I was called out for a trunk call for a short while, but I listened attentively to the hon. the Minister and I did not hear him deal with this particular aspect. However, I would like to say that the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs, when his vote was under discussion, did not deny that he had written a letter to the Secretary of the non-European Welfare Railway Passenger Association saying that the Government was carrying out extensive investigations into ways of relieving Indian unemployment, one of the items being the opening of new avenues of employment. When I asked the hon. the Minister of Labour a week or so ago, when he replied to a question, whether he was aware of this fact he said that he was not. Therefore I would like to know whether the liaison between the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Indian Affairs has broken down somewhere because it would appear that far from carrying out investigations to find new avenues of employment, the hon. <span class="col_7351-7352" refersTo="page_1009"/>the Minister of Labour is closing avenues of employment. I feel that the hon. the Minister should give us some indication as to whether anything has in fact been done with a view to instituting such investigations.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also dealt with the manpower position and he stated that he felt that there were certain aspects of this question of manpower shortage which were being exaggerated. I would like to draw his attention to a statement that was issued by the Department of Information at the South African Embassy in London recently and which appeared in February 1964. The report which I have here says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has launched a drive to recruit 10,000 skilled workers in Britain. From every corner of South Africa calls are coming in for bricklayers, motor mechanics, cable joiners, loom turners or sewing machine mechanics. Every immigrant is guaranteed a job.</block>

<p>The position is that the Department of Information in London is appealing for 10,000 skilled workers to come to this country. Surely that shows that there is a manpower shortage in that particular field.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, in the course of his speech, also mentioned the fact that there had been an increase in the number of contracts entered into by apprentices. He quoted a figure of 6,611 for 1963. When we look at the latest report of the Department of Labour we find that in 1959 there were 7,556 new contracts; in 1960 the number dropped to 7,017; in 1961 it dropped to 6,525, in 1962 to 6,306, so it is obvious that there has been a steady decline in the intake of apprentices, and surely this is going to have an adverse effect on our manpower position. If there had been an increase of only five per cent per year in the intake of apprentices, starting with the figure for 1959 when there were 7,556, we should have had 9,182 apprentices entering into contracts in 1963, a figure which is far in excess of the figure of 6,611 which I have quoted. Sir, the figures in respect of the building industry also call for some comment. When we look at the report of the Department of Labour we find that in 1960 1,056 apprentices entered into contracts in the building industry; in 1961 the number dropped to 853 and in 1963 to 595. The hon. the Minister, in reply to a question earlier this Session, said that in 1963 554 new contracts were entered into. He also said in the course of his speech that some 600 Coloured persons had signed contracts of apprenticeship in 1963, but the figure shown here is only 595; that is the total number of new contracts of apprenticeship in the building industry entered into in 1963. Then when we look at the table showing the number of contracts in operation in the various industries we find that there has been a decline of almost 1,000 a year over the last six years. The position is therefore deteriorating and I believe that we are fully justified in raising this very important matter which is going to affect our future manpower position because these new apprentices who commenced their apprenticeships will qualify within the next two or three years as artisans, and we will then have fewer new artisans available.</p>

<p>Then I would like to refer to the point raised by the hon. Minister with regard to apprentices undergoing military training. The Minister mentioned that apprentices who were in a particular trade would be utilized in those trades in the Defence Department. I want to refer the hon. the Minister to the case of an apprentice who was serving his third year as a motor mechanic and who commenced his nine months&#x2019; continuous training. After two months he was transferred as a motor mechanic to the Technical Services Corps attached to the Second Armoured Car Regiment. He served seven months of his nine months&#x2019; training in the workship, yet this apprentice, when he returns to civilian life, will still have to have his apprenticeship extended by a period of five months, because only four months of the nine months during which he was undergoing military training will count towards his period of apprenticeship, in spite of the fact that he spent seven months out of those nine months at his trade in a workshop. I feel that with the shortage of skilled artisans, the hon. the Minister of Labour could perhaps take up this matter again with the Department of Defence or with the National Apprenticeship Board to see whether sympathetic consideration cannot be given to those persons who are virtually working at their trade while undergoing military training.</p>

<p>The other point I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister is one which has not been raised in any degree of detail during the course of this debate, and that is the effect of the legislation passed in 1962, when the Unemployment Insurance Act was drastically amended. I have various letters which I received during the month of May, all from persons placed in difficult financial predicaments, due to the fact that they are unable to qualify for any further benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Benefit Fund. I shall take one which, I think, is typical of the other ten letters I have here. This one is from a person aged 55 years of age. She lost her employment. She drew benefits for 26 weeks <span class="col_7353-7354" refersTo="page_1010"/>was unable to find further employment for a period of 13 weeks and, therefore, does not qualify to draw any further benefits from the fund. This person has been a member of the fund for 14 years and is now 55 years of age, as I have said. She is, consequently, placed in a difficult predicament&#x2014;she is a widow&#x2014;in that she has no source of income. She is too young to qualify for an old-age pension and, at the same time, in spite of the fact that she has contributed to the fund for a period of 14 years, she finds that she can no longer draw any further benefits from that fund. And her age might also militate against her finding other employment. She cannot draw any further benefits, in spite of the fact that she may have built up a large number of credits over that period of 14 years. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to associate myself with the plea made by the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) in regard to the necessity for having more labour bureaux, particularly with a view to greater employment of the Coloured population in the rural areas. I was grateful to note the announcement by the hon. the Deputy Minister in connection with the expansion of work provision services to the smaller centres. With the decrease and the eventual removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape, one of our most serious and urgent problems is how effectively to utilize the available Coloured labour. Therefore I hope that the Department of Labour, in co-operation with the Department of Coloured Affairs, will devote serious attention to this matter and provide the facilities to utilize the available Coloured labour as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>Where our White youths are to-day almost without exception compelled to make themselves available for military training, has the time not arrived for our Coloured population to be compelled to make themselves available for some or other form of service? I cannot see how we can incorporate them in our military services, as we do in the case of the White boys, but I do think that there is much scope for labour service, service in other spheres, particularly with a view to the later effective utilization of many of our Coloured people who leave school at a very early age and are not fitted for anything really. On the farms it is very easy to employ those people and gradually to train them, as is usually done. In the towns, however, it is a much more real problem. One has the young Coloureds who have left school after Stds. II, III or IV and are not really fitted for anything. They have not been taught to do anything. They practically develop into a skolly element, if I may put it that way, and lend themselves to all kinds of misdemeanours and eventually they commit serious crimes. Coloured parents strongly feel the need that their sons should be taught something, that they should be properly trained. By means of such a compulsory service, I think that we can create a greater sense of responsibility on their part, and a greater sense of self-respect. It will teach them to contribute something positive to the development of the country in whose prosperity they would also like to participate, and ought to participate.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the hon. the Minister to-day referred to a pilot scheme. I want to welcome that idea very heartily. I think there is a real need on the part of our people, White as well as non-White&#x2014;and I am really referring to the Coloured population&#x2014;whom it is difficult to fit into any industry. I hope that this pilot scheme will also in time be used for the benefit of our unskilled Coloured workers in so far as they find it difficult to find work.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the old Special Service Battalion of the 1930&#x2019;s. That did a great deal for our White youths. At that time there was a great scarcity of work and those battalions did much for our White boys, many of whom to-day have responsible positions in various branches of the Public Service and in industry. It was an institution of a disciplinary nature which at the same time prepared these boys to assume responsibilities later on. Where I am pleading to-day for a form of compulsory service for our Coloured population, particularly for the young Coloured boy who leaves school at an early age and does not fit in anywhere, I hope that something will be done in that direction and that that training will also have a strong disciplinary character so that these people will be disciplined and taught a sense of responsibility so that they can take their place in life amongst their own people.</p>

<p>The next point I should like to raise in regard to this whole matter is the application of the Unemployment Insurance Act on the platteland. In principle I have no objection to that Act. I think it is a measure which serves a very good purpose and complies with a great need. But in view of the fact that on the platteland we do not yet have proper labour bureaux and opportunities for employment, and where we have to deal with so many unskilled people, I am wondering whether we are not ahead of the times in the application of the Unemployment Insurance Act on the platteland, particularly in regard to unskilled labour. There is really a more urgent need to put these people in employment and to teach them to work than to insure them against unemployment, because there is a tremendous amount of work <span class="col_7355-7356" refersTo="page_1011"/>to be done. We have a chronic labour shortage to-day. We are trying to reduce the numbers of Bantu in this area and eventually to remove them, and the problem now is how to employ the Coloureds. The application of the Unemployment Insurance Act in small places is really a problem. The Coloured says it means nothing to him; it is just money which the employer or the State takes from him and he is not really interested in it. Moreover, he does not like to bind himself to a specific employer. He wants to work for the local shopkeeper today and tomorrow perhaps for the builder. If the pressing season is there, he wants to work on the farm&#x2014;he and his family&#x2014;in order to eat nice grapes for a change. When it is the rock lobster season he wants to work on the sea for a few months because he earns more money that way, etc. That lays a heavy administrative burden on the employer, whereas it really means nothing to the unskilled worker. He is a migrant worker, who likes to work where there are many people, where he is taken to and fro by lorry and where his day is as short as possible. I want to ask the Minister to consider&#x2014;and I do so on behalf of people who have made representations to me on various occasions&#x2014;whether this matter should not be reconsidered. There is no objection to unemployment insurance for the man who has a permanent job and who appreciates the wages he earns, but it is really a problem where we are faced with the question of employing the unskilled Coloured on the platteland. Ought he to be included under the Unemployment Insurance Act? I hope the Minister will devote attention to this matter and that a solution will be found. I also want to express the hope that, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, in the foreseeable future there will be an appreciable expansion of the labour bureaux with a view to the effective employment of the available Coloured labour.</p>

<p>Sir, I was very surprised at the attitude the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) adopted towards this question of the manpower shortage. Everybody in the country agrees there is this shortage. He said the way to combat this would be just to go slow. As far as he was concerned industry must slow down, expansion must stop and we must cut our suit according to our cloth. I hope the hon. the Minister does not agree with that suggestion of the hon. member. Surely it is the Minister&#x2019;s job to see that industry goes at as great a tempo as possible and that we get the people that we are short of. The Minister told us that in his opinion&#x2014;of course he should know&#x2014;the position was not as bad as it was made out to be. I don&#x2019;t know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s definition of &#x201C;bad&#x201D; is. How bad must it get before it really gets bad? He also said that the barometer we could use was the building industry. He said that if we were not terribly short of manpower in the building industry it was a barometer for all other industries and professions throughout the country. I think the building industry is the worst barometer because in that industry he has given exemptions from job reservation. He is not finding the shortage in the building industry which he finds in other industries because he is supplementing the shortage in the building industry by Coloured people.</p>

<p>I say there is only one barometer and that is the expressions of opinion that are given by people throughout industry. Not one single industry should be used as a barometer. That is ridiculous. I hope the Minister will not in future use that industry as the barometer because that was the worst example he could take to prove his point.</p>

<p>I want to go on to another matter which was touched on by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). I think the time has come for us to start to assess what benefits have accrued to the Unemployment Insurance Fund since the Act was last amended.</p>

<p>I now want to read from a letter, of which the hon. the Minister probably knows because he received it some time in January. I have a copy of it here, and wish to read the following from it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is recalled that the hon. the Minister of Labour assured a deputation representing this council &#x2026;</block>

<p>(i.e. the Trade Union Council) &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">that the Act would be reviewed &#x201C;in a year or two&#x201D; in the light of the experience resulting from the application of the amendments, and this council claims that the time is now overdue for such a review. The heavy drain on the Fund, which was cited as one of the reasons why the Government decided to introduce the amendments, has, due to fuller employment among the White workers, now ceased, and as the Minister is aware, this council most emphatically rejects the unproved allegations of widespread abuse on the part of the contributors, which was also advanced as one of the principal reasons for the amendments and the undue haste with which they were effected.</block>

<p>Now. Mr. Chairman, I as well as the hon. member for Umbilo have example after example of hardships that have been caused to people who have worked their full term and through illness now find themselves in dire difficulties. I do not know how much the hon. <span class="col_7357-7358" refersTo="page_1012"/>the Minister is saving by taking away the benefits of these people. I do not believe that it was possible for him to save any large amount through the won&#x2019;t works and if the hon. the Minister has the figures he can prove that the won&#x2019;t works did not take any large amount out of the fund. Therefore I ask him now to review the position and to give those people who have been so badly affected by having to go back to work for 13 weeks after 26 weeks unemployment, a further chance. I say he must, if at all possible, bring in an amendment to this Act which will allow a further period of unemployment pay to those people who have been genuinely ill for more than six months and even after six months are not in a fit state to go back to work.</p>

<p>The Minister said a few moments ago that he was placing the elderly persons in work and that some of the people who are incapacitated are also being given work. But I know for a fact that people who have suffered from heart trouble for instance, or from kidney trouble, have been offered work which it is impossible for them to do. Because they find it impossible to do the work on account of the hard nature thereof, they have lost their benefits.</p>

<p>They unfortunately just miss the old age pension. Others again are unable to get an old age pension because during the years of work they have been paying off their homes and often just as the time arrives for them to fully own that home, they are stricken down by illness and consequently are unable to continue their payments with a result that the ownership by them of their own home is placed in jeopardy. I ask the Minister to consider these people. If necessary let him have an appeal board or a tribunal&#x2014;call it what you will&#x2014;consisting of people able to investigate the true hardship cases. Let them come and state their cases. Let them prove that they positively want to work but that they cannot do the type of work offered to them because it is unsuitable. Surely, this is not too much to ask the Minister. There are not hundreds of thousands of these people, but there are virtually only a handful of them. I told the Minister last year and I want to tell him again now that if he genuinely wants to help these people, he could find work for them to do in their homes, clerical work, for instance. Let the Minister do his best to get the large industrial and commercial firms to give these people work and let him count that as a period of employment even if the amount of money they earn thereby is far less than that which they earned before. Let him regard such casual work as a term of employment, so that after they had completed their 13 weeks they would still be entitled to get the unemployment insurance money again. But as things are at the moment, there are these poor and unfortunate people whom I feel we should help.</p>

<p>There are various diseases, as the hon. the Minister himself knows, that keep a person incapacitated, sometimes against his own will, for more than six months at a stretch. Even when he has recovered he may not yet be able to go back to work for another 13 weeks that is required. Surely they can be assisted. Is it not possible to attach a medical certificate to the usual unemployment certificate and accept that as sufficient cover for them? The Minister has had time to consider this matter. The letter I quoted from previously also states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is submitted that an opportunity should be afforded the workers of South Africa to submit evidence of the very considerable hardships imposed on contributors as a result of the amendments. To permit of this, the hon. the Minister of Labour is requested to agree to a complete review of the Act as a matter of urgency.</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to reply first to the hon. member for Rossentenville and the hon. member for Umbilo and give them some information about the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Let me first of all deal with the income and expenditure of this Fund for the last three years.</p>

<p>The income and expenditure of the Fund over the last three years have been as follows:</p>

<table>

<tr>

<td colspan="2"><p><i>Income</i></p></td>

<td><p><i>Expenditure</i> (Benefits and costs of administration)</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>1961</p></td>

<td><p>R11,217,276</p></td>

<td><p>R11,987,000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colspan="2"><p>(Estimated)</p></td>

<td><p>(Estimated)</p></td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>The net deficit for the year 1962 was R5,546,114 compared with a deficit of R5,782,214 incurred for the year 1961, a decrease of only R236,100. The reason for this small decrease is the fact that although there was an appreciable drop in the expenditure on benefits&#x2014;ordinary benefits in particular&#x2014;as from September 1962 as a result of the amendments to the Act which came into operation on 30 July 1962, the expenditure for the first eight months of 1962 was considerably higher than that for the corresponding period of 1961 due to <span class="col_7359-7360" refersTo="page_1013"/>greater unemployment during the former year. In other words the drop in expenditure from September to December 1962 was insufficient to offset to any appreciable extent the increased expenditure from January to August 1962.</p>

<p>Whilst the full effect of the amendments to the Act is not apparent from the expenditure on benefits in 1962 the position changed vastly during 1963 with a very appreciable drop in expenditure especially in the case of ordinary benefits. The year 1963 ended with a surplus of R447,000 as against deficits of R5,782,214 and R5,546,114 during 1961 and 1962 respectively.</p>

<p>The accumulated funds as at the end of 1963 amounted to approximately R120,062,000.</p>

<p>During 1963&#x2014;an amount of R9,018,234 earned on maturity and sale of investments was re-invested at rates of interest of 5 per cent, 5&#x00BE; per cent and per cent. The average rate of interest on investments during 1963 was 4.107 per cent as against 3.990 per cent for 1962 and 3,813 per cent in 1961.</p>

<p>The total amount invested with the Public Debt Commissioners as at the end of 1963 was R114,861,904&#x2014;an increase of approximately R255,000 over the previous year. The market value of investments in stocks and debentures as at the end of 1963 was R113,842,627.</p>

<p>The Unemployment Insurance Board is keeping a close watch on the income and expenditure of the fund more especially under the conditions at present prevailing which continue to reflect a position of full employment. It is felt that under circumstances such as these the fund should yield surpluses which can be used during periods of increased unemployment. That is the object of the fund. The figures for the current year will be analysed from that point of view and I can tell hon. members that the position will be reviewed by the Board in the coming recess.</p>

<p>I think it is obvious that the policy must be to keep on increasing the amount of the fund. At the same time, we must do that within reason. One never knows when we may have to face a bad period of unemployment. One never knows. The fund is there to compensate for unemployment. My duty is to see that the fund is maintained in a healthy position so as to be able to meet the eventuality of unemployment but, obviously, we must have regard to the fact whether that amount is adequate or not. That will naturally be taken into consideration.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The manner in which all the criticism which the Opposition has offered here to-day in regard to the policy of the Minister of Labour and his Department has been received, indicates a high degree of complacency. There is hardly an aspect of the work of the Minister or his Department about which either the Minister or the Deputy Minister, or both, have not said that all is well with the workers of South Africa. This complacency may arise from the attitude of the Deputy Minister, who in a recent speech at Cradock was heard to say, according to a report I have here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Political victories and the achievement of independence and economic prosperity make the Afrikaner to-day feel like an Alexander the Great, who, after conquering all within reach, sat on a hill and wept because there was nothing left to conquer.</block>

<p>I do not know whether the Minister has now joined the Deputy Minister on that hill, and also spends his time weeping because there are no fresh fields for him to conquer; but I should like to suggest to both of them that there is at least one field left for them to conquer, and that is the field of Bantu labour and the lack of advancement in so far as the earning capacity of the Bantu is concerned, and in so far as it affects the affluence of the White worker. I am not making a plea for the Bantu out of sheer love for the Bantu as such, but for what an increase in Bantu wages can achieve not only for the Bantu worker, but also for the White worker and economy of South Africa as a whole. At a time when we boast that we have a dynamic economy, as we do to-day, and Ministers say that this is the fastest-growing economy in the world, I am surprised that we do not at the same time realize that an economy which cannot readily produce the means to eliminate poverty is anything but dynamic, and certainly a Minister with a Department which does not bestir itself to eliminate poverty among the largest <span class="col_7361-7362" refersTo="page_1014"/>section of the population of the country which that Department serves, is not dynamic. Compare our position and our attitude with a country like the U.S.A., which is supposed to be the richest country in the world&#x2014;but where at present the Government, led by the President, in a campaign called &#x201C;the national war on poverty&#x201D;, is moving heaven and earth to remove poverty in a sector of their population which, by our standards, is anything but poor; because they say that a family with an income of less than 3,000 dollars a year, which in our currency is R2,200, lives on the poverty datum line! Let us look at the position of the Bantu worker here. I do not suggest that the comparison is necessarily accurate, because there are certain discrepancies which require adjustment, but broadly speaking, where in the American economy a family income of R2,200 a year is regarded as the poverty datum line, we have had repeated statements by investigators into our economy to the effect that 46 per cent of all African families in Johannesburg do not earn enough to keep them going. This is a statement made in March this year before the Conference of the Institute of Market Managers of South Africa by the General Manager of the Non-European Affairs Department of Johannesburg. He says that according to an analysis made recently, the average monthly wage was R32.24. That, contrasted with the poverty datum line in America of R2,200 a year amounts to R390 a year. I hope the Minister will give some attention to this, because if he says he mistrusts anything that comes from Johannesburg and therefore distrusts this information, there is ample evidence from other sources to show that this information is basically correct. There is, e.g., the survey made by the University of South Africa, which shows that while the average expenditure of an African household amounts to R62.69 a month, the income is only R58.79, of which R42 comes from the breadwinner and the rest from the other members of the family. And if that is not sufficient, there is the survey made periodically by the Bantu Wages and Productivity Association about which I am sure the Minister will have no complaint whatsoever, because that is not a political body. According to their report, published in January this year, the average monthly income of heads of households was now R42.5, and in 46 per cent of households there was only one breadwinner, so that it would appear that using a poverty datum line of R46 a month, a large number of families continue to live in poverty notwithstanding the substantial progress in wages made in recent years. There, again, is a reference to the survey of the University of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to put this to the Minister&#x2014;it is not sufficient to argue that until such time as the productivity of the Bantu has been raised to a certain level there can be no question of increasing his wages, for the reason that the Bantu has not been allowed to acquire the skills to earn that higher income and to make his productivity higher, and therefore he cannot take all the blame for that situation. We, the White people, boast of the fact that we have been in his country for 300 years, so that to some extent we must take some responsibility for the fact that to this day the productivity of the Bantu worker is so low that ft can be argued that there is no real reason&#x2014;economically&#x2014;to increase his earnings. And in any case the standards are not absolute. I would ask the Minister and the Deputy Minister to tell us exactly how they propose to measure the productivity of the Bantu worker before they will agree that the Government should take the initiative in increasing their wages. I do not know how it is to be done. There is a general feeling in industrial and commercial circles to-day that something on those lines must be done, and done soon. The obstacle to any general movement in that direction of increasing Bantu wages, which may be followed by the increased productivity we all desire, is the attitude of the Minister, and particularly of the Deputy Minister, and the Government; because as long as the Government refuses to give the green light, or itself refuses to regulate wages in such a way that there will automatically be a substantial increase in the earnings of the Bantu workers, for so long it cannot be expected of commerce and industry, in their competitive field, to take the initiative and themselves to raise these wages. For all these reasons I want to ask the Minister to tell the Committee, in the short time still left this afternoon, whether they intend to adhere to this attitude&#x2014;that this is a matter which cannot be dealt with by the Government or need not be dealt with, because there has already been an improvement in the wages of the Bantu.</p>

<p>No, I cannot agree with that entirely. The Government cannot divorce itself from responsibility completely. It may be mainly the employers&#x2019; responsibility, but the employer has from time to time shown his desire to concede this increase; yet it is the Government which has adopted the attitude that this cannot be done until there is conclusive evidence of an increase in productivity. It is like asking for the cart to be put before the horse. I maintain&#x2014;and there is a lot of factual information to support it&#x2014;that in essence you cannot expect the worker, who, according to the three surveys which I have cited, cannot meet his obligations to his family and himself, although he does a full day&#x2019;s work, to do more than he is equipped to do. We are simply begging the question when we say that until he increases his productivity his wages cannot be raised.</p>

<p>Unlike the hon. member for Rosettenville who pleaded with the Minister for further concessions to the unemployed under the Unemployment Insurance Fund, I would rather ask the Minister whether he cannot evolve methods by which more people can be employed, particularly the older group who are still suitable for the labour market but who find it difficult to obtain work. I think particularly of the group between 55 and 65 years, people who cannot yet qualify for the old-age pension. I also have in mind people who are not suitable for the normal labour market, people with minor physical defects but who do not qualify for a disability allowance; people who do not have the technical or academic training to do special work. Particularly as these people become older they find it very difficult to obtain work. There are opportunities to-day under sheltered employment, but those are very limited, and I think there is still a lack in that regard which should be supplemented to provide more opportunities of employment for such people. We need the services of these people. I am thinking of a case I came across to-day, a woman of middle age, unmarried, but who has had no special training. She applied for a disability allowance because she had a minor physical defect but she did not qualify for an allowance, and the Department of Social Welfare told her to apply to the local Labour Office for work, but what can that office offer her? In that regard the Department can still perhaps do more to help these people.</p>

<p>But the matter I really want to discuss is the testing centres. Since 1952 the Government has made it possible for people who have worked at a certain trade for a long time and have acquired skill in it to go to a testing centre to be tested, and if they succeed in passing the test they receive a certificate and become artisans. But now there is only one testing centre for most of this work, and that is at Olifantsfontein, and that is very inconvenient for many people. I think many more people will make use of these tests if there are more testing centres. But if a person in the Western Cape wishes to be tested, he must leave his employment for at least a week, and in most cases he is not paid during that time. His employer, who now pays him a lower salary, is not prepared to allow him to go away in order to qualify. If he qualifies as an artisan, he must of course be paid more, and many of these employers are not prepared to grant such a person a week&#x2019;s leave to go to Olifantsfontein to take the test. But what is more, the journey to Olifantsfontein in order to be tested costs him a lot of money. He is often put off by the cost and consequently does not make use of this opportunity to be tested. I think that is discriminatory against people who have worked in a trade for a long time and who have the skill but who live far away from these centres. They have to go to Olifantsfontein to be tested. I want to ask the Department whether it would cost so much to have a few more centres in central spots in the country. If we can test certain people at Olifantsfontein and others, in other trades, perhaps in this city, and others again in Durban, it would be much fairer towards people who live far away from that testing centre. I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this matter.</p>

<p>I wanted to deal with the hon. member for Boland, but he has now left the Chamber. The hon. member comes here year after year and tells this story of how the Government discriminates against the Coloured traffic officers in Cape Town through work reservation. The position in regard to this matter is the following. When the Industrial Tribunal published its recommendations, the then Minister of Labour told the City Council of Cape Town: &#x201C;Here is the report of the Industrial Tribunal. There is dissatisfaction. Now give us the solution. Make suggestions to us as to how we can divide the work of the traffic officers so that there will be satisfaction&#x201D;. And what was the attitude of the Cape Town City Council? They said: &#x201C;We want to have nothing to do with it; we shall not allow the Government to prescribe to us where we should use our traffic officers; we want everything or nothing&#x201D;, and as the result of the attitude of the liberals in the City Council of Cape Town&#x2014;and the hon. member for Boland was a member of the City Council at that time&#x2014;the hon. the Minister, after warning the City Council, eventually applied the recommendations of the Industrial Tribunal in respect of traffic officers in Cape Town.</p>
