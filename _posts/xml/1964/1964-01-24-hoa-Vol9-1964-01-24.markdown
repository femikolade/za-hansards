<li>(1) No. The report is expected during the course of the present Session of Parliament. The delay in the submission of the report is, due to the magnitude of the task.</li>

<p>I have already given my reply. The report was expected but did not come to hand, and the commissioners who are busy with it simply say that the task is of such magnitude that the report cannot be submitted earlier. Consequently I gave a quite fair reply.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I will not be able to fulfil my promise to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) to give him a full reply to his charge, but I shall try to do so if I am given a suitable opportunity at a later stage. I think he merits a reply.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with a simple resume of what I said yesterday. A legislative instrument&#x2014;call it a Parliament if you like&#x2014;can only function successfully if its various components have so much in common with one another that the things that bind them together are more important than the things that divide them. As far as we are concerned, with our different races, with our different languages, our different kinds of civilization, the differences in our levels of civilization, the things that divide are of greater importance than the things that bind. I want to discuss only one point and that is the difference in values. When we look at the rest of Africa we can see living examples of these differences in values. It is unthinkable to us that a person who was an accessory to murder, who was accused of it and who was detained for that crime could ever become Prime Minister. Similarly if an Opposition becomes too much of a nuisance it is simply unthinkable that we would put that Opposition in gaol. We cannot <span class="col_269-270" refersTo="page_0149"/>imagine, as happened in Ghana, having a Deputy Speaker who was gaoled for counterfeiting. That does not surprise us. What does surprise us is that they made him Minister of Finance! And so we could go on along the same lines. Because of, these differences the prerequisites for a multi-racial Parliament are completely absent. In such a Parliament the races would stand together to protect the group. Blood remains thicker than water and where it cannot run, it crawls, and that would also be the case here. Those facts and those circumstances doom the multi-racial Parliament of the Opposition to failure. But the country can rest assured, the people can be comforted. The Opposition will never be given the opportunity of trying this experiment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze), the Professor of Law, said yesterday at the beginning of his speech that we had no policy on this side and that we had no principles, in fact nothing. Well, most hon. members opposite, including the Prime Minister who spoke for about three hours, have been talking about our policies, so for three days they have been talking about nothing. I thank heaven that he was never my professor and that he is not my legal adviser. Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister told the House that he had the fullest confidence in his Minister of Justice; that he was a great Minister. I would point out that the hon. the Prime Minister said exactly the same thing only a year ago about Mr. Louw, and we know what happened to him.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>I give you two guesses. I do not want to discourage the hon. the Minister of Justice but he must remember and he must be warned what happened to Mr. Louw. Let me say this to the hon. the Minister of Justice: like when the Greeks bear gifts, beware of Prime Ministers who come bearing eulogies. It is very dangerous.</p>

<p>Sir, we all agree that South Africa&#x2019;s economy is extremely sound and our currency one of the strongest in the world. It is only natural that the Government will take full credit for this state of affairs. I do not blame them, for that is politics, and perhaps if we were in power we might at a pinch do the same sort of thing if we were in the same difficulty in which they are in finding anything to get credit for. But the facts of the matter are, of course, that our country is so basically sound and blessed with such great natural resources of which I will mention a few in a minute, that in spite of the stupidity, in spite of the intransigent and crass follies which have been committed by the present Government, South Africa has been able to weather the storm and the world&#x2019;s hostility and world isolation up to now. To mention but one folly&#x2014;pursuing an extremism that has antagonized the whole world. Sir, I said I would mention a few of our natural resources which have kept our economy afloat, in spite of everything and in spite of this Government. The obvious one is gold, of which we are the world&#x2019;s greatest producers. It is not only a vital world yardstick for valuing one currency in terms of another, it is not only the only means by which a country which has a deficiency in its balance of payment or its balance of trade can cover it by shipping gold (as long as the present form of world financing exists) but it is a commodity that is in short supply and therefore sold before it is mined. That is the real basis of our economic stability. But can the Government claim the credit for that? Are they responsible for our gold mines? Have they spent one sixpence or done a single thing to develop the gold mines? I merely mention this to show that my earlier remarks that the country is flourishing in spite of this Government was not merely a facile debating point.</p>

<p>Sir, I will not waste the time of the House by mentioning other natural resources which God has given us and which the present Government&#x2019;s policy cannot destroy. Our most important asset, of course, is our people. We had the early settlers first from Holland, then from France and then the 1820 British settlers. They might not have been the rich and influential people of those nations but they were people of very strong, determined and firm character, not quick to compromise. They were people who were prepared to risk hardship, disease, danger and even death if necessary in an unknown country rather than put up, if I may use a vulgar expression, with being mucked about any longer by opposing religions, politics or economies of their mother lands. In short, they were people who preferred freedom to comfort. Sir, an amalgam of such blood forming a new nation would make for a people of great determination, slow to compromise and even stubborn and intransigent at times, and also a people who would admire such qualities, particularly in their leaders, for they are great qualities in times of danger. Like the British in general and the Londoners in particular in 1940 when they stood up against the greatest military might. We saw what happened in 1899 when two small republics fought the greatest Empire that ever existed. But, Sir, those are qualities that should not be used to meet small or petty situations which do not endanger the safety of the State. May I give a simple example. Take the father of a family who is a firm, strong, decent man who is determined that his family shall follow certain conventions and lines of integrity. If he finds that they like television, which he does not&#x2014;it is not an important thing which is going to destroy the moral code of that family&#x2014;then he takes the dog for a walk and he lets them have their way. In small things he does not force his will upon them. Now the Prime Minister, realizing that these qualities are admired by the people as a whole, has decided <span class="col_271-272" refersTo="page_0150"/>to cash in on it, and he has tried to create the granite image of himself, not realizing that courageous firmness in main essential problems must not be confused with mere stupid, intolerant obstinacy in matters that do not endanger the safety of his state. Sir, we know that large numbers of tombstones are made of granite. In fact next to marble it is the most popular material for the making of tombstones. They will stand there indefinitely, for hundreds or thousands of years, never moving forward to meet the changes of a changing world, but what good do they do bar marking the grave of people now dead? Sir, let the Nationalist Party realize that the granite image of the Prime Minister might finally mark the grave of a great and fine people, the South African people; it might finally mark the grave of our White civilization.</p>

<p>Let me clear the decks straight away so that there can be no misunderstanding. We on this side stand for the main principle of not handing the political power to the Bantu or other non-Europeans. This is one thing where we agree with the Government and here we differ completely from the Progressive Party whose policy, if carried out, must eventually mean just that. But, Sir, we agree also with the Government in one other great principle and that is &#x2018;&#x2018;South Africa First&#x201D;. But we do not agree with South Africa alone and isolated in the world, unless the world wants to force the issue over the first principle and force us to hand over power to the Bantu or the non-Europeans. If that becomes the issue then if necessary we must fight; for it is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees. Because of this Government&#x2019;s intransigence and moronic policies over, non-essentials and petty matters that do not endanger our Western civilization but which by the Government&#x2019;s insistence on them must eventually bring that very White Western civilization into jeopardy, we say that this House cannot have confidence in the present Government.</p>

<p>Having said where we agree, let me enlarge on a few of the many obvious points on which we entirely repudiate the policies of the Government. They maintain that the non-European cannot be economically integrated in the Republic. We say that that is the case to-day. They want to put the clock back and have a White economy, a Coloured economy, an Indian economy and a Bantu economy. They go further and say that this is not a multi-racial state. Well, that has been touched on before and I do not want to be guilty of repetition. I think the best reply to that was given last year by the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) who, when he was challenged across the floor of the House, said &#x201C;Go into the streets and see if this is a multi-racial state or not&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s side maintain that the country must be divided into a White state, a Coloured state (within a White state) and Bantustans, with all the appalling dangers which such a policy must bring in its train. I do not want to enlarge upon this because it has been dealt with before, but it could mean that in future we might have a number of hostile Cubas on our borders. We see how practically every small or large ex-colonial Black state has gone or is going communist. Zanzibar is the latest and we see what has happened in Ghana; we see what has happened in Tanganyika a short while ago, and Uganda is practically going the same way. Now, Sir, to start with Bantustans will be merely to create colonies; they cannot be anything else until they get sovereign independence. In other words, South Africa is going to be in exactly the same position as Britain was 100 years ago when she was surrounded by a galaxy of colonies, some self-governing and some with Crown colony government. The Government is starting to create colonies at a time when the word &#x201C;Colonialism&#x201D; has become an international swearword. These colonies are being created with the knowledge that great powers like France and Britain and lesser powers like Belgium and Holland have not been able to hold their colonies in the face of world opinion. Yet our Government, with childish insistence, believes in the impossible. How can anyone with a soup&#x00E7;on of intelligence still have confidence in this Government? They say that the non-European shall have no representation in the Central Parliament. We say that whilst maintaining the political power in the hands of the Whites, the majority of the population must have some representation in the highest court of the land so that their voice can be heard and so that they can ventilate their grievances. That would be a safety valve. It would be not only in the interests of our non-Europeans but in the interests of the White ruler, because the White ruler should not live in a vacuum; he should know what is going on in the back of the minds of the majority of the people in this country. It is essential for the White ruler to know how those people are thinking.</p>

<p>Sir, I have spoken about the obstinate and granitelike behaviour of the Government over matters that do not endanger our Western civilization, and I will give just three examples to show what I mean. For instance, a White man and a Bantu are involved in a car accident and they are both bleeding to death in the street and a White ambulance or a Black ambulance comes along. It is essential to get those people to hospital as soon as possible, otherwise they will bleed to death. Is it going to endanger the State if that Black ambulance or that White ambulance takes both those people to their respective wards in the hospital to save their lives? Is that going to endanger our State? That is what I mean by petty apartheid. Sir, how can I endanger the State by buying a stamp standing next to a Coloured man, when my wife is in the kitchen standing next to a Coloured maid helping her to cook the dinner? Will the Prime Minister tell me how the safety of South Africa is jeopardized by my sitting in the back seat of a taxi which is being driven <span class="col_273-274" refersTo="page_0151"/>by a Coloured man? I do not want to touch on that because it was very eloquently put yesterday by the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). But the amusing thing is this: If that same Coloured man loses his job through this policy of the Government and he becomes my private chauffeur, I do not have to sit in the back seat, I can sit in the front seat next to him. That does not endanger the safety of the State, but if I sit on the back seat in a taxi driven by a Coloured man then I endanger the safety of the State. Have you ever heard of anything so childish?</p>

<p>I could give hundreds of examples of what I mean by petty apartheid which hurts the pride, the feeling and the ego of the non-Europeans and makes the world our enemies. But what does it avail anybody to talk to obstinate closed minds, minds as dead as granite? Sir, the only way such minds can be opened is by this House, by hon. gentlemen opposite having the courage and the people outside having the courage to show that they have no confidence in the present Government.</p>

<p>Then we have the example of immigration, which has been dealt with fully by my Leader and referred to in detail by others. I do riot want to go into any details therefore I merely draw attention to it because I want to put forward an argument on that point. Tremendous publicity is being given to the number of immigrants coming to South Africa, and for that we congratulate the Government. We thank heaven that they are coming here. But has the Government ever thought of the 15 wasted years when we could have got the best skilled people from Europe? Had the United Party&#x2019;s scheme been kept in operation over the last 15 years we would have had over 1,000,000 immigrants in this country. I think my hon. Leader was understating the position when he mentioned 1,000,000. I think we would have had very much more than 1,000,000 if the United Party&#x2019;s immigration scheme had been kept going. Sir, let me tell you why. In 1948, after Britain had been bled white economically by war, and unemployment was rising rapidly; Germany was down and out; France, Belgium and Holland were also in the throes of a depression. Europe was expecting the Russians to march to the Channel or even to the Atlantic seaboard. I was in the Government at that time and I saw the secret files. That was the considered opinion of the greatest military experts in the world. They said that at any time towards the end of 1947 dr the beginning of 1948 the Russians could march right through Europe. The result was that millions from the West wanted to seek work and a new life in other countries. Millions did go to Canada; many millions went to Australia and millions went to other parts of the world, and during those 15 years South Africa got no immigrants through the stupidity of this Government. Sir, what is the position now? With the huge numbers who did go, the pressure in Europe was relieved so far as unemployment was concerned. Then a wave of prosperity struck Britain, which made for full employment. Britain also became a welfare state, in which every man knew that even if he was unemployed, his wife would not starve, he would have a roof over his head and his children would receive education. Germany got right back on her feet, so much so that within the last two months Germany has been saying that she is short of skilled workers, and to-day she is in the market bidding for skilled manpower against other countries. That is the position in Germany to-day whose unemployeds could be counted in millions in 1948. Sir, France has also prospered, and the same can be said of many other European countries. Now after 15 years which the locusts have eaten and there is a shortage of skilled manpower in Europe, this Government starts to do what they deliberately broke down in 1948. They are now closing the door after the horse has fled. Sir, how can any sensible person, how can anybody other than a bird-brain (and, Mr. Speaker, you can see who I am looking at), have confidence in this Government when it has such a record? It is obvious that if this country is going to continue to develop we must use our manpower to its full capacity. Let us start with our Coloured people. They are educated and highly skilled, splendid workers and artisans, but job reservation prevents their skill being used in many capacities, apart from the fact that this policy makes our names smell in the nostrils of the world and makes the Coloured man hate us if we go on frustrating him in this way. Sir, I was asked last session by some very intelligent young men, all of whom were strong supporters of the Government, &#x201C;What can we do to improve the deteriorating race relations in South Africa?&#x201D; I said to them, &#x201C;You must make a gesture to the feelings of the non-Europeans; start with the Coloureds. They want to be our friends. They have shown themselves to be true South African patriots in every single war and every war they fight mainly in the interests of the White man.&#x201D; The reply I got in all sincerity from these intelligent young men was this: &#x201C;What more can we do? Look at the millions the Government is spending on housing and on education.&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;It is true, the Government is doing much in the line of education for the Coloured man, but what is the use of raising a man&#x2019;s educational standard if when he has a trained brain he has in many cases to use that brain as an office boy or as an unskilled worker?&#x201D; That is much more dangerous because you train that man up to a certain standard of education and then you leave him in the air with nothing to do. It is then that he becomes an agitator. Nothing that you can give the Coloured man materially&#x2014;I am talking about the material benefits that you can give him&#x2014;can soothe that hurt to his feelings which is being done every day by this Government; the touching of his ego; the touching of his personal pride which legislation passed at session after session keeps rubbing in. I was against General Hertzog&#x2019;s policy <span class="col_275-276" refersTo="page_0152"/>in 1939 of remaining neutral, but I heard his speech here and it impressed me very greatly. On 4 September 1939 General Hertzog said: &#x201C;This war is not being caused by Hitler; this war is being caused by Versailles and the humility which has been heaped on the German people.&#x201D; Then he added: &#x201C;I have been under a harrow; I know what humiliation means and I have seen what humiliation can do to a man and to a people.&#x201D; I have never forgotten those words. How must the decent Coloured man feel when he sees me walking into the post office followed by my coloured dog, yet the Coloured chauffeur cannot follow me carrying a parcel! My own servant cannot follow me into the post office but my dog can! [Interjections.] Hon. members can jeer; but that is a fact. Let me give an example of what I mean by humiliation. In 1899 the British Government, unjustly, decided to eliminate two small republics for political reasons. They took possession of the country; they humiliated the people by forcing them to admit defeat; by forcing on them a foreign flag; by forcing on them a foreign Government. Then the British people in their wisdom chucked that Government out for 20 years and a new Government came in. That Government gave millions to rehabilitate those two republics; they gave them self-government; they gave them sovereign independence; they made it possible for three Boer generals to govern the whole of the Union and two old British colonies. They did all they could to placate the feelings of those people who had been humiliated and had been beaten in that war. Now, after 60 years, the descendants of some of those people are still, in some cases, fighting that old war. Why? Because their forebears were humiliated half a century ago. Do you think that anything we do to placate the Coloured man in years to come will make him forget what is happening today? Does anyone with a knowledge of human psychology and the reaction of people to a sense of grievance expect that any material thing that you can give the Coloureds will make up for that sense of wrong, frustration and resentment and humiliation? Can anyone have confidence in the Government who cannot see this and who continues creating this grievance? The situation is, as I say, that we must accept the Coloured man as part of Western civilization, and that is the policy of the United Party. That does not mean social integration; that does not mean handing over political power. I ask again: Can anyone have confidence in the Government which has not got the courage and the guts to admit it is wrong; a Government who were forced by economic circumstances to change its immigration policy?</p>

<p>Finally, the present policy of the Government in respect of the White small farmers has been dealt with. I shall only deal with it in passing because I want to develop an argument. That type of small farmer is the backbone and the stabilizing factor in any country in the world. Year by year the small landowner is leaving the countryside in increasing numbers. The hon. the Deputy Minister, so my Leader said, told us that 2,400 were leaving per year, and they are being replaced by the large landowner who is unable to live on all the farms he possesses. So what does he do? He gets Coloureds and Bantu to work those farms for him. In other words, the countryside is becoming less White day by day and more Coloured day by day. Sir, world history shows us that the human stock of the countryside has always fed the industrial cities with new sound blood and become a stabilizing factor. If that is destroyed that nation&#x2019;s greatness is weakened. I am sure the hon. member for Cradock will agree with what I am about to say.</p>

On several occasions in this House I have explained the position absolutely.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to react to the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl). It was very clear that he himself did not have much faith in his arguments. In the second place he is a former Minister of Native Affairs and you can therefore say, Sir, that he and I belong to the same broederbond! Nor do I wish to react to the attacks that were made on our general policy. I think the replies which hon. members on this side of the House have given have been so devastating that it will not be fair of me to dwell on them. I merely want to avail myself of the opportunity to clear up a few misconceptions and misrepresentations which have become evident during the debate.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to deal for a moment with the election in the Transkei because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to it. I want to say at once that I am surprised that the Opposition has not uttered one word of appreciation of the way in which that election went off. When we compare that election with elections in other parts of Africa and even in other parts of the world, I really <span class="col_277-278" refersTo="page_0153"/>think South Africa has reason to-day to be proud of the way that election went off in the Transkei and also to be proud of the Bantu in the Transkei for the way in which they behaved themselves. But we have not had a word of appreciation of that from that side of the House. On the contrary, the old pattern was followed of not only reviling the National Party but even of belittling the Bantu of the Transkei still further. I wish to refer to the attitude of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). I want to say this at once&#x2014;and I say this without any fear of contradiction&#x2014;that the way the election went off in the Transkei has been a victory for the policy of the National Party. I challenge any member to compare that election with any election in any African state and in many parts of the Near East and even the East. There is no comparison. Mr. Speaker, do you remember the predictions we had when the Transkei legislation was introduced? We had a number of prophets of doom who predicted the most ghastly things. It is really interesting to read those speeches again to-day. What has happened to those prophets of doom? I think they have been put to shame. I say the way that election went off was a victory to the National Party. Sir, I want to ask you to think with what powers we had to contend there. In the first place we had organized attacks on the part of the larger section of the English-language Press. Those attacks were often of a nature that descended to the lowest moral level imaginable in South Africa. I am sorry that I have to say that about the English-language Press but that is the position. I really think that if there is one section of the Press which ought to hang its head in shame because of the predictions it made and the way in which it misjudged the whole situation, it is the largest section of the English-language Press. But we did not find that on the part of the Press alone. We also had to contend with other forces. We had organized attacks by communist elements. They hired people to go to the Transkei, people who infiltrated everywhere. We had organized attacks by liberal elements who did not hesitate to hire people to go there or to go there themselves. We had attacks by the Progressive Party which followed the same methods. We had attacks by certain persons who did not hesitate to bring the National Party and the policy of the Government in disfavour. We had attacks by certain ecclesiasts who, instead of teaching the Gospel, taught politics to the Bantu of the Transkei. I am not saying all of them, but some. We had attacks by certain traders. Now that the election is over, Sir, you will be surprised to know how many Bantu tell me that they were bribed to carry on with the fight. Not all the traders. In spite of that everything went off so well that we can only be thankful. I say these things because I have always adopted the standpoint that if a decent and honest White man was really sincere in acting decently and honestly towards the Bantu of South Africa, he should have showed that in a practical way in the Transkei, namely, by not meddling in the affairs of the Bantu of the Transkei. That was a golden opportunity to every White man to prove that he wanted to leave the Bantu of the Transkei to themselves to decide on their own affairs as far as the election was concerned. In spite of this we had those elements which did not hesitate to conduct an unholy agitation campaign.</p>

<p>Let me start with the registration. That was not an easy task. Just think of the campaign that was conducted particularly by the Press. I can assure the House that there were elements who exerted their utmost powers to dissuade the Bantu from registering, to stay away from the registration offices, so much so that certain newspapers predicted that registration would be negligible&#x2014;the smallest percentage we have ever had in South Africa. That was what certain people and certain newspapers predicted. Fortunately, however, the Bantu of the Transkei did not pay any attention to that.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I shall be pleased if the hon. member will just give me a chance of stating my case. I say that in spite of these facts we found that people flocked to the offices to have themselves registered. Subsequently when the results were made known it was suggested that the people did not know they had to register. These false rumours were spread not only in South Africa but throughout the whole world. Let me just give the figures in connection with the registration. There are altogether 650,000 registerable people in the Transkei. Mr. Speaker, do you know how many of these registered? Six hundred and thirty thousand or 97 per cent. To have seen the Transkei during that registration campaign was an eye-opener to more than one. At many places over 1,000 people stood in a queue. There was an enthusiasm hitherto unknown even in White constituencies. There was not less enthusiasm outside the Transkei. It has been estimated, and very thoroughly estimated, that there are approximately 500,000 voters outside the Transkei. We know they are spread throughout the country. Of those 500,000 altogether 250,000 registered, or 50 per cent. I can assure the House that had a 100 per cent intensive registration campaign been conducted that percentage would have been much higher. The average number who registered outside and inside the Transkei was a little over 74 per cent. That really does the people credit.</p>

<p>Let me deal for a moment with the election campaign. There too we had this propaganda. It was immediately stated that there would be no candidates; it was said that people would not stand as candidates because they did not know what remuneration they would get, etc., etc. In other words, the people were encouraged on a large scale not to make themselves available. There is something else. It also appeared prominently in the newspapers <span class="col_279-280" refersTo="page_0154"/>that Proclamation No. 400 was still hanging over the heads of the people and that it would not be possible for them to hold meetings. That was something which the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) also said. The result was that 180 persons offered themselves as candidates in those nine constituencies. Those people held meetings. I left Proclamation 400 at the request of the Bantu themselves. I have so often said in this House that it would not interfere at all with meetings because Proclamation 400 was intended, as I have so often said, for certain people like Patrick Duncan and others and their stooges, people who were creating mischief in Pondoland and other places. During that short period of the election, as I said to-day, 899 meetings were held altogether in the Transkei and a large number in Cape Town and Johannesburg and in practically all the big cities in the country. But we actually had the spectacle of hon. members getting up in this House and trying to make the world believe that Proclamation 400 was the reason why there was no freedom in the Transkei. Is that fair and reasonable towards South Africa? We always want to know why the world outside is besmirching South Africa the way it does. The reason is this type of untruth that is sent into the world. The people were at liberty to print their pamphlets and to distribute them as they liked and they did so. How did this election go off? It went off so orderly and smoothly that there was not a single incident at any place. Nowhere did anybody even get a black eye.</p>

They wondered whether that would be possible in view of what other states in Africa had done where the elections were held over a period of a week and longer. But it was a question of honour with South Africa; we wanted to show the world that we could hold this election in one day like a modern election. And that was done, Mr. Speaker, and it does South Africa credit. What is more, the election was conducted according to modern standards and methods. It was not necessary for us to have symbols.</p>

<p>There the Bantu again showed that he could behave in a way which really redounded to the credit of South Africa. During the whole of the election we did not have a single incident of any nature whatsoever either inside or outside the Transkei. What is more, you found a happy and cheerful nation round the polling booths. They joked; they sang, etc. There was no unruliness or fighting as in the other parts of Africa.</p>

<p>The United Party then revelled in one thing. They said there would be a large number of spoilt ballot papers. The newspapers also predicted that.</p>

<p>The newspapers. The one thing which absolutely surprised us was the fact that the percentage of spoilt papers was negligible. We have every reason therefore to be very proud and grateful for that as well. Let us look at the number of votes that were cast. In the Transkei 478,000 votes were cast or 77.7 per cent. They voted more dutifully than the United Party supporters, Mr. Speaker. Outside the Transkei 51.2 per cent votes were cast and in some place the voting was 100 per cent. Had it not been for the difficulty employers experienced and the difficulty of working hours, etc., this percentage would have been much higher.</p>

<from><span class="col_281-282" refersTo="page_0155"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Here we have proof therefore that the Bantu of the Transkei and those outside the Transkei have not only accepted the policy of the National Party but have accepted it with enthusiasm. The important thing is that they have accepted with enthusiasm the idea of a united Transkei and that they are not prepared to divide it into two: they want to maintain that basis. That was one of the commendable things that became evident from that election.</p>

<p>Let me now deal with the election of the Chief Minister. In this case too the election went off equally well and orderly in spite of the real attempt on the part of the English-language Press to sow dissension among the Xhosa of the Transkei, something in which they perhaps succeeded in the case of certain people. In this case too the position was that everything went off smoothly. Here too certain elements did not hesitate to say who should be elected as Chief Minister. In this connection I again refer to certain ecclesiasts; I refer again to certain traders; I refer again to the reprehensible role played by certain sections of the Press; I refer again to certain people who did not hesitate to take an active part in it. I am going to mention one name&#x2014;I mention the name of the big friend of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories, Mr. White. The afternoon when the results as to who was Chief Minister came out Mr. White nearly fainted; I believe his wife did faint. They had to take her home. That shows you, Sir, what an important part those people played in the election. One of the untruths that was sent into the world, particularly by the Press, was that the Transkei had now accepted the principle of multi-racialism. I wish I had had the time to deal with this at length but I trust I shall get the opportunity to do so at a later stage. The Transkei has not accepted the policy of multi-racialism. On the contrary 90 per cent or more of the people in the Transkei are against the policy of multi-racialism. I admit that Paramount Chief Victor Poto said that he was in favour of multi-racialism and he is a person for whom I have a very high regard; I know him very well. But when he was asked at meetings what he meant by multi-racialism his reply was: By that I do not mean at all that Whites should be allowed to sit in the Parliament of the Transkei; I do not mean at all that the Whites should have the right to acquire land in the Transkei; all I mean by that is that they should not be chased out of the Transkei. The other candidates gave the same reply. I know of candidates who declared openly that they were in favour of multi-racialism but when they came to the meetings and the voters asked them what they meant by multi-racialism they said, oh no, by multi-racialism they meant that the Bantu must ultimately possess the whole of the Transkei. These things were written down by people of my Department who were concerned in those matters. No clear picture was given of the real position. I trust, however, that an opportunity will present itself at a later stage for me to deal with this point at greater length and to produce the evidence. I can state today that the majority of the Bantu of the Transkei, inside and outside the Transkei, have accepted the policy of apartheid of the National Party with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I just want to deal with another matter for a moment. Reference has been made to the increase in the number of Bantu in the White areas and it has been said that that number was nearly 1,000,000.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has already repeatedly pointed out that we continually warned that that would go on. I also want to refer hon. members to my own speeches in which I said every year that this flow would continue and that it would increase at times. It is only when the Bantu area has been properly developed that you can expect a reversal of the flow. Surely what hon. members have raised is nothing new. It is a miracle that over the period of ten years, a greater number of Bantu did not enter the White areas than did enter. Had it not been for the National Party with its control measures I want to know what South Africa would have looked like to-day. Had the National Party not come into power you would have had a second Zanzibar in South Africa because the policy of the United Party is nothing but a Zanzibar policy. I am firmly convinced of it when I say that. I wish I had had the time to go into detail but just take the percentage that entered between 1936 and 1946. It was 25.5 per cent and there is an annual growth of 2.4 per cent. In spite of this growth the increase from 1951 to 1960 was only 23.5 per cent. Then it must be borne in mind that there had been tremendous development in every sphere. Just think of the development in the mineral sphere, think of the gold fields in the Free State, think of the industrial development that has taken place over those ten years. All that development demands a terrific labour force. It was a miracle that we managed to put a stop to the uncontrolled flow of Bantu to South Africa. We put a stop to it. And the tide has already started to turn. The year before last 100,000 Bantu had already left the White areas. Do you know, Sir, that we have sent back a considerable number of foreign Bantu over the past two years, Bantu who have not returned to South Africa? Just think of the 2,000 Rhodesian Bantu whom I removed from the vicinity of Port Elizabeth. Approximately 20,000 foreign Bantu have passed through our border posts, Bantu who will not return to South Africa. As far as this is concerned there are many bodies who co-operate with us. Only last week I received a letter from a big sugar mill in Natal which for years has seen its way clear to repatriate <span class="col_283-284" refersTo="page_0156"/>hundreds of foreign Bantu. But last week they informed me that they had repatriated all their foreign Bantu employees. Bantu are daily returning to their own areas, not to be destitute there. They earn just as much if not more there than they did here. I want to give a few examples. You have the Mdontzani project near East London where 60,000 have been resettled in the Bantu area. We are busy with that; we shall shortly start in Pieters-burg; there are 180,000 at Durban who will shortly be settled in the Bantu area; Dalmeny 75,000; Pietermaritzburg 38,000; Rustenburg 9,000; Potgietersrust 6,000 (already settled); Newcastle over 12,000; Pretoria over 50,000. Just think of these few projects, and more are in the process of development. That will mean that within the following few years over 550,000 Bantu, from the White areas, will be settled in their own areas. And not only do the Bantu accept this, but they accept it enthusiastically. I wish hon. members would sometimes come and see what is happening.</p>

<p>However, I want to hurry on to another point, and that is the accusation which the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), in a typically United Party fashion, made when he said we had negotiated with the leaders in the Transkei to give them sections of the Republic.</p>

<p>Very well, discussions. He is not the only one to make such allegations. I am sorry the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) is not here, but I visited Wepener recently and I was told there that the hon. member held a meeting there and that he assured the people that it was merely a question of time before Wepener and that entire so-called conquered area would be transferred to Basutoland. Those allegations were made to such an extent there that the people asked me whether they could continue building houses, whether they should not put a stop to their building projects. Is it fair towards South Africa to spread these untruths? I know the United Party is bankrupt. I know it is a party which is a pastmaster at raising bogies and the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) is an expert in that field. As far as that is concerned he has no equal in the world. But I do not think it is fair towards South Africa. I want to assure the hon. member that there have never been discussions with the leaders of the Transkei in that connection. Where does he get that idea from? He has sucked it out of his thumb; it is a figment of his own imagination. I gave the assurance in this House that Wepener and Ficksburg and those places would never be handed over to Basutoland. The hon. member for Yeoville put that question to me in this House a few years ago and I assured him that that would not happen. Why do they spread such stories? [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>We have just listened to a remarkable speech. The hon. Minister of Bantu Administration spent 20 minutes of his 30 minutes not defending the Government against attacks on the complete inflexibility of the policy of apartheid, but telling us how well the election went in the Transkei, and expressing surprise that we did not thank him and apparently the Government for the smooth and orderly way in which the election went there. Only towards the end did he try to meet some of our attacks on his policy. Mr. Speaker, we did not congratulate him on the smooth progress of the election in the Transkei because we were not very surprised. After all if you look at the whole of Africa, you find that the first elections in Ghana, in Nigeria, in Kenya, Northern Rhodesia, all passed very smoothly under the aegis of the departing imperial powers. What is more, in most of those countries they did not even need a Proclamation 400 to make certain that everything went orderly. So we really were not surprised at all. I do not know why the hon. Minister apparently was surprised that everything went so well. The figures that he has given us to show that apartheid has not been the total failure that we submit it has been, I will deal with later in my speech. As I said, his speech was a remarkable speech.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the other side claim that thanks to this Government South Africa is experiencing a remarkable economic growth and expansion. What are the facts? The facts are of course that for the past two years South Africa&#x2019;s gross national production has increased in 1961-2 by 5 per cent and 1962-3 by 7&#x00BD; per cent. This must be put in its proper context. This followed on a period of very slow economic growth, virtual stagnation, as hon. members themselves now admit. But by what test can this growth be regarded as remarkable? It is only remarkable by comparing it with the Congo, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) suggested yesterday. Surely your test must be: Is it remarkable in relation to South Africa&#x2019;s potential growth? What is that potential growth? I would like to make some suggestions and then put some questions to hon. Ministers on the other side.</p>

<p>In the first place this growth during the last few years incidentally is the fastest growth (following on a period of stagnation) that we yet have had under this Government, and if we compare that growth with other countries, we find that that was the average rate of growth of the Common Market countries ever since the establishment of the Common Market. Does the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs or his deputy for one moment deny the fact that South Africa has a potential growth at least as great as the Common Market countries? I will give the reasons why that is so, if perhaps they differ. In the first place our natural resources are infinitely greater than those of any Common Market country. I think the hon. Minister will agree to that. Secondly, our rate of population <span class="col_285-286" refersTo="page_0157"/>growth, and therefore the increase in our labour force, is twice as fast as that of any Common Market country. Do hon. members agree to that? The third essential for that economic growth is our rate of saving. If you look at our rate of saving it is on a par with most Common Market countries; therefore our rate of investment should be as fast at least as in Common Market countries. If the hon. Minister differs from me, I hope he will tell me. If that is so, it is remarkable that if you look over the whole period that this Government has been in power, as my Leader pointed out a couple of days ago, our rate of economic growth has only been half of that of the Common Market countries. Surely that is the test. Surely that shows that under better government we would have had a much faster rate of economic growth. Why have we not grown to the maximum of our potential? My hon. Leader mentioned some of the reasons, and I want briefly to mention them again. In the first place it is because we have a Government that apparently does not comprehend what the educational requirements are of a modern industrial society in the twentieth century. I will not go into all the arguments again. My Leader gave those reasons. But if some admission on the part of the Government is still required for that we had it in that remarkable speech of the Minister of Education when he accused the youth of South Africa of being cultural paupers. What does your cultural level depend on? Surely it depends on the educational system of the country. This Government has been in power for 15 years and now they talk of the youth of our country as cultural paupers. Imagine, as my hon. Leader pointed out further, what a different country it would be if we had taken the 1,000,000 immigrants which did not come in as a result of this Government&#x2019;s policy during the past few years. Can anybody imagine what an infinitely richer country ours would have been, how much greater our wealth would have been, what new industries we would have had, and on what bigger scale our industries would have operated, and how much bigger the market would have been for our farmers? It would not then have been necessary to tell the farmers that they must leave the land and depopulate the platteland as far as the Whites are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the third is the unreal policies of this Government which are frightening away capital from South Africa. The remarkable thing is that even under the so-called boom conditions existing at the moment, private capital is still leaving the country. It is one of the most remarkable phenomena that private capital is flowing back. If the world had confidence in South Africa that would not be the case. If you look at the statistics, you will find that private capital is still flowing out of this country. Then of course there are a dozen other reasons. If this Government is really serious about separate development, then of course they should have a magnum programme of training the non-Whites and especially the Bantu in the skills that the modern world requires, in the skills that modern industrial society requires. How else are they going to be self-supporting in their homelands if they have not got the elementary skills. The Government has made a start on that, but it is so puny that by and large you cannot even start a single industry to-day based purely on Bantu technologists and Bantu skilled workers. In fact far from encouraging education among the Bantu, the Government has put restrictions in their way of obtaining skills, such as job reservation. It is for all these reasons that we are not growing up to the maximum of our potential, and it is because of this that we see that after two years of fairly rapid growth, there are already signs that we are going to run into wage inflation because of the shortage of skilled labour, and Ministers on the other side had to issue warnings already that steps will have to be taken to counteract that, because we are running out of a sufficient number of skilled workers, technologists and administrators, after two years of a rate of growth which is regarded as normal in Western Europe. Of course hon. members on the other side always say that we have to make economic sacrifices for apartheid, and this is one of the economic sacrifices we have to make, a slowing down of our rate of growth. They say that only in that way can we keep South Africa White.</p>

<p>Let us see in what way this slowing down in the rate of growth has assisted to keep this country White ever since the present Government has been in power. The hon. Minister of Bantu Administration said that if there had not been this slowing down, our cities would have been much blacker. But we had the answer yesterday from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout: Under a sensible Government we would have had 1,000,000 extra White people in this country to-day and our proportions of White to Black would have been far better than they are to-day. Let us see what in fact has happened despite this slowing down in the rate of growth. If we look at the population census figures we find that between 1951 and 1960 the urban population as far as Bantu are concerned increased by 45 per cent, Coloureds by 41 per cent, Indians by 39.5 per cent, and Whites by 23.6 per cent. That is what has happened in our cities. Have these economic sacrifices we have made made our cities any whiter? They get blacker and browner and yellower in the course of years and the percentage of our White people in the cities has been dropping constantly over this whole period. Of course in the days when hon. members opposite were in opposition they called this integration. They said that this influx of Bantu to the towns was integration and that it would lead to the downfall of the White man. Now the Prime Minister comes along and says: Of course this is not integration any more (as he said the other day). I cannot for the life of me see why it is not integration any more. Be <span class="col_287-288" refersTo="page_0158"/>cause if you look at it objectively it is exactly the same economic process that went on before they came into power&#x2014;the drawing of Natives to the cities is still going on. The only difference is that we have had an accumulation of what people called &#x201C;petty apartheid&#x201D; these days&#x2014;the fact that when Natives want to go to catch a train, they must enter through one door and the White people through another door, and then they mingle on the platform. How that makes our cities more White I cannot really see. As I say, the only difference has been an accumulation of petty grievances. Of course these petty grievances do not make the Natives less permanent in the cities; it does not reduce their numbers in any way; these grievances only make them more discontented. If it was integration before this Government came into power it is still integration to-day, with this difference that you are integrating a population that is far more discontented than it has ever been before. In any event, if the Prime Minister now says that it is not integration any more, thanks to the legislation that has been passed restricting the economic and other activities of the Bantu in the cities, then why does he want to go on with his border development scheme? Why does he want to go on talking about depressing the curve&#x2014;I have never quite understood what this curve meant. Surely if it is not integration and they have found a solution, then everything is in order and our cities do not get blacker any more and there is no need to spend vast sums of money on the development of new industrial areas. In fact of course our Bantu population has not only become much greater than it ever was, but it has also become more permanent than it has ever been before. What is the proof of that? That in the same census years that I have quoted, the flow of Native women to the cities has been almost on a par with that of Native men. That surely is a sign of them becoming a more permanent population. In any event if we want further scientific proof I can only quote from a semi-Government publication, the C.S.I.R., its 1961 Annual Report which contains a report of the National Institute for Personal Research in respect of the Witwaters-rand. What do they say?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some interesting facts have emerged concerning characteristics of the Black industrial labour force, as one finds it in and around Johannesburg. Using three criteria for urbanization, viz.: Continuous residence in an urban area for not less than five years, residence of wife and family in the urban area, and not possessing land rights in a rural area, it was found that approximately half of a large sample of over 1,000 cases could be looked upon as urbanized. Of those not fully urbanized, less than one-fifth still followed a migrant pattern.</block>

<block name="quote">The commonly held view that the Bantu worker drifts from job to job and frequently interrupts his work periods with prolonged visits to rural areas, is not borne out by these investigations. The survey showed that 70 per cent of the group could be looked upon as industrialized men who had never reverted to rural work.</block>

<p>Is any further proof really necessary that far from our cities becoming whiter, thanks to the apartheid policy, they in fact become blacker and that the permanent Native population is increasing? Of course we have already learned in this House how the hon. the Prime Minister if facts do not suit the Prime Minister&#x2019;s case, he simply changes the facts. It is as simple as all that. Ordinary mortals have a harder task and must try to adapt their theories to the facts. In the end of course, I submit, apartheid will only make sense if the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government declare that from now on &#x201C;black is white&#x201D;, and that they are establishing a White state in South Africa by way of apartheid.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the most interesting thing is that whilst the Government is ostensibly still fighting the apartheid battle in the cities, it has apparently given up the struggle on the platteland. We have had commissions on the depopulation of the platteland, but we never hear what steps have been taken to do anything about it. The hon. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs says that this process of the flow of White people away from the platteland must last for another five years. The hon. Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing said recently when he opened the Congress of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, as reported in <i>Merino</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Minister Uys het ges&#x00EA; dat daar veral drie belangrike maatre&#x00EB;ls is om hierdie boere uit hul penarie te red: (1) Die bevolkingsvloei uit die landbou na ander sektors van die ekonomie moet vergemaklik word.</block>

<p>That is the only answer he has. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, look what has happened already. They talk about apartheid to keep this country White, but what has happened already between 1951 and 1960 is the rural White population has decreased by 8.5 per cent, the Bantu population increased by 20.9 per cent. Keeping South Africa White! The hon. Minister apparently has given up the struggle completely. It is rather interesting also to pick on a particular district of special interest, a district like Heidelberg. In the magisterial district of Heidelberg (the Prime Minister&#x2019;s seat) we find that Whites on the farms have declined from 5,399 to 4,425, a decrease of 1,000. We find that Blacks have increased from 32,000 to 39,000, by nearly 7,000. In the Prime Minister&#x2019;s constituency the ratio of Blacks to Whites in the rural areas has increased from 7:1 to 9:1. One asks oneself: What is the point of trying to stem the flow of Bantu to your cities when you are losing the battle on the platteland anyway? What is the point of having in the end mixed cities with overwhelmingly Black rural areas? These figures of the population census show that thanks to our population growth and our economic growth and the great difference in skills between the <span class="col_289-290" refersTo="page_0159"/>various races in South Africa, separate development or apartheid has been shown to be a completely impracticable proposition. Believe me, if we could separate the races, I sincerely believe our political problems would become easier. But it is simply impossible in a situation such as we find in South Africa, for the reasons I have given. We on this side of the House are quite aware that a multi-racial society is a much more difficult society to govern than a homogeneous society, but if you have a multi-racial society, what is the point in shutting your eyes to the facts? Why not adjust your policy to realities? Because what are the realities of South Africa? We find that in the period 1951-60 the Republic&#x2019;s population increased at the rate of nearly 370,000 per annum, of which the Bantu accounted for almost 260,000 and the Whites for 50,000. Now, Mr. Speaker, as a proposition of common sense, can anyone in his sound senses really believe that those 260,000 Bantu from now on or from some time in the future&#x2014;let us take 1978, according to the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration&#x2014;can we really believe that from now on or in 15 years&#x2019; time 13 per cent of the surface area of South Africa with limited natural resources and a primitive population with no industrial skill and no administrative skill will really be able to support a rate of growth of this order, and that the other 87 per cent can be reserved only for the Whites and for the Coloureds and the Indians? Surely it is nonsense. If you take into account the population growth, if you take into account the cultural differences between the various groups, especially as far as the Bantu are concerned, all they can do is to go to the cities, go to the farms, go to the shops and to the factories. There is no other way out. Surely any farmer with common sense knows that that is the only thing that can happen. Given the human realities, given the economic realities, it is absolute nonsense to talk of the separation of the races.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the next decade as in the past decade we will see that rapid economic development will mean a rapid influx of Blacks to the towns and cities. The flood is only stemmed in periods of slow economic growth. That is the great paradox of this Government. When there is rapid economic growth, they are very proud of it, and then you have a huge influx of Blacks to the towns, and the apartheid policy collapses. When they start having success with their apartheid policy and they stop the influx of Blacks to our industries and our farms and our mines, then the economic policy of the Government collapses. Economic success under this Government means political failure; political success means economic failure. Therefore I say that this is the most remarkable Government I have ever heard of. The more rapid South Africa develops economically, the more rapidly does apartheid become discredited. That is why we on this side, unlike gentlemen on the other side although we welcome the recent economic growth, say that apartheid is limiting such growth. The faster we grow economically, the quicker will apartheid become discredited completely. So that is the stupidity of countries who are in favour of economic boycotts. If they are earnest and serious in their desire to put an end to apartheid, they must say to their people: There you have one of the richest countries in the world with a rapidly growing population; go and invest your money there. That country has limitless resources, and the quickest way of destroying apartheid is to help the country economically. We welcome rapid economic development. We are just afraid that it might be slowed down again as a result of the Government&#x2019;s policies. If we have five years of rapid economic development, the people will come to the realization that this big bluff that apartheid can keep South Africa White, that the establishment of great big Black states can keep South Africa White, is the most gigantic fraud that has ever been perpetrated on an electorate. They will realize that what we will get are eight Black independent sovereign states with all the implications which have been pointed out by other speakers on this side of the House, but on top of that we will still have a multi-racial society, we are still going to have a platteland overwhelmingly Black. We will still have a shrinking ratio of White people in our big White cities. We will have the worst of both worlds. There is no choice. Apparently some dupes fall for this pretence that if you have apartheid you can keep South Africa White. We have seen an example of that just recently of people falling for this fraud. But the fact of the matter is that we have no choice; we are a multi-racial society, and the longer we shut our eyes to that the longer will we postpone the solution to any pressing problems facing us. As I have already pointed out, apartheid has in no way kept South Africa White. All it has done is to weaken it economically and internationally. We are the loneliest state in the world, but are we any Whiter? No, we are much Blacker and we are not as strong economically as we could have been otherwise. We have forgone the stabilizing influence of having a million extra White people in this country. Not only will apartheid not keep South Africa White, but from what the Prime Minister said recently, and in previous debates, it will give South Africa the queerest constitution the world has ever seen. Hon. members opposite taunt us with our race federation. It is easy, if you take up a narrow attitude, to pick holes in our plans, but why do they not publish their constitution as it will look in the end? I have discussed this matter with constitutional lawyers and I asked them how you can have two Parliaments in one country, and they said they did not know how it could be done. We have heard of Parliaments within Parliaments and we have heard about Commonwealth consultative bodies. Why do they not commit all of that to paper so that we can have a look at it? We have had the spectacle here of the Prime Minister outlining a <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_0160"/>policy for the Indians, of which the Minister of Indian Affairs apparently himself is not aware yet. The Prime Minister will not only do us a great favour by publishing his constitution as he sees it, but he will do his own party a favour.</p>

<p>The other amazing thing about the constitution outlined by the Prime Minister is that in 1961 he claimed that apartheid is not a policy which contains discrimination, although he admitted, as we all admit, that in the transitional period a multi-racial society such as we have in South Africa must have discrimination in it. But he said ultimately discrimination would disappear and he did not know why UN attacks us because Nationalist policy has the same aims as UN policy&#x2014;in other words, no discrimination between different racial groups and the development of every individual to his fullest dignity and freedom. If we consider the latest Commonwealth Consultative Council&#x2014;I do not know what to call it&#x2014;that the Prime Minister has mentioned here, it seems to me that discrimination is inherent in it for all time. Let us leave out of account for the moment that the Bantu will have their own homelands, but if you take the three communities, the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians, which hon. members opposite now admit are all part permanently of the multi-racial society in South Africa, although they still call it a White man&#x2019;s country, it is only a question of time before the Indians and the Coloureds will outnumber the Whites. Let us consider this Consultative Council that the Prime Minister has now suggested. In it is inherent permanent discrimination, because the White man sits in this Parliament and will not tolerate any other race sitting here, except that the Coloureds can have four White representatives. The Indians apparently will also take part in that Council, but they will have no representation in Parliament. So there is a permanent basis of discrimination between the four groups. The whole thing is so illogical. It is inevitable that if you start on this road of unreality, as this Government has done, the constitutional development in the end must become completely unrealistic. I cannot understand what we solve by pretending that we are a White country when in fact we are a multi-racial country. I repeat that South Africa will only achieve the great destiny which I believe awaits it if we have realist policies and try to evolve a constitution which suits that multi-racial society, which I submit is the honest attempt we made in evolving our race federation plan.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the beginning of this debate used our present manpower position as one of his attacks on the Government in asking that the House should express no confidence in the Government. Three years ago it was the question of unemployment which was used to attack the Government. In fact, that was the time, three years ago, when the Leader of the Opposition himself marched in a procession through the streets of Johannesburg like the leader of a carnival to protest against unemployment. Seeing that the hon. Leader looks at me in that way, I may just remind him of the large photograph of him which appeared on the front page of the <i>Sunday Times</i>. Perhaps that will refresh his memory.</p>

<p>We have now listened to the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), who said in this House last year that our economy was just struggling along. As against that, we now hear the complaint that we have a manpower shortage in this country. Instead of that unemployment, about which such a big fuss was made two or three years ago, having increased, as was predicted by the Opposition, it has, judged by international standards, disappeared to such an extent to-day that South Africa, according to those standards, has virtually no unemployment. And because that is the position, and because we have a position of almost full employment, the Opposition has thought fit to grasp at this full employment, with its concomitant shortage in certain spheres of labour, in order to attack the Government. The Opposition has already on previous occasions shown that they grasp at such things, but in this respect they are not alone. It is the Opposition and the newspapers which support them which to-day ardently hope to use this position of full employment to force the Government to depart from its traditional policy of apartheid, particularly in the sphere of labour. In this respect they are in full agreement with the Press supporting them. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to a speech I made in Odendaalsrus. I made that speech with reference to a leading article which appeared in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 11 October 1963, in which the following was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the last resort it will be economic development, not political pressure, that will expose apartheid for the pipe-dream it really is.</block>

<p>That is precisely what the hon. member for Jeppes, and also the Leader of the Opposition said. Then that same <i>Financial Mail</i> continued to say that they wanted to give advice to the Nordic and the Afro-Asian countries which sought to force South Africa to its knees by means of boycotts. They told them to forget about those boycotts if they wanted to force South Africa to its knees, and then they gave the following advice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Afro-Asian Group would be better advised to press for the maximum of world trade with South Africa and to do whatever they can to encourage overseas investment in the Republic. The reason is that every extra dollar of business which comes South Africa&#x2019;s way helps to strengthen the forces of economic integration.</block>

<p>They continued to say that this would be the way in which this Government could be embarrassed. In this respect the United Party is <span class="col_293-294" refersTo="page_0161"/>in complete agreement with this advice given to the Afro-Asian countries. They base all their hope on the expectation that this position of full employment will force us to depart from our pattern. Therefore one must view this manpower story which was raised here against the background of this matter on which the United Party bases its hopes to bring us to a fall. In passing, I just want to say that I hope that this concern about our manpower shortage, the shortage of technicians and scientists, will at least continue until next week, because next week extra facilities for training technicians in this country will be discussed in this House, and then we shall see whether the United Party is serious enough in regard to this matter to support the establishment of the University of Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it very soon became clear to me from the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that this attack in regard to our manpower is being used as a smokescreen behind which the real attack is being launched against something else, against one of the main pillars of our policy of apartheid and our labour policy, namely job reservation. But before saying something about that, I just want to mention the following in regard to the manpower position as it is at present. The Opposition and the House need not be concerned about the manpower position in South Africa to-day, because I think this Government does everything humanly possible to strengthen and improve our manpower position. We do so by means of this immigration policy, which is a great success. I may say that due to that immigration policy we have implemented our skilled manpower during the past calendar year in the sphere of the professional group and workers in the manufacturing and construction industries by 7,600 skilled people. But apart from that, during the past year and the previous one, we have done much to bring our own manpower in the country to the greatest degree of efficiency. In this regard I need only mention that to-day our technical schools train more than twice the number of students than they did some years ago. Apart from that, the improved conditions for apprentices is one of the most important measures to ensure our having improved manpower in future. The steps taken in the past to train adults at certain training centres in the country will be expanded during the next few months so that adults can be trained in our technical high schools and colleges. Therefore I want to express the conviction that in so far as our manpower position is concerned, South Africa need have no concern for the future. We can face the future with confidence. The available manpower is being implemented and trained to the maximum.</p>

<p>But what caused me concern in the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was not so much this question of the shortage of manpower about which he made such a fuss, but that once again it was used as something on which to base his attacks on job reservation. He is at liberty to attack it at all times, but what causes me concern is that it spoils the &#x201C;image&#x201D; of South Africa in the world, to use a word of which the United Party is so fond. They use these repeated misrepresentations in regard to job reservation in order to create the wrong image of South Africa overseas. It is a fact that job reservation has been depicted in a very bad light overseas, and that is one of the things which creates an unfavourable impression there, to the detriment of South Africa. Now it surprises one that a Leader of an Opposition who in season or out of it continually says how he wants to uphold the good name of South Africa overseas should have stigmatized job reservation as a sin at his Bloemfontein Congress in November, and as a measure applied by this Government to prevent people from using their God-given gifts and from improving themselves. I can only say that this is utter nonsense, apart from being libellous. If the Leader of the Opposition is so concerned about the image of South Africa and that this country should be depicted in the correct light overseas, particularly in regard to this matter in connection with which we are already in bad odour, I think it is his duty to state the true position in regard to job reservation, and then I want to tell him this. If the hon. the Leader is so concerned about South Africa&#x2019;s image overseas, why does he not say here and on his public platforms that in the only industry to which a country-wide job reservation determination applies, viz. the clothing industry, the numbers of Coloureds in the Western Cape has increased by 4,000 since this job reservation determination came into effect in 1959? To-day 4,000 more Coloureds are employed in the clothing industry in the Western Cape than there were in 1959. Why does the hon. member not tell the world that? By means of this determination we succeeded in retaining in the industry the small group of Whites still employed in the clothing industry in the Cape. In 1959 they numbered 870, and that figure has now been increased to 950, and therefore it is only a very small group, but those people want to work there and we have given them the opportunity to remain there. Is it so indefensible, to use his term, for us to take steps to protect that small group of Whites, whilst also providing work for between 16,000 and 17,000 Coloureds in the clothing industry in the Cape? No, the actions of the Opposition in regard to job reservation definitely do not do South Africa any good; and if they now say that it is inhumane I want to ask them why they have never come to this House with a single substantiated case where a Coloured person or anyone else has been harmed by these job reservation measures? Why have we not had a single substantiated case from the Opposition in the seven years during which these measures have been applied of someone having been treated unfairly? Sir, we have not had it and we will no more have it in the case of the building industry, which was also mentioned <span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_0162"/>in this debate, because in so far as the building industry is concerned the United Party and the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) create the impression, in season and out of it, that by means of job reservation we are depriving the Coloureds in the Western Cape of the opportunity of earning a living in the building industry. Sir, that is a scandalous misrepresentation. The fact is that the Coloureds retain the major proportion of the work in the building industry in the Western Cape. They constitute 85 per cent of the bricklayers and 65 per cent of the plumbers. Not a single one of them is prohibited from working in those industries. Most of the Coloureds in the building industry are not in the least affected by this determination. Why do those people, who are so concerned that the correct picture of South Africa should be painted, not tell the world that it is only a very small percentage of Whites in a negligible part of the building industry in the Cape which is actually affected by this determination, and that it actually affects only a small sub-division like stone-masonry? That is very hard work in which a small group of Whites are employed who asked us to protect them. Electrical wire-workers, of whom only 5 per cent in the Cape are Coloureds, are protected, and the Coloureds in that trade have not been kicked out. Is it a sin if a Government pays heed to the request of the Whites in that small section of the building industry and gives them the necessary protection? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that the Government had lost its perspective, but I am afraid that not only has the United Party lost its perspective but it has also lost all sympathy for the White worker. They use the present shortage of apprentices in the building industry to prove that job reservation has had a harmful effect. One would at least have expected the Leader of the Opposition to know that three years ago, when there was a recession in the building industry, in regard to which he attacked the Government, the building industry was at such a low level that building workers deserted the industry, and they could not come back all at once because they were placed in other employment. Do the hon. members not know that the conditions of apprenticeship in the building industry in the past were very unattractive, but that thanks to the steps we took last year they will now be so attractive that they will come back again? But the most important reason for our not having enough White building workers in the Cape is simply because the White boy has seen what has happened in the building industry, that the Coloureds have taken it over, with the result that the Whites have got out. That is the main reason why not many Whites are employed in the building industry in the Cape. But now the Leader of the Opposition comes along with a new rate for the job solution.</p>

<p>The hon. Leader said that we should abolish job reservation and substitute for it the rate for the job, but this time he has amended his rate for the job. This time we have had a new kind of rate for the job from the Opposition, which firstly proves to me that the United Party has at last realized that their rate for the job cannot protect the White man in his employment. We told them year after year, and one report after the other dealing with the matter confirmed it, that this rate for the job is fixed so low that it undermines the standard of living of the Whites, and therefore the Whites have abandoned the industry. In other words, it is no protection for the White worker in any industry. Now that has eventually been realized by the Opposition, and now they come with an amended form of the rate for the job. The Leader of the Opposition advocates that a rate for the job should be determined&#x2014;to use his own words&#x2014;according to &#x201C;the actual wages&#x201D; paid in any industry, and not the wage fixed by any determination. Sir, I have never yet heard such an ill-considered proposition from the Leader of the Opposition. I should like to know from him and his labour advisers how he proposes to apply this rate for the job which he now suggests within the framework of collective bargaining? How can one have collective bargaining and at the same time lay down what the wages should be? Surely then there is no collective bargaining. Is the Government to step in when an industrial council, which consists of employees and employers, agree on a wage, and then veto that wage? Then, according to the hon. the Leader, the Government must ensure that once this agreement in regard to wages has been reached, a different wage should be determined which will apply to the White worker. Sir, have you ever heard such an ill-considered argument? Just imagine our interfering with this collective bargaining machinery in that way, and this suggestion comes from those people who seven years ago, when this Act was before the House, continually accused us of wanting to destroy collective bargaining! Now they say that we should, as it were, suspend collective bargaining and we must intervene and ourselves determine wages if those wages are not high enough for certain White workers. What does the Opposition think the Coloureds on the Industrial Council in the Cape would say if they were told: The wages you agreed on with your employers are too low; there must still be an extra higher wage for the Whites in the industry? If there is one thing which will completely destroy industrial peace in the Cape, it is the application of this new suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the &#x201C;image&#x201D;. I want to ask the United Party this. If they are so keen on having the image of South Africa in regard to job reservation set right, why do they not tell the world for the first time what excellent opportunities for employment for the Coloureds exist to-day? Why does the United Party not tell the world that to-day there are better opportunities of employment for the Coloureds than there were 10 or 15 years ago? The impression is continually being created that we do not want to allow the Coloureds to improve their position <span class="col_297-298" refersTo="page_0163"/>further. At their Bloemfontein Congress it was said that we do not want to allow them to use their talents and to improve their position. Sir, do you know what the position is in the Peninsula in regard to two of the most important industries? I want to mention the building industry first. Whilst to-day there are 190 White apprentices in the building industry in the Peninsula, there are no fewer than 450 Coloured apprentices. Does that seem as if we are depriving these people of the right to improve their position? We have the position not only of the garment industry or of the building industry, in which the Coloureds have made progress, but I also want to mention the furniture industry. In the furniture industry there are to-day only four White apprentices in the Peninsula, as against 117 Coloureds. Is that the way in which this Government is depriving the Coloureds of the right to be trained and to improve their position? Cannot the United Party, which is so concerned about South Africa&#x2019;s good name, state the true position for a change? Cannot they say what is being done for these people?</p>

<p>But the impression is also being created that we do not want to give the Bantu the opportunity, as they say, &#x201C;to improve their skills&#x201D;. I wonder whether the Opposition knows that to-day in this country we have 3,600 registered Bantu building workers, thanks to the Act which was still introduced by Minister Schoeman, and that would never have been the position had it not been for those apartheid measures taken by this Government. But it was not only those people who were trained. We heard complaints again to-day that we do not train the Bantu. Do they not know that at the moment at East London we are training 400 Bantu a month to work in the new textile factory of Mr. Lord? There they will do semi-skilled work, and also advanced skilled work. And when these people create the impression that we do not want to allow the Bantu a place in the sun, I just want to say that they should really state the true position for a change, namely that these Bantu who are being trained in our border industries will be the nucleus of the workers in the industry which must be established in their own homelands. There they will become the kernel of their own industrial force, and in those areas the expression &#x201C;The sky is the limit&#x201D; will apply. Why cannot that also be said to the credit of South Africa? But the impression is created every time that we are inhuman and unreasonable and that it is a sin, as the Leader of the Opposition said. I want to express it as my conviction that if only one-quarter of the evils which the Opposition has been sucking out of its thumb over the years against job reservation were true, South Africa would to-day be in the stranglehold of a series of strikes. But instead of having strikes, South Africa has the greatest industrial peace any land can wish for, so much so that we are actually the envy of other Western countries. This industrial peace is to me the best and the final proof of the desirability and the wisdom of job reservation, because if job reservation in fact contains those evils and those demerits, we would to-day be seeing the results in the form of labour unrest and strikes in this country. No, there is nothing wrong with the essence of job reservation, because it is simply a means, conventional and statutory, of protecting the Whites&#x2019; standard of living. And in this respect we are no more peculiar than other countries. If the British public refuses that non-Whites should be appointed as &#x201C;Bobbies&#x201D; in London, if the British bus drivers refuse to have non-Whites as bus drivers in London, if the National Union of Seamen in Britain refuses to have Indians appointed as stewards on ships, that is not peculiar, nor do I blame them. They are trying to protect the White standard of living there, to protect the British way of life, and why should it be a sin in our case? Let me say this: If South Africa wants this development we have at the moment to continue, a development which is essential not only for the Whites but also essential for the further employment of non-Whites, whether in the border areas or elsewhere, then South Africa needs industrial peace, and in order to ensure that industrial peace and to maintain, it, it is necessary that the corner-stone of industrial peace, namely job reservation, should be maintained.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has done a lot of writing during this debate. It sometimes seemed to me as if he was under the impression that we have no Hansard in this House, and I trust that the hon. the Leader has made enough notes on matters put to him by hon. members on this side in regard to cardinal questions on which we would like to have replies. I am thinking, <i>inter alia</i>, of the question the hon. the Minister of Transport put to him yesterday, as to whether they are prepared to say that they will abolish the Colour bar in the mines. That was the first job reservation determination in South Africa and therefore, if they have the courage of their convictions, they must say that they will abolish it, but they will not be able to do so because that job reservation preserves industrial peace which is to the benefit of everybody.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by expressing the hope that the Leader of the Opposition, in the light of the questions put from that side, will also give this House clear replies on the questions put to him, which are of great importance, because in this debate it was not the Government which was in the dock; it was the Opposition which stood in the dock, and it is they who must now account to the country and to the people for the consequences of their policy and their deeds. I therefore want to express the hope that the Leader of the Opposition will make use of this opportunity to answer the cardinal questions put to him not only from this side of the House but also by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell). I trust that we will not get ambiguous replies, just the vague replies we have had in the past. Because if the United <span class="col_275-276" refersTo="page_0164"/>Party wants to continue evading these cardinal questions by means of vaguenesses, the day is nigh that South Africa will be able to do without such an Opposition. South Africa needs an Opposition which has the courage of its convictions to say what it deems necessary in the interest of the country. We need an Opposition which has the courage to give straight replies to the cardinal questions put to it. As we have known this Opposition in the past, it has never had that courage, and such an Opposition is doomed to disappear, and the day that happens South Africa will shed no tears.</p>

<p>When one listens to the criticism from the Government benches with regard to the attacks made by the Opposition over the past few days one is reminded of the two reports or the comment which appeared on the same day in the same Nationalist Party organ here in Cape Town.

<block name="quote">Sir de Villiers Graaff was forced to do what we prophesied, that is, to rake together every bit of criticism and to shake it out like a bag of chaff in the House of Assembly, with the result that the few grains of wheat which might have been present also became lost.</block>

<p>But in the same newspaper on the same day, on the same page of the newspaper, we find a report from the political correspondent of that newspaper with regard to the same speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the rest he put up a better parliamentary performance on this occasion than he has done in the past few years. He did this by getting away from high United Party philosophy and concentrating on a few specific points.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, who is correct? This is the criticism of the Nationalist Party. It changes from day to day as its suits them and as the political winds happen to blow.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister of Labour put up a serious defence of job reservation here to-day. He pointed out how fair it was towards the non-White workers. Sir, I have heard him on other occasions as well, and on those occasions the emphasis was placed on the protection of the White worker in South Africa. We were then told what a wonderful thing job reservation was to protect the White worker in South Africa.</p>

I shall deal with this matter in greater detail when I deal with the various points which I raised in the course of my speech and the replies on those points. This debate has been of particular interest to me because I raised certain important matters in my introductory speech, but in his reply the hon. the Prime Minister proceeded to raise a large number of other matters, dealt with them and destroyed his own case. He was like a batsman batting on a pitch without a bowler. He batted beautifully. He handled the bat beautifully but the ball was not there, because those matters were not raised by me, and some of them I did not raise because I felt that it was not in the interests of South African that they should be raised. I do not think the hon. the Prime Minister did South Africa a favour by raising some of those matters.</p>

<p>I propose first of all to deal with the matters which I myself raised. I stated in the first place that in my opinion this Government was not capable of adapting itself to the scientific developments in this modern world which is witnessing a scientific revolution.</p>

<p>Well, it does not matter much. I just want to say that I know of no gathering of prominent industrialists or businessmen in South Africa during the past year where this matter has not been raised and where the fear has not been expressed that we shall not be able to provide the necessary manpower within the time it must be done in order to be able to keep up our present level of development. It went so far that one of the most important gatherings of industrialists in Johannesburg discussed this matter and asked whether it was not possible to try to meet that shortage by means of immigration. They expressed the opinion that that shortage was so serious that it would not be possible for them to make up the leeway even with an immigration programme <span class="col_301-302" refersTo="page_0165"/>at the rate at which it was being applied by the Government at the present moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister said that the figures which I had mentioned were based on an immigration inflow of about 5,000 a year and that if the figure rose to 20,000 a year, then those figures would be meaningless. I just want to say, as far as the businessmen and the industrialists of South Africa are concerned, that this estimate was made last year when the figures in connection with the influx of immigrants during the past year were already available, and I have no reason to believe that they did not take that influx into account. But it seems to me that this Government is afraid to tackle this matter, or that it has neglected to tackle it because, as the Prime Minister said on one occasion, they have been too busy in the past with constitutional matters to give adequate attention to the training of the population of South Africa. It seems to me that what will happen is that they will take steps too late and take too few steps to make up the leeway and that the rate of development in South Africa will drop therefore and that the whole nation will suffer in consequence. We find already that the children are suffering because of the shortage of trained teachers. No member on the other side of the House has tried to deny that; no member has come forward with a plan indicating how they hope to cope with this situation. I made certain proposals to the hon. the Prime Minister and I must say in all honesty that he was courteous enough to repeat some of them. He said that they still had to be considered. But when are they going to be implemented? That is what the people and this country want to know, because there is not the slightest doubt that if we are going to lose technicians and scientists at the rate at which we are losing them at the moment, then South Africa has no hope of maintaining her present tempo of economic development.</p>

<p>I then went on to talk about job reservation. Here I feel that once again we are dealing with a matter where political considerations rule over and above the interests of the country, because the hon. the Deputy Minister repeatedly defended job reservation, just as his Prime Minister did, by trying to prove that it was in the interests of the White worker and for the protection of the White worker. To-day he is afraid of the image of South Africa overseas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The picture which you paint there is that we are doing an injustice to the Coloureds here.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>He says that this is the picture which we paint there, but it is his policy, and if there is one thing in the world which no traveller from South Africa can defend oversea then it is this policy of job reservation. Ask any businessman who goes overseas; ask any diplomatic representative of South Africa where he has managed successfully to defend job reservation before any oversea audience, and you will get the same reply. They cannot do it. I think the hon. the Prime Minister realizes this to a certain extent because in the course of a speech which I have already mentioned he talked about relaxations, and when the hon. gentleman replied he spoke of the possibilities for the various racial groups of doing skilled work in their own areas or amongst their own people. I wonder whether the hon. the Prime Minister realizes what he is saying there. He is now creating two markets; he is creating different markets for the same labour in one economy. Sooner or later those markets will inevitably compete, and unless he applies the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; he will find himself in this difficulty that those races which have not reached the same standard of civilization are going to accept lower wages than the groups with a higher standard of living, and that there is going to be competition which will be unfair, competition which is going to jeopardize the whole position of the White worker in South Africa. That is already happening in the case of the border industries. The hon. the Prime Minister knows about the agitation which was set afoot as the result of what happened in certain border industries where non-Whites were allowed to do work which was being done by Whites in other areas at a higher remuneration. It seems to me that when one asks oneself which proposals will better protect the standard of civilization, the standard of living, of the White worker in South Africa&#x2014;the proposals made by this side of the House or the proposals of that side of the House&#x2014;the reply must be that the proposals of this side of the House are better: and when one asks oneself which of these proposals will lead to the greatest development and the most rapid growth in the economic sphere in South Africa, then it is clear that our proposals are the best, without the slightest doubt. I know that the hon. the Minister of Transport will ask me immediately what my attitude is towards the Work in Mines and Factories Act, and I am quite prepared to reply to it, as I have done repeatedly in the past. That legislation is a traditional piece of legislation and it would be extremely irresponsible on the part of any Government to amend that legislation so that the handling of explosives is placed in the hands of primitive Natives who come from every State in Africa, thus an-dangering the whole of the White race. I go further, Mr. Speaker. I say that the removal of that legislation can only be considered if there is unanimity between the employees&#x2019; associations and the employers&#x2019; associations.</p>

<p>Well, then we are both satisfied. Why all this scare-mongering then about the danger on the mines if the United Party comes into power? There we see the great character of the Minister; he says himself that his attack is worthless; it will never happen, and that danger no longer exists therefore.</p>

<p>I then went on to deal with the Government&#x2019;s shortcomings as far as economic planning is concerned. I dealt with the proposal of Dr. van Eck and of this side of the House that certain benefits should be given to industries not only when they are established in border areas but also when they are established in rural areas where the White population is showing a tendency to decrease. The hon. the Prime Minister made an accusation against me in this connection. He said that I was complaining that the platteland was becoming Black and now I wanted to establish industries there and make the platteland Blacker. But the ratio of Black to White in the agricultural industry, as the Minister knows, is about eight Blacks to one White. In most industries it is 2&#x00BD; to one or three to one. In other words, the effect of my proposals will be that the platteland will become Whiter, not Blacker. How can the hon. gentleman come along with such stories?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Are agricultural activities going to be discontinued then?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, they will continue but as far as the ratio is concerned more Whites than non-Whites will come in and proportionally the ratio of White to non-White will become stronger in the platteland. That is the entire proposal, and it applies particularly to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own constituency. Here I have figures in respect of the magisterial district of Heidelberg. What do I find in respect of the period 1951-61? In the rural area of Heidelberg there were 974 fewer Whites and 7,207 more Natives at the end of that period, and in the urban area of the magisterial district of Heidelberg&#x2014;I do not know whether it corresponds precisely with the constituency&#x2014;during the same period 1,185 more Whites came in but 4,325 more Natives. In other words, taking the whole district we find that during those nine years there was an increase of 200 in the number of Whites but an increase of 11,500 in the number of Natives. In other words, in that magisterial district the number of Natives increased 57 times as rapidly as the number of Whites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Are you including the mining industry?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>We include everything. I took the figures for the magisterial district. But the hon. gentleman knows as well as I do that the ratio on the mines is more or less the same as the ratio on the farms. That does not apply to industry, however. If industries were established there the position would be quite different. I say therefore that the first shortcoming of this Government&#x2014;its first failure to adapt itself&#x2014;was in respect of skilled manpower. Its second shortcoming will prove to be lack of economic planning for the future of South Africa. But then I come to the third charge which I made against the Government, and that is that the economic boom in South Africa is not attributable to the success of the non-White policy of this Government but to the failure of that non-White policy. I pointed out that over the past ten years there had been an influx of at least 1,000,000 Natives in the White urban areas and that they were inextricably bound up with the growth of our industries in those areas. The hon. the Prime Minister has now reminded me of prophecies in the past that that influx will increase until about 1978, and then the stream will begin to move in the other direction. But the vast majority of these Natives who are in our urban areas to-day are employed in our industries, and when the stream begins to move in the opposite direction, what is to become of those industries? They need that labour. What becomes of those industries when the labour flows in the other direction?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<p>They go in for a little mechanization.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says that they will go in for a little mechanization. I wonder whether he knows what it costs to go in for a little mechanization. I wonder whether he knows that in the U.S.A., in spite of an expenditure of millions of dollars, there are still more people employed in industry than there were before mechanization was introduced. What is going to happen? There is another alternative; of course; the industries themselves must be shifted; they must be shifted to the border areas, and that is precisely what I said. If the policy of this Government is applied then the profits will decline because of the enormous capitalization that is needed, or the costs will rise and the profits decline because of the necessity to shift those industries, and we will never retain the level of development and the level of prosperity that we have at the moment.</p>

<p>What I find interesting is this: The Prime Minister, when he talked about the Protectorates, said that he hoped to protect them from Communism by making them economically strong. I should also like to protect the Native from Communism by making him economically strong here in the Republic of South Africa, particularly in the urban areas, which are the dangerous areas, and in his own reserves, with the utilization of White capital, White ingenuity and White initiative, but it seems to me that the effect of the policy of the Prime Minister is going to be to retard development to such an extent that they will never enjoy that level of prosperity which is necessary to protect them from Communism. The hon.gentleman wants to make us believe <span class="col_305-306" refersTo="page_0167"/>that like the oxen with which we plough the Natives are not integrated on our farms or in our industries. In other words, he does not regard this labour force as one of the factors of production; he counts it amongst the capital assets of the industrialist to make sure that they will not be integrated. If that is the position then there is not the slightest doubt that it is going to cause friction which is going to create a fertile seed-bed for Communism.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize in particular that throughout this whole debate not a single speaker attempted to reply to the argument that little apartheid is one of the most harmful and offending institutions in South Africa as far as race relations are concerned, and that it is only being implemented by this Government because their great ideal of big apartheid cannot be implemented in practice. Repeated attacks were made upon them in this regard. Mr. Speaker, how far did we get? Not a single reply, not a single attempt to defend it, in spite of the harm which it does South Africa&#x2019;s good name abroad. If there is one thing to which the hon. the Minister of Information ought to give his attention then it is the effect in the outside world of little apartheid.</p>

<p>The third matter that I raised was the administration of the hon. the Minister of Justice. The hon. the Minister of Justice reacted as though the complaints in regard to detainees under Section 17 of the General Law Amendment Act constituted the only charge against him. That was not the case at all. It was not the only charge, and possibly it was not the most important charge either. I am still awaiting a reply to another matter that I raised, a reply either from the hon. gentleman or from the hon. the Prime Minister himself, and that is in regard to the reaction of the Government in connection with the actions of Dr. Naude in Washington. I refer to his statement on this Section 17 of the General Law Amendment Act. Is there a modern state in this world in which a blunder has been committed such as that committed by a man who is possibly our most important Ambassador abroad and where the Government remains silent when this matter is raised in a no-confidence debate in the House? Nobody said a word about it. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister of Justice was responsible for the information that that unfortunate Ambassador received. I do not want to make that accusation against him. But the hon. the Prime Minister must know. There is no answer. What is the position? Must the news go out into the world that an important Ambassador representing South Africa in one of the most important Western countries was wrongly informed and thus gave wrong information to a most important newspaper with the largest circulation in the world and that no steps were taken in this regard, that no statement was made in this House either by the hon. the Prime Minister or any Minister of his Cabinet? What sort of impression does this create, Mr. Speaker? Does it create an impression of efficiency, of a competent Government that is upholding South Africa&#x2019;s name in the outside world?</p>

<p>I come to the second matter, the use of not one but two&#x2014;if I correctly understood the reply of the hon. the Minister&#x2014;White female complainants as traps in a certain case.</p>

Mr. Speaker, there was one complainant and she was used as a decoy to trap a White man who, according to the hon. the Minister, tried to procure White women for an Indian. It appears to me that it would have been impossible to use her as a trap in order to prove this unless she was prepared to some extent to lend her body to that Indian. I take it that it was only an attempt, that act was not completed.</p>

<p>It was merely an attempt; there was no sexual intercourse.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sexual intercourse did not take place but there was an attempt. And she had to lend her body to that Indian for him to make the attempt. Mr. Speaker, I regard this as a scandalous state of affairs here in South Africa. I want to repeat: I did my best to get the facts from the newspapers; I am now trying to take the matter further in the light of the reply of the hon. the Minister. I take it that even the judges were not acquainted with all the facts when they gave judgment but it still remains a disgrace that a woman should be used for those purposes here in South Africa.</p>

<p>I come now to the treatment of detainees under Section 17 of the General Law Amendment Act. When I introduced my motion I told the hon. the Minister that certain things had come out as a result of certain statements made to me at a post-mortem examination in the Transvaal and that there were indications that one detainee had become mentally unbalanced. I did not want to take the matter any further because I am not a detective. It is not my duty to prove these matters here. But it is my duty, if Press reports are published on such matters to try to protect South Africa&#x2019;s good name by asking the hon. the Minister to have a judicial inquiry made in order to prove that that charge is or is not completely false and that South Africa is not afraid to take action against members of the Police Force who act in this way.</p>

<p>The witness Tlale gave evidence in the Looksmart post-mortem case. I understand that his evidence was made available to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>That has nothing to do with the matter; it is not <i>sub judice</i>. After all it is a post-mortem examination. Nobody is in danger. There is nothing to prevent the hon. the Minister from acting now and having an investigation made to find out what happened there. Nothing prevented his taking action on the day that report appeared in the newspaper. It was a report by a witness about torture. I myself read that evidence. I want to be quite fair and say that under cross-examination he was not very impressive. But the fact remains that this is the sort of thing that is sent overseas.</p>

<p>By whom! By the international Press. After all right or wrong, it is news. Even if I or the hon. the Minister tried to stop it it would still be sent overseas. Why was an investigation not made immediately? A man was brought before the court in the same case to show that there were burns on his fingers, that his hands were black because he had allegedly been given electric shocks. There was nothing to prevent the hon. the Minister from having this investigated immediately. This happened quite some time ago. This man&#x2019;s name was Ziphania Mo-thopeng. A report in this regard was also published. There was also the case in Cape Town in which one of the accused, Marcus Solomon, gave evidence that he had been tortured. The case concerned the admissibility of a specimen of handwriting by that particular accused person. The Judge did not admit it and he ruled accordingly because the State had not proved conclusively that that man had voluntarily given the specimen and that it had not been made as a result of the treatment which, according to him, had been meted out to him. Mr. Speaker, as far as that is concerned, the matter is closed: judgment has been given. The hon. the Minister could have had an investigation made. Why was it not done? Then there are the statements by eight detainees&#x2014;I understand that these statements are already in the hands of the hon. the Minister&#x2014;of whom at least five. I think, according to them, made complaints to the magistrates who visited them.</p>

<p>I am not blaming the hon. the Minister; he had no knowledge of these matters. But those statements were made. They say that they lodged these complaints. They all complain about the same thing. They were beaten; they were given electric shocks and sacks were put over their heads so that they could not see who was administering the shocks. In each case the pattern was the same. They were manacled, in certain cases with their hands behind their backs and in other cases with their hands in front of a stick under their knees and over the elbows. Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether these facts are true or false. But what is of importance to South Africa is that the pattern is the same throughout; it is the same pattern that we had in the Looksmart case. It seems to me that there are two possible explanations in this regard. One is that these were trained wrongdoers who were all told to lodge the same sort of complaint if they were arrested &#x2026;</p>

Is it not in the interests of South Africa that there should be a judicial inquiry into these matters so that we can have an end to this sort of story?</p>

<p>I go further. There is the case of Moffat Msingizane who was detained on 28 October. According to my information he was in goal then; he was then held as a detainee and no longer as a prisoner.

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, of course, this afternoon I showed the hon. the Minister eight statements which I mentioned in my introductory speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>One statement and eight names.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I beg your pardon. The eight statements were under the papers. I am sorry. They are available to the hon. the Minister. Here they are. I asked the hon. the Minister whether he had the statements made by these people and I understood that he had. [Interjection.] Mr. Speaker, what good will it do to beat about the bush in connection with this matter? I am trying to do my best in the interests of South Africa but it seems to me that the hon. the Minister does not want assistance. I also told the hon. the Minister in my introductory speech that I had an affidavit in my possession which could possibly result in litigation and that for that reason, although I would give the hon. the Minister the name and certain other information, I could not give him the affidavit itself. He told me this afternoon that he had that affidavit.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I have certain proposals to make and I am following this course in the interests of South Africa. We do not want our good name to be sullied. But this hon. Minister in his irresponsibility and rashness took immediate action. He did not even discuss the matter further. He then challenged me to give him the facts here in this House or else I was not worth my salt. I draw a veil over some of the other statements. I think we will leave the matter there.</p>

<p>But there are other things in regard to which I am not satisfied. I am still not satisfied about this statement by Colonel van den Bergh and the so-called correction that appeared the next day because that correction contained comments in regard to the actions of Great Britain. As far as I have been able to discover, that correction was published in only one newspaper&#x2014;the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Is that Colonel van den Bergh&#x2019;s fault?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whose fault it is but if a man publishes a correction, to whom does he give it? To one newspaper or to all of them? Mr. Speaker, what I want to know is this: Since when has a police official had the right to make statements in regard to international matters, in regard to South Africa&#x2019;s relationships with her nearest neighbours and particularly as far as one of her most important friends is concerned? I am not going to trouble the hon. the Minister any further in regard to Goldreich and Wolpe. But I do resent his comparing two such people with an hon. Senator and an hon. member of this House. (Laughter.) Apparently hon. members do not support me in this. I do not think that that is being fair. I think the hon. the Minister ought to be ashamed of himself for acting in this way in South Africa. But perhaps the hon. the Minister has information that I do not have.</p>

<p>Lastly, in connection with the continued operation of the Act, the hon. gentleman has told us that there is peace and quiet in South Africa but that the Act is still necessary. He was not impressed by the statement of those doctors and psychiatrists; he said that this was all part of a conspiracy for which Mr. Hamilton Russell was responsible. Mr. Russell said that he was not responsible for it. I do not know, Mr. Speaker, but having regard to the effect of this legislation upon South Africa, would it not be advisable to seriously consider the question of not re-proclaiming this measure? That is the request of this side of the House. After all, they do have the right to re-proclaim it if danger threatens again. If there is one thing that will create a good impression it will be a refusal on the part of this hon. Minister to re-proclaim this Act because he is satisfied to-day that there is peace and quiet in South Africa.</p>

<p>My third reason for attacking the Government is the attitude of this Government in regard to the Broederbond and the attitude of the hon. the Minister in this regard. I listened with great interest to the explanation of the hon. the Prime Minister. I want to tell him quite frankly that I do not doubt his word. I accept that that has been his experience. But we have the opinions of two former Prime Ministers in regard to this organization. Mention was made of the possibility that General Hertzog changed his opinion immediately after he had had his interview with Professor van Rooy on this matter in 1935 and shortly after he had made that speech at Smithfield. Yet in 1939 we had an open letter from the hon. gentleman to his son Albert, the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in the following terms (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To my dear Albert,</block>

<block name="quote">On their basis it is clear that the Afrikaans-speaking section of the population will be the only part of the South African population which will count as a nation and the English-speaking section of the Afrikaners will not count as part of the Afrikaner nation. The power must therefore vest in the hands of the self-constituted Afrikaner nation. <span class="col_311-" refersTo="page_0170"/></block>

<p>This book has the following comment to make&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With such a proposal he would have nothing to do. The answer was an uncompromising refusal.</block>

<p>The letter goes on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under no circumstances, I assure you, will I ever give my political co-operation to persons who are not prepared to recognize and accept the principle of full equality between and equal justice for the Afrikaans- and English-speaking sections of our people.</block>

<p>I do not think there is any doubt that the Albert Hertzog Committees which were appointed at the time and set up by the hon. gentleman throughout the country had very close ties with the Broederbond. It is said that General Smuts caused no investigation to be instituted. He had the opportunity. If I understand his statements and his remarks correctly, he did not consider an investigation to be necessary. He was convinced already. Then there is the possibility that the Broederbond itself has undergone a change. In that case we are faced with the circular of September 1962, a photostatic copy of which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> and which makes it clear that their idea of national unity is that the English-speaking section should be assimilated by the Afrikaans-speaking section.</p>

<p>I quoted from a letter to Albert Hertzog, as published in Trollip&#x2019;s book, &#x201C;The South African Opposition, 1939 to 1945&#x201D;. The fact remains that this is a secret organization in our public life with recognized political aims, one of which is the Afrikanerization of our public life and quite possibly the application of organized nepotism in certain cases in order to achieve this end.

<p>I move accordingly as far as the Broederbond is concerned as well as any other secret organizations which the hon. the Prime Minister wishes to include. [Interjections.] I do not want to restrict it. The hon. the Prime Minister says that he considers it to be completely unnecessary. I regard it as necessary as far as the Broederbond is concerned. I think a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made out in this regard. I cannot say that a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made out as far as the Freemasons or the Sons of England are concerned. I do not have sufficient information to pass judgment on Anglo-American. I leave that to the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Finance. I just want to say this. I understand, as far as the Freemasons are concerned, that there are 38 books on Freemasonry in our Library. I understand that the hon. gentleman can visit a bookshop here in Parliament Street, Carmichael and Evans, and there he will find the calendar of the meetings of the Freemasons, of their various lodges, for the year. I looked in vain for something of this kind in connection with the Broederbond. But I think that there are four things on which we must agree. I think we must agree on the commissioners; I think we must agree on the commissioners&#x2019; terms of reference; I think the right must be given to hear evidence under oath and I think the investigation should be a public one.</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Quite correct, discrimination. Well, that is my attitude; I have put it quite clearly.</p>

<p>I want to deal now with matters that were raised by the hon. the Prime Minister himself. His first point dealt with South Africa&#x2019;s foreign policy. The only comment I want to make in this regard is that I still remember the days when Turkey was referred to as &#x201C;the sick man of Europe&#x201D;. I did not think I would live to see the day when the Prime Minister of South Africa would say that South Africa was the healthy man of the West and that every country with the exception of South Africa was sick. In other words, what the world regards as a failure, he considers to be a complete success. The hon. the Prime Minister regards the fact that we are completely isolated from the rest of the world as a complete success because in that way he avoids becoming contaminated by the other countries of the world; he avoids the necessity of sharing their sick bed with them. What actually is this disease? According to the hon. gentleman, the disease is multi-racialism as understood and interpreted by the hon. the Prime Minister. What is the remedy? The remedy, as explained by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;I made a careful note of his words&#x2014;is the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under the circumstances (so he says) it is clear that the White man must maintain himself in his areas, and that the Bantu, the Coloured and the Indian, etc., must be given their rights in their own areas, but because the White man stands steadfastly by what is his own, he is able to co-operate with the other areas which belong to the other race groups.</block>

<p>Where in the Republic, Mr. Speaker, do we find the area of the Coloureds and the Indians? They have never had their own areas. What then is the solution, the remedy, as far as the Republic is concerned? Are these areas still to be demarcated? Are they still going to go so far at some stage as to apply this remedy to South Africa? As far as that is concerned the hon. the Prime Minister <span class="col_315-316" refersTo="page_0172"/>still owes us a reply, and I think this underlines the great difference between the hon. the Prime Minister and myself. I regard South Africa as a multi-racial country; the world considers it to be a multi-racial country; the hon. the Prime Minister does not see it in that light. He is like a man whose body has already been infected with a disease but because of his powers of imagination his brain is not allowed to admit it. Who says that we stand firmly in our own area when in every province, outside of the reserves, in the so-called White areas, there are more non-Whites than there are Whites? If the interpretation of the hon. the Prime Minister is that multi-racialism will only materialize when the non-Whites have representation in the Central Parliament of the country, then we will remain multi-racial, because the Coloured has representation in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman is inclined to ask: Where in the world is there a multi-racial country where the non-Whites have political rights in the same area as the Whites and where a solution to their problems has been found? I think the question should be worded somewhat differently: Which multi-racial state has found a solution to its problems by the application of apartheid and by changing the whole nature of the state? I think the hon. gentleman can only mention one state and that is India and Pakistan. But it cost 3,000,000 lives and there is still friction, particularly in Kashmir, because it was applied half-heartedly, just as will be the case here if the proposals of the hon. the Prime Minister are implemented.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman also raised the question of Cyprus. He said that I cited Cyprus as the model of a race federation. Sir, it certainly does have certain of the characteristics of a race federation, and I have always said that because of the activities of Communism, it would be exposed to tremendous handicaps. And what is happening to-day? In that country the majority is trying to subvert the constitution in order to oppress the minority because up to the present the constitution has remained inviolate; the race federation has survived and the minority has been protected. One might just as well say that the Constitution of South Africa was a failure because during the war years the Ossewabrandwag wanted another kind of government here, a National-Socialist government or something of that nature, and that for that reason they cut telegraph wires and blew up post offices. Did this mean that the Constitution was a failure? No, that is no reasonable representation of the position.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister went so far as to say that we must compare the advantages and dangers of his policy with the advantages and dangers of our policy. In all fairness to the hon. gentleman I want to try to equate those dangers. I want to compare the one group of dangers that is bound up inextricably with the implementation of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy with the group of dangers with which we would have to contend if the policy of the United Party were applied here. When that comparison is drawn we find that since under the policy of the United Party South Africa will be kept as one integral whole we will avoid numbers of the dangers which constitute the greatest dangers under the policy of the hon. the Prime Minister. The first danger that we will avoid will be that our labour forces will not consist of foreigners, of subjects of a foreign state; they will be South African citizens with a common loyalty to the Republic of South Africa. The second advantage that we will enjoy will be that our urban Bantu will not be the cast-off citizens of a foreign state, a state which most of them have never seen, but they will be citizens of the Republic with security of tenure and a realization of the function that they have to fulfil in the community itself, because of the administrative and executive powers that will be given to them by their people, and they will be conscious of their function because of the fact that they will also have representation in their own common councils and in the Parliament that decides their fate, no matter how limited that representation may be. Instead of the whole strategic concept of our defence system being undermined by the breaking up, the fragmention of South Africa, our defence strategy will be based upon our natural borders and that will enable us to offer maximum resistance to Communism and to the nationalism and aggression of the Africa states. There will be no artificially established Bantustans offering footholds to aggressive countries seeking to attack South Africa, no springboards for the propagation of foreign ideologies as far as the Republic is concerned. Nor will there be Bantustans offering a haven to saboteurs or spies trying to escape from South Africa. We will avoid the danger of artificially established foreign states, carved out of South Africa, states that will make use of every opportunity to give assistance to their brothers here in the Republic whom they regard as oppressed subjects. But above all, because we regard South Africa as being one integral whole, we will not be providing a foothold for Black nationalism, Black nationalism assisted by Communism which has so rapidly and easily swallowed up the newly established Africa states and which is hostile to us and which seeks the destruction of South Africa, not only because it forms the basis of Western civilization here in Africa but because it is the basis of White civilization.</p>

<p>We would derive a second benefit. As against pan-Africanism and Communism we could offer something which the hon. the Prime Minister cannot offer, and that is a common loyalty to one Republic on the part of all our citizens in South Africa. We could establish a broad South African nationalism which is magnanimous enough to give consideration to the differences that exist between the various sections of our population.</p>

<p><span class="col_317-318" refersTo="page_0173"/>I do not think it is necessary to take this comparison any further. The hon. the Prime Minister has of course, expressed certain criticism of our plan. He says: &#x201C;You are prepared to give the Bantu eight representatives in the House of Assembly; they will never be satisfied with that. How will you avoid increasing this number until we are eventually swallowed up?&#x201D; That criticism eminates from a gentleman who has given the Coloureds four representatives in this House. Are they satisfied with that? Are they agitating for increased representation? Our Nationalist friends say, &#x201C;They are on a separate roll, the position is quite safe.&#x201D; This holds good for the Coloureds but when it comes to the Bantu then they say that it does not apply to the Bantu. The hon. the Prime Minister also says that he prefers a small White South Africa to a large mixed South Africa. Since when has this small South Africa been White? Even under his policy where every conceivable thing is being done, we still have the position that there are more non-Whites than Whites in the so-called White areas in every province; that this will remain the position and that their numbers will increase more rapidly than those of the Whites.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has also said that the danger exists that in time to come the representatives of the Bantu in this House will be Black. I have stated repeatedly that it is the policy of the United Party that those representatives will be White. But we realize, and we are not afraid of being attacked in this regard, that we cannot deprive them of the right indefinitely of being represented by their own people, particularly in view of the development in the Bantustan areas of the hon. the Prime Minister. I have also said repeatedly that if I have to choose between eight Black representatives in this House and eight Bantustans, I would choose the eight Black representatives every time. I direct these remarks particularly to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell) who made such a half-hearted speech here yesterday and who does not realize what the policy of our party is.</p>

<p>There was also an attempt on the part of the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Prime Minister to say that the protection that we would provide by way of a referendum before there will be any increase in political rights is of no value, because if the number of the electorate increases, those who participate in the referendum will also increase in number.</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I have said repeatedly in this House and outside that all those who are on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll would vote in that referendum and because I realize that when the Bantu are given the franchise on a separate roll this will no longer afford any protection in a general election, I have had the provision included in that pamphlet that once the first stage has been passed&#x2014;which we define in that pamphlet&#x2014;a protective provision will be inserted in the constitution which will be just as effective as the provision by means of which we are protecting our voters at the moment. Various guarantees are given. It will be far easier in a referendum than at an election. An election will not provide that protection when we have Bantu representatives in this House. That is why I say that once that stage is reached protective measures will be taken which will be just as effective as those which protect the electorate at the moment.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister also said that I was prepared to put the Coloureds on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and that I was prepared to allow Coloureds to take their seats in this House. He said that because I had made this statement I would not be able to prevent an Indian from sitting here. Mr. Speaker, how do we prevent a Coloured from taking the place of a representative of the Coloured in this House? If the hon. the Prime Minister can do it, why cannot this side of the House do it? It is silly to argue in that way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am quite prepared to be criticized and attacked in regard to the policy as it stands, but I am not prepared to be attacked when interpretations are given to that policy which are entirely incorrect. I have said that the policy of the United Party is a safer policy as far as the Bantu are concerned and when I ask myself who has the best chance of retaining the friendship and the goodwill of the Indian and the Coloured in South Africa, then there is not the slightest doubt that the United Party with its policy has the better chance and not the hon. the Prime Minister with his policy.</p>

<p>I have one last remark to make. What is this new consultative organization that the hon. the Prime Minister wants to establish? It is a new consultative body in which even the Indians and the Coloureds will be represented although they do not form independent states! Will they receive equal treatment; will they be given the same rights as the Bantu? Is this not merely an attempt to try to steal the race federation plan of the United Party without including all its good points? Mr. Speaker, my time has expired.</p>

<heading>UNIVERSITY OF PORT ELIZABETH BILL</heading>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to direct the attention of the House to the first Order of the Day for to-day, viz. the second reading of the University of Port Elizabeth Bill.</p>

<p>This Bill proposes to establish the University of Port Elizabeth and to provide for the administration and control of the affairs of that university.</p>

<p>It is the established practice of this House that Bills establishing White universities should be introduced and proceeded with as private measures, and had this Bill been introduced by a private member I would have ruled that the Standing Orders relating to Private Bills had to be complied with. The proposed university differs from other White South African universities in that it is the first university to be established <i>ab initio</i>, the other universities having their origins in colleges or similar institutions. Furthermore, I have been informed that the Government regards the measure as one of public policy in that the initiative for the establishment of the university has come primarily from the Government itself. I have also been informed that there are no private individuals or bodies that could easily undertake the responsibility of promoting legislation of this nature.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I have decided that this measure may be introduced as a public measure and I have informed the Minister concerned accordingly.</p>

<p>First Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;University of Port Elizabeth Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p><span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_0176"/>This Bill is one which has a previous history and I undoubtedly owe it to the House to state it here briefly. In the early 1950s a conviction arose in Port Elizabeth on the part of many various bodies and individuals that Port Elizabeth had grown to such an extent that it justified the establishment of a university there. The City Council of Port Elizabeth in 1959 (before I became Minister of Education) sent a deputation to the Government, and also incorporated other bodies in this deputation, to make representations to the Government for the establishment of an independent university. A year before, in 1958, the University of Rhodes also applied to the Government for an extension of its faculties in the form, mainly, of a medical faculty and an engineering faculty. On that occasion the Government then appointed a committee of inquiry consisting of Dr. Wilcocks and Dr. P. J. du Toit, who investigated the circumstances underlying this request. The committee which had to inquire&#x2014;the Wilcocks Committee, as I will hereafter call it&#x2014;then issued a report and considered what the best thing would be to do in this regard. The committee decided to recommend that Rhodes University should have a branch in Port Elizabeth. The Government then considered the matter and decided in favour of the recommendation of this committee.</p>

<p>There were two reasons for the Government taking that decision. The first was that the smaller universities were fast expanding, whilst the larger universities were not fully occupied in respect of the faculties which had been granted to them. That applied to both the medical and the engineering faculties, which on the whole had vacancies at the various universities. But there was a second important reason why an independent university could not be considered. At the same time the non-White university colleges were established. That involved a large-scale financing programme, and organizationally much planning had to be done, and the various lecturers had to be obtained to do the work, and as the result the Government decided that they could not at that moment devote attention to the question of establishing an independent university. That is how it came about that part-time classes, particularly extramural classes, were established at Port Elizabeth under the aegis of Rhodes University. The Government supported such a Bill when it was introduced in 1960 by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker), and it did so particularly for one important reason, namely that the young people employed in the large industries in Port Elizabeth should be given the opportunity to receive university training, even though only extra-murally. This concession made by the Government was, however, not unconditional. The Government imposed conditions, and the most important condition was really contained in the report of Drs. Wilcocks and du Toit, who, <i>inter alia</i>, said in their report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The committee (i.e. they themselves) does not however desire its very largely negative finding to be considered as a recommendation for a final closing of the door to future university developments at Port Elizabeth.</block>

<p>That was already stated in the report of the committee which could not see its way clear to recommend that an engineering faculty and a medical faculty should be given to Rhodes and recommended extra-mural classes.</p>

<p>The other condition which is perhaps fairly generally known, but which is of importance for purposes of the record, was that when the then Deputy Minister of Education (Mr. Vorster, the present Minister of Justice) participated in a debate on 19 February, he stated the standpoint of the Department and of the Government very clearly. <i>Inter alia</i>, he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I must, however, make it very clear on behalf of the Department that, having granted this extension for part-time classes, it should not be inferred from this that the Department has now bound itself for all time. It is possible that in future there may be a claim by Port Elizabeth&#x2014;when perhaps I will no longer be here&#x2014;to become independent, and this extension which is now being allowed should not then be hurled at Port Elizabeth&#x2019;s head and they should not be told: &#x201C;You cannot develop independently because we have now obtained certain vested interests in Port Elizabeth and this is our field of operation.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Referring to the hon. member for Albany, Mr. Vorster further said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member for Albany understands it in that way. Because it is possible that a misunderstanding in this regard may arise in Port Elizabeth and its environs, I think it is only fair and just for me to state now that the part-time classes now being established there should in future be regarded as being subject to any expansion which might take place in Port Elizabeth, when independent action may be taken.</block>

<block name="quote">At the moment, as hon. members know, we have eight full-fledged universities, apart from the University of South Africa. The expansion at our universities is great. It may be that in future other universities may be established, and if that is so and one of those institutions wishes to take root in Port Elizabeth, then this expansion on the part of Rhodes should not be regarded as prohibiting it. As long as we understand each other clearly on that point, there can be no misunderstanding.</block>

<p>I refer to Hansard, Vols. 103, 104 and 105 in that debate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that from this we should certainly draw an inference so as to know precisely where we stand to-day, and that inference is that it is quite clear from <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_0177"/>these two statements that the extension of the activities of Rhodes University in the form of part-time classes in Port Elizabeth should be regarded as an interim measure and was approved as such until such time as an independent university could be established in Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>At this point I briefly want to review the developments following on the institution of these part-time classes. During the course of 1962 various organizations in Port Elizabeth and its environs insisted on having an independent university for Port Elizabeth. Requests came from all directions, and let me say clearly that these requests did not come only from the Afrikaans-speaking, but also from English-speaking people. In order to consider the whole matter thoroughly, I think it was my duty as Minister of Education, in view of the fact that a city as large as Port Elizabeth with the whole of its hinterland made such a request, to appoint a fact-finding committee to ascertain all the facts and to submit a report which I could in turn submit to the Cabinet for consideration and for a decision in principle. This fact-finding commission, with Dr. J. H. Robbertse, the director of our Research Bureau at the head of it, a man with great experience of universities, one who grew up with universities and who has continually dealt with their affairs, went to Port Elizabeth and they submitted a report to me which for the sake of convenience I will call the Robbertse Report.</p>

<p>Advertisements were placed in the public Press, notice was given to all possible persons and bodies and organizations, and they were invited to give evidence before this committee, to draft memoranda and to submit them, and with all this information at their disposal they then submitted the report which I have here before me. The report of this committee is very convincing, and it unequivocally recommends that an independent university is justified in Port Elizabeth. I am convinced that if I just quote a few passages from the report of the committee, this House will agree with me that it is an important matter. The committee found that the area which can be served by this university, always bearing in mind that it is not a unilingual university but that it will have to be made available to both sections of the population, is an area with a large hinterland, the Eastern Cape, and for the purposes of the investigation the area was taken which lies within a line drawn from Mossel Bay northwards to the Orange River and then eastwards and southwards all along the borders of the Cape Province including the area known to us as the Eastern Cape.</p>

<p>The Committee made a surprisingly wide investigation. In the first place, they took the figures of the population census of 1960 and analysed them with regard just to the university cities, and if Port Elizabeth were to obtain a university, which would then be the ninth one, the ninth residential university then, according to the census, Port Elizabeth, in so far as the population figures are concerned, stands fifth on the list after Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria. According to the census, Port Elizabeth had 94,085 White inhabitants in 1960, Bloemfontein (which has a university) 61,000, Pietermaritzburg 39,000, Potchefstroom 20,000, Grahamstown 10,500, and Stellenbosch 10,600.</p>

<p>The phenomenal population growth in the area known as the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage-Despatch area becomes evident from the fact that whilst in 1936 there were only 27,700 Afrikaans-speaking people in that area, that number has increased to 61,800 in 1960 and the English-speaking people increased from 41,800 in 1936 to 59,470, and if all the Whites speaking other languages are added we find that in that small area there is a White population of 125,446 persons.</p>

<p>The first point I want to make is that if we look at the population figures in other countries and pose the question when universities are established, we should not be put off by that and we should not say that sufficient provision has been made. This report went into the matter and pointed out that in Sussex, at Brighton, a university was established in 1961 with 50 students and nine lecturers. In Kiel (Germany) a university was established in 1949, and in 1963-4 the number of enrolled students was 491. In Canada universities were established in 1954 where there was a population of 58,000, and in 1959 at Waterloo, with a population of 16,000, one was also established. I mention these facts to show that it is no argument at all to say that there are already too many universities. I shall come back to this later.</p>

<p>Since 1936&#x2014;I now want to make the point that a university which can provide education in both languages has become an absolute and urgent necessity in the Eastern Cape&#x2014;the number of Afrikaans-speaking people has more than doubled, viz. from 27,000 to 61,000 in 1960. The total White population of Port Elizabeth has therefore more than doubled since 1936.</p>

<p>Port Elizabeth has the largest municipal area in the whole of the Republic. It comprises 106 square miles. The net taxable valuation of Port Elizabeth in 1961 already amounted to R160,000,000. In the year 1930 buildings to the value of more than R1,000,000 were completed, whilst in 1960 buildings to the value of more than R7,000,000 were completed. There is enough water&#x2014;8,702,000,000 gallons capacity in storage dams, and just recently the Minister of Water Affairs gave his approval to another 40,000,000 being taken out of the Kouga Dam. Electric power is unlimited in that port. The consumption of electricity is always an indication of the growth and progress of a town, and in 1927 the revenue derived from the supply of electricity was R181,000, in 1947 it was R1,000,000, and in 1958 it was more than R4,000,000. I could give many other examples, but I do not wish to weary hon. members by doing so. With all this tremendous expansion and development, <span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_0178"/>the question of the available educational facilities for these people was then investigated, and I now read from the evidence of school principals contained in the report. From that it appears that many more Afrikaans-speaking students from the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage area, and possibly also from the hinterland, would go to a university provided there is one in Port Elizabeth. Whereas on an average 52 per cent of the matriculants in the country go to a university, it is only approximately 10 per cent in respect of certain Afrikaans schools in the Port Elizabeth area.</p>

<p>The example mentioned in the report is that of the High School Cillie. The enrolment there was 700 students, the number who matriculate every year is about 75, and the number who annually thus far have gone to a university from that school was approximately eight. That school serves the middle and lower income groups of the population. When the question is investigated as to how many matriculants would go to the university next year if one were established in Port Elizabeth, the reply was that there would be 25, i.e. three times as many as those who go to university at present.</p>

<p>A second matter which the committee investigated very thoroughly is this: Will this really harm Rhodes? What will happen there? The finding is that in the majority of cases a university does not draw its students from its immediate vicinity alone. The committee analysed where Rhodes&#x2019; students came from and found that of the 1,606 students then enrolled, 928 came from the whole of the Cape Province and 678 from other parts of the Republic, Rhodesia and even from overseas. Therefore the greater proportion came from the Cape Province but not from the immediate environs of Rhodes. In fact, that is true of all universities. The number of students at Rhodes coming from the Transvaal is 138. We can make the same analysis in connection with every university in the country. After it has built up a certain tradition it draws students not only on geographic lines.</p>

<p>There are many other things I could quote from the report, but quite independently of this report Professor A. C. Cilliers, who had to investigate the financing of universities last year, investigated the Holloway formula for university financing, together with his committee. Quite independently of this report, Professor A. C. Cilliers submitted a report&#x2014;he knew nothing about the first-mentioned report which was submitted to me and which was not published&#x2014;in which, <i>inter alia</i>, he says the following, after investigating the financing of universities&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Whites will still for an appreciable time have to render the services to the large mass of non-Whites which are demanded by university education if the country develops at an extraordinary tempo in the economic and industrial spheres.</block>

<p>If we compare the White population of South Africa with the White populations of other Commonwealth countries and the English-speaking United States, South Africa is at present second on the list, and probably second in the world in so far as the ratio between the number of students and the total White population is concerned. In 1911 South Africa had only 1,125 White students out of a White population of 1,116,806, or one student for approximately every 1,000 White inhabitants. The United States then had one for every 250. Fifty years after Union South Africa had reduced this figure to one for every 83, and in the U.S.A. it was reduced to one for every 50. Therefore during the past half-century South Africa has made appreciable progress in regard to the creation of facilities for higher education. South Africa&#x2019;s progress in the economic and industrial spheres was just as phenomenal. Without any fear of contradiction it may be said that the last-mentioned progress would not have been possible without the first-mentioned. It was our universities which provided the necessary leaders and trained assistants in almost every sphere of activity and development. Professor Cilliers continues to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nevertheless there are evidently still people who are of the opinion that we have too many universities for our small population, viz. eight so-called residential or teaching universities, as well as the University of South Africa, for approximately 3,000,000 Whites. But the nine universities plus the five universities for non-Whites provide for the requirements of approximately 16,000,000 people, consisting of the two White language groups and a number of non-White racial groups. In actual fact, according to the latest official figures, provision is made for altogether 41,817 students, including 3,893 non-Whites out of 16,366,192 inhabitants of the Republic of South Africa and South West Africa. Viewed from this angle, the applicable figure is not one student for every 83 inhabitants, but one for every 391. The fact is that some of our larger universities are fast becoming full. Three of them already had more than 5,000 students in 1960. If they want to retain their unitary characteristics and their high level of efficiency, they will sooner or later have to limit their numbers by means of some method of selection. Part of the surplus will in the meantime have to be absorbed by the smaller universities, and possibly it will not be many years before they also reach the 5,000 or 6,000 mark.</block>

<p>Then the report continued to point out that it takes approximately ten years for a university which is established to get going properly, and unless we ensure doing so in the large centres we will not succeed in our planning to provide for the needs of the Republic. Therefore we to-day have a piece of legislation before the House as the result of the <span class="col_329-330" refersTo="page_0179"/>recommendations of these two committees, and we dare not delay longer. We must act immediately and ensure that the necessary facilities are provided for steady, gradual development, because in regard to this matter one cannot set to work hastily. Gradual development must take place.</p>

<p>We set certain conditions before the establishment of this University could even receive the attention of the Government. The most important condition set to the inhabitants of Port Elizabeth was that in terms of the subsidy system the Government could not consider introducing any legislation to establish a new university by 1965 before at least R750,000 was either collected or properly guaranteed. I may say that this figure of R750,000 has been far exceeded; it is already more than R1,000,000. I may say further that the greatest proportion of this amount has already been received and the rest has been guaranteed in such a manner that it satisfied the Government, the Treasury, and everybody else who had to investigate the matter in detail.</p>

<p>The second condition was that land should be made available, and in spite of all the confusion and the political fuss which was made the City Council of Port Elizabeth decided, right at the beginning, to make available 250 morgen for this university. Moreover, their Property Committee has recommended making available another 250 morgen. That has not yet been approved of by the City Council. Having so much land available, they will probably ensure that this university will have a hinterland comprising 500 morgen. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate those farsighted people, in spite of the differences which arose, on the unanimity which was reached and their wonderful co-operation with the Government, those people who feel that here something great will be established not only for the sake of Port Elizabeth but for the sake of a very great cause.</p>

<p>In order to publicize this matter as widely as possible, I published a draft Bill in a <i>Government Gazette Extraordinary</i> on 22 November. I hope hon. members have read it and are acquainted with the good intention of that Bill. Before it was even approved of by the Government or by the law advisers, I sent this draft Bill confidentially to the Rector of Rhodes, to the City Council of Port Elizabeth and to the Rector of Stellenbosch University, with a request that they should give their comments and make suggestions before we put it into more final form for submission to the Cabinet and the law advisers. I heartily want to thank those bodies for the suggestions and the comments they made and for their splendid co-operation, with the result that to-day we have a Bill which in my opinion complies with the requirements, and when in a moment I come to the provisions of the Bill I shall suggest various amendments which can be dealt with in the Committee Stage. <i>Inter alia</i>, Rhodes&#x2014;and here I want to pay special tribute to its Rector, Dr. Hyslop&#x2014;took a resolution when it was faced with the question whether it could still continue in Port Elizabeth or not, which briefly amounted to this, that in its efforts to serve the cause of higher education it would grant such support to the new university as it considered necessary to promote higher education and in the interests of the Eastern Cape. That clearly proved to me that in spite of all the political dust which was kicked up, particularly by the Press, I was dealing here with a man with very high academic qualifications, a scientist and a person who was able to elevate himself above the petty squabbles in connection with this matter. I am not saying that he agreed with everything, but when he was faced with the inevitable he adopted this standpoint: Everything is settled now, and now I will heartily co-operate for the sake of the expansion and the promotion of higher education in the Eastern Cape. Rhodes further decided that it would offer for sale to the new university the property it had acquired in Bird Street, and that it would confine its activities in Port Elizabeth to field work which may be considered necessary where any projects are undertaken by Rhodes for post-graduate study or any other project. This action by Rhodes made it unnecessary to submit this Bill to the House as a hybrid Bill, and it also made it unnecessary to amend the Private Act of Rhodes. I accept the word of people who say: We will do this. And when they ask me one day to amend this Private Act of theirs, to bring it into line with the practice, only then will I do so. I accepted that this would be the position without amending the Rhodes Private Act.</p>

<p>The comment of the University of Stellenbosch amounted to this, that it was willing to co-operate heartily and to play its role together with Rhodes, and to shoulder the extra burden of helping to bring to maturity this university right from its inception. I must say that the Mayor and the City Council of Port Elizabeth, when I sent them the provisions of the Bill, decided at a special meeting to accept it.</p>

<p>I now come to the main provisions of the Bill, with which I just want to deal briefly. At the outset I just want to say that one serious objection was brought to my notice: Here you come along with an old method, which was tried in Pretoria, of establishing a university where both languages would be used equally as the media of instruction, but it is an obsolete thing which has proved to be a failure, and now you want to deceive us, because very soon this university will not have two languages as the media of instruction, but it will degenerate again into a unilingual university, and it will again become an Afrikaans university. I want to remind hon. members of the old Roman adage that the times change and that we change with the times. What happened in 1916 is no longer true to-day, and this side of the House&#x2014;I hope this does not become a political matter&#x2014;believes that times have changed and that <span class="col_331-332" refersTo="page_0180"/>the people have changed to such an extent that it will no longer be an experiment but that it will rather be a demonstration of the real seriousness with which the South African people regard it, and of the ability of the South African to understand what he is taught in either language. I think our degree of bilingualism has increased to such an extent that it would be very wrong to say that it will be a failure even before it has begun. Therefore I wish to do my utmost in formulating the Bill in such a way as to put this very clearly. No possibility should be left in the Bill to evade it, because the law is not everything; I believe that the spirit in which this matter is regarded will be a revelation not only to us as South Africans but to the whole world, that in this country we have decided to co-operate even though we are a people with two languages and two traditions and two cultures. The provision in regard to the media of instruction in the Bill&#x2014;it is contained in Clause 14&#x2014;is worded in such a way that at the moment it may be open to another interpretation. It says that the media of instruction of the university are English and Afrikaans and that the circumstances in which a student is entitled to be taught through the medium of the one or the other language will be prescribed by statute. As it is formulated here a student may be put in a very difficult position, whereas the most important point is really the circumstances. Therefore I have decided in the Committee Stage to amend this formula as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The mediums of instruction at the university shall be English and Afrikaans and the circumstances in which the instruction shall or may be given through the one or the other shall be determined by the Senate and shall be so determined in such a manner that if the proficiency of the teaching staff in the use of those two languages and the number of students in question permit, the two languages shall as far as possible be used on an equal basis for that purpose.</block>

<p>To make it quite clear what I intend moving in the Committee Stage, I shall also read it in English&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The mediums of instruction at the university shall be English and Afrikaans and the circumstances in which the instruction shall or may be given through the one or the other shall be determined by the Senate and shall be so determined in such a manner that if the proficiency of the teaching staff in the use of those two languages and the number of students in question permit, the two languages shall as far as possible be used on an equal basis for that purpose.</block>

<p>I hope that when hon. members have had an opportunity of studying it they will be satisfied with it.</p>

<p>But of course. One may have a man who cannot give it in both languages. One duplicates the work, and that is parallel medium, and it will be a very expensive matter. But we can discuss that in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, you prefer dual medium?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>My standpoint is that if a student has passed his matriculation, for which both official languages are necessary, whether he passed it on the A or the B basis or not, then such a student who attends the university is quite able to follow lectures in both languages. Secondly, one does not compel him as a student to write his examinations otherwise than in the language he prefers, whether the examinations are oral or written. If you want to regard that as dual medium, I am willing to call it by that name, but I just want to say that then its meaning is not the same as that which the hon. member has in mind when it comes to other schools below university standard. It is a horse of quite a different colour.</p>

<p>Another thing I notice which evidently causes hon. members concern is that this will again be a Government-controlled university, particularly as the result of Clause 8 of the Bill, which deals with the appointment of the principal or rector. The law advisers preferred it to be drafted in the way it reads here because they say that this is a better form than the form in which the other Acts put the matter. In this Bill it says that someone who is approved by the Minister is appointed as Rector of the University and the Council, and if the Minister and the council cannot agree as to who should be appointed as Rector, the Rector is appointed in the other way prescribed by statute. I consulted the law advisers and asked why we should at this stage, when establishing a new university, want a better formulation; I prefer to state the intention of the Bill in the same words, and I then refer to the Private Act of Rhodes University which reads that the Rector of the University is appointed by the Council in the way prescribed by statute subject to the approval of the Minister. In English it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principal of the university shall, subject to the approval of the Minister, be appointed in the manner prescribed by statute.</block>

<p>That is what I will propose in the Committee Stage, in order to give hon. members the <span class="col_333-334" refersTo="page_0181"/>assurance that there is no motive here other than precisely to give effect to the method still applied in a few universities, and which is also gradually disappearing. Therefore I took the example of Rhodes so that hon. members need not think that I want to do something else here which departs from the existing order.</p>

<p>The next point I want to draw attention to in this Bill is the various faculties indicated in the Bill. It has also been said that this Bill really provides for a duplication of faculties and that if the Government had just established a new university with all the main faculties necessary to comply with its needs, that would have been a good thing. But that is not how a university is established. Where experience first has to be gained, one usually begins with what is basic and easier, and now the Bill allows them to start with the faculties mentioned in it, but it is also clearly stated that the Council is not prohibited from prescribing other faculties. Therefore the Council, which is an autonomous body, can say what other faculties it wants, but of course it must obtain the Government&#x2019;s approval for that, because great expenditure is involved.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words in regard to the examinations. Apart from its own lecturers, examiners from other universities will also be appointed as external examiners. In the beginning the old University of South Africa was the mother of all the university colleges, and as they became autonomous and reached maturity they became universities. They then developed and set their own examinations, which are recognized in this country as well as overseas. Here we have decided not to make this a university college first and to entrust it to the guardianship of the University of South Africa, but the whole set-up is that here we have two existing, recognized universities, Rhodes and Stellenbosch, representing the two language groups, and they are really the guardians of this university until such time as it reaches maturity and its examinations as well as its degrees receive the necessary recognition, and then the supervision of Stellenbosch and Rhodes will decrease until it disappears completely. In the examinations we will not only make use of examiners from these two universities, but we can call in an external examiner from any university. Further, it is provided in the Bill that students of Rhodes who are already studying in Port Elizabeth under this section of Rhodes may continue their studies at the new university as if it is the same university, and all the examinations they passed in that section of Rhodes in Port Elizabeth will be recognized by the new university. The Bill provides for the protection of freedom of religion of both students and teaching staff, and in order to make this university run smoothly right from the beginning it is also provided that vacancies in the university, and particularly in its Council, will not invalidate any actions. If one looks at Clause 22, and also at Clause 9, which constitutes the Council, one sees that there will right from the outset be a Council which is autonomous and where nominations may possibly be obtained from existing institutions without the statute prescribing how that should be done, such councillors may be appointed. And until such time as it is provided by statute how they should be nominated, the Minister can nominate them and they may act forthwith.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by telling the House that a very unsavoury and unfortunate incident took place in Port Elizabeth when this proposed establishment of a university became known. That was a great pity. I think that particularly with regard to higher education, a matter which is of such great importance to the country, it is a pity to drag in irrelevant matters and that much suspicion was aroused, but eventually on 19 September last year, when I had the opportunity of meeting representatives of Rhodes and of the City Council and we had a round table conference, we were able to iron out our differences. I think Port Elizabeth is surely a very happy city now that everything is over and that this conflict no longer exists. They shook each other&#x2019;s hands and decided to make a success of it. Now we are going to make a start in 1965. The university will have as its guardians proved foster-parents, Stellenbosch and Rhodes. I am convinced, in view of the spirit in which this matter is being approached by both these high-standing institutions, that guidance will be given to a young university which will lead it on the way to maturity. I believe that the spirit and the enthusiasm are such that this new institution will soon be developed into an independent university with the necessary authority. You will also permit me, Sir, on this occasion to express my thanks and appreciation to the Universities of Stellenbosch and Rhodes and for the valuable co-operation I had from both Rectors, and for the friendly and interested advice particularly of Dr. Hyslop, who from the very nature of the matter had to co-operate intimately. I also want to mention the bigheartedness and assistance and the sacrifices made by the City Council of Port Elizabeth, both the former Council and its Mayor and the present Council and its Mayor. I want to say that those people proved that the matter lay near to their hearts. Then I also want to mention the inspiration and the confidence displayed by a group of very good friends of Port Elizabeth, both Afrikaans and English speaking, who not only spoke with confidence and conviction but put their hands to the plough and within a short time achieved a record by making available such a sum of money for the university, unselfishly and without deriving any benefit from it, in order to achieve this great ideal. I move.</p>

<p>I think it is no more than right that I should, at the very outset, not thank the Minister&#x2014;we practically expected it of him&#x2014;but express our appreciation to him for having stated his case so <span class="col_335-336" refersTo="page_0182"/>clearly and in such great detail. It is not often that he speaks in that vein of completely leaving party politics aside and of even going so far as to submit United Party policy to this House. His speech has made it easier for us to understand the background of this whole question and also to appreciate it better. I on this side of the House shall be much briefer than the hon. the Minister because it is not necessary for me to go into the history of this matter.</p>

<p>Have you anything to say?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. friend will only remain quiet he too will learn something. I shall try to state the case of this side in broad principle. There are people on this side of the House who were, and still are, concerned with the university to be established at Port Elizabeth, people who will, <i>inter alia</i>, also deal with the background thoroughly and raise any points which the Minister may have omitted to raise. In the course of dealing with this Bill we shall touch upon various points but I think we should right at the outset, as the hon. the Minister has also done, draw attention to the praiseworthy attitude which the University of Rhodes adopted when they discovered that they were to be pushed aside and that they went so far not only of expressing their satisfaction with the steps that were being taken, but of even playing the leading role to-day in the establishment of that university.</p>

<p>The Minister has pointed out the new direction which is being followed in higher education in this Bill and you will allow me, Mr. Speaker, just in passing to point out what the approach of this side of the House is to bilingualism in South Africa. You will allow me, Sir, to point out that it has always been the policy of this side, as far as the schools in our country are concerned, to bring the two national groups together and at the same time to recognize the rights of the parent in the education of his child. In other words, we believe in parental choice, but then we go further and we say that we must consequently have certain institutions that will satisfy the parent as far as the education of his child is concerned&#x2014;single medium schools, parallel medium schools, and dual medium schools. As far as universities are concerned we believe, of course, as we have indicated time and again in this House, in the autonomy of our universities but we realize too that the university follows upon our primary and secondary schools and that it plays an even more important role in our lives. Had I been Minister of Education it would have meant that the United Party would have made a special grant to any university who introduced the principle which is to-day laid down here, without interfering in the domestic affairs of that university. That is the background. I thought it was necessary for me to say that so that you, Mr. Speaker, and hon. members would understand precisely what the attitude of the United Party was, an attitude which has been and will be consistently put into effect.</p>

<p>To return to the Bill itself I want to say that in the light of the figures the hon. the Minister was kind enough to submit to us, figures which are more or less the same as those we have, this side of the House is not opposed to the establishment of a university at Port Elizabeth. We also believe, as the hon. the Minister has said, that there are enough people in Port Elizabeth and in the adjoining area, the Eastern Province, to justify it and that they are entitled to such an institution. We also know that the people in the Eastern Province want such an institution. We also know that the majority of their Members of Parliament and of the Provincial Council&#x2014;as a matter of fact I think every one of them&#x2014;want such an institution for Port Elizabeth. The fact that Port Elizabeth has already raised R1,000,000 is proof positive that they are willing to assume the necessary responsibility for the establishment of such a university. Consequently, as far as that is concerned, we are not opposed to the establishment of a new university at Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The Bill, however, goes further; in my opinion this Bill contains another principle and that is that a specific type of university will be established and although the hon. the Minister is going to amend Clause 41 somewhat I think that, as far as the principle is concerned, that will not be changed. I think he is making a mistake if he amends it in such a way that the Senate will replace the Council, but that is another matter. The principle remains unaltered, namely, a bilingual university because it will be possible to use both languages of the Republic. We do not know at this stage how they are going to do that because that is left, as the Bill reads at the moment, in the hands of the Council, but at the moment in the hands of the Senate. I do not know how the Minister can leave such an administrative matter in the hands of the Senate. It is usually left in the hands of the Council, but we shall discuss that at a later stage. It appears that the principle of using both languages as medium is being recognized and introduced, though how they will use the two languages as medium will depend on practical considerations as far as lectures are concerned. It means that you will introduce the two languages as medium but only when that is possible in practice. The question arises, as it was also posed by the hon. the Minister in the course of his speech, whether they will have parallel medium or dual medium. The Senate of the university, if the amendment of the Minister is accepted, or the Council of the university, as the Bill provides at the moment, must decide whether it is possible, depending on circumstances and practical demands. The hon. the Minister, who was a school principal, will know what a major role practical considerations play when it comes to certain policy decisions. In this connection, if the amendment is accepted, the Senate will have to decide what will be done <span class="col_337-338" refersTo="page_0183"/>in practice&#x2014;whether both languages will be used or whether only one language will be used at a time. Let me give an example. There are usually a large number of students in the first year B.A. history class and in that case it will be the easiest thing in the world for the Senate to decide to introduce parallel medium instruction, in other words, to have separate classes, the one having English as medium and the other having Afrikaans as medium. If the class can be divided into two the one student will attend the class where Afrikaans is the medium of instruction and the other one will attend the class where English is the medium of instruction. But when you come to the M.A. degree class and only five of those students remain, for example, it would be stupid to let those five students sit in two separate classrooms and in that case the dual medium system can be introduced. That is what I imagine will happen had I been a member of the Senate and had we to decide what the medium of instruction should be. The whole question of having two languages as medium of instruction therefore depends on practical considerations.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we of course accept this aspect of the Bill as well. We accept it because it is United Party policy. That has always been United Party policy. May I congratulate the hon. the Minister on ultimately having seen the light in spite of the policy his party has been following over the past 15 years, and on having realized that the policy of this side is in the interests of South Africa. [Interjections.] I am convinced that as far as primary and secondary schools are concerned as well, hon. members opposite will also accept our policy one of these days, just as they have accepted our immigration policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have certain misgivings, misgivings which may be quite unfounded, and we hope they are unfounded, but we have them. One of our misgivings is that the university will in any case eventually become a single medium institution. My attitude is this: If you act in the correct way and in all sincerity right from the start you cannot be blamed if your actions fail. Even if it is done deliberately I do not think the Minister can be blamed for it; the Council or the Senate will be to blame. But I shall tell you, Sir, when this dual medium idea is going to fail. It can fail when we as politicians start to interfere; when we as politicians start to interfere in the domestic affairs of the university. When we as politicians start exploiting this issue for party political purposes then either the one or the other section will be afraid to attend that university.</p>

We must not exploit the position and frighten the one or other section. How can I blame the Council in 10 or 20 years&#x2019; time if the majority of their students are English speaking? Then I cannot expect them to continue to have Afrikaans as a medium of instruction.

He ought to know&#x2014;I think he has been told; he has only forgotten it&#x2014;that Stellenbosch and Cape Town and the University of South Africa were not established as a result of a private Bill.

It is true that we have heard the Minister, but Parliament itself has not as yet had the opportunity of hearing the views of the people who are concerned in this matter.

<p>It appeared to me at the beginning of the year, before I had further evidence on the matter, that because of this legislation Rhodes was getting the worst of it, but the hon. the Minister assures me that is not the case, and Rhodes itself says that it is satisfied and that it will co-operate and we appreciate that. What we should like to know is why there has been this change of attitude on the part of Rhodes. Rhodes is the only body who can tell us that and who can allay our suspicions. Then I should also like to know this from Rhodes, because the Minister did not tell us that to-day: Was Rhodes itself not prepared to become a bilingual university? I understand Rhodes did make the offer to the Minister: &#x201C;Leave us as we are; let things remain as they are; we shall switch over and become a bilingual university.&#x201D; We as a House of Assembly do not have the opportunity now of getting to the bottom of these things by listening to the people who were and still are concerned in this matter. I hope the hon. the Minister will still decide at this late stage&#x2014;surely there is no great hurry&#x2014;to accept our suggestion. We suggest it in all friendliness but urgently.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 10 which I have discussed with the legal adviser of the hon. the Minister. I do not know whether he has submitted my views to the hon. the Minister but I am sure had he done so and had the Minister been in the good mood in which he is to-day, our suggestion would have been accepted. Clause 10 reads</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) The senate shall consist of&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) the principal of the university, who shall be chairman;</li>

<li>(b) two other members of the Council elected by the Council;</li>

<li>(c) the professors of the university;</li>

<li>(d) the persons appointed by the Minister, subject to the provisions of subsection (2), in respect of each faculty of the university, and who shall be professors in a corresponding faculty of Rhodes University or the University of Stellenbosch.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(2) The members of the senate appointed by the Minister under paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) shall be not less than the other members of the senate.</li>

</ol>

<p>I want to ask a few questions in this connection. In the first instance, it is not clear to me whether the number of members of the senate appointed by the Minister will be drawn equally from Rhodes and Stellenbosch. In the second place I cannot understand why it &#x201C;shall be not less&#x201D; than the other members of the senate. As the Bill is worded at the moment he may appoint more than half the number. But the most important aspect of the whole matter is this&#x2014;and it surprises me&#x2014;that the University of Stellenbosch in particular, that university which is so proud of its autonomy, is prepared to allow the Minister to appoint people from its own ranks to the senate of the University of Port Elizabeth without its approval. I know the Minister will tell me that he will naturally in practice consult the principal or the council but his Bill does not lay that down. The Bill says that the Minister may, irrespective of the wishes of Stellenbosch or of Rhodes, appoint members of their senates to the senate of the University of Port Elizabeth, without their approval. If the Minister bears them ill will he can ignore them, or if I were ever to become Minister and I bore them ill will I could ignore them. [Interjections.] My hon. friend over there need not be afraid; I shall not appoint him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, those are my misgivings but for the rest, in principle, we have faith in this university which is to be established at Port Elizabeth; it has our blessing. We also trust that the actions of the university will always be above suspicion, that it will always base its commissions and omissions on scientific principles, unprejudiced by any party or pressure from whoever it may be. May I express this hope in particular that that university will develop in such a way in future that it will not be influenced by any politician and that it will be to the great benefit of our South African nation and to our education in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mostert">

<from><span class="col_341-342" refersTo="page_0185"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp). We have, in the past, often worked together for education in South Africa, and we have thought much together. But what strikes me here is that he does not find anything vitally wrong with the Bill; he agrees whole-heartedly and pronounces his blessing on the university-to-be, and in this I wish to support him. But then he talks about the policy of the one party or the other in this House. I as educationist&#x2014;and I think that I have quite a bit of experience&#x2014;have never in the 16 years that I have been here, tried to associate any educational matter with the policy of either of the political parties. I have always endeavoured to keep it free from any party political policy and I am grieved that here claim is laid upon some principles as being those of the United Party. I should prefer the parties not even to be mentioned. On reading the Bill for the first time in November I said to myself: Here is something striving after an ideal, and that ideal, as it was so well put by the hon. member, is that the university in its growth, in its being and actions should always be above suspicion. But I should like to have a yet higher ideal, namely that it should be a free academical institution and not a political brewery. What I have advocated here in the past under the heading &#x201C;academical&#x201D; is a striving after truth by people who are not biased by party politics; an aspiration to seek the truth, to analyse that truth and to use it for the benefit of humanity. In so far as this university can do this it shall have my whole-hearted support. The hon. member used the word <i>volte-face</i> in connection with the attitude of Rhodes. It was not really a <i>volte-face</i>. The reason why Rhodes gave its support to this movement was that under the guidance of the principal those people thought academically. It is a well-known fact that when we think academically our efforts must be successful and that we will understand one another. That is why I feel that this request that this matter be referred to a Select Committee should not just be acceded to without more ado. The hon. member knows himself that his main reason for this is to give the people concerned a hearing. This Bill is not a conclusive Bill; it is an authority Bill and we are in a great hurry to tackle it to-day, the first Monday, in order to help that community so that this matter may be finalized before 1965. This authorizing Bill contains but one principle and that is that there is going to be a university. It must now return and then the new council of that university must draw up a statute for us to study. A university must have a statute. When we have that statute to be incorporated in the Bill it will tell us what those people want, not only what the public wants&#x2014;that is not so important&#x2014;but what the academical people, whose task it will be to run this university, want. I think we should be patient and when the statute is introduced in the House there will be ample opportunity to discuss the matter thoroughly and to shape it properly.</p>

<p>Serious thought will particularly have to be given to the matter of language medium. I am, of course, not&#x2014;as the hon. members know&#x2014;so much allergic to the language medium as to the real academical dignity of the institution. I attended Grey University College and we were satisfied with whichever language the lecturer or professor chose to use. We never quarrelled over which language we were going to hear. Take economics, a subject in which I majored. We had English text-books, either printed in England or America. But if we did not wish to take economics through the medium of English we would have had to take it through the medium of Netherlands, which was still more difficult. We therefore got on with the job in silence. However, circumstances will show us what will happen in this case. I am glad that the Minister said that the languages will be Afrikaans and English&#x2014;not Afrikaans or English. A student who studies some subjects through the medium of one language and others through the medium of the other will find that no harm has been done. That is how I studied. In other words, Mr. Speaker, we come to the conclusion that the old method of carefully weighing out so many ounces of the one and so many ounces of the other medium is out-dated. We have advanced too far. We have advanced in our everyday life, I am not referring to our schools now, to the stage where we have reached that ideal where it matters not which language we hear or speak. At least I have. I feel sorry that the previous speaker had spoken about schools and the parents&#x2019; choice. We are not dealing with the parents&#x2019; choice now. If we want to talk on that matter we must consider Natal and I am not prepared to do so now.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I should like to broach, it is that word &#x201C;autonomy&#x201D;. I am one of those who believe that an institution worthy of the name of a university must have its independence and must think for itself. If the word &#x201C;autonomy&#x201D; is used so soon one must necessarily think of the financing of such a university. In America we have for instance the &#x201C;State universities&#x201D; and the &#x201C;endowment universities&#x201D;. The latter is completely autonomous. They have their own money and they carry on absolutely independently. They do what they like. There are universities in Europe which are subjected completely to some higher authority. If ever this should come about in South Africa I should now like to say to our friends on the other side that I sincerely hope that the State will not concern itself with the domestic matters of that university. Concerning the policy, if that is the correct word, of the university we are all agreed that the university should be as autonomous as possible. We should, however, always remember that it is dependent on the State financially and that legally the State will protect it. The State protects this institution and therefore the State must have some say <span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_0186"/>in certain matters like for instance the approval of the appointment of a Rector. We realize how soon, especially in a community like this, a row can develop over the appointment or nomination of a Rector who does not meet with the approval of a certain section of the community. Much local unpleasantness can be caused if the final decision lies with the Council but this can easily be overcome by the Minister saying: I am referring this appointment back to the Council; the person you have nominated will cause dissension; do not appoint him; look for someone else; I have no one of my own choice, but nominate another one and I shall consider his nomination. I think this safeguards the local authority against a very odious task.</p>

<p>I should like to mention just one more matter. In England, e.g., upon whom we model our education in most cases, we find the old-established universities based on the old academical system. There are universities in Europe, e.g. Leipzig, Heidelberg, etc., institutions which were founded by the more developed section of the community, be it the aristocracy or the well-to-do section. But it was realized that whether the parent was rich or poor, whether he belonged to the aristocracy or not, the children of the working class, to coin a phrase, were given a new chance in life. Not for one moment do I wish to imply that Port Elizabeth is made up of only the working class. That is the last thing I want to do. Universities in England have, however, been established on the same principle that we are dealing with here. We have Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and other small universities particularly which cater for the youth of the environment, for the children of the industrialists and businessmen of that town. I am not advocating a policy of class or group-formation, and that is why I am devoting much time to this point. On the contrary, I am only endeavouring to make it possible for a certain section of the youth to become university trained locally and inexpensively. I think that we also agree upon this point. Years ago, I think it was in 1926, I was in Port Elizabeth, and I studied the community. I also studied that of Durban. Those communities have changed beyond all recognition. New population groups with academical desires have been added. Whereas in the past there was no need for even a primary school the want is felt to-day for a university. I am glad therefore that this university will be part of that community.</p>

<p>The question was mooted&#x2014;fortunately it was answered satisfactorily, and therefore I shall skip it&#x2014;why Rhodes does not go to Port Elizabeth, or why the Port Elizabeth students do not go to Rhodes? Rhodes will not forsake Grahamstown. They are too deeply rooted there and I do not think they will ever move from there to pitch camp in Port Elizabeth. However, I still believe there are still students who should grow up in that area where their interests will be catered for. What I mean by this is that Port Elizabeth will develop into an essentially industrial centre and there they will have to equip themselves academically, whilst Rhodes is in a much more academical and ecclesiastic environment. Rhodes has made such progress that many students from outside our borders go to it. Rhodes, together with the University of Stellenbosch, are now assisting this new university to gain prestige, a prestige of which it shall be worthy. It has been said, and I accept it, that for a new university to establish itself, ten years are required, but ten years are not enough. Some universities overseas took hundreds of years to attain status properly.</p>

<p>Whilst pleading to-day&#x2014;not quarrelling, because we are in agreement&#x2014;for the support of the public and the State to make this undertaking an absolute success I should just like to point out that the day we approved of Rhodes extending its activities to Port Elizabeth I was the one who welcomed this move wholeheartedly and I congratulated Rhodes. I referred to other universities, not only local ones; I referred to Durham which was taking rapid strides in certain industrial areas in North-East England. The want was felt and Rhodes expanded accordingly, but even to this day Rhodes is catering only for the extramural students in Port Elizabeth. It has not yet become a residential university. Only when a university becomes a residential university can it meet the needs of the people in its environment. I naturally exclude the University of South Africa because it does not cater for any particular district or for any particular need. But this university will be of such a nature that it will have to become part of and supply the needs of an essentially industrial community. I want to emphasize this, so that I will not be misunderstood. I do not believe that universities should bear certain labels, such as primarily theological or agricultural or technological universities. When a certain person heard about this new university in November he remarked to me: I suppose it will be mainly a technological institution. I replied: No, I do not want that at all, because if one decides beforehand that such an institution should develop in a certain direction one immediately curbs its autonomy and academical development. I do not want that. If it should incidentally branch out into a theological university in a harbour city amidst all the industries, what will be wrong with that? It will only lend more prestige to the institution. I should like to stress that where other universities supply the needs of their people and make a study of their environments and adapt themselves to it, they will always have my support.</p>

<p>I want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, by expressing my fervent hope&#x2014;and the Bill guarantees this&#x2014;that the standard of this university will be unassailable right from the beginning. I have no doubt about this. Rhodes, which has a very high international standard, and Stellenbosch, which is rated just as highly, will see to this. I want to thank the State, not the Government or the Nationalist Party or some <span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_0187"/>such body, because I do not want people to think that this university was the idea of a certain group or political party, because that is not the position; but I want to thank the State as such that it reacted so swiftly and deliberately to the idea of establishing a university in the Eastern Cape, a very young idea as yet. As far as I am concerned it is only fitting that in that part of the country a bilingual university should be established because it was there that the Afrikaner pioneer and the British Settler, especially in 1820, met and co-operated in an exemplary way and together became a nation. The Eastern Cape set a wonderful example there. It did not force the two sections to live in strife with one another but allowed them to live in harmony. I think especially of Uys and Thompson, men who could look one another in the eyes over a Bible. I hope that this spirit will never disappear in the Eastern Cape, but that this same spirit will be the spirit and the inspiration of this new university.</p>

<p>I regret that the hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) does not favour this Bill being sent to a select committee. I shall give reasons why I disagree with him. Nor do I agree with his statement that it is advisable that students should have their university training in their home towns. I know as an experiment it is certainly necessary but I would not for a moment say that it is to the advantage of any student to carry out his university education in his home town.</p>

<p>I am pleased, Sir, that this side of the House supports this Bill. No one will deny that Port Elizabeth, as a centre of great development and increasing population, merits having a university of its own. I should also like to congratulate the Minister on the way he introduced this Bill. He introduced it in a very efficient way. That does not mean that I agree with all he has said nor that this Bill is a perfect measure. For instance, I do not agree that Rhodes and other universities do not serve any geographical area but that the Port Elizabeth university will. I claim that if the Port Elizabeth university is to grow and to be the great university we would like it to be, it should also not definitely be defined to serve a particular geographical area.</p>

<p>That was what the Minister indicated namely that Rhodes and other universities did not serve a geographical area but that the Port Elizabeth university would. I am sorry if I gained the wrong impression. There is no doubt, Mr. Speaker, but that the development of Rhodes University must suffer through the competition of a university in its vicinity. I do not think Rhodes University is complaining about that. As the Minister has said the Vice-Chancellor of Rhodes University wants to do everything in his power to promote and assist in the development of the new university at Port Elizabeth. I appeal to the hon. the Minister nevertheless to agree to this Bill being sent to a select committee, even after the second reading if the Minister so wishes. There are definite reasons why I ask that, Sir. I regret that this Bill was not drafted so as to be a hybrid measure so that Rhodes University&#x2019;s interests in its Port Elizabeth branch could have been cleared up once and for all. The Minister says that he will repeal their Bill at a later stage at the request of that university, but it is not only the rights of those universities with which I am concerned, it is the rights of the over 200 students who are at Rhodes University in Port Elizabeth; students who have already taken their first year of their degrees. Where must they complete these degrees? Must they take these at Rhodes University, Grahamstown? How can they afford to do that? Will the Minister give boarding grants; will he compensate these students or assist them in acquiring their degrees without losing the time they have already put in at Rhodes University at Port Elizabeth? I know this compensation could not have been provided for in this Bill because then it would automatically have become a hybrid Bill. But I would ask the hon. the Minister, in his reply, to give us some assurance that consideration will be given to those students and that some assistance will be offered them. I have no doubt the Minister will do that but I think that is a reason why this Bill should have been a hybrid measure, and gone to a Select Committee.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult and of great disadvantage to a student to have to change from one university to the other during the course of taking a degree. I claim that indirectly certain rights are affected by this Bill and for that reason I say to the Minister: Please send this Bill to a Select Committee, a committee which will be able to receive informed opinion and clarify the evidence and give Port Elizabeth&#x2019;s new university a fair start. Mr. Speaker, all kinds of rumours circulated regarding this new university. Only a Select Committee can clear up all the damaging statements that appeared in the Press. I myself say that a lot of trouble was caused by the clumsy way in which this university at Port Eilzabeth was planned. It is on that account that there are certain justified public misgivings.</p>

<p>The Minister realizes what happened during the early stage of this proposition especially before the Minister himself visited Port Elizabeth <span class="col_347-348" refersTo="page_0188"/>and clarified the matter. We know a municipal election was fought in Port Elizabeth on this issue and that the prime advocates of this new university lost their seats. Some said that Rhodes University had been slow in its development in Port Elizabeth, others that it was ahead of schedule and complained that application for the establishment of medical and engineering faculties there had not been favourably received by the Government.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that this university, to be established at Port Elizabeth, is designed to bring about the withdrawal of Rhodes University from Port Elizabeth. That is how it should be. I cannot see any reason why the Minister should not refer this Bill to a Select Committee and let us clarify the whole position and satisfy public opinion. We have heard much about double medium education. Well, you know, Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult in the Eastern Province to divide the community. I say that the Eastern Province has set an example to the whole of the Republic to bring about the happy co-existence of the various national groups of our population. The member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) knows that is true. We brought that about in our early history when the two groups struggled together. We are informed that Rhodes University offered to provide parallel medium instruction in English and Afrikaans and that it maintained that it would have no difficulty in providing this immediately in certain faculties. Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether this is in fact so and whether the offer was made. It is reported that Rhodes University too spent considerable sums of money on its Port Elizabeth development. Could the hon. the Minister inform the House how Rhodes University will be reimbursed? We know that Port Elizabeth provided R200,000 and that Rhodes has drawn on that amount, but it will take a Select Committee to decide, after taking a great deal of evidence, on the compensation to which Rhodes is entitled. I am pleased that the hon. Minister has informed the House of the cooperation that Rhodes University has offered in the development of this new university in Port Elizabeth. But no doubt Rhodes will have many difficulties; it will have difficulties in regard to its extra staff that it has in Port Elizabeth&#x2014;it is not to say that that staff is going to be agreeable to be transferred to the new university in Port Elizabeth. Those are difficulties which should be cleared up in evidence. I would also like the hon. Minister to inform the House how he visualizes that Rhodes can assist the development in Port Elizabeth. I am in favour of the undertaking of our vice-chancellor, but it is one thing to say that you will assist in the development of a university, but it is another question of how one is to assist in such circumstances. I know that Rhodes University will have a representative on the Council. Is that all the hon. Minister can indicate? I think the hon. Minister should give a lead. We have two comparatively new universities, and there is no doubt that the Minister must give a lead. As we all say, we do not want any politics introduced in the reasons for the establishment of the university in Port Elizabeth and it is the Minister himself who can provide that guidance.</p>

<p>I have detailed a few of the problems and questions which have not been answered so far and which should be answered in the public interest. I therefore hope that in fairness to the new university at Port Elizabeth and in fairness to the Rhodes University and its Port Elizabeth students that the hon. Minister will take the public into his confidence by agreeing to appoint a Select Committee with power to take evidence and to call for papers, and to report to this House. That is the usual procedure in respect of all university legislation introduced as private Bills. I think that in the general interest the Minister should make this procedure available even if this is a Government measure. The hon. Minister will find that there will not be any controversy arising from such a report of a Select Committee. A Select Committee could smoothe over the wrinkles that have arisen through certain controversies that have arisen between interests in Port Elizabeth and in Grahamstown, and even if many of the things we have heard were merely rumours, I have seen quite a few reports which were correct, circumstances which have given rise to certain misgivings. I hope that the hon. Minister will regard what I have said as serious and that he will give his earnest consideration to our request.</p>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>It was really refreshing to listen to the speeches that were made by the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) and the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) who adopted a tone and spirit completely different from that contained in the report which appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> as recently as 21 January in connection with an interview with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman). The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) adopted the spirit of a small group of people in the Eastern Cape who tried to cause friction in regard to this matter and to give it a political flavour. That is why it has been refreshing to listen to the two speeches that we have heard thus far from the other side. The only point on which the two hon. gentlemen differed from the hon. the Minister was that they wanted this Bill to be referred to a Select Committee and it was very clear from the speech of the hon. member for Albany why they wanted this to be done. This is a back door that they want to keep open, although they try to hide this fact under a pretence of curiosity. They want to know what is behind the agitation in regard to this matter and they also want to know why there was a change of heart&#x2014;as they call it&#x2014;on the part of the Council of Rhodes University. For example, the hon. member for Albany wants to know what is to become of <span class="col_349-350" refersTo="page_0189"/>the staff of Rhodes who are now employed in Port Elizabeth if they do not want to be absorbed in the new university. But that is their affair. If they do not want to work at the new university it is up to them to find employment elsewhere. The hon. member wants to know all there is to know about this matter. I do not think that a Select Committee is necessary in this regard. I think that I can tell hon. members the whole story in very few words. I am speaking now as a member of the Council of Rhodes University and as a person who has had the opportunity of gaining first-hand knowledge of the full history of the matter as it has developed. I can give these facts without betraying any confidences because we have a rule at Rhodes that a matter is secret while it is under consideration, but when once a decision has been taken on a matter it becomes common knowledge and every Council member can discuss it. The matter has been disposed of as far as Rhodes is concerned and that is why I can discuss it, although I shall not give details of the attitude adopted by certain members or mention their names, at least not unless I have to.</p>

<p>To begin with, I want to say that all the trouble started with a group of leftists at Rhodes University. When Rhodes University in all good faith asked to be permitted to extend its activities to Port Elizabeth and the Government agreed, under certain conditions, that group began saying that Rhodes should move to Port Elizabeth &#x201C;to liberalize them&#x201D;. That was the start of the trouble. When the Government announced that it had decided in principle to establish a university at Port Elizabeth, that group which in the meantime had increased in strength became very vociferous and I am sorry to have to say here that the former vice-chancellor, Dr. Alty, acted as spokesman for that group. They immediately stated openly at Grahamstown that so much fuss would be made about this whole matter that the outside world would be able to use it as an extra weapon against the Government. That was what was behind the whole matter. No less a person than Dr. E. G. Malherbe, the Principal of the University of Natal, told them on the occasion of some or other function at Grahamstown: &#x201C;This sort of university that is situated in two different places causes a great deal of trouble.&#x201D; He called it a Dachshund university. In the case of Natal University, he said, the Dachshund had two legs in Pietermaritzburg and the other two legs 60 miles away in Durban. He went on to say: &#x201C;And so you want a Dachshund in Grahamstown which has two legs in Grahamstown and the other two legs 85 miles away in Port Elizabeth.&#x201D; He said that this was a monstrosity.</p>

<p>The objections that were raised to the establishment of a new university in Port Elizabeth were not based on academic grounds. Right from the start my attitude on the Council was&#x2014;and indeed I aired my views publicly in the <i>Oosterlig</i>&#x2014;that the only proper academic attitude towards such a university was the attitude which the University of South Africa had adopted at the time to the University College of Rhodes. When Rhodes became a full-fledged university, when the hon. member for Albany introduced a Bill into this House to give Rhodes full university status, the attitude of the University of South Africa was the attitude which it adopted in the case of all the other university colleges. Its attitude was: &#x201C;We are pleased that we have been able to assist you to reach this stage; we are pleased for the sake of academic education that we have been able to bring you to where you are. We wish you every success because you can now become independent. You have our blessing.&#x201D; That was also the attitude that I adopted on the Council. But that group also had representation on the Council and, as I said, Dr. Alty was their spokesman. But there was also another group on the Council and we fought the matter step by step. The change did not come with the departure of Professor Alty. He was succeeded by an acting vice-chancellor. The matter was then discussed and a final decision was taken which can therefore now be made public. I suggested to the Council that Rhodes should continue at Port Elizabeth up to the end of 1964. This was also the request of the hon. the Minister. There was another proposal to the effect that the move should be made immediately. There was a further proposal which gave the impression of being a mediatory proposal; it simply stated that Rhodes would continue to fulfil its duties at Port Elizabeth to the best of its ability. This proposal was made in such a fine spirit that I felt that I could withdraw my proposal. But on the next Sunday a report appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> under the heading: &#x201C;Council of Rhodes Defies Government.&#x201D; And, unfortunately, whoever gave the report to the <i>Sunday Times</i> gave it in such a way that it was open to an interpretation of that nature. At that stage Mr. Hobson was no longer chairman; Mr. Acting Justice Cloete was chairman and I want to tell the hon. the Minister, if I may mention a name, that I should like to mention the name of Mr. Justice Cloete who did a great deal to bring about a better understanding and attitude. On 17 June last year I telegraphed Mr. Justice Cloete in the following terms (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Make earnest appeal to you to refute <i>Sunday Times</i>&#x2019; interpretation of resolution. That is not spirit in which I understood it.Unrefuted will do Rhodes great harm.</block>

<p>On the next day I received a telegram from Mr. Justice Cloete in which he said that steps were being taken &#x201C;to refute detrimental inaccuracies in Press&#x201D;</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with what happened at Port Elizabeth because the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) is better qualified to do so than I am. But feelings were aroused by people from Grahamstown: a great fuss was made and meetings in regard to which we had issued warnings were held. Then the change of heart became more <span class="col_351-352" refersTo="page_0190"/>obvious with the arrival of Dr. Hyslop. He was an academic man and he immediately considered the matter from an academic point of view, as did the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp). The swing that he mentioned was simply brought about by the fact that the agitation of that small group of leftists, the people who wanted to exploit this matter for party political purposes, was stopped.</p>

<p>That is briefly the story. Why is it necessary to have a Select Committee? I think it would be a waste of time to have to inquire into the attitudes of certain people and the reasons why they changed their minds.</p>

<p>I was pleased when the hon. the Minister said that he would move an amendment to Clause 14. I did not have the opportunity of discussing his amendment with him and in all the rush I was not able to follow precisely what was actually envisaged. I myself have framed an amendment. I feel that the clause should read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The mediums of instruction at the University shall be English and Afrikaans and the circumstances in which a student may make use of one or the other language shall be prescribed by the statute.</block>

<p>Like the hon. the Minister, I do not like the expression &#x201C;circumstances in which a student shall be entitled&#x201D; to use this or that language.</p>

<p>I want to explain precisely what I mean. We are dealing here with a bilingual university, not a dual-medium university and not a parallel-medium university. We are dealing with a bilingual university just as Stellenbosch was when I was a student there and when the hon. member for Hillbrow studied there. I studied Greek there under one professor through the medium of English and under another professor through the medium of Afrikaans and it did not trouble me at all. There were many subjects taught by one teacher in English and by another teacher in Afrikaans and the students followed them well. To my way of thinking certain subjects should be taught in Afrikaans and other subjects or even the same subjects taught in English at the University of Port Elizabeth. I do not think that students should be divided up into separate classes because this will only cause a great deal of overlapping which will simply prove to be a millstone around the neck of such a small university. As the hon. the Minister has said, we have probably come a long way in that matriculants must be able to follow lecturers in either of the two national languages when they attend the university. What is the position when our students go overseas? Many of these who go to Germany leave here not knowing a word of German, or knowing only a little German, but they very soon learn the medium and derive full benefit from those lectures. In the same way, students who are weaker in English or Afrikaans will very soon acquire the necessary knowledge of the other language at that bilingual university. I find that matriculants from the English-medium schools in Cape Town go to Stellenbosch simply because they want to improve their Afrikaans. That will be a fine characteristic of the University of Port Elizabeth and I am sure that it will receive the support of the vast majority of people in the Eastern Cape who will send their children there. The University of Port Elizabeth will not only serve the whole complex of the Eastern Cape but will be a great asset to the whole of the Republic. We have a potential that must be developed and it can only be developed properly if we have a university at Port Elizabeth. I want to repeat what I said at a Press interview: That as the representative of one of the Eastern Cape constituencies I shall do all in my power to promote the growth of the University of Port Elizabeth so that it can reach full maturity as soon as possible and I shall do so without neglecting or without its interfering with my duties as a member of the Rhodes University Council because the two bodies are completely separate. The one is an established university following a certain course and having a certain character which is such that it draws people from everywhere in the Republic, even from Rhodesia and abroad. I can therefore pledge my full support to the University of Port Elizabeth without in the least neglecting my duties as a Council member of Rhodes. This will be a great thing for the Eastern Cape and I am sure that my other colleagues from the Eastern Cape will want to congratulate the hon. the Minister, as I do, on this step and thank the Government very much indeed for having undertaken this important task. We are grateful that in his calm and quiet way the hon. the Minister has been able to overcome the trouble, the suspicion, the unjust and unacademic wrangling that has been experienced there and that all those problems have disappeared. I want to express the hope that no member of the Opposition will ever again try to rake up those old grievances.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) has tried to drag controversy into a debate which up to now has been free of such controversy. I am not concerned with his contribution to controversy now or in the earlier history of this matter. So far as his reference to myself is concerned, it is quite clear that I said no more than is contained in your ruling, Mr. Speaker, viz. that there has been a departure from established practice and that the initiative for the establishment of universities in the past came from private members, whereas in this case the initiative comes primarily from the Government itself.</p>

<p>I want to add my plea to the hon. the Minister that he should agree to send the Bill to a Select Committee before the second reading is taken. I do so firstly because the Bill comes to Parliament as a Government measure, as you have indicated, Sir, and not in the customary manner as a private measure. This is an exceptional step. The hon. Minister <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0191"/>in an interjection indicated that there have been some six cases in which this has happened before. As far as I know it has only happened once before in the history of this Parliament and that was in 1916, almost half a century ago. As the hon. member for Hill-brow (Dr. Steenkamp) has pointed out, on that occasion three university Bills came before Parliament in exceptional circumstances when Parliament itself felt obliged to permit a departure from the customary practice so that it could pass the proposed legislation more expeditiously. On that occasion, Sir, Parliament itself specially condoned the introduction of the three Bills as Government measures because of the urgency that had arisen. The circumstances were, as the hon. member for Hillbrow indicated, that the old Cape of Good Hope University was becoming defunct and the change-over to what was then a modern arrangement in regard to university education in the Cape and the new arrangement in respect of university education in the rest of South Africa had to be dealt with expeditiously. As I have said, there were not only exceptional circumstances in that case, but there was prior condonation by Parliament to the break with convention. I myself do not believe and see that these factors are present in this instance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Is the hon. member questioning my ruling?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, I have accepted it completely. The private Bill procedure of the House is frequently used, and there is no need for me to explain it in detail. But the essential purpose of that procedure is to provide an equitable measure of protection in those cases where proposed legislation, beneficial to particular interests or affecting particular local interests as opposed to general interests, may be injurious to others or may conflict with similar local interests. In those cases Parliament as a first measure, as a first step, assumes its judicial cloak in order to satisfy itself by its own peculiar form of Select Committee inquiry that conflicting interests are examined, that particular interests are verified and that the legislation is warranted. Only when so satisfied, does Parliament then resume its legislative cloak and deals with the proposed legislation on its merits. My first plea therefore is to the hon. Minister that this salutary and conventional practice should not be by-passed or sidestepped in this instance, because I think it would be regrettable if the Port Elizabeth University Bill were regarded as an exceptional measure rather than a Bill which is subject to the customary parliamentary scrutiny and the conventional parliamentary equity. I think it would be more than regrettable if it were felt outside this House that this new university should get its charter in a partisan spirit or as a party measure rather than in the conventional way as has happened in the case of all other universities.</p>

<p>Sir, I see no need to restart from the beginning. The conventional way can be achieved quite adequately at this juncture by the hon. Minister agreeing to the suggestion that has come from this side of the House that the Bill should go to a Select Committee before the second reading.</p>

<p>My second reason for making this plea is also based on precedent. Whilst the laudable object of the Bill is to bring into being another university in the Eastern Cape, the tragic fact is that it does so at the cost of bringing about the disestablishment of university facilities presently available to students in the same area. While it is true that the Bill purports only to do the one thing, i.e. to establish the new university, yet the second factor, the disestablishment of existing facilities, is implicit, certainly in practical terms if not in legislative terms, in the passing of this Bill.</p>

<p>I am quite aware, as the hon. Minister has explained, that Rhodes University Council and the Port Elizabeth City Council came to terms with the Minister in regard to the retraction by Rhodes University of its statutory authority to carry out its educational work in Port Elizabeth. But I am by no means satisfied that in coming to terms in the circumstances that prevailed at the time, it was ever contemplated by those two representative bodies that the procedure usually followed would not be followed in this case&#x2014;that there would be a Government Bill and not a private Bill, which would then deprive other local interests of the opportunity of tendering to Parliament evidence, whether it be for or against the legislation, and whether it be for or against the precise terms come to between the Minister and these representative bodies.</p>

<p>When I make this plea, I am also fully aware that both these Councils are guardians of specific rights and interests, always of course within their limited sphere of jurisdiction. To that extent of course their decision admittedly carries weight. But nonetheless the domain over which the guardianship and sphere of influence of those two bodies extends is limited. Your ruling, Mr. Speaker, indicates the position. The initiative for the establishment of this university comes primarily from the Government itself, and to a degree this might be setting a precedent for the future. In any event, this is a matter of an important nature and where there is such a limitation of influence in local affairs, as I have indicated, I do not think that is adequate for the purposes of Parliament itself. In any event, Parliament is the upper guardian in matters of this kind and it should, as a matter of public policy, be the final arbiter. Therefore this House should be permitted to employ the safeguards in respect of particular private interests before considering the merits of the Bill itself. To have regard to safeguards can only do good. On the other hand, to ignore those safeguards may do harm, and I say quite sincerely that that is something which I believe neither the Minister nor any <span class="col_355-356" refersTo="page_0192"/>one on this side wants. The hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) used the words &#x201C;absolute success&#x201D;. That is commendable. One wants absolute success when establishing such a body, and my plea therefore is for that very purpose.</p>

<p>That brings me to my third reason for making a plea to the Minister. It also has an historical background. It is not a wholly un-contentious background. Nevertheless, as the Minister mentioned it I think I should also mention it, and I do so in the interests of a sincere approach for a better understanding of the problem than we have now. The manner in which the project of this new university was originally launched was unfortunately not a happy one. It is not my intention to reopen that bit of history or to retrace any of the events themselves, but it would be foolish, as the Minister has apparently recognized, to ignore the fact that that bit of history has led to much resentment, much suspicion and much unhappiness amongst persons in Port Elizabeth who value the extension of university education by Rhodes to that city. As I have experienced and seen the position, they are in the main persons who would have welcomed the setting up of a new university in Port Elizabeth if it was to be complementary to and not in competition with the existing facilities. They are people who would have seen the virtue of a new university which was to be complementary to what already existed, whether it be on language medium or whether it be on an equitable division of the faculty courses between the two institutions. I believe there is very great virtue in diversity in educational facilities, instead of the rigid similarity which seemingly will now take place. Having listened to the Minister&#x2019;s glowing description of Port Elizabeth&#x2019;s position in the country and its rapid expansion, with which I agree, it would seem to me to justify having two complementary universities and not a single university in Port Elizabeth, which will happen now. So whatever the Minister has himself said is an argument for submitting this matter to a Select Committee and for following the principles of equity and scrutiny which are contained in that procedure and which can result only in good and not in harm. In the circumstances, therefore, I believe that a gesture by the Minister to agree to the Bill at this stage of the proceedings going to a Select Committee would go a long way towards healing hurts and it would ensure for the new university a greater spirit of goodwill and co-operation than might otherwise be the case. I repeat that to follow the precedents of the past and to accept the suggestions made from this side of the House and to submit the matter to a Select Committee can only do good.</p>

<p>My last reason for making that plea to the Minister is the contents of the Bill itself. It has already been pointed out, both on this side and from the opposite side that there is scope for improvement in the contents of the Bill. Surely there is no better place in which to try to bring about that improvement than in a Select Committee. The Minister has had that experience on other occasions and he will know that in the calm and cool atmosphere of the Select Committee much can be done to improve the contents of matters and to leave the controversy to this House itself. If there were any indication by the Minister that he will accept that suggestion, I will sit down, because that is the purpose with which I have risen. Although the Minister gives no indication of acceptance, I still hope that he will accept it, having regard to the importance of the matter, to the past history of the matter and to the future prospects of the institution itself. I hope he will agree to the suggestions made from this side.</p>

<p>I was pleased to hear the Minister&#x2019;s expression of satisfaction at the way Rhodes University had handled the situation which arose. As the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) said, Rhodes has a proud and honourable record which goes back for some 60 years. It owes its origin to the pioneer efforts and the enterprise of the citizens of the Eastern Cape. It has grown because of the initiative stimulated by those who valued what it has set out to achieve, and there is no doubt that it has achieved much. The expansion which has been developing since 1960 is now to be ended and it must be crippling in one way or another to Rhodes. I therefore say that if Rhodes university is to serve with the same degree of success in the future, it will need a great amount of sympathy and support from the Government. If the Minister continues in the spirit in which he introduced this Bill, I have hopes that that will be achieved, because as I have indicated, the tragedy of the present Bill is not that it does only the one thing. Admittedly the laudable object is to create something, but the tragedy is that it does so at the cost of this other institution. My plea therefore to the Minister is to bear this in mind in dealing with the problems which are likely to arise at both institutions in future.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there had been no need for university training in the Eastern Cape, one would not have had colleges like St. Andrew&#x2019;s College at Grahamstown and Gill College at Somerset East being founded as early as in the 19th century, and one would not have experienced the fact that those colleges have made their marks on the history of South Africa and have justified their existence. It was fortunate that we had Rhodes University to replace St. Andrew&#x2019;s, but in Somerset East the position was different. There were too few people and there was not enough money. But those colleges were established through the generosity of well-meaning people like the late Dr. Gill who achieved undying fame in the Eastern Cape because of his generosity to that part of the country by making a bequest to be used for university and higher education. I say that the existence of those colleges and the representations that were made proved that the Eastern Cape <span class="col_357-358" refersTo="page_0193"/>really needed a university and that was why we were particularly pleased to hear the announcement made by the hon. the Minister on behalf of the Cabinet in February last year that the Cabinet had decided to establish a university at Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. On the same afternoon that the announcement was made, some representatives of the English-medium Press visited members of Parliament for the Eastern Cape constituencies and asked us what our attitude was in regard to that university. Hon. members on this side welcomed the step openly and without reserve. I just want to refer to what was said by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) as reported in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> of 14 February 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Abraham Jonker, Member of Parliament for Fort Beaufort, who is also a member of the Council of Rhodes University, said: &#x201C;I wish Port Elizabeth well and am prepared to* help them in whatever manner I can.&#x201D; Mr. A. H. Vosloo, Member of Parliament for Somerset East, said: &#x201C;I am very glad to hear the announcement. It is going to mean a great deal for Port Elizabeth and its hinterland, especially as the Orange River scheme is developed.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I said even more than that. I added that Port Elizabeth which had already developed into an industrial city needed a university of this kind; that the city would benefit if it had a university that could also train technologists and that if this were the case it would develop even more quickly. The <i>Eastern Province Herald</i>was not slow to make inquiries, as our experience showed, and under the heading &#x201C;City Reaction to Cabinet Varsity Decision&#x201D;, it gave the views of Mr. Ernest Love, chairman of the Midlands Chamber of Industries. It also gave the views of Mr. S. Odendaal, chairman of the Afrikaanse Sakekamer, and this is what Mr. Odendaal had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Odendaal said the future of the University College depended on financial support from city businessmen. He appealed to commerce and industry to lend their full support to the dual-medium university college. The possession of such a university college would be a great cultural achievement for Port Elizabeth, he added.</block>

<p>But a certain Mr. Edgar Crews also had his views on the matter. He sent a telegram to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Edgar Crews, spokesman for the &#x201C;Rhodes for Port Elizabeth group&#x201D;, sent off two telegrams last night. One went to Mr. Plewman, United Party Member of Parliament for Port Elizabeth (South). Mr. Plewman was asked if the English-speaking section of the city could expect the United Party to oppose an attempt to force Rhodes out of Port Elizabeth.</block>

<p>It was most interesting to note that the second telegram was sent to Field Marshal Montgomery, but I do not want to elaborate on this fact. I want to show that a campaign against that proposed university was then started in Port Elizabeth by the English-medium Press. On 16 February, two days after the report that I quoted here the <i>Evening Post</i> wrote a leading article under the heading &#x201C;Remarkable Behaviour&#x201D;, and attacked the proposed university on the grounds that it would affect Rhodes so adversely. But that was not their only reason. The article stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Propaganda: As the lecturers of the Rhodes Port Elizabeth Division have pointed out, at no time has the academic quality and status of Rhodes University been questioned. It seems that the justification for this Nationalist-approved <i>coupd&#x2019;etat</i> rests on two main grounds: (1) This is a move towards a separate Port Elizabeth university; (2) it is to be dual medium (a term not yet precisely defined)&#x2014;the only one of its kind in South Africa. These propaganda arguments may appeal to some politically unsophisticated English-speaking citizens. Let us examine them. Probably No. 1&#x2014;the local or parochial&#x2014;pride appeal is the stronger. A Nationalist Member of Parliament, Mr. A. Vosloo, has been quoted as saying that &#x201C;the new institution will mean much for the area &#x2026; and Port Elizabeth itself will become a big industrial centre&#x201D;. This statement prompts several questions. For example: Stellenbosch is an exceptionally well-established university centre, as is Potchefstroom. Yet are these towns becoming great industrial centres?</block>

<p>The article continues in this way. It was then that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) joined the struggle. I refer to these matters because the hon. member stood up sanctimoniously here this afternoon and told us that he had only said what you, Mr. Speaker, had given your ruling in regard to this afternoon. He gave us a lecture on parliamentary procedure and the question of the establishment of the university. On the same date, 16 February, the <i>Evening Post</i> wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">United Party Pledge to Port Elizabeth in Varsity Struggle. Mr. R. P. Plewman, United Party Member of Parliament for Port Elizabeth (South), has indicated that he is opposed to the Government&#x2019;s move to establish a university college in Port Elizabeth under the aegis of the University of South Africa in place of Rhodes College.</block>

<p>I just want to say that the hon. member who acted so sanctimoniously here had this comment to make&#x2014;I do not want to quote everything he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nor, added Mr. Plewman was he clear whether there was justification for another university.</block>

<p><span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0194"/>The hon. member is a person who has no interest in Port Elizabeth except as far as the safety of his seat is concerned because he had to flee from Johannesburg (North), and he compromised the United Party into opposing this university. I do not want to refer to the further developments in the struggle and the fact that a municipal election in Port Elizabeth was fought on this matter; how the former mayor was not returned to office as a result of this struggle that was unleashed by the English-medium Press. But the hon. member made progress. In February the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">High-handed university move deplored: Joint protest by East Cape M.P.s and M.P.C.s: Opposition M.P.s and M.P.C.&#x2019;s of the Eastern Province last night issued a statement protesting at the whittling away of the rights of Rhodes University. They deprecated the high-handed action of the Government and expressed confidence in the ability of Rhodes University to meet the educational needs of both sections of the Eastern Province. The statement is signed by Mr. I. Goldberg, M.E.C., Mr. Bowker, Mr. Plewman, Mr. Streicher Mr. P. R. Dodds, Mrs. Murray and Mr. H. Charles.</block>

<p>The hon. member has been at the forefront of the struggle, but this afternoon he has welcomed it most sanctimoniously. On 21 January 1964, a few days ago, this hon. member gave an interview to the <i>Cape Argus</i>. I do not want to quote the report but the heading was: &#x201C;University of Port Elizabeth. A Party-Political Issue.&#x201D; That is what they said in pursuance of an interview that they had with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). If one compared this report with the leading article of the <i>Sunday Times</i> of the previous Sunday, one would notice that the two reports were very similar. The hon. member repeated exactly what had appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i>. I want to say this to the hon. member. I welcome the change of heart that he has had and the fact that he can now also take his place in the ranks of those with whom I stand&#x2014;those who are in favour of this Bill.</p>

<p>I knew that within half an hour I would succeed in making even the hon. member for Sea Point understand how I feel. But there is still one man who has not joined our ranks and that is Mr. Crews. I want to tell the hon. member not to be afraid of Mr. Crews because Mr. Crews did not vote for him at the last election and will not vote for him at the next election either. The hon. member must stand by Port Elizabeth; if he does so he may perhaps retain his seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are people who have done a great deal for this university. There are so many of them that I do not want to mention all their names although I do want to make use of this opportunity to mention the names of some of the people who have done so much in this struggle, people like the former Mayor, Mr. van der Vyver, Mr. Albertus Delport and Mr. van Vollenhoven, all of whom have done everything possible without compensation and have given up their time to collect the necessary funds. We trust that they will acquire undying fame. We believe that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) will also acquire undying fame but I doubt that it will be in gratitude to him for the unnecessary political struggle that was unleashed in the Eastern Cape in connection with this university and in regard to which he was in the forefront. This university will supply a great need. We welcome it. It will mean a great deal to the Eastern Cape, to my constituency and particularly to Port Elizabeth. We also want to take advantage of this opportunity to thank the Government. [Interjection.] Yes, I am not ashamed to thank the Government. That hon. member has much to be grateful to the Government for but he ignores that fact. I do not. We hope and trust that they will not be disappointed in their hopes for that university. We believe that their hopes will be exceeded.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DODDS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to follow the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo), but I want to say that I am sorry he introduced a political flavour which was not necessary at this stage. I want to say that we on this side are in full support of this university. I think those of us who know Port Elizabeth realize that our population justifies it, and I think the industrial development which exists and which will still follow alone justifies an institution of this nature to enable young men and women to fit into the future development. I would like to compliment the hon. member for Witbank. I find myself in agreement with the spirit of what he said. I, too, feel that the university will afford the opportunity to a greater number of young men and women to obtain higher education. Those of us who have lived in that city for a long time will realize that much had to be done to make it possible for some of these young men and women to go to the university. When there is a university in the town, the young men or women can go there on their bicycles. Over the years there has been a constant demand for a university. It dates back, as the Minister said, for a long time, and our local authorities and commercial organizations have all from time to time given consideration to what is now going to be brought about, this university. I do feel that it is to Rhodes that we owe much. They came in 1960 to establish a branch and to assist us to get under way to provide facilities for part-time and also for full-time students, to attend the university. None of us wants to see Rhodes badly treated in any way. They have made a big contribution and are continuing to do so. The Port Elizabeth people as a whole will also appreciate it. We will never forget the contribution <span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0195"/>they have made. I know it is the hope of many that this university will not in any way detract from Rhodes and that that great institution will carry on as it did before. Much has been said this afternoon in regard to submitting this measure to a Select Committee. We all hold our views, but so much has come out. We have heard various hon. members telling us that this and that happened. It seems to me that if we want to launch this university and give it a really healthy send-off, the Minister should give very serious consideration to this request; then all these so-called misunderstandings can be removed. The opinion has been expressed that the support for this university is one-sided. Surely if the air is thoroughly cleared we will find that full support will be forthcoming from all sides. Sir, I want the House to know that we in our particular area as English-speaking persons have never found any difficulty in getting along with other language groups. The hon. member for Wit-bank (Mr. Mostert) has told the House that too; that is the way we feel about it. But there is one thing that I would like to stress and that is that while I am grateful for this development there is, of course, a feeling that at a later date we may find that the dual-medium might be disturbed. The Minister has given us certain assurances that this cannot take place, but if this university is launched we may be sure, particularly if a Select Committee is appointed, that we will get full support from both sections of the community. After all, it is our earnest desire that the university to be established at Port Elizabeth should get full support from both sections of the community, and I have no doubt that that is what everybody here desires. It is for that reason that I would again say to the hon. the Minister that he should give very serious consideration to the request made to him to refer this Bill to a Select Committee.</p>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Having listened to the speeches of the hon. members of the Opposition it is clear to me that they do not welcome this university at Port Elizabeth. They accused the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) of talking politics but the fact that they ask for a Select Committee without giving conclusive reasons why they want a Select Committee shows clearly that they want to retard this Bill as much as possible. They know that the Minister is in a hurry for this House to pass the Act; they know that a Select Committee takes a long time to complete its work. They want Rhodes University, the City Council of Port Elizabeth and other bodies to give evidence here. In other words, this Select Committee will not be able to conclude its work during this Session and that is why they ask for a Select Committee.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to point out here the necessity of having a university at Port Elizabeth. The hon. the Minister has already done so. The Minister said that in 1960 there were 94,000 Whites in Port Elizabeth. Now there are 103,000. Tremendous expansion has already occurred there as the Minister has said. But there are a few other matters that I should like to deal with here, and one of them is a matter which was mentioned here by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman). He said that this matter was a Cabinet measure. This is the same as they have at the English universities, namely a &#x201C;charter&#x201D;, which means the right to found a university. After that &#x201C;Royal Charter&#x201D; has been granted then the statute is introduced. As Dr. Cilliers said in his report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Private enterprise cannot nowadays any longer be expected to take the initiative in starting such new seats of learning with the State coming in later with the recognition and financial support. This traditional process can only operate in reverse to-day.</block>

<p>That is what has happened here now. The State is responsible for granting the subsidies and that is why it is essential that it should introduce this Bill, just as also happened in England, as I have already said. In the &#x201C;Commonwealth Universities Year Book 1963&#x201D; the hon. members will find the following on page 882&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All the universities of the United Kingdom exercise their rights and functions in virtue of royal charters.</block>

<p>That is what we are busy doing here now. We have no &#x201C;royal charters&#x201D; but Parliament gives them the right&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Supplementary to the charter of each university, and in conformity with it, are statutes which are approved by the Sovereign-in-Council. A charter defines the powers, privileges and constitution of the university in broad and general outline; the statute, which within the framework of the charter can be amended on the initiative of the university subject to the approval of the Privy Council, provides for the more important and permanent constitutional details which need to be clearly set forth.</block>

<p>The same thing is happening here. We first give them the right and then the statute follows later. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) says further that in reality it will be a dual-medium university, but after a number of years the Government will come and proclaim it an Afrikaans-medium university. But that is not so. If the English of the Eastern Cape, and in particular those of Port Elizabeth support this university, it will always remain a dual-medium university and will never become anything but a dual-medium university. But yet another argument was advanced against this university. It was argued that in South Africa we already have too many universities. The hon. the Minister mentioned the A. C. Cilliers report here last year. But even before we experienced this industrial development in South Africa Bradby wrote in 1939 in his book &#x201C;The University outside Europe&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_363-364" refersTo="page_0196"/>A university should be where men are. A university out of reach of all save those having the means and the opportunity to make a long pilgrimage, is out of date.</block>

<p>That was said in 1939 already&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a primary duty to provide university institutions within easy reach of all capable of profiting by it.</block>

<p>Hon. members have objected to Clause 13 in terms of which certain faculties may be established. The <i>Argus</i> wrote about this and suggested that it was the old pattern of a university and that a new pattern ought to be followed now. Mr. Speaker, had a new pattern been followed it would have been said that the university of Port Elizabeth was an inferior university. That is what the enemies of this university would have said. When the Bantu university colleges were established and the pattern was altered just slightly it was said that the Government was establishing inferior universities. But that is not all. They suggest that it should be a technological university. Technological universities do not exist anywhere. True enough, in England one finds the so-called colleges for &#x201C;advanced technology&#x201D;, but these colleges do not award degrees. Even to-day these institutions are being strongly criticized. It is contended that those institutions should remain an integral part of the university. That is also what Dr. Holloway said in his report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although, in view of the Union&#x2019;s industrial expansion and the consequent need of providing a constant flow of highly qualified technologists, provision for the training of such people ought to be made, your commission is of opinion that the relation between higher academic and higher technological education should be as close as possible.</block>

<p>He goes further and suggests that it should be in the same university institution. The commission cannot accept that the two should be in separate university institutions. It says that it will entail expenditure that the State cannot afford, but over and above this the commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A close liaison between men engaged in fundamental work in a university and others engaged in technological work is likely to be of advantage to both groups.</block>

<p>That is the spirit&#x2014;no more separate technological universities. That is also the position in Canada to-day. I have here a book published in 1938, &#x201C;The University Question&#x201D;. I am not going to quote from it, but here we find the same&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Combine humanism with technique</block>

<p>That is the tendency. But I know why the <i>Cape Argus</i> pleads for a separate technological institution&#x2014;so that they can say they are inferior institutions. But further, a training college for teachers is going to be established at Port Elizabeth next year. We are acquainted with the pattern followed by other universities and training colleges. There is close cooperation between the Normal College of Pretoria and the University of Pretoria, and between the Normal College of Bloemfontein and the Free State University. There will be the same co-operation between the training college and university in Port Elizabeth. The students at the training college do not take technological subjects. They will take a B.A. degree there perhaps with history or one of the languages as a major subject. There are many boys and girls in Port Elizabeth who do not want to have a technological training. They want to study languages; they want to study law; they want to study in other directions. Must they be deprived of the opportunity so that they will be forced to go elsewhere to get that special training? Surely that is ridiculous. The whole object of establishing this new university will be defeated because boys and girls of that area, who want to further their studies, will be compelled to go to other centres to do so. That is precisely why this university is being established, to create the facilities for these people to be trained at Port Elizabeth. Mr. Speaker, those are the arguments advanced against the establishing of this university. The <i>Sunday Times</i>&#x2014;I do not want to mention the name of that newspaper, because I think no decent person any longer mentions the name of that paper in this House&#x2014;yesterday compared the university of Port Elizabeth with Turfloop and called it the Turfloop of the Eastern Cape. The idea is of course to disparage this university in advance.</p>

<p>It was also argued here that the reason for appointing a Select Committee was the fact that Rhodes had invested so much money in Port Elizabeth. But not one penny of that money came from Rhodes. It all came from funds made available to Rhodes by the City Council of Port Elizabeth. Rhodes did not give a single penny out of their own pocket. Why should a Select Committee now suddenly be appointed? Rhodes is satisfied. The two parties who will be called upon to give evidence before the Select Committee, Rhodes University and the Port Elizabeth City Council, are satisfied. Why should they be called upon further to come and give evidence before a Select Committee? Surely it would be futile. The City Council and Rhodes University said that they agreed with the Minister but now they must come again and say: Once again we agree with you. Surely that it quite ridiculous. I repeat that the reason why this proposal was made to-day is because they do not want this statute to come before the House during this Session because they know that the Select Committee will not be able to complete its work in time. I know that this university will be a success. It can only be a success if both the English-speaking section <span class="col_365-366" refersTo="page_0197"/>and the Afrikaans-speaking section of the Eastern Cape support it. I know that the Afrikaans-speaking section will support it, and I appeal to the United Party to encourage the English-speaking section to support the university of Port Elizabeth, and then these dangers they envisage will vanish because it is a university for both sections of the community of Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>He said that these colleges should become part of another university because they cannot exist separately. The hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert) to-day explained to the House that our university system here is built and has been created on the British system, for historical reasons. I think perhaps we have adhered too closely to the British system. Had we considered developing along our own lines earlier it would have been better for South Africa. But in Britain itself they have now decided that they must change their direction; that they must follow the direction of the United States, Western Germany and Russia. In the Robbins Report, which has just been published on university development in Great Britain, the point which the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) made is dealt with exhaustively. They have in Britain colleges which they call the C.A.T. Colleges, colleges for advanced technology, and it is recommended in the Robbins Report that these colleges should have university status and that they should be given the right to confer degrees. Technology in this modern world has a place quite different from what it had in the world 50 years ago. If there is any criticism of South African universities and of our system, it is that our South African universities are all planned in the same way. Where there is an opportunity for variation I think that opportunity should be seized with both hands.</p>

<p>I should like now to say a word about the Bill. No one in this House will say anything that does not welcome a university Bill. We know the procedure in this House for the presentation of a University Bill. We know that it is an occasion for mutual congratulations. We like to feel that South Africa is developing in higher education in a new direction. We are anxious, all of us, to do that. Where criticism has come from this House, where my criticism will come, where there is criticism, it is because of the maladroit manner in which the hon. the Minister has presented the Bill to the House. That is my criticism. Our procedure is well known to the House. The procedure is that vested interests or particular interests&#x2014;generally the Council of the College, but it may be other interests&#x2014;approach this House with a private Bill, and in doing so they give certain information in their preamble. The information which they give in the preamble is the historical background on which they base the application. The number of students available is given to us, as well as the prospects for the future. If I may say so, the reason why we have this procedure and why it is an excellent procedure, cannot be better stated than in our authority on procedure in South Africa, Kilpin. This is what Kilpin says in his concluding paragraph on the question of private Bills introduced into this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But perhaps the greatest merit of the system lies in the fact that by insisting on personal and local affairs being removed from the sphere of Cabinet responsibility and the general field of political discussion it removes the pressure for patronage and an incentive to political &#x201C;log-rolling&#x201D;. For as an eminent authority on parliamentary government has put it &#x201C;The curse of most representative bodies to-day is the tendency of the members to urge the interests of their localities or their constituents; and it is this more than anything else that has brought legislatures into discredit and has made them appear to be concerned with a tangled skein of private interests rather than with the public welfare&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In other words, Kilpin has stated that what is necessary is that this should be divorced completely from any suggestion of party politics. It has not been divorced in this case. We know what has happened. I do not know how much political &#x201C;log-rolling&#x201D; there has been, but there has been an election fought on this subject. Surely that was most undesirable. It is most undesirable that a university should have been associated with it. Sir, in introducing the Bill before the House in this manner the hon. the Minister has ignored our procedure in Parliament and, if I may say so he has ignored us as members of the House.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am going to accept your ruling. The hon. the Minister has introduced this Bill. There is no preamble. He gave us the preamble in his speech to-day. We should have had a preamble in this Bill to give justification for the introduction of the Bill. Now, Sir, as I understood your ruling you said that as no private individuals or bodies were available to promote the legislation, it was the duty of the Government to sponsor it. I accept all that, of course. The best authorities agree with that. But when I listened to the Minister speak a doubt came into my mind. This is what the Minister had to say; he said in regard to this application from Port Elizabeth that there were &#x201C;instan-sies&#x201D; (bodies) and individuals who from the <span class="col_367-368" refersTo="page_0198"/>fifties have asked for a university there. He also said that from all quarters the proposal was welcomed and that there was enthusiasm for it. He also spoke of the &#x201C;groot voor-standers&#x201D; of Port Elizabeth. I have seen a list, a very imposing list, of trustees of this university. Surely these bodies could have come before us with a private Bill, as interested parties, if what the Minister said is correct. Why could they not come along with a private Bill? Why could the trustees not do so? Why could they not say, &#x201C;We intend to establish a university; we wish to come to Parliament&#x201D;, instead of going to the Minister? Instead of going to the Minister they should have made it possible for the Speaker&#x2019;s ruling to be what it has always been. It is not the Speaker&#x2019;s duty to find that body; it is the duty of the Minister. The Minister&#x2019;s response to this application should have been, &#x201C;Get together in Port Elizabeth and come along to me with a private Bill and I will assist you&#x201D;. We on this side of the House would have assisted him as well, and then what would have happened? The Bill would have come before the members of this House, under the chairmanship of perhaps the hon. member for Witbank.</p>

<p>Sir, we are discussing universities now&#x2014;a most serious subject. Our desire to assist in the establishment of a university is not in doubt, and the manner in which we could have assisted would have been to have sat in the usual way on the Select Committee, but we were not given that opportunity. The hon. the Minister has tried to impress us today by telling us that he had committees of investigation. In the 1955 University Act which we passed in this House, the first section, of course, is the definition clause, but Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 deal with the establishment of an Advisory Council. There are from three to eight members on this Council, and I should like to ask the Minister whether he called this Advisory Council together to advise him. Under the law the Minister is called upon to consult the Council. Did he call this Council together? Did they advise him and if so will he lay the advice he received on the Table of the House so that we can see what advice was given to the Minister by this Advisory Council, a body constituted under our University Act. But following on Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 there are Sections 6, 7 and 8 where another body is established, the Committee of Principals. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the Committee of Principals was consulted. If they were consulted what advice did they give? Did the Committee of Principals of all the universities in South Africa advise him to proceed with this Bill? Can we have their opinion laid on the Table of the House to assist us in Committee? I am very anxious to see that. I am not satisfied with the explanation which was given by the Minister. Why should we have to listen to the finding of one of his committees which is sent to investigate? Why should we not investigate? We are the jury. We are the people who sit in this House: the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker), the hon. member for Wit-bank and others with whom I have sat on these committees. We are the people who sit here to consider an application of this kind.</p>

<p>Sir, in the time at my disposal I should like to have a look at some of the clauses and perhaps make one or two suggestions to the Minister which he might introduce himself as amendments. He is willing to do so. He has already intimated that he is prepared to introduce an amendment on the Medium clause. I come now to Clause 6, dealing with the Chancellor of the University. I should think that the hon. the Minister is an authority on this because as Chancellor of a University he has personal experience. He knows what the duties of a Chancellor are; no one knows better than he does. The Bill says here that the Chancellor shall be elected by the Council and so on, and in sub-section (2) he says that the Chancellor shall hold office for a period of 10 years. Why 10 years?</p>

<p>Well, what about taking the very fine example of Potchefstroom University. The hon. the Minister has been quoting Rhodes. I want to quote the university with which he is most familiar, Potchefstroom. In Potchefstroom they do not say that the Chancellor shall be elected by the Council; it is decided by the Statute. Why take the period out of the hands of the Council? But, worse than that, this is what the Bill says, &#x201C;the Chancellor shall hold office for 10 years,&#x201D; but if he is to be removed the request shall go to the State President. Why bring the State President into it when you have a council of the university? I hope the hon. the Minister will put that right.</p>

<p>The people of Port Elizabeth should have decided this not the Minister. The people of Port Elizabeth should have told us what they wanted. I am sure they will not be satisfied with this. Let us go a little further. We come to Clause 10, which deals with the Senate of the university. I did not quite understand the Minister when he spoke on this in introducing the Bill at the second reading. Does he mean that he will nominate professors or lecturers to the Senate, or will he ask Rhodes and Stellenbosch to nominate the members. Will he nominate individuals himself? Surely that is an intrusion on the rights of Rhodes and Stellenbosch. Surely it is for them to decide. The next thing is this: For how long are they to be nominated? For how long are they to hold office&#x2014;these representatives of Rhodes and Stellenbosch? Surely they cannot form half the Senate indefinitely and that is what is proposed in this Bill&#x2014;&#x201C;that for an indefinite period half the Senate will be nominated by the Minister from Rhodes and Stellenbosch.&#x201D; Well, if the hon. the Minister were to come along and say during the teething period, during the first three or four years, that he would make that arrangement and then leave it to the Council to decide in their Statute, I would understand it. But I think to put that provision in the law as an indefinite period is something quite unknown in the organization of our universities. So much for that.</p>

<p>I come to Clause 10. Sub-clause (5) says the duties of the Senate will be &#x201C;the organization and control of the curricula and examinations of the university&#x201D;. The Minister has forgotten the discipline of the classes that is a very important function. Perhaps the hon. the Minister would make a note of that. Had the Bill gone to a Select Committee of the House we would have been able to put that right for him.</p>

<p>Now I come to Clause 11 &#x201C;Convocation of the University&#x201D;. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he introduce an amendment to give us in convocation not only the members of the Senate and graduates of the university but, as in the case of the Potchefstroom University, the lecturers, the librarian and the registrar. If he wishes to follow the Potchefstroom system I think it is an excellent system to follow. We now come to the appointment of professors. There is one point forgotten in Clause 12, if I may so. Provision is made for the appointment but no provision is made for dismissal which is a very important feature. I think that should be noted and I think the Minister should introduce an amendment there.</p>

<p>We now come to Clause 14 &#x201C;Mediums of instruction&#x201D;. I want to say quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, I cannot become emotional over that. I have seen so much of the medium of instruction and I have heard it discussed so much! Why not leave that to the people of Port Elizabeth to be dealt with in their own university. Let us accept their autonomy. When I hear the Minister become emotional about medium, about the new start, about how they are now going to bring the two language groups together, I remember that they were the people who introduced White apartheid in the primary and secondary schools. This is the party that separated the children in the schools. Now they come with an emotional appeal to bring everybody together! That leaves me cold, Sir, I refuse to become emotional about the medium of instruction in Port Elizabeth. That does not affect me. I am not annoyed with Pretoria; I am not annoyed with the Free State. The Pretoria University started off the same way. I do not say they have failed. An hon. member says they have failed; I do not say that. They developed the way in which the community wished them to develop as the Council wished them to develop. The same is true of the Free State University. They are very fine institutions and I believe Port Elizabeth will develop in the same way, If in the course of time they say they wish to change the system it is for them to decide&#x2014;not for us. It should not be laid down in the law. It should be laid down in the Statutes, the Statutes which can be improved by the Council, accepted by the Minister, and laid on the Table of this House for three months as they usually are.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that is what will happen. I think he is probably right. It should be left to them. I do not see why it should be laid down in the law. However, if you want it in the law who am I to object to it! That is the story of the medium of instruction. I want to say this: if they are going to develop in the manner that the Minister thinks probable it is going to be a very expensive system. I have in mind the Natal University. The Natal University made provision for parallel classes on the ground of race. In other words, they made that gesture to the policy of the Government. They had White classes and non-White classes, but the Government was not prepared to give them the extra financial support to carry it out. It will require more money here and I hope the Minister will be able to provide it.</p>

<p>I now come to this question of discipline. &#x201C;A student at the university shall be subject to the disciplinary provisions prescribed by the statute or by rules made by the Council&#x201D;. I object to &#x201C;rules made by the council&#x201D;. The disciplinary provisions should come into the Statutes and appear before Parliament. Parliament should be able to approve of them; they should not be rules by the Council. That is contrary to the whole principle of universities. Here again I refer to Potchefstroom University. They do not say this in Potchefstroom University and I do not see why they should say it in the case of Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>I now come to the last clause, Clause 23. &#x201C;Until the publication of the statute in the <i>Gazette</i> such persons will be appointed by <span class="col_371-372" refersTo="page_0200"/>the Minister.&#x201D; Now, Sir, how long is that going to last? How long will they hold office? Is it for an indefinite period or is it only until the Port Elizabeth people elect their own Council? There are people there who are interested and who will become members of the Council. How long does the Minister suggest this provision should last? Three years? Two years? I think that should be stated in the Bill. I do not think the Port Elizabeth people should be told that indefinitely they will have a Council appointed by the Minister. &#x201C;The Minister may appoint any person as an alternate, the Minister may prescribe, in such manner as he may deem fit, the quorum and procedure at meetings of the Council.&#x201D; In other words, it is the tribal college system, Sir. But I hope it does not last. I would ask the hon. the Minister, when he introduces his amendments in the Committee Stage, to make provision for that as well and to give us a limited time.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for me to say as a peroration that we wish them success in Port Elizabeth. Everybody in this House, every member I have ever known, is anxious to wish success to an undertaking of this kind, especially where there is good local support. I do not think it is necessary to say so; I think that is taken for granted. We shall be able to discuss the Minister&#x2019;s amendments when we come to the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_spuy">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down put a number of questions to the hon. the Minister. I presume that the hon. the Minister will reply to those questions when he replies to the debate and so I shall not refer to them. I want to come back to one matter he raised, and that was when he referred to the provision dealing with the medium of instruction. I want to ask him whether he is not aware of the fact that that provision dealing with the medium of instruction is worded in the way it is worded in this Bill with the express purpose of combating any attempts to cast suspicion upon the establishment of this university. I want to give the hon. member some good advice. I want to tell him that I am convinced that the hon. the Minister will have no objection if the hon. member moves at the Committee Stage to omit this clause and to substitute a new clause containing more or less the ideas that he has in mind. I want to urge him to tell the House of his intention to move this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was deeply disappointed because the Opposition did not see their way clear to give this Bill their unqualified support. I really thought that at a time when there was so much talk about a shortage of trained people in our country, any effort to establish an institution for higher education would receive the general and wholehearted support of both sides of the House. Unfortunately this was not the case. The motion that this Bill be referred to a select committee appears to me to be something of a delaying action. I listened to the arguments that were raised in regard to why the matter should actually be referred to a select committee. In my humble opinion not one of those considerations justifies a step of this nature. All the reasons that were given can be put right at the Committee Stage of this Bill. The only conclusion that I can draw, therefore, is that because of the force of circumstances, because of the fact that the representatives of the Eastern Cape are mostly United Party supporters, the Opposition have been compelled to give their support to this matter because otherwise they will not be able to face their voters.</p>

<p>I have actually risen to speak because I am most closely connected with an effort to establish an Afrikaans university on the Rand. I should like in this capacity to congratulate the people of the Eastern Cape very heartily indeed on what has been achieved by means of this historic step. I should like to give my full support to the principle of the establishment of new universities. I trust that they will succeed in getting this university under way so soon that it will make the achievement of our goal on the Rand so much easier and quicker. Various methods have been used to try to cast suspicion upon the necessity for such a university. I would like to deal more fully with a few of these considerations. Why should we have an additional university? We have noticed that some of the daily newspapers have published data to show that as far as the number of our universities in relation to the number of our students and our White population is concerned, we are just behind the United States of America. That may be so. I contend that in this country of ours the Whites carry a tremendous intellectual responsibility. Upon us rests the responsibility of supplying leaders not only for the White section of the population itself but up to the present we have also had to provide leaders for all the various non-White sections of the population. I think that this will be the case for some time to come. But what is more, we also have to supply trained people for countries far beyond our borders. I think that we can accept the fact that that development will continue for some time. So I say that here in the Republic of South Africa the need for academically trained persons is proportionately larger than in any other country of the world, and this fact alone justifies the establishment of an additional university at the right and most strategically situated place. It is a fact that the intellectual potential of our White population is not being developed to the full in this country. When we consider that barely half of the number of students who enroll at our White universities leave those universities with degrees, we must realize that somewhere there is a great wastage of our intellectual potential. I feel that an additional university will succeed in attracting more students to university and also in producing more graduates.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a very interesting point that I want to raise in connection with the growth of the population in the Eastern Cape. <span class="col_373-374" refersTo="page_0201"/>Mention has been made, and rightly so, of the tremendous increase in the population in the Eastern Cape and the growth that it is anticipated will take place there. When we make a study of the information at our disposal we find that that growth has occurred chiefly in the urban and peri-urban industrial centres and, indeed, at the expense of the platteland. It is a fact that those platteland people who have moved to the cities have mostly found their niche in the lower structure of our urban economy and that for that reason they are not able, even with a great deal of assistance from the State in the form of bursaries and otherwise, to send their children to universities elsewhere. A very enlightening and expert survey has been made in this regard by a team of American scientists. According to that survey it appears that the entrepreneurs and the highly professional group continue to emerge from the same group; in other words, there is very little movement from the lower income groups to the higher income groups. This means that we have what virtually amounts to a petrification of the professional structure. It must therefore be clear to all of us that it is an almost impossible task for those people moving into the urban areas&#x2014;most of them are from the platteland&#x2014;to gain access to that higher professional structure of the entrepreneur and the professional class. A second point that this investigation proved and a point that fits into this picture well is the fact that it is stated that the most effective way of assisting those lower income groups to break through to the higher groups is the establishment of universities and higher institutions for technical and commercial development. Sir, that is precisely what the Government has in mind with this Bill that we have before us. This is why I deprecate the fact that we do not have general support for this step; that the method that is being followed here is criticized and that some of us by our actions in this regard are seeking to undermine the principle involved in this matter.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the tremendous growth that has taken place recently at our universities. I want to tell you that according to a survey that was made by Professor Pauw, the Afrikaans universities in our country have grown over the past ten years by 112 per cent. Nowadays it is true to an increasing extent that the lecture-rooms of our existing universities are crammed, that the hostels are full, that there is no space in the laboratories and, alas, not always space in the time and attention of professors and other teachers. In saying this I am not accusing the teachers concerned; I am merely sketching the circumstances prevailing at present. We find that if that same rate of growth of the past ten years is maintained during the next ten years we will have more than 100,000 students at our White universities by 1974&#x2014;an average of about 10,000 per university. Pretoria University will then have more than 17,000 students, Stellenbosch more than 11,000 and our two smallest universities will then each have about 4,000 students. It can of course be said that there are universities in other countries which are far larger than this and which nevertheless do good work. That may be so, but I hold the view that the standard of a university does not depend upon numbers and that many of the universities with world-wide reputations and world-wide status are deliberately kept small. That is why I advocate the more personal as against the impersonal.</p>

<p>I want to ask hon. members who have objected so vociferously to the establishment of an independent university at Port Elizabeth as opposed to the division of Rhodes University, whether the fact that Rhodes University started with a division at Port Elizabeth does not prove conclusively the need for a university at Port Elizabeth? If they admit this&#x2014;and I hope that their sense of logic will permit them to admit it&#x2014;then I want to ask them: What is the fundamental difference between a branch of one university at some other place and an independent university there? If they support the branch there, why can they not far sooner and far more easily support the establishment of the full-fledged university there? Mr. Speaker, the question of expense has been raised. I hold the view that it is cheaper to build new than to enlarge and to renovate. I think that we have had proof of this over and over again. We have had the experience that our existing universities have not been planned on a sufficiently large scale. When they were planned at the time, it was impossible to foresee the tremendous expansion that would take place with the result that all of them suffer from impossible limitations. Expansion to-day necessitates the purchase of expensive premises, the demolition of existing buildings and the erection of new ones. That is why I say that if we can erect a new university that is planned to cope with expansion at a place where the need for university facilities already exists we will be doing far more than by wanting to continue in the old way. In this connection it is interesting to know. Sir, that the loans asked for by universities last year in order to enable them to supply their capital requirements amounted to about R9,000,000. I ask myself whether it will really make such a great difference as far as expense is concerned if that money is used for the establishment of a new university instead of providing the expansion that is required in the existing institution. But there is also another consideration as far as I am concerned and that is that any university makes a great contribution to the cultural and intellectual development of the area in which it is situated. I ask myself why this privilege should be limited to the places where universities already exist. I think that this is also a question to which we must give our serious consideration. Mention was also made of the shortage of teachers. This is the same argument that was raised when the establishment of the universities for Coloureds and Bantu was being discussed. I just want to ask hon. members opposite whether they have not <span class="col_375-376" refersTo="page_0202"/>learnt that the history of this country has proved that it has always been possible to find the necessary staff for every new development that has come about on the initiative of the White man.</p>

<heading>MOULD IN GROUNDNUT CROP</heading>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I wish to move, pursuant to Standing Order No. 25&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House do now adjourn.</block>

<p>I do so in order to raise a matter which I consider of great importance to the farming community in particular and to the public in general. I refer, Sir, to the outbreak of a mould in the 1963-4 groundnut crop, known as <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>, in common terminology, aflatoxin poisoning or contamination of this crop. I do so, Sir, because it somewhat astonishes me that in an important matter of this nature, a matter which is obviously dangerous to the public health, which is considerably dangerous to our export market and which is dangerous to the whole of the 1964-5 crop, there has not emanated from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department any statement. The Minister&#x2019;s Department has been aware of this outbreak as far back as October last year, as I understand it.</p>

<p>In order that I may place the position clearly before the House I wish to read to the House the instruction given by the Oil Seed Control Board to their agents&#x2014;all their agents I understand&#x2014;in order to make desperate efforts to recover what residue remains of the 1963-4 crop both in regard to seed and any supplies held by the farmers in the way of feed or compressed meal or any other form in which the residue of the 1963-4 crop is held&#x2014;in plain terminology the residue of the monkey-nut crop. Sir, this instruction is worded in the strongest possible terms. I see the Minister looks slightly surprised; he is apparently not aware of this instruction. Let me place it before the House. This is an instruction to all producers of ground nuts&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; u word dringend versoek om alle voorrade grondbone van die 1963-4 seisoen onmiddellik maar nie later as 31 Januarie 1964 nie by u naaste ontvangsdepot in te lewer. Dit geld ook vir saad wat u aangekoop het maar nie gebruik het nie.</block>

<p>It goes on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Luidens &#x2019;n verslag van die Raad se labora-torium is die grondbone van die 1963-4 seisoen in hierdie gebied aflatoxin-besmet. Geen grondbone van die 1963-4 seisoen mag gedurende die 1964-5 seisoen gelewer word nie, aangesien die besmette graan die onbesmette graan so aantas dat &#x2019;n hele stapel besmet kan raak deur een besmette sak.</block>

<p>Now comes the most important part of this instruction by the Oil Seed Control Board. It is underlined in this circular&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Aflatoxin-besmetting is uiters giftig en hou groot gevaar in vir mens en dier. U same-werking in die verband sal op prys gestel word.</block>

<p>To show the earnest nature of this appeal made by the Oil Seed Control Board to its agents let me read how they preface this circular. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit sal hoog op prys gestel word indien u die inhoud hiervan in &#x2019;n baie ernstige lig sal beskou.</block>

<p>I repeat that I am aware that this matter was known to the Minister&#x2019;s Department as far back as October and that up to date there has been no statement whatsoever from the hon. the Minister in regard to the effect of this outbreak and contamination and the dangers it holds to humans and animals alike. Admittedly the outbreak is confined at the present moment, as I understand it from the Department, to a certain area, an area northwest of Lydenburg in the Transvaal. The plain fact remains that it holds dangers for the infestation of the entire 1964-5 crop, and to show the danger to human life and animal life, I would like to indicate to the House that the consumption alone of edible groundnuts in the internal market consumed by the public, was no less than 12,000 tons-odd in the 1961-2 year and that seed used for seedplanting alone was in excess of 6,500 tons. But more than that, Mr. Speaker, we have to think as well of the economic effects of this outbreak. It must be realized that our exports of oil from groundnuts was in excess of 68,000 tons in the 1961-2 year and our exports of edible nuts were in the region of 24,000 tons for the 1961-2 year. It is increasing every year. If one relates that to what has happened on the overseas market in regard to the same disease as far as the export of nuts from Brazil is concerned and the export of nuts from East and West Africa and the effect the outbreak of this disease had on the groundnut crop as far as Indian exports were concerned to the European and British markets, it must be realized that the effect of this outbreak of aflatoxin poisoning may be that our export markets will be seriously affected. I think all producers in this House, all farmers who know anything about the groundnut crop, will know that prices are presently maintained purely on our exports of oil seed.</p>

<p>I have raised this matter and have placed the facts before the hon. Minister and House because I feel that because of the dangers that are contained in this outbreak, it is a matter <span class="col_377-378" refersTo="page_0203"/>of urgent importance. Let me emphasize again the statement made by the Oil Seed Control Board: &#x201C;Aflatoxin-besmetting is uiters gif tig en hou &#x2019;n groot gevaar in vir mens en dier.&#x201D; A report of this nature, issued by the laboratory of the Oil Seed Control Board would not be issued lightly. In the light of what I have placed before the House in regard to this appeal to an agent of the Board&#x2014;and I assume that all agents of the Board have received it&#x2014;I think it is a matter worthy of the attention of this House and a matter worthy of an adequate statement by the hon. Minister in order to allay any fear that may exist among the consuming public and the farming public of this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member said that no statement was issued in connection with the mould on groundnuts which was caused by toxin, but at the same time he quoted from a circular in which all producers and receivers of groundnuts were warned that this toxin could in certain circumstances be poisonous. What statement did he expect to be issued? He even cast a reflection on the export of groundnuts.</p>

<p>Let me just tell the hon. member that this toxin, this mould which appears on groundnuts, has been known for a long time. We know that it appears on South African groundnuts and that it also affects other grains, in certain circumstances. The infestation has, however, never before assumed any significant proportions in South Africa. Some time last year, however, the oil pressing industry drew the attention of the Oil Seed Control Board and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services to the fact that certain supplies of groundnuts had become infected by this mould, <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>. More or less at the same time various cases of death among chickens which could be ascribed to aflatoxin poisoning were brought to the notice of Onderstepoort. It is a toxin which is caused by this mould and is particularly poisonous to young chickens, turkeys, ducks and pigs.</p>

<p>The Departments concerned, Agricultural Technical Services and Health and my Department, decided immediately that the whole matter should urgently be investigated, particularly to determine the extent of the mould infestation, and also the areas in which the groundnuts have become infested and in which areas not.</p>

<p>The laboratory of the Oil Seed Control Board was converted into an emergency laboratory and chemists were obtained from the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, the C.S.I.R. and the Bureau of Standards who did the necessary analyses. Samples of groundnuts were obtained from all depots and agents. Chemical tests showed that the infestation was general in groundnuts which came from the area north of a line from Lydenburg in the east to the north-western area of Western Transvaal. South of this area any sign of infestation was only found in exceptional cases and only in low grade groundnuts.</p>

<p>At the same time the Oil Seed Control Board arranged with the oil pressing industry that no more groundnuts would be pressed and that no groundnut oil cake or compressed meal would be made available to the balanced diet manufacturing industry unless it had been analysed. Some of the larger pressing units have their own laboratory facilities, but it was suggested to others to make use of the services of private concerns in order to do the necessary analyses.</p>

<p>While the investigations were in progress the Oil Seed Control Board did not rail groundnuts anywhere and all exports were stopped. It was only after the extent of the infestation had been determined that groundnuts were once more supplied from the aflatoxin-free area to groundnut roasters, domestic groundnut manufacturers and oil pressers.</p>

<p>On the strength of the knowledge and data available at the time concerning the toxin, a committee of experts made recommendations regarding the use of groundnut oil cake. The maximum percentage oil cake, in various stages of infestation, that could be added to the various feed mixtures was indicated. According to these recommendations no cake which contained two parts or more per million of the toxin could be used in any mixture at all. Cake containing more than 0.1 part per million was recommended for chickens, milking cows and pigs. For human consumption the groundnuts must be completely free of toxin. The investigations revealed that the mould infestation appeared mainly in the lower grade of groundnut and that there was no infestation in those groundnuts which were specially selected for eating purposes. In the case of the hand-selected groundnuts which are exported by the board and which are also made available by the board to local buyers no afla-infestation has so far been found, either here or overseas, not even in those groundnuts which come from the area where the infestation is mainly evident. All processers of groundnuts do not, however, buy hand-selected supplies and it was arranged with the health authorities that, for the sake of safety, the board would only supply groundnuts from those areas that were found to be free of infestation. When infested groundnuts are pressed any infestation is removed from the oil by the caustic soda which is used in the refining process so that the oil is completely free of infestation. It is only the oil cake which contains the poisonous element.</p>

<p>As far as can be determined there are approximately 29,000 short tons of groundnuts in the hands of agents of the board and more or less 13,000 tons in the hands of pressers which are considered to be infested to a greater or lesser degree. Apart from this there are approximately 4,500 tons of oil cake which is regarded as unusable on account of the degree of its infestation. The board has succeeded in finding a market overseas for the infested supplies in its own possession while <span class="col_379-380" refersTo="page_0204"/>it is also trying to find a market for the infested oil cake as fertilizer. There may be 12,000 tons of such oil cake if the cakes to be manufactured from the 13,000 tons infested groundnuts still to be pressed are added.</p>

<p>Since the middle of October 1963, the date to which the hon. member has referred, only a minimum amount of groundnut oil cake has been used in feed mixtures, and that was only done in those cases where the oil cake was regarded as completely safe. Apart from any maize germ meal and other possible sources of vegetable proteins that may be used, the balanced diet manufacturing industry normally uses approximately 30,000 tons of groundnut cake, 31,000 tons sunflower seed cake, a few thousand tons cotton seed oil cake and approximately 38,000 tons fish, whale and carcass meal per annum.</p>

<p>In view of the fact, therefore, that groundnut cake barely constitutes 20 per cent of the supplementary protein ingredients, it has so far been possible for the industry to make the necessary adaptations, particularly by pressing more sunflower seed. It is also expected that towards the end of April/May sunflower seed will already be available from the new crop. Apart from the requirements for human consumption there are in any case considerable supplies of infested groundnuts available for the pressing industry.</p>

<p>It will be seen therefore that the appearance of aflatoxin, to a dangerous extent, is something which is completely new in South Africa and that preventive steps were immediately taken when we became aware of its existence. The danger of aflatoxin poisoning has, however, been confined to animal feed mixtures and as far as feed mixtures were concerned immediate steps were taken, when we became aware of the danger, to ensure that dangerous oil cake was not supplied to agricultural producers. This aflatoxin infestation in groundnuts is well known overseas. The oil pressers there know how to set about ensuring that it did not appear in dangerous quantities in feed mixtures. That was why the board succeeded in finding a market overseas for a limited supply of infested supplies and the buyers were aware of this.</p>

<p>As far as the future is concerned, measures are already being taken to try to prevent a recurrence of the infestation as far as possible. The aflatoxin mould flourishes especially where you get the right amount of moisture accompanied by high temperature during the harvesting season. These circumstances prevailed during the 1963 harvesting season in the northern areas as a result of un seasonal rains during June 1963. It is surmised that infestation takes place particularly during the harvesting season when the groundnuts lie in heaps on the land but if the necessary conditions of moisture and temperature prevail the mould can also develop further during storage.</p>

<p>A pamphlet containing advice and hints to the producer has already been prepared and will shortly be distributed. In the meantime the first of a series of talks over the radio in this connection has already been delivered. The desirability of harvesting timeously and the precautionary measures to be taken during the harvesting season are emphasized as well as the necessity of a low moisture content to ensure that the groundnuts can be stored with safety. Naturally the extension officers of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services are also kept informed so that they can assist producers with advice, etc. The Control Board will also consider ways and means to encourage its agents and producers, by way of price fixations and by prescribing the grades, to take the necessary precautionary steps during the harvesting season and so as to limit this danger to the minimum.</p>

<p>I think. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will agree that when this infestation became known all necessary steps were immediately taken to keep infested groundnut oil cake and even groundnut seed out of the trade and I think that instead of attacking us and saying that we did not do enough he ought to congratulate the Department and the Oil Seed Control Board and the pressers on having taken action so quickly in order to smother this danger at birth.</p>

<p>I am afraid I cannot agree with the hon. the Minister when he says that the Department took all the necessary steps. It seems to me that his Department took very little interest in human health. There is no evidence whatsoever that his Department, with this dangerous foodstuff floating about the country, apparently in several thousands of tons, took any steps whatsoever to inform the Department of Health of this fact. I happen to know that up to about eight o&#x2019;clock this morning one of the regional departments of Health in the Republic knew nothing about this infection at all nor its danger to humans. How are the doctors to know what is happening when they are not informed by the Department of Health whose duty it is to inform them? How would an ordinary doctor, who is called to a sick child, suspect for one moment that a few seemingly innocent handfuls of monkey-nuts, which every child will gobble down with the greatest of glee and which every member of this House no doubt has eaten, contain a deadly poison? I am certain that had the Minister&#x2019;s Department informed the Department of Health of these facts the Department of Health would have had the disease investigated and would have issued notices to doctors warning them of the danger and if possible, instructing them how to deal with such cases, especially as the symptoms are very often masked by other diseases and imitate the symptoms of other diseases. I think this reflects gravely upon the Minister and his Department.</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_bantu_education" to="#gorshel">

<from><span class="col_389-390" refersTo="page_0209"/>The MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No complaints have been received but when the results of the Junior Certificate examination 1963 were announced certain newspapers conjectured that the remarkable achievement in the examination was the result of a lowering of the standard of Bantu education.</li>

<li>(2) With the view to remove all misunderstanding in this connection, I am prepared to state that the improvement in the Junior Certificate examination, as is also the case with the results of the Matrix examination, has absolutely nothing to do with a lowering of standards or lesser requirements which could have been set to candidates in the examinations.</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">The standard of the Matriculation and Senior Certificate examination is controlled by the Joint Matriculation Board and in the Junior Certificate examination the same standard as before is expected of candidates in all subjects. Examination papers are set by the same highly qualified examiners, controlled by the same capable moderators as before and are available for inspection to anyone who is competent to judge. The syllabuses of the Department of Bantu Education are in no way surpassed by the syllabuses of any other education department. All standards which are set in the examinations of the Department of Bantu Education are determined by and are subject to the control of the Department&#x2019;s Examinations Board in which highly qualified professional representatives of White as well as non-White universities of our provincial education departments and of the Joint Matriculation Board are also members. As from 1959 the results of the Junior Certificate examinations show a definite improvement. In 1959 the percentage passes were 41.8 per cent, in 1960 56.1 per cent, in 1961 54.5 per cent and in 1962 56.9 per cent. At the end of 1963 a total of 9,532 Bantu pupils wrote the Junior Certificate examination. Of these a total of 7,456 pupils or 78 per cent passed. The results of the Junior Certificate examination 1963 therefore show a remarkable improvement which is particularly striking when the details are analysed:</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) Thirty-three candidates passed with distinction, i.e. they passed with an average of 70 per cent and higher. Against this the number of distinctions in the previous four years was never more than 11 in one year.</li>

<li>(b) The number of candidates who passed in the first class in 1963 was 1,051 (or 11 per cent of the total) against 446 (or 4.5 per cent of the total) of the previous year.</li>

<li>(c) Also, 3,822 pupils (or 40 per cent of the total) passed in the second class and 2,550 pupils (or 26.7 per cent of the total) obtained third class.</li>

</ol>

<p>The improvement in the examination achievement of the Junior Certificate over the past four years and particularly in 1963 must be attributed to the following factors:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Since 1960 only pupils who obtained a Continuation Certificate in Std. VI were admitted to secondary schools. The weaker pupils who were in the past also admitted to secondary classes can now only obtain a school-leaving certificate and are eliminated from secondary schools. With pupils who are better trained and grounded scholastically, work of a higher standard can be produced in secondary schools, as the Junior Certificate results for 1963 now bear out.</li>

<li>(2) The group of Junior Certificate candidates who wrote the examinations last year is the first group which received its tuition through the medium of the mother tongue throughout the entire period of the primary school. This must necessarily prove that pupils get a better grasp of the subject-matter and gain a better insight when they are taught through the mother tongue in the primary school. This is particularly noticeable in a subject such as arithmetic, in which the performance of the pupils in the past was usually weak.</li>

<li>(3) The Junior Certificate syllabuses of Bantu education appeared for the first time in 1957, initially as draft syllabuses. It therefore took some time before the compilers and publishers of handbooks could supply the necessary textbooks to the secondary schools. These syllabuses have since been finally accepted and handbooks, which are now freely available to pupils and teachers, have contributed much towards the improvement of the general standard of Bantu education.</li>

<li>(4) Through the introduction in 1960 of a Division of Psychological Services and the application of scholastic and aptitude test in Std. VI classes, standardized tests are now made available to secondary schools. These tests lead to a better selection of pupils for admission to post-primary schools.</li>

<li>(5) Better educational facilities are being continuously created by the Department, more and more school buildings with <span class="col_391-392" refersTo="page_0210"/>properly equipped laboratories, libraries and better qualified and trained teachers are available.</li>

</ol>

<p>In the Matriculation and Senior Certificate examination in which the same requirements are set for Bantu as for White pupils and where there is no question about the lowering of standards, Bantu pupils showed a marked improvement over the last three years and in the examination of 1963 in particular there is a remarkable similarity in the achievements in both examinations. The increase in the percentage passes in the Matriculation and Senior Certificate examination from 40 per cent in 1962 to 60.5 per cent in 1963, refutes any suggestion of a so-called lowering of standards or inferiority in Bantu education.</p>

<p>No, I did not receive such an invitation nor did I pay such a visit or hold such discussions.</p>

<p>My attention has been directed to a report to this effect in the 8 September 1963 edition of the London <i>Observer</i> in which this untruth is stated as a fact by a certain Colin Legum. It presumably originated in a blatant he to this effect which appeared prominently as a report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> some time ago, obviously with the intention of disturbing the relations between the Republic and Swaziland.</p>

<heading>Permission for Investment of Funds Abroad</heading>

<question by="#emdin" to="#minister_of_finance">

<num>*XXI.</num>

<from>Mr. EMDIN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Finance:</p>

<p>Whether any banks or financial institutions have been given permission to invest surplus funds abroad; if so,</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) what banks or institutions,</li>

<li>(b) how much was each permitted to invest abroad and</li>

<li>(c) on what terms and conditions.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_finance" to="#emdin">

<from>The MINISTER OF FINANCE:</from>

<p>Yes. As I explained in the course of my remarks when introducing the Part Appropriation Bill last year, this facility is available to all commercial banks. In addition two other undertakings have, on application to the Exchange Control, been permitted to retain temporarily overseas for investment there, certain funds accruing to them there which would otherwise have had to be brought back to South Africa.</p>

<p>(a) and (b) The amounts so invested have varied from time to time, but as at 23 <span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0211"/>January 1964 the following amounts were held abroad by the commercial banks under these arrangements:</p>

<table>

<tr>

<td><p>Barclays Bank D.C.O.</p></td>

<td><p>R17,000,000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Chase Manhattan Bank (S.A.) Limited</p></td>

<td><p>R500,000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Netherlands Bank of South Africa Limited</p></td>

<td><p>R1,000,000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Standard Bank of South Africa Limited</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Volkskas Limited</p></td>

<td><p>R8,000,000</p></td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>At the same date the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited, with the permission of the Exchange Control, held overseas approximately R8,430,000. Last year the Accepting Bank for Industry Limited was allowed to retain abroad approximately R500,000, but this amount has since been repatriated.</p>

<p>(c) The authority to the commercial banks is granted on a monthly basis, and the investments are covered under an exchange guarantee by the South African Reserve Bank. The authority granted to the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited is for a period of three months from 30 November 1963, and no exchange guarantee is involved.</p>

<li>(a) What educational qualifications are required from candidates for commissioned rank in the Permanent Force and</li>

<li>(b) what is the duration of the training course for such candidates;</li>

<li>(3) whether Permanent Force officers are required to pass any courses in order to be considered for appointment to the Staff Corps; if so, what courses.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#bronkhorst">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) The prescribed minimum educational qualification for appointment with officer&#x2019;s rank in the Permanent Force is the Certificate of the Joint Matriculation Board or an equivalent certificate. The Permanent Force Regulations, however, vest the Minister with power to appoint persons who do not comply with this requirement with officer&#x2019;s rank in the Permanent Force. This is only done when a candidate has special knowledge of and/or experience in a mustering, for which candidates with the required educational qualifications cannot be found, and provided the person complies with all other requirements for appointment with officer&#x2019;s rank.</li>

<li>(b) It varies according to the arm of the service, branch and mustering in which the appointment is made from five months to five years.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(2)

<ol>

<li>(a) A Lieutenant must have two years&#x2019; service in his rank before he is allowed to write the prescribed examinations for promotion to Captain and three years&#x2019; service before he can be considered for promotion.</li>

<li>(b) A Captain may write the prescribed examinations for promotion to Major in his third year of service in his rank and is eligible for promotion <span class="col_395-396" refersTo="page_0212"/>as soon as he is fully qualified.</li>

<li>(c) No examinations are written for promotion to the rank of Commandant and higher and there is no restriction on service in a particular rank.

<p>The Permanent Force Regulations empower the Minister to promote any officer who does not comply with the prescribed requirements with regard to qualifications and service to Captain&#x2019;s rank unless he has completed four years&#x2019; service in the rank of Lieutenant.</p></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(3) Yes, a staff duties course or a course which in the opinion of the Commandant-General, South African Defence Force, is equivalent to a staff duties course. The Minister may, in special circumstances, post an officer of Commandant&#x2019;s or higher rank to the South African Staff Corps although such officer has not qualified at a staff duties course.</li>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) Yes.</li>

<p>For the information of the House I wish to make a short statement on how I envisage further developments in this connection.</p>

<p>I regard it as necessary that before the Government takes decisions, informs the House in a White Paper of its intentions and gives an opportunity here for a discussion thereon, the inhabitants of South West Africa should be properly consulted. Consequently I have decided to arrange for a public meeting in Windhoek on 15 February next under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister for South West Africa Affairs in order to submit the report itself to the White population. Since I will address this meeting <span class="col_399-400" refersTo="page_0214"/>as Prime Minister, and not as party leader, I intend asking the Administration of South West Africa to make the necessary arrangements for the organization of the meeting.</p>

<p>The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the Minister of Coloured Affairs will immediately thereafter discuss the report with the racial groups entrusted to their care, as far as the report affects those groups, in a series of meetings at suitable places.</p>

<p>The hon. the Administrator and members of the Executive Committee have already been furnished with copies of the report, and I have asked the Administrator to summon the Legislative Assembly for a special session not later than February in order to consider the report.</p>

<p>Only after these meetings have taken place, the Government, taking into consideration the reactions, will consider the report, issue the White Paper and arrange for an opportunity for a general discussion in the House, that is to say apart from the opportunities for special discussions which may follow should legislation be required. I hope that it will still be possible to submit and discuss the White Paper during March.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion of the Minister of Education, Arts and Science, adjourned on 27 January, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#van_der_spuy">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>When the discussion was interrupted yesterday I was discussing the alleged shortage of teachers. I concluded my remarks with a statement that I want very much to repeat and emphasize and that is that it has been proved in our history over and over again that every new development of the Whites has led to the supplying of the necessary labour forces for the maintenance and improvement of that development. As far as the academic sphere is concerned, I believe that in this country it is not so much a question of a lack of manpower to cope with the present growth, although I do admit that there is a shortage in certain highly specialized spheres, but is more a question of the judicious placing in employment of trained people who are able to do more responsible work. I do not think that we can permit an artificial restriction <span class="col_409-410" refersTo="page_0219"/>upon our growth to lead to gifted people being used in the performance of less important work. Indeed, a normal growth takes the trained workers higher up the ladder to the top and those people who are gifted are promoted in order to fill these vacancies. This has been the experience that we have had with, for example, the university colleges for the Coloureds and the Bantu. These institutions have all succeeded in obtaining the necessary teachers. They have attracted these people mainly from the other institutions and, I think that I can say, without this having a very adverse effect upon those existing institutions.</p>

<p>I would like to reply to the question of whether we have sufficient teachers by giving a few interesting figures. At the moment, we are producing 5,000 graduates per year of whom 1,000 obtain advanced degrees and 100 doctors&#x2019; degrees. About 1,000 people go abroad for further study, mostly for advanced degrees, and of these, 100 also obtain doctors&#x2019; degrees. We therefore have a potential of about 200 doctorates per annum. But what is more, if a university is at all worth its salt, one of its advantages will be that it will be able to supply its own needs, or, at least, to supply most of its own needs. I believe that the proposed university at Port Elizabeth will be able to attract more students from that group which at present is not attending or cannot attend some or the other university. I believe that it will gradually be able to obtain teachers from that group.</p>

<p>But if we approach the matter from another quarter and we presume what I do not believe&#x2014;that there is indeed a shortage of teachers in the light of our present growth&#x2014;then I would like to point out that the average number of students per faculty member in the Republic of South Africa is 13. I am speaking now of the Whites only, but I may say in passing that in the case of White and non-White jointly the number is also 13. In contrast to this we find that in Germany the average number of students per faculty member is 24 and in Holland it is 26. I ask myself whether any member will have the courage to stand up in this House and say that the university work that is done in Germany and in Holland is of an inferior standard to that done in this country. I also believe that even if there is a temporary shortage of academic personnel our present teachers at the universities are sufficiently conscious of their calling to take more upon themselves, if necessary, and teach more students in order by this means to release teachers for this proposed institution. I heartily support the establishment of this university and I wish everyone concerned with it every success. As I said yesterday, I trust that the success that they achieve will strengthen us on the Witwatersrand in our efforts to have a second university established there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) who has just sat down has been talking about the shortage of teachers and technical manpower. We agree, and that is why we on this side support in principle the establishment of this university, but before we do so I would like to say in all seriousness that while this university, we hope, will help to correct the shortage of manpower, there are some essentials in this Bill which cannot be accepted without clarification. There is a need for a university in Port Elizabeth to train expert personnel for local industry as well as for the industries and social services of South Africa as a whole, and this side of the House also believes that a genuine bilingual university will be a meeting-point of English-and Afrikaans-speaking students. But we feel, too, that the establishment of this university could be made an important factor in welding the two language groups of our nation into South African national unity. I myself, as the hon. the Minister will recollect, advocated last year the establishment of a bilingual pre-university college as a factor to encourage national unity, but this college which I advocated, like the institution referred to in the Bill before the House, must remain bilingual. The safeguards requested by this side of the House are concerned with two main principles. They are mainly the high standards of teaching and true and free bilingualism.</p>

<p>Before dealing with these points, I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the question of finance. In this Bill I see no reference to the sources of finance. While one understands that there are certain private sources busy at this moment finding finance for this university, this Bill has been introduced by the Government, and this is not a private Bill but a Government Bill, according to Mr. Speaker&#x2019;s ruling yesterday. I feel that the Minister should state in this Bill the mode of financing, the capital cost of establishing the university, and also the annual cost of running it. I would like to have the Minister&#x2019;s answer to this question of finance.</p>

<p>The second point I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister is that I feel that the amendment which the Minister has put forward to Clause 8 is an improvement. As it stood in the original Bill the clause would give the Minister the power of blocking the appointment of a principal selected by the university council if the choice of the council did not coincide with that of the Minister, in which case the clause as it stands states that the principal should be appointed &#x201C;in that other manner prescribed by statute&#x201D;. Now one felt that this interference with the freedom of choice by the council had a sinister air about it, and one feels that the Government and the Minister have been well advised to avoid creating suspicion in the minds of the public that the Government intended to place its &#x201C;stooge&#x201D; in the Chair of the Rector of that university. Secondly. I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this further point of possible friction, and that is Clause 10. It is important to the public to assure them of the avoidance of any possible appearance of sectarianism in the composition of the Senate of this new university, if we want to achieve a truly bilingual establishment; <span class="col_411-412" refersTo="page_0220"/>and yet this clause as it stands discloses the intention of the Minister. He could, if he so wished, pack the Senate with his appointees, because sub-section (2) states that the Minister can appoint members to the Senate but not less than the other members of the Senate, the other members of course being the principal of the university, two members elected by the university council and the professors of that university; and furthermore, in sub-section (10) (i) (d) it states that persons appointed by the Minister in respect of each faculty shall be professors in the corresponding faculties of Rhodes University or the University of Stellenbosch. I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention particularly to the word &#x201C;or&#x201D;. Now, as it stands, this wording would leave the Minister free to appoint all the members of the Senate, if he so wished, either from Rhodes or Stellenbosch. I feel that the English-speaking section of this country has good reason to fear any implication of the packing of the Senate. We wish therefore to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this, as I notice that he has not put any amendment concerning this clause on the Order Paper. The test of the general intention behind this Bill is contained in Clause 14, to which the Minister has an amendment on the Order Paper. This section, as it stands, perpetuates the iniquitous curtailing of the freedom of choice of the medium of learning which already exists in primary and secondary education. We on this side maintain that academic freedom demands that in a genuinely bilingual university the student should have the right to choose both, or either English or Afrikaans, as the language medium of instruction, and furthermore, in practice, for the efficiency of the running of a bilingual university, such freedom of choice is demanded. This could be demonstrated very easily by a single example. Let us assume that you have a Faculty of Science at this university, and in that Faculty of Science the Chair of Physics has to be filled, and through advertisement or invitation the best qualified man or woman has to be selected, and such a person may be English speaking or Afrikaans speaking, or bilingual, and similarly in this department a lecturer in specialized subjects like electricity or magnetism or thermodynamics would be bilingual. It is surely for the students themselves to make the selection in what medium they want instruction. I notice that in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s amendment the circumstances under which the instruction shall or may be given through the one language or the other shall be determined by the Senate. I would suggest to the Minister that this should surely be determined, if possible, by the students themselves, and that they should have the right to select the language, because it would be unjust to students to limit their teaching because of any restrictions. The Minister should bear in mind that with the shortage of personnel it may be difficult or impossible to fill every post with bilingual people, and in addition the cost of running the university might become prohibitively expensive if every Chair or lectureship has to be duplicated.</p>

<p>I abide by your ruling, Sir, but I feel that the Minister should lay the emphasis on the students rather than on the Senate.</p>

<p>There are various other aspects of the establishment of this new university which concerns the public in general. Educational bodies have expressed their opinions and I feel that these voices should be heard before Parliament decides on the final form of this very important Act. While one appreciates that a commission has already sat on the desirability of establishing this university, I fully support the request from this side of the House that this Bill should go to a Select Committee to canvass the opinions of responsible persons and the educational bodies, including the two Universities of Stellenbosch and Rhodes, and also the Municipalities of Port Elizabeth and East London, in order to present to this House the best form of legislation and to improve the contentious parts of the Bill which have been referred to by members on this side.</p>

<p>There is a further important reason for asking for a Select Committee, and that is the necessity for allaying the fears and suspicions of those sections of the Afrikaans- and English-speaking people of South Africa who are not supporters of this Government, and for the establishment of a truly bilingual university. The Bill, after having gone to a Select Committee, can be an important factor in bringing together the Afrikaans- and English-speaking youth, and bringing about the much-desired unity between the two White population sections. Therefore, in supporting the motion that the Bill should go to a Select Committee, I feel that the Government and the Minister would be well advised to go out of their way to demonstrate their honesty of purpose by appointing a Select Committee to deal with the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall reply as far as possible in the course of my speech to the case put forward by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss). Sir, we are concerned here with the establishment of a new university, which can be a source of inspiration and knowledge to us in the rapidly growing Republic of South Africa. South Africa, with her phenomenal growth in various spheres, needs not only one additional university but, according to expert reports, possibly even two within the next few years. It is definitely necessary to establish this university, and to establish it in Port Elizabeth. People who have undertaken research in this direction have made the allegation that at least 8 per cent of the people of every country are the people who take the lead in various spheres of life. They are the leaders of the community, and it follows also that they are the people who have received higher education. In South Africa, where we have a White population of 3,500,000 and a much bigger non-White <span class="col_413-414" refersTo="page_0221"/>population, a much more onerous task rests on the shoulders of the Whites and a much bigger percentage of the White population must receive higher education because at this stage the non-Whites still do not contribute their 8 per cent to serve or to lead the non-White population. That is why we cannot make a true comparison between the figures for South Africa and the figures for countries overseas because their populations are differently constituted. I say that according to statistics and according to the research which has been done by various committees, an additional one or even two universities will be needed within the next ten years. I am grateful that the first one is now going to be established in Port Elizabeth. As an inhabitant of the Witwatersrand I also want to express the hope immediately that the second vacancy will be filled by establishing an Afrikaans university on the Rand.</p>

<p>But let us come back to Port Elizabeth. Port Elizabeth is now to be given a university but I was very interested to discover in one of the old works of reference which I looked up that there was a time earlier on when higher education was available in Port Elizabeth. I found a booklet written by Professor A. S. Kidd, who was chairman of the Senate of Rhodes. This booklet entitled &#x201c;Higher Education in the Cape Colony, 1874-1910&#x201D; contains quite a number of interesting bits of information about the educational institutions of the Cape Province in the previous century, with specific reference to Port Elizabeth. Grey Institute which used to be in Port Elizabeth gave higher education as far back as 1880-3 and even had students taking the B.A. degree. It is interesting to see that in those days there was an inspection of the various colleges and that an inspector-general named Donald Ross was appointed there. Well, we have a Mr. Donald Ross in this House at the moment, but even in those days this educationist displayed much more loyalty to South Africa and its education than this hon. member does.</p>

<p>Why do you say that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to quote a few arguments in connection with this matter. Here is a report which was brought out by this Mr. Ross&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It cannot be said that the question of university studies has yet been solved in this country. The Higher Education Act has only shelved it and there is no positive proof that the country has gone in finally for an examining body as its ideal of a university, or that it would reject the university system that has done so much for liberal culture and popular advance as that of Germany or Scotland has done. &#x2026; To prepare highly educated students, after all, is more important than to impress the stamp upon those who are taught; to teach well is infinitely more important than to examine; and though it is a fact that a good examining body stirs up the best energies of a good teaching body, it may be seriously doubted whether all the higher or university education of this country might not be carried on by one organization with unity and harmony in its operations.</block>

<p>He held the view in those days that one central body should be established and that all universities and higher education institutions should be established as subdivisions of this super-body. What happened in practice in the following period proved, of course, that this was impracticable and impossible.</p>

<p>But to come nearer to Port Elizabeth again, there were six colleges in those days and he says that according to the numbers even the six together did not justify one university. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus in all there are six colleges with a staff of 22. No one could reasonably expect these colleges to be on a level with the higher seats of learning of old-established countries&#x2014;. The first glimpse of them gives an unnatural combination of the university and the school. For, somehow, connected with every one of them, there is a preparatory school or what might pass for one.</block>

<p>Then he comes to this institution in Port Elizabeth&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Grey Institute the college department is completely dwarfed or pushed into a comer by two first-class schools which, somehow or other, have sprung into spurious being and taken possession of the main building.</block>

<p>I want to read out one further quotation and that is from the report which he drew up on this specific college, Grey Institute. He quotes from the report of the S.G.E. in 1885 and this is how he puts it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The history of the Grey Institute under the Higher Education Act is not one of any glory. For ten years it drew a grant of &#x00A3;400 a year, but Port Elizabeth thirty years ago&#x2014;</block>

<p>This booklet was written in 1910&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; was not enthusiastic in educational matters. In 1876 the Grey Institute had a matriculation course and 32 students and nothing more: in 1881 it had one B.A. student, one student in surveying and 20 matric students. &#x2026; It is not surprising that in the S.G.E.&#x2019;s report for 1885 we read as follows: &#x201C;From July 1885 the Grey Institute has occupied the position of a first-class public school and with its grant schools at North End and South End it is now likely to do more effectual service to the cause of elementary instruction than when aided under the Higher Education Act for advanced <span class="col_415-416" refersTo="page_0222"/>classes connected with the work of a university.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In other words, there were higher education institutions in Port Elizabeth as far back as that year. The fact of the matter is that that institution came to an end, and from this conglomerate of colleges there arose the Universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch and Rhodes and a number of teachers&#x2019; training colleges. As has already been pointed out, the number of Whites in Port Elizabeth has increased to 103,000 and these people, or large numbers of them, are people who actually work, middle-class people who make an honourable and decent living but who are not so well off that they can afford to send their children to distant universities and to pay for board and lodging there. In that respect the establishment of the university will bring about a very great improvement for Port Elizabeth and its environs because a large number of students will not be deprived now of university education because of economic considerations.</p>

<p>I come to the question of donors and the collection of funds. It is very encouraging to see that the target of R750,000 which was set as the amount to be contributed by the people of Port Elizabeth has already been passed. It only goes to show that those people have the determination and the will to have an institution of this kind. That brings me back to this whole question of donors and the collection of funds, and I think the House will be interested to hear a few figures from the annual report of the Department of Education, Arts and Science. I have looked up the allowances which are given by the State and the income which occurs to the various universities. I have worked out that in Cape Town the contribution of the Government per student is R253 as agains R143 which is collected by the university itself. In Johannesburg the State&#x2019;s contribution is R296 as against a collection of R201 per student. At Rhodes the State&#x2019;s contribution is R404 whilst the university&#x2019;s own income is R134 per student. In Natal the State subsidy is R308, as against R133. In Pretoria the subsidy is R224 per student as against R113 from the university&#x2019;s own funds. In Stellenbosch the State subsidy is R256 as against R109; in the Orange Free State it is R299 as against R90 and in Potchefstroom it is R366 as against R105. In every one of our institutions the State subsidy is much bigger than, and in some cases more than three times as much as, the amount contributed from the institutions&#x2019; own funds, which clearly proves that the State is fully discharging its duty in respect of higher education, and as far as this institution is concerned it will also discharge its duties to the full.</p>

<p>I want to come to the Bill itself. The first feature which distinguishes this Bill from previous Bills is that it is not a Private Bill but is being introduced by the Government itself. The second interesting feature is that what is being established here is not a university college but a university. We have had the criticism from the Opposition in respect of Clause 10 that the constitution of the Senate of this university is such that the Minister can pack the senate, to use the last speaker&#x2019;s words. Our task, however, is to see that this institution becomes a recognized institution and that its degrees are recognized. Before it achieves status amongst the institutions of the world and before it can hold its own in South Africa and acquire the reputation which our older universities have, there is the problem, of course, of having its degrees recognized and its standard accepted. In my opinion, therefore, the Minister is perfectly correct in laying down the policy that the members of the senate will be appointed, half from Stellenbosch and half from Rhodes, and that these two universities jointly will have more representatives serving on the senate of the Port Elizabeth university than Port Elizabeth itself. That means that the two older institutions will have the majority on the senate; they will, therefore, give the necessary status to it and will exercise supervision over the standard, thus ensuring recognition of the degrees. The authority and the influence of the two other institutions will gradually disappear with the granting of recognition, with the result that we will then find, as at all the other universities, that the senate will be constituted on quite a different basis. I feel, therefore, that the Opposition is unnecessarily raising a hullabaloo here. There is nothing sinister or ideological in connection with this matter. The object is to give status to this institution and to have its degrees recognized by constituting its council in such a way that there will be no doubt as to the standard of the work which is produced there.</p>

<p>Then I come to the language question, which is apparently another sore point with the Opposition. The Minister has stated perfectly clearly that we are dealing here with a bilingual institution; that it will be an institution in which both languages will be used, and what happens in practice will depend upon the circumstances as they develop there. The hon. member for Johannesburg North has just put forward the proposition that the student should be able to choose in which language he wishes to receive his training. Mr. Speaker, is that practicable; is it administratively practicable if to begin with there is a small number of students? I am not talking about the B.A. class for Afrikaans or history or one of the popular subjects, a class in which there are going to be many students; I am talking about those specified courses which will be taken by only a few students. Let us assume that there are seven or eight students taking a certain course and that five of them prefer Afrikaans as the medium of instruction and two English. Does the hon. member really want this institution to go to the expense of appointing two professors for that particular subject or to have two sets of lectures, one lecture in Afrikaans and the next lecture in English? <span class="col_417-418" refersTo="page_0223"/>Must this be done for people in the Republic of South Africa which has stood for a policy of bilingualism ever since 1910? Has she really so little confidence in people of matriculation standard that she believes that they are not bilingual, that they will not be able to follow a lecture in the second language when they go to university? I know&#x2014;and it was a shock to me to discover this&#x2014;that there are certain places where little attention is paid to bilingualism. I do not want to talk about it here but may I just mention the City Council of Cape Town. I must mention it here because it shocked me when I happened to walk up the Avenue above Adderley Street and saw a notice board there, put up by the Town Clerk of Cape Town, on the instructions of the City Council, on which there was painted, &#x201C;Kennis geskiet&#x201D; (it sounds as though they want to shoot the doves in the Avenue) &#x201C;hiermee dat ennigeen&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I am talking about bilingualism in this sense that we have had bilingualism since 1910, and I accept that we are going to have bilingualism at this university because our matriculants are capable There is no doubt that the whole country of understanding the second language, but it comes as a shock to me that in actual fact the City Council of Cape Town still does not practice bilingualism. Let me state the position perfectly clearly. The fact that we are going to make this university a bilingual institution is in no way a departure from or a violation of the National Party&#x2019;s policy of mother-tongue instruction. On the contrary the policy of mother-tongue instruction is educationally correct and that is why we will adhere to it, but we believe that our children should be able, when they reach high school and after high school, to receive their training in any one of the two official languages. It is therefore no departure from our policy of mother-tongue instruction, but in the primary schools we will adhere to it because it is in the interests of the child on purely educational grounds and not on political grounds, as Opposition members always seek to suggest.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to come to Clause 23&#x2014;the other objection which came from the Opposition&#x2014;namely the constitution of the temporary council. I think this objection came from the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore). After all, Clause 23 states perfectly clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Until the publication of the statute in the <i>Gazette</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) such persons, not exceeding nine, as the Minister may appoint as members of the Council shall also be such members. &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington strenuously objects to this as though the Minister is coming along here with a packed council, but surely it is perfectly clear that there is no question here of packing the council. It is quite clear that the Minister has no sinister motive here. This is an interim council which is being constituted until the statute is promulgated, and it is a question of time before that can be done. Why this objection is being raised, only hon. members of the Opposition themselves will know. Finally, the Opposition objected to the appointment of the Rector; to the fact that the Minister has to approve of the appointment of the Rector, the principal of the university. But surely that is the position in respect of every university institution in our country at the present time. It is stated in their statutes in one form or another that the appointment of the Rector shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. Why then create the impression abroad that this is only being inserted into the statute of this institution and that it does not appear in the statutes of the other universities? Why this great hullabaloo; why these insinuations? No, the position is perfectly clear to me. Sir, before I come to my final point I want to say just a few words about the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. We all accept&#x2014;it was stated perfectly clearly by the Opposition&#x2014;that there was a fairly great hullabaloo at the beginning about the establishment of this institution, but to-day everybody, even including the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), accepts that that fuss is over and done with and that to-day there is co-operation in connection with this whole matter. In other words, the problem has resolved itself. Certain problems did arise; there was a certain amount of unpleasantness, but in actual fact the problem has now resolved itself completely. Why appoint a Select Committee now to call up all those people to come and tell us here how they quarrelled? Such a Select Committee would be nothing but a platform for gossip; what else could it be? Why rake up all these old stories again? It would serve no useful purpose. The problem has resolved itself. The City Council of Port Elizabeth wholeheartedly supports the establishment of this institution; both the university of Rhodes and the University of Stellenbosch wholeheartedly support it and the whole of the United Party wholeheartedly supports it. What would be the purpose of a Select Committee in this connection other than to delay this matter? No, I do not think any argument has been advanced here which justifies the appointment of a Select Committee to delay this matter further and unnecessarily. There is a need for such an institution; members of the public have made their contribution; they have demonstrated their willingness quite clearly; the City Council of Port Elizabeth has donated the land; everything is <span class="col_419-420" refersTo="page_0224"/>in readiness; the time is as ripe as it could possibly be, and I think it would be mean towards Port Elizabeth and its inhabitants to go and delay this matter by the appointment of a Select Committee.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by conveying our congratulations to Port Elizabeth and by expressing the view that here we are going to have a university, which at the moment will be different from other universities in its constitution and in its form but where we are very clearly going to find one spirit only, and that is the spirit that we expect and that we are going to have at this university because it has grown out of this co-operation&#x2014;a spirit of putting the interests of South Africa above all other interests in every respect.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>There is no doubt that the whole country welcomes the establishment of a university in Port Elizabeth. People would similarly welcome the establishment of a university in other parts of the country. It is not only important for Port Elizabeth and its environs that a university should be established there, it is important for the whole country, and because it is important for the whole country one believes that it is necessary for the whole country to hear the details as to why an institution of this sort should be established in Port Elizabeth. The mere fact that hon. members on the Government side are so keen to avoid having a Select Committee makes me suspicious that it is necessary to have a Select Committee. I feel that there must be reason for suspicion. I don&#x2019;t know. I know the Minister and I know how he carries out his work; he carries it out efficiently and along one line. Sir, let us say that the establishment of this university has become necessary. May I say constructively now that we who know how much this country needs selected manpower as much as ordinary manpower must make every effort to enroll into this university as many students as possible, students in all fields of scientific activity. I was a little perturbed when the Minister said that the university would open up with only certain faculties. I would like to see the university start off with those faculties which are difficult to establish, those faculties in which we find to-day that South Africa has the greatest shortage of manpower. I will come back to that in a moment. Let us just deal firstly with the suspicion I have about this university. The Minister has taken upon himself the power to veto the appointment of a principal. The Minister will virtually pick the man he wants. It is no good saying that he will not do that; he will do it. Not only will the Minister pick the principal but at the same time he will also select the person who will act as vice-chancellor and chairman of the senate. Sir. I am not afraid of the actions of this Minister. He is not always going to be the Minister of Education. There is going to be a change. He knows that as well as I do. But what I am perturbed about is the damage that may be done between now until the change does take place, and that is why we want certain safeguards. The safeguard which I want to see entrenched in this Statute is most important, and that is that the university shall remain a bilingual university. I do not like the attitude of the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Muller) who, in the course of his speech here this afternoon, said that if there were not enough students to justify the continuation of classes in one language or another then one language only shall be used. The Minister says that we have passed the stage where we should concern ourselves with which language is going to be used in the class. I am concerned about that. I am concerned to protect the rights of the minority, and if there are five Afrikaans students and 25 English students it is not necessary for the lectures to be given solely in English and vice versa. You must remember, Sir, that in this university we hope that there will be a 50-50 enrolment of Afrikaans- and English-speaking students. We have to make sure that this Minister does not interfere in such a way that the rights of any of the students are interfered with. It must be the right of the student to pick the language in which he wishes to be taught. There are many, many students to-day who speak one language or the other and who want to be taught in the other language. I know that if I had to go back to university to-day I certainly would not go to an English-medium university. I would specifically go to an Afrikaans-medium university where I would have the privilege of learning the other language. That is what we want; we want to see parallel classes, and if this university is a success it can prove how wrong the Minister was when he advocated mother-tongue education in high schools as well when he was in the Transvaal Provincial Council. We want to reach the stage in South Africa where this university can be an example to the high schools, a university where both language groups can go and learn through the medium of the language of their choice. If it cannot be a success in these schools then it is going to be difficult for it to be a success at the university.</p>

<p>They should have the same choice in the schools which they have in the universities. That is what I want.

<p>What the hon. member has just said amazes me. It has been one of the disappointments of teaching in the high schools that it has not produced bilingualism. We have heard over and over again that very many high school children who have passed matriculation are not bilingual. We have heard that from the Afrikaans groups and from the English groups and you know, Sir, as well as I do, that that is a fact. You only have to go into the services where we have an enrolment of high school students from both groups and we find them deficient in both languages. They are not proficient either in English or in Afrikaans. Only a few of them are thoroughly bilingual. We must try to avoid that. The reason for that is the failure of the unilingual schools. I hope that this university is going to prove our point. Sir, I want to come to a very important aspect of this university, one that concerns me personally as a doctor. I have from time to time said in the House how short we are of medical personnel. I make an appeal to the Minister to start his medical faculty at Port Elizabeth as soon as possible. One of the tragedies of this country is that Ministers from time to time have neglected the call to increase the number of students at university who take up medicine. We have asked from time to time for an enlargement of the medical faculty in the already established universities but nothing has been done. All sorts of excuses have been given. I ask the Minister this afternoon to establish a medical faculty at Port Elizabeth immediately. In Port Elizabeth he has a chance which is denied to many other towns. He has sufficient hospital material there; he has sufficient space and I am sure he has sufficient money and, as he well knows, he has the support of at least 200 doctors in the area who will help to establish that medical faculty. That is something that must be started immediately. Even if he started this afternoon and, even if the first students entered the portals of the medical faculty this afternoon, it would still take seven years at least for that student to become a doctor.</p>

That is why I say let us start now, and let the Minister say that if he does nothing else he will at least establish a medical school as soon as he possibly can. He will have an opportunity there of teaching not only White students, but because of the non-White population in the adjacent areas such as the Transkei and because of the hospital accommodation in Port Elizabeth he will have an opportunity also to train non-White doctors. I make this appeal to him this afternoon and I say to him that if he does that he will justify the establishment of this university.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to keep the House any longer. I wish the Minister every success in his undertaking. I am sure that the people will give him every help. I am also certain that the industrialists and the businessmen in and around Port Elizabeth are waiting to help him not only to establish this university but to keep it going. I hope that all will listen to the appeals which have come from this House and put their hands deeply in their pockets and give to the university and give to the students who want to attend the university and who cannot afford to pay their university education.</p>

<p>When a new university is founded in South Africa it is, to my way of thinking, a joyful day for the whole nation. I say this because in the world and in the Africa in which we are living to-day, we cannot afford to lose any of our intellectual material. Our best answer to the attacks made upon us to-day is to put to the best use our youthful mental material; that is also why it is our best investment.</p>

<p>In the years just after Union came about, viz. in 1911, only one out of every thousand of our White population was a student. In those years the comparable figure of the United States of America, which is generally considered to be the leading Western power, was one student out of every 250 of the population. By 1961 there was one out of every 83 students in South Africa as against one out of every 50 in the United States of America. This enormous increase of students, of studying youths, is closely related to the progress made by our country in the economical, political and many other spheres and here we get a very clear picture of the advantage of making full use of our youthful intellectual material. Because of the constant attacks being made upon us we must promote every opportunity to make the best use of our intellectual material. South Africa is second to-day in the Western world with regard to the number of students in ratio to its total population. To-day there are 20.1 students per thousand of the population in the United States of America. Next comes the White population of South Africa and South West Africa with 12.1 per thousand. Canada is next with seven students per thousand; New Zealand with 6.6; Australia with five and the United Kingdom with 2.2 per thousand. That we have advanced so far is something to be proud about, but I do not think that this can be a reason for saying that there is no need for new university facilities in South Africa <span class="col_423-424" refersTo="page_0226"/>especially in view of the fact that it is accepted in the West that a residential university is most effective if it has not more than 5,000 to 6,000 students enrolled, and quite a number of universities in South Africa have passed this mark.</p>

<p>When we consider the environs of Port Elizabeth specifically we find that we are dealing with the fifth biggest city in our country, a city which is the centre of a very busy hinterland, a large area of the Cape where, true enough, they have Rhodes University at Grahamstown, but where still a large number of the students must go elsewhere to get their university training. Because this entails having to go elsewhere full use is not being made of the opportunity to obtain university education. I have said that it should be a joyful day when a new university is founded especially when it is established in this large city where up to now there has been no university; therefore everyone will rejoice in the friendly spirit in which this Bill is discussed in this House, and in the general welcoming of this Bill and the best wishes for this university expressed from both sides of the House, in spite of what had happened previously in connection with the establishing of the University of Port Elizabeth. The sooner we forget that bit of history the better. Yet I do think it will be fitting to tell my colleagues on the other side that they should be careful not to take part in a political agitation so easily and so quickly because they think that it might gain a few votes for them temporarily. They should be careful particularly in a matter like this where it concerns the future of our country and the welfare of our youth.</p>

<p>Look who is talking now!</p>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who made that interjection knows what is written in the papers that support him. He knows what the comment of some of his colleagues was. The sarcastic suggestion was even made during the past week in a newspaper on the Witwatersrand that the aim with this university is to gain a few extra seats for the Nationalist Party in Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to leave this matter there and express the hope that we will no longer have this sort of thing in this country, and that the members opposite will refrain from taking part in such agitations for the sake of temporary gain. We need not debate the matter of the head of a university in the environs of Port Elizabeth any more and that is why I also see the request for a Select Committee which came from the other side of the House as an attempt to delay this measure which actually wants to expedite the drawing up of the statute of this new university so that the machinery can be set in motion. I can only regard the request for a Select Committee as delaying tactics, perhaps delaying tactics to give satisfaction to those elements outside who opposed the idea of a new university, to try and play an ambiguous game. Mr. Speaker, what will we gain by a Select Committee? We will only create an opportunity for a repetition of the unpleasantness which arose in this regard and which we would like to forget as soon as possible. While I welcome the spirit of this discussion I cannot but express my regret that here and there the members on that side showed signs of sowing suspicion as to the intention of the Government in establishing this university; there were signs of creating suspicion and the fear was expressed whether bilingualism would be practised there to the full; suspicion was created about the appointments in the senate, and about the appointment of a rector of that university. I really do not think that it is fitting in a case like this. If one compares the history of the growth of university facilities in South Africa with that in Great Britain one sees a considerable amount of similarity. In Britain there were initially the two large universities, the two well-known ones which are still there to-day, namely, Oxford and Cambridge, and much later, after Britain had developed, also as an industrial country, and when scientists had to be trained for it, one finds the establishment of local universities in the larger urban areas, or as they call them, the &#x201C;Civic Universities&#x201D;. Here in South Africa we also had in the beginning the Universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch and later others followed in the larger centres of the country and now we have reached the stage where they are also spreading to other large urban areas. But what is also interesting about the history of universities in South Africa is that shortly after Union, when serious thought was given to this matter, there were also opinions that the various universities should be grouped together in certain areas, as there were also opinions that a new university should rather not be established at Port Elizabeth, but that Rhodes University, with its extramural department, should continue to serve the population of Port Elizabeth. At that time a commission of inquiry was appointed and the finding of this commission was that two large universities should be established apart from the University of South Africa, one for the North and one for the South, and the southern one should take Cape Town, Stellenbosch and Rhodes under its wings&#x2014;a kind of federal university&#x2014;and the same in the north. Fortunately that plan was not accepted because it was met with strong opposition. Interesting on this occasion to-day is the opinion put before the commission by the well-known Professor Freemantle. In his memorandum he said among other things:</p>

<block name="quote">It has now been definitely proved that the local universities arouse real local interest in higher education, enlisting in its own behalf the powerful agency of local pride; that they create and foster intellectual life and ambition in the provinces: that they stimulate secondary education through the wide growth of their interests; that they arouse, satisfy and arouse afresh the higher ambitions <span class="col_425-426" refersTo="page_0227"/>of classes of the community which without them would remain dormant on their own. I submit with confidence that it should definitely adopt the policy of developing the existing colleges into separate universities.</block>

<p>Where he gave this opinion about the advantages of all areas having their own universities he referred to the experience gained in Great Britain. As I see it, what Prof. Freemantle said here not only relates to the necessity of having universities in their own environs but it also relates to the other matter debated here namely, whether such a university which is going to be established in an industrial city like Port Elizabeth is aimed primarily at supplying technologists, to train people for the industries. There I want to agree with Prof. Freemantle in what he says in this memorandum that the function of such a university is a local one, and that it awakens interest, through channels at its disposal, in that local area for study in directions other than those which are required locally, because it will bring the local inhabitants and the local youth in contact with the advantages and opportunities of university education.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill covers but an intermediate phase, because otherwise in the case of the coming into being of our present universities, which developed out of university colleges, this university will have to be built up out of the ground. Hon. members opposite who have doubts should see the Bill in the light that this is but an interim Bill, and then many of their doubts will vanish. The council of this university, which is coming into being will draw up its own Statute and as it grows and develops amending legislation will again be introduced here to change the composition of its council and senate. In other words, the fears that hon. members opposite have, will vanish because we are dealing with an interim measure. Because this university will be the first of its kind in the sense that it is a declared bilingual university it is perhaps necessary for us to pause to deal with this aspect. Hon. members opposite expressed their doubts as to whether bilingualism will really be applied. Yesterday it was argued here whether it should be a parallel or a dual medium university. I want to agree with what the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) said that it would be, as was stated, a bilingual university. When we talk about a bilingual university in a bilingual country, I do not think anybody can have any doubts or fears that both language groups will receive just attention. The hon. member for Johannesburg North (Mrs. Weiss) to-day voiced her doubts about the constitution of the senate and that the hon. the Minister in terms of Clause 10 may probably pack the senate, I take it with Afrikaans-speaking members, pack it with professors of the university of Stellenbosch. However, Mr. Speaker, this brings me to the point that every professor of the University of Stellenbosch, and as far as that is concerned, of every Afrikaans university, is a bilingual lecturer. I do not know whether this can be said about the lecturers at the English universities But I wish to make this point: There need be no fear for unilingualism in the constitution of the senate because everyone who will be appointed from the ranks of the University of Stellenbosch in this senate will be a bilingual person. The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) yesterday paid his <i>alma mater</i> this unfriendly compliment when he asked, referring to Clause 10, what had now happened to the university autonomy of the University of Stellenbosch because the hon. the Minister can now appoint professors from the senate of this university to the senate of this new university-to-be and that the senate and the council of the University of Stellenbosch is not given the opportunity to nominate persons.</p>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>That is so, Sir, but the hon. member overlooked a very important point and this I want to put to him now. In the first place Clause 10 determines that the hon. the Minister shall appoint subject to the provisions of sub-section (2) in respect of each faculty of the university persons who must be professors in a corresponding faculty of the Rhodes University or the University of Stellenbosch. In other words, in constituting the senate of the new university there is a choice, either from a corresponding faculty of Rhodes or a corresponding faculty of Stellenbosch. If there is such a choice, how on earth can one say either to the senate of Stellenbosch or to that of Rhodes: Now you indicate the person.</p>

<p>You misunderstand everything.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, this point is as clear as daylight. The fact remains that the appointment in the interim rests with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Let me mention another analogy case. Often teaching persons from the ranks of the professors of universities are appointed to commissions, boards etc. Recently professors from various of our universities were appointed to the Scientific Advisory Council. Were the university senates concerned asked: Whom do you recommend? Because the hon. the Minister in every case, in this case as well as in the other cases, has the responsibility to appoint someone he has the opportunity and that is why the opportunity is not there for the senate of the university concerned to propose someone. Therefore it is no transgression or infringement of the autonomy of that particular university.</p>

<p>You cannot get away with that.</p>

<p>The hon. member will have to agree that where the hon. the Minister has this <span class="col_427-428" refersTo="page_0228"/>task and where he has a choice between the two universities&#x2014;Stellenbosch and Rhodes&#x2014;the matter rests with him. The hon. member will further have to agree that the hon. the Minister will not appoint Professor A or Professor B on his own. He will go to the university authorities concerned and consult.</p>

<p>What does the Bill say?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>But it is obvious, Sir, that the hon. the Minister will do so. It is also being done in practice to-day. I referred a short while ago to the appointment of the Scientific Advisory Council and there the universities concerned were also consulted.</p>

<p>Let us not argue further about this. I think the hon. member mentioned that point simply as delaying tactics and to raise objections to this Bill.</p>

<p>This brings me to the point of real bilingualism at this university. The hon. member for Hillbrow said that the Opposition accepts this aspect wholeheartedly because it is United Party policy. I think the hon. member and other hon. members opposite who spoke on this matter are completely in the dark as far as bilingualism at a high school and at a university is concerned. They are two completely different matters. Even though I should be criticized for it, I want to make this statement here to-day that it is not the function of a high school in the first case to make a pupil conscious of bilingualism. It is the function of a high school to impart to that child the necessary amount of knowledge, but after that child has left school and goes to a university, or goes further in life, then he must, with the knowledge of the second official language or any other language that he was taught at school make himself proficient, as far as the two official languages of the country are concerned, to be bilingual. The man who studies further will not only need the other official language, but he will also need other languages. The hon. member sitting next to me (Dr. Steyn) studied in Germany. Had he not learned this language at school and at the university here it would not have been possible for him to go and study there. I want to make this point here about all this argument about real bilingualism that the so-called Afrikaans universities are the true bilingual universities in this country to-day. I am not at all surprised that the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) said a moment ago that if he had to go to a university to-day he would go to an Afrikaans university. It does not surprise me at all because in fact the Afrikaans universities of this country are the bilingual universities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>That is your interpretation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>I will explain this point. I say this because the text books also at all these universities are in most cases predominantly English. Therefore the student has to make use, at least for study at home, of English text books and so from day to day he makes himself more proficient in that language. Yesterday reference was made to the University of Pretoria and that of the Free State. It was said that they also started as bilingual universities but later developed into so-called Afrikaans universities. But in practice they are still bilingual universities. Take the University of Stellenbosch of which the hon. member for Hillbrow is an old student. Even in these days when it is known as an Afrikaans university, nearly one-fifth of its students come from English speaking homes. The hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) only this morning went to the University office through my mediation and enrolled his son there to read law next year. The son of the hon. member for Constantia came as a student to Stellenbosch in my time. He could not speak Afrikaans because his father served in Britain as High Commissioner in his earlier years. What is the position of such a student who cannot speak Afrikaans? The bilingual Afrikaans lecturer repeats everything to such a student in the language that he can understand. The hon. member for Constantia can confirm that. It happened to his son. In the first years when he had not yet mastered Afrikaans, the lecturers taught him in his own language. I remember my own student years when I had a senior lecturer for a few years who could not speak a word of Afrikaans. He taught his subject in the English language but the university appointed him as lecturer because he was a first-rate and capable professional man. That is still the position at the University of Stellenbosch to-day. There are hundreds of English speaking students and they go there for the same reason as that given by the hon. member for Rosettenville to-day. And care is taken at those Afrikaans universities that the students, are taught in the language that they know best. I want to mention another point that yearly at the graduation ceremonies various doctors&#x2019; degrees are awarded where the thesis had been written by Afrikaans-speaking students in English at those Afrikaans universities. They do if for practical reasons; perhaps because most of their reference work was in English and because the technical terms of that particular subject was English in most cases. It has already happened that the thesis was handed in in another language, like German for example. That is why I say, Mr. Speaker, there is not the least bit of doubt in my mind that the Afrikaans universities in South Africa to-day are really the practical bilingual universities. On that practical pattern this university at Port Elizabeth is now being established. It is being described by means of legislation as operating like these Afrikaans universities already do to a great extent. That is why I say that there need be no fear in this House about the extent or the pattern of bilingualism which there will be at the University of Port Elizabeth. It is not necessary to utter any fears in regard to that matter because that scaremongering can only lead to the English-speaking students in that area becoming estranged and that is something we are not anxious to have.</p>

<p><span class="col_429-430" refersTo="page_0229"/>Mr. Speaker, the University of Stellenbosch which is going to act as guardian in connection with the establishment of the University of Port Elizabeth has already given its full support to this institution in various ways; also in connection with the fund-raising it co-operated whole-heartedly. And the University of Stellenbosch will continue, in the shape of representation on the council of that university, in the form of representation on the senate and in the form of supplying external examiners, to give its whole-hearted support to this new university. That is why we want to express the hope that the new University of Port Elizabeth will help to utilize the intellectual talents of our young people further and better for the growth and safeguarding of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch, who has just sat down, gave us a long dissertation on what was to-day happening in that university town which he represents here. I want to tell the hon. member that he is correct of course when he says that that university plays an important role in stimulating bilingualism. But other universities are also doing that to-day, not only our Afrikaans universities but English language universities as well. As I was informed last year, for example, practically 50 per cent of the students at the Cape Town University are Afrikaans-speaking&#x2014;they come from Afrikaans-speaking homes. So if that is the trend in South Africa then Stellenbosch is not the exception to the rule. I know Stellenbosch is playing an important role in that respect but it is also correct to say that the English language universities are following in precisely the same direction. That is the position in the case of Rhodes, for instance, where there are numbers of Afrikaans-speaking students. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) is himself an example of an Afrikaans-speaking person who finished his studies at Rhodes University. What I cannot understand is that the hon. member for Stellenbosch and other members opposite can accuse us of employing delaying tactics when we ask that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee. I cannot understand how that can be described as delaying tactics when we are dealing with a Bill, the principle of which has been under discussion in the Eastern Province for the past ten years or more, as far as I know. How can we be accused of employing delaying tactics when we ask for a Select Committee, a Select Committee which at the most will take three or four weeks before they will submit the legislation in its final form to this House. Surely we all know that it is the idea that the University of Port Elizabeth should start with its classes next year and where will it start with those classes? In the old buildings which the Rhodes staff are to-day using in Port Elizabeth. Why shall we be delaying it by merely postponing it for three weeks? The Board of Trustees have already been appointed; they can continue with their work. Let me give the hon. the Minister one reason&#x2014;many have been given already&#x2014;why the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. We must remember that Port Elizabeth has a new City Council to-day. I do not want to argue about that; I am simply mentioning it. It is not the City Council which originally gave form to the idea of an own independent university. I noticed only this week in the Press that this legislation will only be discussed today by a sub-committee of that City Council. They are perhaps discussing it at this very moment; at the very stage when we are discussing it. Then hon. members maintain that insufficient reasons have been advanced why the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee!</p>

<p>For this reason that they were only placed in possession of the details of this Bill a few days ago. If it is true that they are only discussing it to-day is it not perhaps necessary for us to hear the views of those people? Hon. members say we want to delay it. Why should we delay it? They admit that we all agree with them as far as the principle of the Bill is concerned, but there is the question of the power of the Minister, the question of the constitution of the senate, the constitution of the council, etc., questions which, as hon. members have already stated, can be resolved out by a Select Committee. The hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) and the hon. member for Stellenbosch say that all we want to do in this Select Committee is to rake up old stories. Mr. Speaker, no chairman of a Select Committee will allow that. I ask the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker), who is an old parliamentarian, whether he can swallow such nonsense that we are adopting delaying tactics in order to rake up old stories? We are not asking for a Select Committee so as to rake up old stories but to improve this legislation still further. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort knows there is room for improvement in this legislation. The fact that the hon. the Minister himself has introduced amendments is an admission that there is room for improvement.</p>

<p>The hon. member is trying to distract my attention by saying that I was opposed to it in principle. The hon. member will learn during the course of my speech whether I am against the principle.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for years influential persons and institutions in the Eastern Province have been making representations for Port Elizabeth to have its own institution. The question which always had to be answered was whether it was necessary and whether the development in the Eastern Province warranted it. These are the only two questions which must always be answered. However, when the Rhodes legislation was amended in 1960 that important principle was decided upon, namely, that we in <span class="col_431-432" refersTo="page_0230"/>Port Elizabeth admitted that Port Elizabeth had to have its own institution and that the development in Port Elizabeth justified it. We all know that Rhodes University, which was given the right by this Parliament to open a branch in Port Elizabeth, has done a great deal to meet the needs of Port Elizabeth and its immediate vicinity during the few years it has had at its disposal. Although the university had a considerable amount of money at its disposal, money it received from the City Council, it must nevertheless be added that the activities of Rhodes University in Port Elizabeth must have caused them great inconvenience at Grahamstown. It called for great sacrifices but without the youth who attended the branch in Port Elizabeth suffering in any way academically. It is only a person without any feeling who will not be deeply grateful to Rhodes for the wonderful work it has done in the past few years in Port Elizabeth. Many people in Port Elizabeth will be deeply hurt because Rhodes&#x2019; activities in that city will cease in the course of time. Many will feel hurt unnecessarily because the severity of the pain was closely related to unnecessary politicking and the stirring up of feelings.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort should listen to this. Both Afrikaans- and English-speaking people were guilty of this and I trust that we as a nation will emerge greater and not smaller in our outlook from such a struggle in which feelings had been stirred up.</p>

<p>I just want to deal with a few principals contained in this legislation, namely Clauses 2 and 3 and 14. The necessity for having our own institution in Port Elizabeth and for an additional institution in the Eastern Province is obvious. The Cape Province has three universities, two of which are situated in the Western Province and only one in the Eastern Province. Port Elizabeth is undoubtedly the most suitable place for another university in the Eastern Province. Port Elizabeth offers a legion of advantages and facilities; they are inexhaustible; they are unlimited. Let me just mention a few. Let us think of the motor industry in Port Elizabeth. It will fit in wonderfully well with such a university. The natural science faculty that will be established there and which will form the basis for the engineering profession, will fit in beautifully with that enormously strong motor industry at Port Elizabeth. We know, for example, that General Motors, Ford, Firestone, Samad and all those big industries concerned in the motor trade are going to spend enormous amounts of money here over the next decade or so. Tens of millions of rand will be spent. We know for instance that the wool growing industry regards Port Elizabeth as the most important port. Then we have the leather and shoe industry, not even to mention the heavy industries and the other manufacturing industries. All that will fit in beautifully with such a university bearing in mind the development we already have there and the development which will still take place in future.</p>

<p>Me must also take it that Port Elizabeth will get its fair share of immigrants, something which will make it even more essential for us in future to have an institution for higher education. We also think of the Orange River and Sundays River development which will take place there. That will mean tremendous expansion. The Eastern Province will be in great need of trained manpower and such a university will meet the needs of that development in the Eastern Province. Over and above that Port Elizabeth will be placed in this unique position that it will be able to serve a much greater hinterland. The argument is often advanced that existing universities should rather be extended and expanded instead of establishing new ones. Hon. members of this side of the House as well as on the other side have already pointed out that the number of universities in South Africa, in relation to the population, is not out of proportion in comparison with other parts of the world where they have far more universities per head of the population. But if we say that we must just extend existing universities surely we must apply the same principle in the case of our schools and colleges. And nobody will be so stupid as to suggest that we should apply that principle in respect of our schools and colleges. New schools and colleges are continually established.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it was a unilingual institution. Just as the medical faculty of Stellenbosch in the northern suburbs is, as I understand, an Afrikaans-medium faculty. No country in the world can have too many universities. If we have more universities it will not of necessity mean a lowering of the standards. Nor will that come about overnight. It is only when it starts at the bottom that an institution eventually, with the passage of time, becomes a full-fledged institution. What you have to admit, Sir is this that you can always raise more enthusiasm for that which is your own and consequently the development will be much faster because of the support of the public. That, I believe, will happen in the case of Port Elizabeth. I do not for one moment doubt the ability of <span class="col_433-434" refersTo="page_0231"/>the Eastern Cape in the passage of time to cope with another full-fledged university. The potential is there. As a matter of fact, everybody realizes that a university is not only maintained by its own environment but that it is usually strongly maintained by distant areas. Hon. members opposite want to know when I saw the light. The hon. The Minister himself told us in this debate that the Government had changed its attitude. He said times had changed and for that reason they had changed and were to-day in favour of a bilingual university. If they want to change their attitude to-day, if they want to convince others, it is not necessary for them to try to convince this side of the House. We have for a long time believed in this principle which we stand for. Hon. members opposite, however, while congratulating Port Elizabeth, talk in the same breath about the possibility of a new university on the Witwatersrand, an Afrikaans university. Where we in the Cape Province are prepared to allow it to be a bilingual university why do they not ask their hon. Minister to make that new university on the Witwatersrand a bilingual university as well?</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that we on this side of the House are in favour of every university being autonomous. That is his business; nobody will prescribe to them what to do, just as little as I will prescribe to Stellenbosch that it should become a completely dual medium university. It is for them to decide.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this new institution must comply with certain demands. It will be some time before the feelings which have been stirred up will quiten down. The slightest indication, the slightest proof that what was envisaged is not being fulfilled, can do a great deal of harm to the undertaking. The hon. the Minister should rather use the power which he has under the law to assist the project than to lend an ear to cold political demands that may be put to him in future. Both sections must be made to feel equally at home in this new magnificent undertaking. The two language groups should be treated on an equal basis. That should not only be the ideal but it should be carried out in practice. What the project needs above everything else is the confidence of the public. If it gets that the institution will indeed be a great success. Why do I believe that that project will ultimately be a great success because in the year 1964 it is a very drastic departure from the historical procedure followed in the past; once again it is something new. Hon. members are inclined to say that we consist of Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking people but a large section of the nation use both languages in their homes, and for the first time in approximately 50 years&#x2019; time attention is once again given to this ever-growing group of our population which uses both languages in their homes, in other words, a group that will prefer to send their children to such an institution. We have been waiting for a long time for a real bilingual higher educational centre in South Africa. With the passage of time it will be a success because the attention of the whole country will be focused on this institution because of the disputes that preceded its existence as well as the inherent desire of the national groups to work in closer co-operation. We have already been told that both language groups were to an increasing extent attending existing institutions. We are already heading in that direction. That is merely becoming an accomplished fact and other institutions in South Africa may follow that example.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that it can be a success because of the seat of the institution, namely Port Elizabeth. Port Elizabeth with its background of the 1820 Settlers and their traditions, with its background of the 1830 &#x201C;Trekkers&#x201D; and their background of sacrifices made for their country and the mutual respect those two sections had for each other and the strong bonds which still exist between them to-day. In spite of language and cultural differences I believe that will be the main reason why this institution will be a success&#x2014;because it will assist South Africa, in the years to come, to create conditions under which the two national groups will be drawn still closer together.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to hear of someone becoming converted. That still goes back to the days of the Bible, namely that there is greater rejoicing over one lost sheep which is found than over the 99 which the shepherd has in the fold. I must say that in any case it took quite an appreciable time before that hon. member became converted, because I read in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> of Saturday, 23 February, that there was &#x201C;a joint protest&#x201D; of &#x201C;East Cape M.P.s and M.P.C.s&#x201D;. And they mention the names of all the members sitting here now: &#x201C;Mr. T. B. Bowker, Mr. R. P. Plewman, Mr. D. Myburgh Streicher and P. R. Dodds.&#x201D; If one now reads this protest and the grave objection to the establishment of the University of Port Elizabeth, then I say thank you and heartily welcome them in the fold of the converted and those who believe in the welfare and progress of South Africa. I want to assure those hon. members that I am being neither cynical nor sarcastic. I say to them open heartedly: Welcome to the ranks of those who now want to tread a new path in South Africa.</p>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Minister?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whether I have just said anything which justifies a question being put. I think the hon. member should just have a little patience. Perhaps he will have no questions to put when I have finished.</p>

<p>I want to start with the main speaker opposite in this debate, the hon. member for <span class="col_435-436" refersTo="page_0232"/>Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp). I want to thank the hon. member for having described my speech as one which excluded politics and as an introductory speech which dealt with this matter on its merits. He congratulated me on that. But then the hon. member failed to see the trap and stepped into it. He immediately welcomed me into the ranks of those who adopt their policy. Then he dragged me headlong into politics, and immediately started with his dual-medium policy. I just want to tell the hon. member that there is no idea here of a dual-medium policy. The United Party right from the beginning tried to exploit this matter of a dual-medium policy in such a way that it ought to leave a bad taste in their mouths. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) knows that in 1955 a great fuss was made on the part of the English-speaking high school teachers in regard to the dual-medium policy. Principals of schools strongly objected because it was just impossible. If hon. members opposite still talk about a dual-medium policy, they are still living in the decade where one put one spoonful of English and one spoonful of Afrikaans in a cup, stirred it well and swallowed it. Sir, the days of that kind of measurement and the days of that kind of determination of rights is past. This is a bilingual country, with Afrikaans and English as the media of instruction. Let us now understand that once and for all, and if that is so, no citizen of South Africa today, if he cannot understand both languages and at least read them&#x2014;I am not referring to the fact that a man prefers one language to the other as his home language&#x2014;should make a university the subject of this type of squabbling. It is deplorable. I call it a squabble. It was nicely worded, in nice civilized language, and it was stated cautiously, but do not let us bluff each other here. This proposed amendment makes it quite clear to me that we are still very immature, particularly hon. members opposite, and in addition we are ignorant &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member did speak intelligently when he congratulated me on not having dragged in politics and said that I had made a good speech. I think the praise expressed by the hon. member was deserved.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I gave notice that I would move an amendment to the effect that the language media at this university would be English and Afrikaans and that the circumstances in which education would or could be given by means of one or the other language would be determined by the Senate. The Senate of the university is the body which has to do the work, and this Parliament cannot determine it. The statute will be drafted in such a way that the Senate will have the say, and they are the teachers who will have to teach those students, and particularly in the beginning the Senate will consist of the professors or lecturers of the university itself, of the University of Stellenbosch and of Rhodes University. I really do not think hon. members have taken the trouble to study it, but in the 1955 Act all domestic matters are entrusted to the Senate. The Senate concerns itself with domestic affairs in regard to education; it decides on the curricula and the content of the courses and the standard and scope of the knowledge required to pass in a subject (the examination). The Senate also decides on the medium of instruction. But because in the case of the other eight residential universities no problem exists because they are either English-speaking or Afrikaans-speaking, nothing is laid down in the regulation in regard to the media used. The hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit) gave us a sound exposition of the procedure in an Afrikaans-medium university. I can support him on the basis of my knowledge of other universities, and I can also confirm that there are certain English universities where lectures are also sometimes given in Afrikaans. But here we now come and say that it is a definite requirement that the two languages should be used. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) wants to make it even more rigid. She will not find two stones which are alike. And it is unnecessary. It is such a pity that there is so much suspicion in regard to this matter. But you know. Sir, we did not have the difficulty with the academic and scientific people with whom we discussed this legislation. They are not party politicians. They are people who know how it works in practice. But here we now want to be suspicious and say: You must be careful. Let me put it frankly: &#x201C;You English-speaking people must be careful. This group of Afrikaners is going to deceive you, and we will not allow it.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, those days are past, and I hope it will not be measured by the yardstick whereby if a man&#x2019;s surname sounds Afrikaans he will be stigmatized as an Afrikaans-speaking person, and if his surname sounds English he will be stigmatized as an English-speaking person. Even those days are past. It is just the other way round in regard to many of the names I have mentioned, in so far as the language is concerned.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the most important criticism of the Bill. All of us were unanimous about the principle. But now they want a Select Committee. That really came as a shock to me, and Mr. Speaker on two occasions pointed out to hon. members opposite that they were really evading his ruling. Mr. Speaker ruled as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proposed university differs from other White South African universities in that it is the first university to be established <i>ab initio</i>, the other universities having their origins in colleges or similar institutions.</block>

<p>And this is the important point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore. I have been informed that the Government regards the measure as one <span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0233"/>of public policy in that the initiative for the establishment of the university has come primarily from the Government itself.</block>

<p>Then Mr. Speaker says in conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under the circumstances I have decided that this measure may be introduced as a public measure.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the fact that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) wanted to force me to give a reply as to whether I would send this measure to a Select Committee before the second reading was in my opinion an attempt to evade the decision of Mr. Speaker. I shall explain why I say so. It is such an attempt because, when a Government measure is accepted as such, it is for the Government to say that it would like to have more information and more clarity on certain points, and it is for the Government to say that before the principle is accepted in the second reading the Bill will be referred to a Select Committee. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) has given us a long lecture on parliamentary practice. My standpoint is that if I were to agree to it, the hon. member knows that the principle of the establishment of this University will be in issue. And that is what those hon. members wanted, but as the result of Mr. Speaker&#x2019;s decision they did not have the opportunity again to discuss whether a university should be established or not. They had to accept the principle of the establishment of the university, and then all this hullabaloo started here: Now we must at least get something out of it, and if the Minister does not grant it before the second reading but we can still get it after the second reading, we can still attain our object. Mr. Speaker, my question is what do those hon. members envisage by having a Select Committee? Do they want to re-hash all the information already given to them, and which ought to be common knowledge by now? Whom do they want to protect by means of a Select Committee? Whom do they think has suffered an injustice? What more do they want to know in connection with this whole matter? Do they think anything has taken place behind closed doors which they are hoping to ferret out? These are the questions which arise in one&#x2019;s mind: Who is concerned in this matter? In the first place, it is Rhodes University. And now? And if they are now told what the position is, not by me but by Rhodes itself, what will they say then? We have arrived at a good understanding. I am not referring to the prehistory. We have come to an amicable settlement. Everybody in that university has come to realize that if this is Government policy, then we do it that way. And they did not do it under pressure. On 19 September I met the Rector of Rhodes with Professor Rennie, and also the Mayor of Port Elizabeth and one of the members of the Finance Committee. After three hours of consultation, the person who drafted this joint Press statement, Professor Hyslop, the Rector of Rhodes, was the one who accepted the following. I read it once again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Joint statement issued by the hon. J. de Klerk, Minister of Education, the Mayor of Port Elizabeth and the Vice-Chancellor of Rhodes University (on 19 September): In view of the fact that the Rhodes University will not receive subsidies on the basis of the Natal University formula, or on the basis of independent residential universities, it is not possible for Rhodes University to continue to operate in Port Elizabeth with the desired degree of efficiency to the satisfaction of the University itself and of the citizens of Port Elizabeth. For this overriding reason proposals have been discussed and will be put forward to the Government, the City Council at Port Elizabeth and the Rhodes University Council, and after these bodies have given due consideration to these proposals, a detailed statement will be issued.</block>

<p>I read this to show that in all this confusion, in which the party politicians, and particularly the representatives of Port Elizabeth, took such keen delight in participating, this is the standpoint adopted by the people immediately concerned with the matter. The party politicians wanted to fish in troubled waters, because they hoped that they might be able to catch something there. Perhaps I should except the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Mr. Dodds). He made a good speech yesterday, the best one of the four, and it rather seems to me that they forced him into doing something which he did not want to do. I still like him more than any of the others. Because after they had stirred up muddy water in Port Elizabeth, hoping here and there to catch a Nationalist fish, we had these consultations and the waters became clear.</p>

<p>Thereafter I had the privilege, at the request of the other two gentlemen, not only to make this announcement at a reception given us by the Mayor of Port Elizabeth, but also to say a few words, and with the exception of Mr. Edgar Crews, the whole audience and all the people with whom we then had cocktails, more than 300 of them, came and said: We thank you very much for having come here in order to throw light on these problems and to remedy them.</p>

<p>But now the hon. members opposite want a Select Committee. Let us get Crews and a few others and rake up the whole thing again and dig up the old skeletons so that they can rattle their bones and make a noise, and let us see whether in this way we cannot blow life into the United Party. I challenge any hon. member opposite to name any body or individual in Port Elizabeth who told them to come and ask here for a Select Committee. That does not come from Rhodes University, nor from the City Council of Port Elizabeth. It is not they who said that this Bill could not pass as it is. But here the United Party acts off its own bat, and its only solution is a Select Committee. I think, Mr. Speaker, they were <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0234"/>obstructed by your ruling. They thought that they could win their point on a technicality, but your wise ruling, based on the facts, made it difficult for them to do so. The hon. members found themselves in a difficult position, and on 8 November I was able to release a statement to the Press in which I said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Both the City Council of Port Elizabeth and Rhodes University have granted their full support to the establishment of this new university, and thereby to the promotion of higher education in the Eastern Cape.</block>

<p>I sent this Press statement both to the Rector of Rhodes and to the Mayor of Port Elizabeth before it was published, and the Mayor replied to me as follows on 20 December&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I thank you for your letter of 7 November, enclosing a copy of the Press statement of the new university.</block>

<block name="quote">I have since received a copy of the draft Bill and studied it, and I have assured the organizers of the new university that I personally would welcome the opportunity to serve as a trustee, subject to the confirmation of my council.</block>

<block name="quote">My council was not able to make a financial contribution for the year 1964, but I am confident that when required, it will make a contribution in addition to the very generous grant of ground already earmarked.</block>

<p>Now the United Party come here, late as usual, and after all the problems have been solved in Port Elizabeth and there is peace and quiet and co-operation, they say, &#x201C;Appoint a Select Committee to determine whether Port Elizabeth should have a university.&#x201D; Has one ever heard such nonsense? I have never heard the like. Speaker after speaker got up, and when in a moment I come to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) and what he had to say, namely that even the contents of the Bill may be improved by such a Select Committee, I should like to take the opportunity to point out that even an hon. member like the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), who ought to know better, made alarming statements. But I shall come to that. Mr. Speaker, I allege that Rhodes has been heard and that it has given its reply. I say that a Select Committee can in no way improve the matter, and that it would rather confuse the whole matter and drag it into politics, whereas we have succeeded in keeping it out. But I was also an eye-witness of what happened in Port Elizabeth right from the start, and let me say this. You cannot bring me one person in Port Elizabeth who said: We are doing this to the detriment of Rhodes and to gain advantage for ourselves. Their slogan was: We do not want to harm Rhodes, but we are pro-Port Elizabeth, and we do not see how we can harm it in regard to its number of students, because they themselves said that within ten years&#x2014;and that was said in 1962&#x2014;their number of students would double itself. That is after this investigation took place.</p>

<p>I gave the House an analysis in broad terms of where the students of Rhodes University come from, but perhaps it is just as well for me to show hon. members how the number of students at Rhodes cannot be affected by this university.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>That is not necessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is very important, because hon. members opposite think that we will now harm Rhodes. The homes of the students, where they come from, were as follows in 1962: From the whole of the Cape Province 928, from the Free State 52, from Natal 84, from the Transvaal 297, from South West Africa 16, from the Protectorates 10, from Mozambique 2, from Angola 1, from the Federation 199, from East Africa 6, and from other places 5. In other words, it is not true that the number of students will decrease, and Rhodes enjoyed no advantage by way of subsidy for its Port Elizabeth section, because right from the outset it was determined that it would not be subsidized for its students on the same basis as Natal. It is not subsidized according to the dual system. The result is that the City Council of Port Elizabeth had to undertake to cover their losses by voting R200,000 for it over a ten-year period, and they could not continue in that way. Dr. Hyslop told me: If you had not come along with this suggestion, I would have been compelled to ask you to be allowed to give these classes on a different basis. Because the R200,000 did not go at the rate of R20,000 per annum, as was originally intended. When I was there last year it was only the second year that this had been going on, and then the R200,000 was almost spent already. They simply could not have continued in that way, and the Government and every sensible member of this House would not like to see a repetition of what took place in regard to the University of Natal. One of the hon. members&#x2014;I think it was the hon. member for Fort Beaufort&#x2014;mentioned that Dr. E. G. Malherbe, the Rector of Natal University, felt that this thing was a monstrosity. The mother, which is in Port Elizabeth, has become smaller, whilst the child is in Durban, and there is a continual tug-of-war. It is an impossible position. I have given the House the reasons why the Government at the time agreed to it, and I also said that it was not intended to last forever. Therefore I do not know what the trouble is. Everybody is satisfied and happy, but now the United Party comes along and tells us at this stage that we should appoint a Select Committee. I hope it is clear that this cannot be done after the Second Reading, because it can serve no good purpose, and it will only result in delay, and what will such delay lead to? The decision has already been taken, and Rhodes has arranged all its affairs in such a way that it will withdraw its classes in 1965. The students who remain behind can continue at the new university in exactly the same way, <span class="col_441-442" refersTo="page_0235"/>and everything they have done will be recognized. Rhodes is withdrawing, and we must now start a new university in these few months. That is why the Government was kind enough to grant priority to this legislation, because only when the Act is on the Statute Book can there be a Council, and it is only when there is a Council that appointments can be made, and only then can a start be made, and even so it will be very difficult for a new organization to take over these university classes in February 1965. Everybody concerned will have to work hard, and it is a very difficult task. Even a week&#x2019;s delay would be detrimental to the whole matter, and if it would still serve a good purpose we could do it, but it will not. Hon. members opposite said it would clear the air and remove any suspicion. Please do not use those arguments. We know that is not true. All it will succeed in doing is to rake up the old reproaches which have already been forgotten. When once an old scandal is revived, it becomes even worse than before, and I admitted in my second reading speech that this was an unpleasant conflict. I can only advise the people of Port Elizabeth to act positively. It was unnecessary for all these objections to be raised, and if I were a voter in Port Elizabeth I would surely settle accounts with those hon. members at the next election. I personally have no grievance against them. I am just glad that they have become converted and have realized that they were on the wrong road.</p>

<p>A few other things were said here. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), an ex-inspector of schools, makes a fuss about Clause 12. He says we provide for the appointment of staff, but not for the dismissal of staff. Surely the hon. member knows of the existence of Act 61 of 1956 which applies to all universities, and that the dismissal of staff is provided for in the Act. He is an educationist. Did he say it only to prove that there are so many mistakes in the Bill that it should go to a Select Committee? The hon. member further says that the University of Natal has separate provision for Whites and non-Whites, but that we do not want to make any contribution towards the resulting extra costs. Surely the hon. member knows that is not true.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. the Minister cannot say that. He must withdraw it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Then I withdraw it and I say he ought to know it, because surely it is general knowledge. Three-quarters of the subsidy of 12 professors is paid, and as the number of non-Whites at Natal University became fewer, and in order to enable them to face all their problems, the Government paid them an additional subsidy of R143,000, and in the Cilliers Report there is a recommendation now that this should be increased, but the Government has not yet considered it.</p>

<p>Surely as responsible people we cannot make such loose allegations. Surely we are not just seeking debating points. The hon. member asks in regard to the appointment of the Chancellor, where have we ever seen this provided for in an Act? But the appointment of the Chancellor of the University of S.A. is provided for in that Act. He is appointed for ten years. The hon. member also objected to the fact that he could be dismissed at the request of the Council by the State President, but that is also contained in that Act. However, the hon. member says this is a new principle; it is not provided tor in any Act. In other words, the suspicion has to be aroused outside that here we again have one of those &#x201C;tribal universities&#x201D; which the Government holds in its iron fist. I am in favour of a man raising arguments, but an educationist like that hon. member should not make such wrong statements.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question? Will the hon. the Minister tell us whether he consulted the Advisory Board and the Committee of Principals as provided for in the 1955 Act?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The Advisory University Committee must be consulted by the Minister, but certainly not in regard to the establishment of any new university. I challenge the hon. member to show me the section which says that I am required to do so. The Act very clearly states in which regard the Minister must be advised. But it was not considered necessary to do so, nor was it considered useful, because as far as the Central Committee is concerned, that Committee deals with quite different matters. I have here a speech by Professor Thom, the rector of one of our largest universities, when he spoke at the sitting of the Academy, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the final analysis we find that there is no denying the fact that the world in general, and South Africa in particular is badly in need of universities and more universities to produce the men and women who are to become the leaders in the various fields of the complicated world of to-morrow.</block>

<p>It is not my duty to consult the Committee of Principals of Universities if the Government wants to establish a new university. The Leader of the Opposition asked what we were doing to fill the shortages, and therefore it is not fitting for the hon. member for Kensington now to ask what they said. Nor would it matter to me if they had said something else, because the Government has to determine what the requirements of the country are.</p>

<p>But I want to come to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss). I want to ask her how she manages to read Clause (10) (d) in the way she does? She objects to that clause, particularly to the concluding words, &#x201C;and who shall be professors in a corresponding faculty of Rhodes University or the University of Stellenbosch.&#x201D; She objects to the word <span class="col_443-444" refersTo="page_0236"/>&#x201C;or&#x201D;. I cannot see how anyone can at the same time be a professor at Stellenbosch and at Rhodes and that is why the word &#x201C;or&#x201D; is used. Surely one can be a professor at only one university. It means that one takes professors of Stellenbosch University or professors of Rhodes University. And if the hon. member has such doubts, I should like to know how she would remedy the position.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about the financing of this university. Hon. members should really make a study of these matters. Sections 21 and 25 of the General University Act, No. 61 of 1955, provide for the financing of capital and current expenditure at all universities. Therefore it is not necessary to provide for it in this Bill; it would just be duplication.</p>

<p>Now there remains the question raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher). The people of Port Elizabeth will certainly erect a monument to him if I accede to his request, because he asked for a medical faculty at that university, and they all want that. I myself would have liked it. But there are also other places which want it. The Free Staters would like one in Bloemfontein. The people of Port Elizabeth would jump for joy if they heard that they were to get a medical faculty. In view of the shortages which exist, the hon. member thought that that was the solution. I told the people in Port Elizabeth, through Dr. Nel&#x2014;he is in the building at the moment and in probably listening&#x2014;the following in a letter. They made their request on 23 December, and I replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In reply to your letter of 23 December in regard to the establishment of a medical school at Port Elizabeth, I wish to inform you that at the request of the hon. Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, Prime Minister, the Scientific Advisory Council, on the available data, supplemented by the reactions to further enquiries made at the universities with medical schools, has submitted a preliminary report in regard to the expansion of the training facilities for medical men. In this report the conclusion was arrived at that all the existing medical faculties were not being utilized to the fullest extent, and that some of them can be extended at little trouble and expense, to make provision for larger numbers without derogating from the standard of the training. As far as the long-term policy for the future is concerned, the Council is expected after thorough investigation to submit a full report still during this year. This report will also take into account the results of another investigation with which the Council is entrusted, the object of which is to ascertain what the requirements of the country are in the way of university-trained scientists and technologists as well as properly trained teachers at universities, and how these needs can be met. As you probably know, the need for training larger numbers of medical men and medical auxiliaries arises mainly from the needs of the non-White population groups in the Republic. In view of this a Committee has been appointed thoroughly to investigate this aspect and to make recommendations. The report of this Committee is expected within the near future. When all these data which are essential in order to reach a decision as to the necessity or otherwise of having an additional medical faculty become available, the Cabinet will devote further consideration to the matter.</block>

<p>Now, this is as far as we have got in regard to this matter of a medical faculty, and that is the reply I gave Port Elizabeth, as well as the reply to all the questions put in this regard. I hope that we will very soon receive this report so that we can continue dealing with the matter.</p>

<p>These, I think, are the most important matters mentioned here. There are many points which we can discuss further in the Committee Stage. I hope that just as the Opposition gave us their support here, they will then also give us their co-operation, so that we can place the best possible Act on the statute book in order to make a success of this new University.</p>

<p>Second Order read: Second Reading,&#x2014;Financial Institutions (Investment of Funds) Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*THE <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with this Bill which is before the House it is the intention to lay down certain principles in connection with the investment, safe custody and administration of funds by financial institutions in an attempt to combat as far as possible by way of legislation the evils which are responsible for the collapse of financial institutions and with which we have had to cope in recent times.</p>

<p>According to the experience of my Department, some of the instances where financial institutions have collapsed are attributable to the fact that the persons in control of those institutions did not display a proper sense of integrity, a fact which in many cases resulted in personal benefits for themselves. They did not observe the necessary good faith towards their institutions and they made risky or practically worthless investments in order to benefit themselves in an improper way. The type of person who engages in these practices is usually able effectively to conceal the circumstances in the institution&#x2019;s financial returns and in a certain cases returns where even falsified.</p>

<p>Our problem is how best to cope with malpractices of this kind. The question may be posed whether it is not feasible to incorporate more preventive measures in the various Acts such as the Banking Act, the Insurance Act, the Building Societies Act. etc. My Department is of the opinion that that is impracticable and that it would be undesirable to try to do so. It would involve the State more and more in the ordinary management of institutions. Thus for example, approval would have to be granted for the making of all sorts of investments and the public would tactily accept that the State guarantees the safety of the investment to which it gives its approval. I think hon. members will realize at once that the State cannot take upon itself the responsibility of managing institutions.</p>

<p>Our great problem lies in the integrity of the persons who control these institutions. In our opinion preventive measures will not help much to keep the real sinners on the right path. We feel that the only language that they will understand is to provide for drastic sanctions to deter the type of person who may be inclined to depart from the usual high standards which are maintained by all respectable institutions.</p>

<p>To this end my Department proposes that we lay down by legislation that persons who are responsible for the investment and the custody of the funds of financial institutions, including ordinary trust funds which may be entrusted to them, shall observe the utmost good faith and that they may not benefit themselves in an improper manner as a result of their actions. At first glance these ideas may appear to be vague but my Department is convinced that if we had had this instrument in the past we would have been able, with comparatively little loss of time, to prove the violation of these principles before our courts and to secure convictions. As things stand at present we can only rely on the crime of fraud, which offers a weapon which it is sometimes very difficult to use and which can only be used after protracted police investigations.</p>

<p>I may mention that we find support for the principles which are proposed in this Bill in the recommendations of the so-called Jenkins Committee which recently instituted investigations in the United Kingdom into the working of the Companies Act there. The Committee recommended, amongst other things, that it should be laid down by legislation that all directors of companies will be required to uphold precisely the same principles which are being proposed here.</p>

<p>In addition to the preceding principles and the sanctions the Bill contains a number of provisions which are deemed necessary for the effective implementation of the aims of the Bill.</p>

<p>My Department consulted the relevant financial institutions such as the various commercial banks, the central organizations of long term and short-term insurers, of building societies, of pension funds and of trust companies with regard to this proposed legislation. Some of these bodies made an important contribution in helping to iron out the proposals, and generally speaking the proposals which are now before the House enjoy the support of the institutions referred to. I might mention that the trust companies themselves are of the opinion that the principles of this legislation should be applied not only to financial institutions but also to individuals who administer trust funds.</p>

<p>Although the proposed legislation, in the opinion of my Department, offers the best solution for our problem and although it enjoys the support of financial institutions in general, I am prepared to consider any other proposals in connection with the proposed legislation, and I therefore propose to move that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee after the second reading. It is my intention that the Select Committee, within the broad principles aimed at by the Bill, should have a free hand. It must not regard itself as being bound, and it will be free to consider any other proposals which have the same objects in view.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the unfortunate cases which have occurred where financial institutions have collapsed have deeply perturbed me and my Department. This is a serious problem that we have to face, and I am sure therefore that we can rely on the full co-operation of this House to place the best possible means at our disposal in an attempt to safeguard the fund <span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0238"/>of the public. Here I just want to utter a warning note, a warning which I have uttered before in this House, and that is with regard to the limitations of legislation. We can never ensure through legislation that unsound investments will not be made. We can only try to curb the dishonesty and the recklessness of persons who work with trust monies, and even in this attempt it is not always possible to achieve 100&#x0025; success. The investor himself cannot be entirely relieved of responsibility as to the person or the institution to whom he entrusts his trust moneys or his savings. A certain measure of responsibility must also rest on his shoulders and he must not be under the impression that what we are doing here relieves him of all responsibility.</p>

<p>The Bill, in the first clause, sets out the scope of the institutions which will fall under this measure. The first six financial institutions which are mentioned here are all institutions which are registered and which fall under the jurisdiction of the Registrar of Financial Institutions. Then we have also added in (g) &#x201C;a board of executors or trust company required to take out a licence to carry on business as such under the Licences Act.&#x201D; That is the scope of this measure. The principle which I have just set out here is contained in Clause 2 and it is tantamount to this that any director, official, employee or agent of a financial institution, when dealing with the investment, safe custody, control or administration of the funds of that institution, shall observe the utmost good faith and exercise proper care and diligence; and similarly in the making of any investment or in the safe custody, control, administration or alienation of such trust property, he shall observe the utmost good faith and, subject to the terms of the instrument by which the trust concerned has been created, exercise the usual care and diligence required of a trustee in the performance or discharge of his powers and duties. Then finally in (c) it is provided that he shall not alienate, invest, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber, etc. any such funds or trust property in a manner calculated to gain directly or indirectly any improper advantage for himself or any other person at the expense of such institution, trust or beneficiary.</p>

<p>Then in Clause 3 provision is made for the measures to implement this principle. The first principle which is laid down there is that of registration or identification of the particular trust property so as to distinguish it from the other property of the institution or of the person who has to invest the trust funds. Where registration is not possible there must be a different form of identification, which is set out here. Then hon. members will observe that all existing institutions will be expected, within 12 months, to bring into conformity with the appropriate provisions of sub-section (1) or (2) any investments which do not comply with those provisions. If they have to go to the office of the Registrar to bring about the necessary changes, those changes can be affected without charge. They do not have to pay any transfer duties on the trust property or other property which is in their possession in order to have it registered in this way: They do not have to pay any stamp duty or other charges; it will be done without any charge and they are being granted a period of 12 months to put their house in order. A second way to ensure the implementation of these principles is provided for in the powers of inspection. Hon. members will observe that Clause 4 refers to the Inspection of Financial Institutions Act which we passed here last year. That Act does not apply to boards of executors or trust companies and this clause is merely designed to make the same Act, which is applicable to financial institutions, applicable also to trust companies and boards of executors.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with records and entries in account books admissible in evidence as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the matters, transactions and accounts therein recorded. Clause 6 simply provides that where there has been an alienation of assets in conflict with the provisions which are laid down here, that alienation is null and void unless the person concerned proves that at the time of the acquisition he was not aware of and had no reason to suspect the contravention or non-compliance and that he acquired such funds, assets or trust property, as the case may be, for valuable consideration. The same onus which rests on a person who has received stolen goods is also being placed now on directors, officials, employees or agents of financial institutions. Clause 7 deals with offences and penalties.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since we are dealing here with such an important matter which is of a somewhat technical nature, I hope that we shall do our best, that the Select Committee will do its best, to see whether it is not possible to find a better way to achieve the object which we have in view and which is laid down in the long title of the Bill, namely to make better provision regarding the investment, safe custody and administration by financial institutions of funds and trust property.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has indicated that what he is attempting to do here is to lay down principles which will guide institutions along the right line and prevent abuse such as has taken place in certain instances. This Bill, insofar as it is an attempt to prevent or to curb malpractices in the handling of trust funds, is quite acceptable to this side of the House. What is not quite so clear to me is what the Minister expects to achieve by this Bill. It is quite clear what he would like to achieve but it is not quite clear from the Bill as it stands what his prospects are of achieving his objects. He talks in the first, second and third clauses about calling on the people concerned to display the utmost good faith and to take proper care, to exercise great diligence in carrying out their responsibilities and he says that he has consulted with the leading institutions and that for the greater part they have agreed with him and have accepted this Bill and have even made suggestions <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0239"/>to him in regard to its drafting. I have no doubt that that is so, but of course they are not going to be the people whom the hon. the Minister is after, and I do not think that this Bill is in the least likely to make a bad man good. I think it is possible that it may make a bad man a little more careful and it may be that the sanction in Clause 7, which carries a very heavy penalty of a fine of R10,000 or ten year&#x2019;s hard labour or both, may make the reckless, irresponsible person, whom the Minister really has in mind, more careful. The Minister says that the question had been asked as to whether it would not be necessary to tighten up the existing legislation in pursuit of the object which he has in view, and he said that his Department felt that that was not desirable and possibly not practicable&#x2014;I do not know. Well, that may be so, but the legislation which we have passed in recent years in this House has placed very wide powers in the hands of the Minister and his officials, and if his Department and the Minister feel that the Department is armed with sufficient powers to carry out the law, one does wonder whether perhaps what is required is not stricter administration. There are cases known to all of us of very great delays which are taking place in certain instances in the publication of the accounts of large institutions. Accounts are sometimes a year overdue before they are published, and in one or two instances there have been cases that where they have been published they have been found to be in very bad order. I should have thought that there was a case for suggesting that administratively the officer of the Minister should have the power, where any firm or any concern handling trust funds or people&#x2019;s money, registered under any of the six or seven Acts mentioned here fails to produce its accounts within, say, three or four or five months with a full auditor&#x2019;s certificate, promptly to suspend that firm or concern from doing any further new business until their accounts are published and found to be in order. That is only one suggestion that one can make. If the officers administering the Act do not have the power to do that sort of thing, then it seems to me that we could possibly make out a case for an amendment of the Act to give them necessary power to do it, because there is no doubt that there have been instances and there may still be instances where people are defrauding the public in a reckless and immoral way. The trouble is, of course, that very often this does not come to light until after the losses have been incurred and the ordinary small investors, the people who have put their money into that particular concern, whether it is an insurance company or some other institution, have lost all their possessions. The Minister&#x2019;s problem&#x2014;and I am sure he will agree&#x2014;is to devise machinery which will enable him to keep an eye on any concern which he has any reason to suppose is not functioning in the proper manner and to have powers quite ruthlessly to suspend them from operating the moment he has reason to believe that there is anything irregular going on, until such time as things have been put right.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that he realized that this Bill did not attempt to cover the whole field. He said that it had been suggested that a Bill of this nature should be extended in its scope, from the field of institutions and companies, to try to cover the case of individuals who mishandle moneys which are entrusted to them. He said that he was prepared to send his Bill to a Select Committee and that he would be happy to receive constructive proposals which would strengthen this Bill, to make it more effective and assist him in achieving the objects which he said he had in view. That being so, I do not think there is any need for a prolonged debate at this stage, beyond saying that in principle we support this Bill and on the Select Committee we shall be very happy to co-operate with the Minister and his representatives in an endeavour to strengthen it as far as we can.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased to hear from the hon. member who has just sat down that the Opposition are not going to oppose this measure. I think that the hon. member is rather enthusiastic about the idea behind this measure although he does not want to show it. The hon. member said that we were trying to illustrate some sort of moral, if I might describe what he said in my own words, by the provisions in Clauses 2 and 3, because the people who were cunning were going to continue to be cunning and that the provision was merely some sort of ethical appeal to them. But I want to direct the attention of the hon. member to one important point that the hon. the Minister raised in his speech when he said that any person who did these various things mentioned in clause 2, things which should not be done, would get away with it to-day unless one could prove conclusively that such person had committed fraud. I know of cases that have been going on in Pretoria over the past months, and also in other parts of the country, cases dealing not only with institutions of this nature but also with individuals handling public money, cases in which the accused persons have admitted to all these things except that they have said that they have not committed fraud. For example, a person may invest somebody else&#x2019;s money for his own benefit; those people then lose their money and that person says that it was not his intention to commit fraud; that he had hoped to make a success of the investment and that these people would then have got their money back. I think that Clause 2 (c) is fairly explicit on this point at least that a person may in the future also be found guilty of crimes, excluding fraud, and be liable to tremendously heavy penalties, in terms of this Bill, when he does this sort of thing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) raised the point that action should be taken sooner. Well, the Department must try to do so if they can. But an important point that he raised was the long period that elapsed before reports were received from the various companies <span class="col_451-452" refersTo="page_0240"/>and undertakings dealing with these matters, and I am in full agreement with him in this regard. The public is at a tremendous disadvantage in that such a long period of time elapses before an audited statement of the affairs of any public undertaking becomes available. I want to ask the hon. member whether he does not think that this matter should be submitted to the commission that is at present reviewing the Companies Act, because I believe that that commission will also have the right to make recommendations in regard to matters affecting not only companies as such but also undertakings that are not companies but which are run on company lines. I feel that that commission under Mr. Acting Justice Jan de Vries and appointed by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs should have been appointed a few years ago to review the Companies Act so that through the medium of that Act we would have been able to control these various companies more effectively in order by so doing to prevent their letting things slide until in many cases it was too late.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with a number of kinds of undertakings that are controlled by the Registrar of Financial Institutions. There are six kinds. The hon. member asked whether we should not review each one of these laws separately. I feel that they should all be governed by the same provisions. Let us rather lay down one central pattern in order to control this sort of thing and to enable us to curtail the activities of those people who handle money belonging to other people and who are guilty of criminal practices. The Boards of Executors which are now being included under this Bill do not fall under the Registrar of Financial Institutions. I do not think that it is necessary for us to review each of these laws with a view to the offences that we are trying to combat. I think that they can eventually be reviewed in one law as is being provided for here. I do not want to suggest that this method is the only method. There may be better methods. The Select Committee can go into this matter. For example, I have already heard of other methods but I do not think that those methods are quite practicable. I do not think that I should discuss this question. Mr. Speaker, one thing is very certain and that is: We have many cases in this country where people who are not scrupulously honest are, in a variety of clever ways, placed in control of trust funds in many cases, the trust moneys of poor people who know no better and so lose their money. We must do everything in our power to prevent that sort of thing. We are dealing here more specifically with the group of undertakings that fall under the Registrar of Financial Institutions and with Boards of Executors which do not fall under the Registrar. I want to make one suggestion to the Select Committee and that is that we must extend the scope of this definition. As the hon. the Minister said, the Trust Bank asked that these provisions should also be made applicable to individuals and other companies handling trust moneys. I am inclined to agree with them. We are dealing here with cases where the same persons may perhaps control a group of different undertakings each of which lives off the other. They all work with other people&#x2019;s money and in the long run they become very wealthy although the people themselves lose their money. They are like an octopus which has different undertakings clasped in each tentacle and which controls the whole group by means of those tentacles. A tremendous amount of exploitation takes place in this way. Mr. Speaker, we must look beyond this type of investment. We must also give our attention to people handling trust money for short terms and here I want to mention specifically the fact that the estate agents, for example, have for some years now been asking for a law to be passed compelling them to keep trust accounts. They want to have a private bill passed by Parliament. A bill of this nature was introduced but it was not passed. They want a law of this nature giving them a certain professional status. But such a law will never be passed by this House. There are firms of auditors to-day that act virtually as deposit-receiving institutions; there are firms of attorneys and various other bodies which also do this sort of thing. If we can extend the scope of the definition in Clause 1 in order to include all these various undertakings, provided that the hon. the Minister will proclaim them as such, then I feel that we will achieve a great purpose&#x2014;far beyond the provisions of this Bill&#x2014;and we will then be protecting the public where they need protection most. I can tell this House that there is a strong desire on the part of persons who are more scrupulous than others handling trust moneys to be protected against the person in the same type of profession who misuses his position, who takes deposits from people who may perhaps want to buy a house and never pays that deposit to the seller. I feel that with a view to protecting trust moneys we can cover a far wider field than that covered by this Bill. I hope that the Select Committee will give careful attention to this matter. I hope too that the Institute of Estate Agents and Auctioneers will make use of this opportunity to give evidence before the Select Committee. If they do not do so they must not say that Parliament does not want to give them the opportunity to protect themselves.</p>

<p>I feel that while we have a Clause 1 (g) in this measure we may just as well have an (h)&#x2014; something to the effect that the Minister may by way of proclamation make the provisions of this measure applicable to any undertaking or class of undertaking and that such an undertaking or class of undertaking shall then be regarded as being a financial institution for the purposes of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>We are thankful to the hon. the Minister that he has come forward with this Bill. It is a measure which perhaps should have been on our Statute Book long ago. The hon. the Minister himself was very worried about this hiatus at the time when he appointed the inspectorate. We understand&#x2014;and we are glad that that is so&#x2014;that the <span class="col_453-454" refersTo="page_0241"/>Opposition not only support this Bill but welcome the fact that it is going to a Select Committee. We know that the hon. the Minister realizes that this Bill does perhaps not go as far as he would like it to go. I have in mind, for example, what happened on the 26th May last year when <i>Dagbreek</i> pointed out that over a period of 18 months South African investors had lost over R10 million because of the actions of financial institutions of this kind. Warnings were issued on various occasions but in spite of those warnings it was always stated that unfortunately that was how the Act read and circumstances unfortunately were such that before one could pounce upon these financial institutions, which misuse or wrongly invest the trust and investment money of the public it was too late. That was the problem in the past. The hon. the Minister as well as the Registrar has this difficult task in the first place of protecting the investor to see, when an organization of this nature is tottering, when it is on the down grade, whether he can prolong its life in some way or other so that it can possibly rehabilitate itself so that the investor will not suffer. That is the difficult task which the hon. the Minister and the Registrar had. That happened in the case of the Boere Bank. When they tried to save the investor by giving the Boere Bank perhaps a longer period of grace than we think was necessary, the manager and others concerned used it as an opportunity to escape and the damage was done in any case.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to point out that it is especially the less privileged persons who are affected, those people who invest their savings and pensions. Unfortunately it is human to invest where one gets the highest rate of interest; it is human to take out a policy where one pays the lowest premium. It is a human factor without the person realizing that by doing that he is taking the greatest risk. I am afraid that we have still not made sufficient provision in this Bill. That is why I am pleased that it is going to a Select Committee so that that aspect can be gone into. Look for instance at Clause 2, the clause that should really apply the protective measure, especially Clause 2 (b). When you look at that clause, sir, you will see that the norm is a very arbitrary one because there it is stated &#x201C;&#x2026; observe the utmost good faith and exercise proper care and diligence &#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;&#x2026; the utmost good faith&#x201D; is so arbitrary that you can only clamp down on a person after the harm has been done. Then you still have to prove that it was not done with the utmost good faith, that it was done with the intention of committing fraud and that it was done knowing it to be in bad faith. That is why I am afraid it will not give us enough power. I hope the hon. the Minister will instruct this Select Committee to attend especially to the following aspects namely the exercise of better control with regards to reinsurance and with regard to the re-insurers. In other words that the directors of an insurance company seeking re-insurance shall to a certain extent be responsible for an inquiry into the financial position of the company carrying the re-insurance so that they will also there act as inspectors. Secondly, that control should be exercised over affiliated companies. Let me put it this way: That there should be reciprocal responsibility for the methods of investment.</p>

<p>On 26th of July last year I pointed out an inquiry had revealed that there were seven companies with the same director. I did not mention the names at the time but I shall do so now: The Tradition Transport Company, The Auto Protection Insurance Company, Bagley and Stevens, Lives&#x2019;s Transport, Jack Meyer Transport Company, South African Reinsurance Corporation and The Provident. All of them had the same accountant and the same auditors. In this type of organization it is easy to let the funds do the rounds while the financial position of all seven is doubtful, or rather while all seven are already insolvent. By transferring funds you can bring the investing public under such a false impression that they will never realize what is happening. That is why I want to support the idea of the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) in the first place namely that we should ask that when a financial institution&#x2014;that is not applicable to companies&#x2014;cannot publish its financial statements within three months, it should immediately stop its activities as far as the writing of new business and the collection of new investment capital are concerned, until its financial statements, its profit and loss accounts, etc., have been published and brought properly to the notice of the public. This will immediately have the effect that such a financial institution will do its work. I think there is one financial institution whose financial year ended in December 1962 and to this day its financial statements have not yet been published although it is continuing to operate. We do not know in what state its financial position is. There is another institution whose year ended in June 1963. To this day its financial statements are not yet available, have not yet been published. If it should go insolvent to-day, not only will the policy-holders be affected, not only will the third-party policyholders be affected but all those people who have claims against those policy-holders will be affected. We cannot tolerate such a state of affairs.</p>

<p>I am thinking of another possible measure and it is this: I want to ask if the hon. the Minister and the Select Committee will not consider the question of imposing upon auditors a liability towards the public. I want to explain this, Mr. Speaker. One finds that the auditor issues a certificate together with the balance sheet and the profit and loss account.</p>

<p>What has that to do with this Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I refer to the control of financial institutions, and the documents of financial institutions are audited. <span class="col_455-456" refersTo="page_0242"/>Those audited documents could be made available to the inspectorate. They are the documents which in the first place come before the board of directors, this board of directors which we want to hold responsible. We find that some of these financial institutions, when they receive the audited documents which have been certified, take care to see that they are not published, that their annual meetings are delayed for up to 13 months as in the one case that I mentioned here. I want to ask whether it is not possible within the scope of the Act&#x2014;and I think it is&#x2014;to require an auditor to bring audited documents to the notice of the Registrar of Financial Institutions once he has issued his certificate. The inspectorate will then know that they should institute investigations. At the moment that does not happen. That auditor is only responsible to the board of directors of that financial institution. He has no public liability. Would this not close the loophole immediately. Once this is done it will be possible to use the auditors of the country to expose these financial institutions which are wasting the money invested by the public. That is why I make this request.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further example in this connection. The hon. the Minister lays down in this Bill that financial institutions must see to it that investments made by them are not to their own advantage and that such investments are made in good faith. I should like to mention a few examples. I went to look up <i>Gunn&#x2019;s Gazette</i> of the 7th January. There I found that a certain company, on securities worth R4,400 raised a first mortgage loan of R34,000. That is something which is not brought to the notice of the auditors. If it is certified and the auditor has public liability then it comes immediately to the attention of the Registrar. There is another company which against a security of R3,460 granted a first mortgage of R36,000. That is the investors&#x2019; money.</p>

<p>I conclude, Mr. Speaker, by saying once again: We welcome this legislation and we ask that this aspect too, be considered by the Select Committee.</p>

<p>It it very difficult to say. But I can say this that here is an entirely new approach to the problem. It is not a question of demanding further statements and papers which we all know are not always as reliable as they purport to be. This is an approach to the person who is responsible, to the person who is in control. We make it easier to get hold of him without ruining the organization. Many of the steps which were taken in the past resulted in the loss of money, money invested in the concern by way of insurance premiums or of deposits in that particular institution. Had we been able to lay our hands on the person responsible, then the institution could have carried on. That is the new approach we have here, and not the clumsy approach of laying a charge of fraud, something which is very difficult to prove; it is a lengthy procedure. We are looking for something that will show results in a much shorter period.</p>

<p>The other thing that we hope to achieve with this Bill is that it will act as a deterrent. The mere fact that there is this greater demand on the persons in charge of these institutions, a greater demand for extreme good faith, should serve as a deterrent. The hon. member has suggested that we could perhaps give more power to the Registrar to say, if he has called for returns and they are not handed in in time, that such an institution must cease its activities. Power is of course given in the various Acts which are referred to in the Bill for the Registrar to call for returns and to apply sanctions if they are not returned within the time stipulated. It is possible that these various measures may be tightened up, but I do not know whether this is the place for it. If we are to give any further powers of that nature it should be given in the various Acts themselves. I doubt whether it will be possible, to go to the lengths the hon. member has suggested namely to say: &#x201C;If your statements are not in in time you have to cease business altogether&#x201D;. As I say, we are approaching it from another angle and that is to get at the person responsible. We throw the obligation on him to show the utmost good faith when he deals with trust money. I think we must wait and see whether this approach yields any success. I may say that these proposals are really born out of the experience we have garnered over the years in regard to those various institutions. My Department feels certain that had they had this instrument at their disposal in the past few years, they could have stopped many of these institutions from going on the rocks altogether without any loss to those people who had invested their savings in those particular institutions.</p>

<p>*The hon. members for Pretoria-Central (Mr. van den Heever) and Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) asked that we should extend the principle of the Bill. I doubt whether it is possible to extend it to individuals, as was asked here. I think that would be contrary to the principle of the Bill, which is merely confined to financial institutions. That is a matter which they can investigate in the Select Committee. If amendments cannot be introduced in this regard, <span class="col_457-458" refersTo="page_0243"/>that is not the end of the matter; suggestions may be made to me or to the Minister of Economic Affairs to provide possibly in another Act for a general protection of trust funds in the hands of individuals. But these are all institutions falling under the Registrar of Financial Institutions. The trust boards also fall under the Banking Act. We are concerned with all of them. The only object of this Bill is to assist the Registrar to ensure that no trouble ensues in connection with the particular institution falling under him.</p>

<p>A Commission has been appointed in respect of the Companies Act. Possibly many of these suggestions may be put to that Commission. But the main thing we are trying to do here, as the principle implies, is to make better provision for the safe custody of trust property and funds of these financial institutions mentioned here. I am not wedded to the particular method provided for here. Our investigation at the various institutions have brought to light no better method. I may tell the hon. member for Constantia that these institutions are greatly interested in this because they want to protect their good name. They will support any means of dealing with the black sheep. They are therefore really interested in the matter. Nor were they able to shed further light on the matter. I can only hope that the Select Committee will be able to suggest something better and then I will welcome it with open arms.</p>
