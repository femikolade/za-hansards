At a discussion between the Regional Representative, Department of Housing, Johannesburg, and the Town Clerk on 20 June 1963 the latter indicated that a further survey of the housing needs would be undertaken.

<li>(2) Since the commencement of the present contract in 1962, the directories of the four Provinces have been standardized in that a thinner improved paper and a special gothic type which is more legible are now being used. This has resulted in an improvement in the standard of the Natal directory, but the Post Office and the Government Printer are continually on the lookout for ideas for further improving the directories, and welcome and give consideration to all practical suggestions.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_labour" to="#suzman">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes; when the subsidization of certain workshops was transferred to my Department on 1 April 1963.</li>

<li>(2) Yes; during October 1956 and August 1962, by the Department of Social Welfare.</li>

<li>(3) Yes; the 1956 application was refused as the proposed building site was not unencumbered and also on account of factors relating to financial control by the Association. The 1962 application is receiving attention.</li>

<li>(4) Despite several reminders to the Association all relevant information was not submitted timeously by the Association to enable my Department to finalize the matter and to make provision for funds during the current financial year. All the relevant particulars have now been received and Treasury will be approached for approval for the inclusion of this service in the estimates for the next financial year.</li>

<heading>COLOURED PERSONS REPRESENTATIVE COUNCIL BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Committee Stage,&#x2014;Coloured Persons Representative Council Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment as printed on the Order Papey in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) and to substitute &#x201C;46 members elected in the manner hereinafter provided&#x201D;; and in lines 12 and 13, to omit &#x201C;nominated or&#x201D;.</block>

<p>During the second reading we made it clear that it was our standpoint in principle that there should be growing co-operation between the Coloureds and the Whites in the existing legislative bodies of the country. That standpoint has been rejected by the Government, and instead a representative Coloured council is now being established. Clause 1 provides for the nature and the size of this representative Coloured council, and we believe that until such time as a different and better dispensation is created for the Coloureds, this House should be used as effectively as possible as a mouthpiece for them. But if this is to be a representative council we feel that it should really be representative of the feelings of the Coloureds and that it should be able to speak effectively on their behalf. And the best way of establishing such a council is to get a council which has proved that it is really representative. There can really be only one sound yardstick for determining that, and that is that it should have stood the test of an election where the voters could say: This is the man whom I want to speak on my behalf, and not that one. Clause 1 provides for a council consisting of 46 members, but only 30 members will be elected and 16 will be nominated by the Government. Our obiections to this arrangement are, <i>inter alia,</i> the following: We want all 46 members to be elected by the Coloureds themselves. If there are to be any nominated members at all, then 16 nominated members out of 46 is far too high a percentage&#x2014;it is more than one-third. We feel that if more than a third of the members of this representative council are to be nominated by the Government it will weaken the whole character of that council. That is our first objection.</p>

<p><span class="col_4435-4436" refersTo="page_0910"/>Our second objection is this. The hon. the member is always concerned with the concept of the balance of power. What do we have here&#x003F; If ever there is to be a group in a council which holds the balance of power, it will be these 16 members, because in any case where there is a difference of opinion these 16 will have the deciding vote. We feel that this will lower the standard of the resolutions of this council. A third objection is that it will create two classes of members within this council. The one class, the elected members, will involuntarily regard itself as consisting of the first-class members, because they will feel that they are there to represent the people who sent them there. The others will be regarded as second-class members, members who are not really representative of the Coloureds and who will bear the stamp of being the Government&#x2019;s &#x201C;yes-men&#x201D;. We know the kind of accusation made in bodies where there are nominated members. One finds it even in White bodies. Just when a nominated member gets up, the accusation comes from the other side: Whom do you represent&#x003F; Here, where in addition we are also dealing with a body constituted on a racial basis, it is so much more dangerous to have a number of members who are put there by a different racial group. In such a body, more than in any other, one should not have nominated members. It will inevitably create an unpleasant atmosphere in the council. I go so far as to say that the nominated members will even be in an unfavourable position as against the others. Such a set-up will necessarily create unnecessary friction in the council.</p>

<p>Another important objection we have is this: It makes the constituencies unnecessarily large. We have 160 members in this House and we know how large many of our constituencies are and how difficult it is for many members, with all their privileges, to represent those large constituencies. The Coloureds are now given 46 members, but they will have only 30 constituencies for the whole of the Republic. Generally speaking, they are not rich people; they will not draw large salaries. It will be an impossible task for them to handle 30 constituencies covering the whole of the Republic. And if there is one section of the population which urgently needs the personal attention of their representatives, it is the Coloureds. So in addition to all the disadvantages of this arrangement, it will have the harmful defect that the constituencies will be unnecessarily large. It would be much better, viewed from the angle of the actual representation and the efficiency of the council, to have 46 constituencies and 46 elected members on this council.</p>

<p>Further, I do not think this depicts the Government in a good light. It shows a lack of confidence in the Coloureds. The Government says: Here I give you something &#x201C;big&#x201D;, but I do not have enough confidence in you to allow you to elect all your members. More than a third will be nominated by the Government. I know the Minister can advance reasons for doing so. I can also give examples of other bodies where there are nominated members. There is, e.g., the Senate. But it is no argument to say that because other bodies have nominated members, such members must also serve on this type of body. The Senate has been mentioned, but the Whites have 160 elected representatives in the House of Assembly; that is quite a different situation. In this case all the sound arguments are against it. Where we are now giving the Coloureds a representative body, let us make it as representative as possible so that the people can feel: Here speaks a body which is actually elected by the Coloureds and which is really representative of the will and the wishes of the Coloured community.</p>

<p>That is why we move this amendment to the effect that all 46 members will be elected members.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>This clause purports to establish this new representative council. It would appear to me that this is the basic object of this Bill. My attitude towards this Bill was made perfectly clear in the second reading and I do not propose to reiterate anything I said there. I have already indicated my total opposition to this Bill. In view, however, of the fact that this clause has this basic object of establishing this representative council I feel one owes a duty to the Coloured people in the sense that it is necessary for us to try to bring about such improvements to this Bill as are possible and it is for that reason, and that reason only, that we intend participating in the debate in Committee. We feel it our duty to effect such improvements in the interests of the Coloured people who will be called upon to serve on this new council. It is in that spirit that I rise to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson).</p>

<p>What is the Government&#x2019;s intention in regard to this representative council&#x003F; Surely the Government intends to establish a council which will be truly representative of the Coloured people of this country and which will carry with it the confidence and respect of those people. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he might give very careful consideration, if those are the objects of the Government, to the suggestion that the nominated councillors should be as few as possible, that there should be a truly representative council representing the views by and large of the Coloured people. If that is the intention of the Government I suggest that the hon. the Minister should be prepared to give very favourable consideration to the proposal that all the members of this council should be elected by popular vote from among the Coloured people themselves.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister and other speakers on the Government side have indicated during the course of the previous debate that the members of the existing council, the Union Council of Coloured Affairs, have been stigmatized <span class="col_4437-4438" refersTo="page_0911"/>as &#x201C;stooges of the Government&#x201D;. We want to try to avoid that. How did that come about, Mr. Chairman&#x003F; In the present council there are 27 members of whom only 12 are elected by popular vote; 16 being nominated by the Government. It is for that reason that these unfortunate gentlemen have acquired this appellation of being stooges of the Government. If the hon. the Minister wishes to discontinue that stigma I suggest to him that he gives serious consideration to allowing the entire council to be elected by popular vote. There is no doubt about it, Sir, that the nominated councillor in any council will always retain the appellation of being a stooge of the Government by the Coloured people. We must try to avoid that. After all, we are trying to bring about what is likely to remain a permanent part of the legislation of this country; we are trying to establish a council which will enjoy the respect and esteem of the Coloured people as a whole. I suggest that nothing will achieve that object more than allowing the Coloured people, in the full exercise of their democratic rights, to elect whom they want on to this council. I urge the hon. the Minister to give very favourable consideration to this suggestion. If the hon. Minister is not disposed to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout I shall, in due course, move an amendment along the lines indicated on the Order Paper. But before I move it, Sir, I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what his reaction is to the proposal that all the members of the council, in the interests of the Coloured people, should be elected by the free vote of the Coloured people. I shall therefore, at this stage, abstain from moving the amendment standing in my name.</p>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>In their attitude towards this legislation the United Party is once again showing how inconsistent they are. I just want to remind you, Mr. Chairman, that in the case of the Bantu legislation the United Party moved an amendment that the Bill should be read to-day six months. On that occasion they put up a fight to the bitter end. They did not move any amendments to those 101 clauses. In the case of the Bill we have had the same amendment but they are so inconsistent that they are moving various amendments.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) advanced the argument that because various members were nominated you would create a class distinction. We have an example of a body on which there are elected and nominated members in the Other Place. So far I have never heard it argued that there was a class distinction in the Other Place. On the contrary in a previous Senate under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime one of the nominated members, namely, the late F. S. Malan, was the President. To-day two of the nominated members in the Other Place are the President and the Chairman of Committees. It works very well in that body and in this regard the Other Place serves its purpose for the very reason that in that way we get excellent men, men who have been left out, on that body.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that the Coloureds on the existing Coloured council want it that way themselves. There are more nominated than elected members on the existing council and it is generally admitted that that council has functioned well. It has functioned well and served its purpose for the very reason that capable people serve on it because they have been nominated to it. As I have said, the Coloureds themselves want it this way. I can understand why they want it that way. I can understand why the existing council want it that way. The Coloureds have no experience of elections. [Laughter.] A very small percentage have in the past gained experience but the broad masses of the Coloured people have no experience of elections whatsoever. The Coloureds in the other provinces have no experience of elections. You can well imagine, Sir, what will happen to the council in such a case and the Coloureds realize that only too well. Whites and White political parties are not going to refrain from poking their noses into the elections of the Coloureds. There are people in this country who will see to it that that council is packed by agitators. The Coloureds are sufficiently wise to realize that and they do not want that to happen. That is why they are prepared at this stage to accept a number of nominated members because the Coloureds do not intend this step of the Government&#x2019;s to fail. They want it to be a success. The Opposition are very anxious for it to fail. The Coloured people do not want that. They have become wise to the fact that they have derived many benefits from the steps taken by this Government and that is why they are prepared to accept this suggestion. As a matter of fact the suggestion comes from them.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>We have now heard an argument which I never thought would be heard in a representative Parliament. We are told that because we said we rejected this Bill, we should not move amendments in the Committee Stage! That was the suggestion made by the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden). Surely we are not going to sink to such depths of absurdity by adopting a suggestion of that kind. We are very much in earnest about these amendments and they are very important. When we consider this new advisory body we must have in mind what we mean by &#x201C;advisory&#x201D;. They are there to represent the views of the Coloured people of South Africa. We want to hear their views and I am sure the hon. the Minister wants to hear their views. If the council is going to have a large number of nominated members they will give the kind of advice that was indicated by the hon. member for Cres (Mr. S. L. Muller) during the second reading. He said when you get advice you should get the kind of advice you like to have and, therefore, he said, the <span class="col_4439-4440" refersTo="page_0912"/>provision in the Bill that advice was to be given by invitation was a very sound one. That was his argument. The man who gives you the kind of advice you like to have is not an adviser; he is a sycophant. What will happen in this case is this: There will be two groups of people, the one group representing the people and the other group, at the worst, will be sycophants&#x2014;&#x201C;stooges&#x201D; as they have been called. At the best they will be called &#x201C;the Minister&#x2019;s men&#x201D; and the others will be &#x201C;the people&#x2019;s men&#x201D;. That is a struggle that has taken place right through the constitutional development of the last 1,000 years&#x2014;&#x201C;the Minister&#x2019;s men&#x201D;, &#x201C;the King&#x2019;s men&#x201D; as they were called, and the &#x201C;people&#x2019;s men&#x201D;. This has led to civil war, as history teaches us. What we want in this case, and what I am sure the Minister wants, are representatives of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>An argument was used in the second reading that these Coloured people had not reached the stage of development where they could tender advice intelligently. Sir, they have reached such a high stage of development that the hon. the Minister of Labour has to have legislation to keep them out of competition; he has job reservation because the Coloured man may be a better man. That is obviously the reason. This argument that they should be Minister&#x2019;s men is very much like the darkest page in the constitutional history of our country, the enlarged Senate. We are now to have an enlarged advisory body. If the hon. the Minister wishes to be advised by the Coloured people let him be advised by representatives of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>I do not want to reiterate the arguments already advanced but I want to ask the hon. the Minister a few more questions before he replies. I want to ask him to remember what happened in the case of the Transkei elections. The voice of the people was stilled and nullified by the voice of the Government because the nominated members made it impossible for the elected members to be the head of the Government. And I think that might happen in this case.</p>

<p>What about the South West African Coloureds&#x003F; Or has the Minister not yet received his instructions from the hon. the Prime Minister in regard to the Odendaal Report&#x003F; If the White people of South West Africa are represented &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) has stated that the Coloureds in the northern provinces are not sufficiently mature to vote. A Free State councillor, Mr. Saunders, was the one who said the franchise should not be extended to the Free State because the Coloureds there had never as yet exercised the vote and that they should first be trained in that direction. Here I have his words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloureds in the northern provinces have never as yet had the franchise and he wondered whether it would be wise to give the franchise to the Coloureds in the Free State, for example.</block>

<p>But apart from that, Mr. Chairman, this is the suggestion of the existing council. We cannot meddle with this Bill; it is their wish that the council should be constituted in this way. The hon. Minister or Parliament cannot now interfere with their wishes. Apart from that, which of the suggestions put forward must be accepted&#x003F; The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) wants 46 elected members; the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) wants 40 elected and 16 nominated members; the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) wants 30 elected and no nominated members. Each one produced a number of figures and which set of figures is the right one&#x003F; There are three different suggestions and then we have the one in the Bill. That means we have four suggestions. Which is the right one&#x003F; If everyone juggles with figures what will be the end of this Bill&#x003F; In these circumstances the Minister and this House cannot meddle with this clause.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) said we had a precedent in the Other Place of where there were nominated members. I think the best example with which this council can be compared is the provincial council. This council is not a parliament; at the most it is merely a provincial council. Are there any nominated members on the provincial council&#x003F; If we are really anxious to promote the interests of the Coloureds I cannot see how we can have nominated members on this council. The hon. member said many Coloureds did not have experience of elections. If that is his argument is he going to find Coloureds with experience of elections to nominate&#x003F; Where will he find them&#x003F; The hon. member for Malmesbury should know more about the Coloureds than that. In the past the Coloureds <span class="col_4441-4442" refersTo="page_0913"/>in the Cape Province have taken part in elections for the city council for example. They have representatives on school boards and in the provincial council. How can the hon. member say the Coloureds have no experience of elections&#x003F;</p>

<p>If we really wish this council to be of any significance, if we wish to gain the confidence of the Coloureds, if we wish to make this council as representative as possible, I think there is only one way in which we can do so and that is to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I first want to refer to what the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has said, namely, that there are 12 elected and 18 nominated members on the existing council and that it is now suggested changing that ratio completely because the number of elected members is to be increased considerably and that that is a big improvement. The argument has been used that if the Government were to reserve the right to nominate a number of members people outside will say, as has been said in connection with the existing council, they are &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; of the Government. What is so wrong with it if a Coloured person supports the Government&#x003F; Is there anything wrong with it if a Coloured person supports the Opposition&#x003F; If there is a strong minority who is not represented why can the Government not see to it that they are represented&#x003F; The strong minority in South Africa is represented in this House.</p>

<p>The principle of nominated members has been accepted in the Senate. Since Union the position in the Senate has been that a number of members are nominated and are they &#x201C;stooges&#x201D;&#x003F; Was a person like the late Senator Conroy who was a Cabinet Minister, a &#x201C;stooge&#x201D; of the then Government&#x003F;</p>

<p>No, it is not a red herring. He was a nominated member of the then Government. In the first place there is an improvement as far as the elected members are concerned. In the second place there is nothing wrong with a Government retaining the right to nominate people. In the third place, when the then Government composed the first advisory board in South Africa, it nominated all the members. All the members of the Lawrence Board were nominated. And, of course, they were not &#x201C;stooges&#x201D;. All the members of the board appointed by Mr. Lawrence were nominated.</p>

<p>Exactly; that is why we are not nominating every one; that is why we allow the majority to be elected. I visualize a situation where these 30 members will be elected and where certain important groups of the Coloured people will not be represented. By nominating members the object is to ensure that that which has been overlooked at the election will be remedied. Hon. members can attack me personally and try to arouse suspicion, that does not matter. But the way in which the Government appointed the Education Advisory Board last year proved that we were not looking for &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; but that we were trying to appoint the most capable people from within the ranks of the Coloured people.

<p>Not always. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) rightly said this suggestion came from the Coloured council. Here I have the memorandum submitted by the council shortly after I had met them for the first time. This was submitted to the Cabinet and I just want to quote a short passage from this memorandum in connection with this matter. I met the council on 26 June 1962 and I put the following question to them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is there clarity on how the council should be reorganized&#x003F; Of how many members should the proposed council consist&#x003F;</block>

<p>Those were the questions I put to them. The committee which consists of the executive committee with two co-opted members appointed to frame the resolution replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your committee will now proceed to deal with the various matters affecting the constitution of the council. According to the information supplied by the Department of Coloured Affairs, the Coloured population of all the urban and rural areas was as follows in September 1962: Cape Province, 788,635 (or 60 per cent in the urban areas) and rural 525,757; Transvaal, 93,643 (or 89 per cent) in urban and rural 11,574; Natal, 36,629 (85 per cent) and 6,464; Orange Free State, 14,061 (55 per cent) and rural 11,504. A total of 932,968 urban and rural 555,299. It will therefore be noticed that the Cape <span class="col_4443-4444" refersTo="page_0914"/>Province has by far the largest concentration of Coloureds, followed by the Transvaal, then Natal and the Orange Free State. At this stage it may also be necessary to quote the population figures for certain cities and towns in the Republic: Cape Town 377,578; Port Elizabeth 60,900; Johannesburg 56,000; Durban 25,000; Paarl 21,000; Kimberley 16,000; Worcester 15,000; Oudtshoorn 11,000; East London 8,000; Bloemfontein 6,000.</block>

<p>Your committee also has had regard to the fact that the existing council consists of 27 members, constitued as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Then they give the constitution of the existing council and they go on&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">In order to make the council more representative of the Coloured population of South Africa your committee recommends (a) that there should be more elected than nominated members; (b) that representation be distributed as follows: Cape Province, 18 elected and 8 nominated members, a total of 26; Transvaal, six elected and two nominated, a total of eight; Natal, three elected, nominated one, a total of four; Orange Free State, three elected, one nominated, a total of four; Griquas, two nominated; Malays, two nominated. A total of 30 elected and 16 nominated, a grand total of 46.</block>

<p>In other words, the existing council came to this conclusion after very proper consideration and with due regard to the population figures and how they were distributed over the country. In the first place they had regard to the fact that there was a definite ratio between the provinces and in the second place they had regard to the fact that the Coloured community was mainly concentrated in certain areas. Therefore the argument that because the Whites are represented in a certain way the Coloureds should likewise be represented does not hold water because the Coloureds are not distributed over the country in the same way the Whites are. To give an example: There are few White people in the Cape Province in comparison with the other provinces but there are many more Coloureds in the Cape Province than in the other provinces. Regard was therefore had to the distribution of the Coloured population over the provinces. Secondly, according to this memorandum, regard was had to the concentration in the urban areas. But regard was also had to minority groups. Hon. members on the other side now suggest that as far as the Griquas and the Malays are concerned their interests should be completely ignored.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister has propounded a new principle in the representation of minority groups. I cannot follow him. Does he mean to say that because there is a minority group that group shall be represented in any legislative assembly, and should they be represented as separate groups and not as a total of elected people&#x003F; Would he go so far as to say that minority groups, no matter who they are, shall be represented in this House as well, by nomination&#x003F; Would he go so far as to say that because there happens to be a liberal group of considerable size outside this House that he would be prepared to nominate members from that group to sit in this House&#x003F; Is that what he means&#x003F; Because that is what he said, and what we on this side of the House understood him to say. It is obvious to us who listened to the hon. Minister and to other hon. members on that side that no reason has as yet been given why there should be any nominated people on this representative council. The hon. Minister has got no confidence in his own party. He knows full well that he cannot get people elected to that council fairly and squarely. So he is going to nominate them. He is going to bring them in through the back door. What are these people going to do there&#x003F; These people are going to be paid people. They are going to act almost as paid officials. His master&#x2019;s voice will be heard in this representative council. The hon. Minister will pay the piper and he will call the tune. If he requires a watchdog in this council, if it is necessary for the voice of the Government to be heard in this council, is it not sufficient that he himself has taken the right to sit in this council and to discuss matters&#x003F; Is it not sufficient that he can have a representative of his own choosing to sit in this council and take part in the discussions&#x003F; Is that not sufficient for him&#x003F; What more does he want&#x003F; Has he not got confidence in himself to change the opinions of the elected people&#x003F; Why must he have in addition to himself another 16 nominated people&#x003F; There is no reason for this. And if he has got 16 nominated people of his own choosing, on what grounds is he going to choose them&#x003F; What are the qualifications going to be of these nominated people&#x003F; He is going to pick people who are going to express his own opinion, and if they do not express his own opinion, he will either not choose them, or he will get rid of them. That is the whole crux of the matter. He cannot have confidence in the Coloured people to elect their own people. He cannot have confidence in the Coloured people to run their own affairs. He has said over and over again that they are not qualified enough to guide themselves even in this lowly type of council. Even here he has not got confidence in those people. It is no good the hon. Minister with <span class="col_4445-4446" refersTo="page_0915"/>one voice saying that they are quite capable of looking after their own affairs, and in another voice to say that they need guidance and that they will continue to need guidance. This sort of thing is what the outside people see, and that makes a laughing stock of this Bill. It means very little. At most it means that in this council the hon. Minister will sit there, he will direct, he will try and change the opinions of those who have been elected, and he will be supported by those people whom he has nominated, and if they do not support him, out they will go.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down immediately accepts that the Minister will appoint nobody but Nationalists to that council. He said &#x201C;He will pick the people who express his own opinion&#x201D;, and that if they did not express his own opinion he would immediately get rid of them. I should very much like to know what gives the hon. member that idea. It has already been stated that some of the responsible Coloured leaders may lose an election, people whom you want on that council, and for that reason the Minister should have the power to appoint them. What I find striking is this: A year or two ago the composition of the executive committees of the provincial councils was changed and on that occasion speaker after speaker on the other side of the House argued that the executive committees of the provincial councils should continue to be appointed as they were because the rights of the minority groups should be protected.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I am quite prepared to continue that argument with the hon. member. They are elected as members of the provincial council and the governing party in the provincial council is the party who has already obtained the majority of votes. But the argument of hon. members on that side was that the party who gained the majority of votes should not be the one to elect the executive committee. Their argument was that the minority group should be protected and that people from the minority group should be appointed so that the minority group would also be able to voice its opinion. If that argument were valid at the time why is the same argument not valid in this case&#x003F; I do not want to predict at this stage to which political party the 30 elected members will belong or which party they will support. Time will have to show us that. But we know it is possible that responsible Coloured leaders, people who can perform valuable services on that council, will fall out at the election. Take the election in the Karoo. I do not think the best man was elected and it may perhaps be in the interests of those people if the minority vote could also be heard. The Minister will have the right in such a case of appointing such responsible Coloured leaders. For the rest the hon. member simply accepts that the whole council will have to do what the Minister wants them to do. How can he come to that conclusion in view of the fact that 30 members will be elected and only 16 nominated&#x003F; If the 30 elected members decided otherwise there will still be a majority of 30 as opposed to the 16 and the Minister&#x2019;s representation will still be hopelessly in the minority. No, the United Party must forgive me when I say I think they are not serious in their opposition to this clause. The Coloureds themselves have asked, <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the existing advisory council, that there should still be nominated members in the first instance. It has already been stated that this is not a law of the Medes and the Persians which can never again be repealed or amended. But to start with this is essential and the Coloureds themselves want 16 members to be nominated. The position is already that the Coloureds will be able to elect many more to the council, in the ratio of two to one. Seeing that the Coloureds ask for that &#x2014;and hon. members say we must create something which will satisfy the Coloureds&#x2014;I cannot understand why they are opposing this clause.</p>

<p>If we were to accept the argument of the hon. member who has just sat down in regard to the representation of minority groups I hope he will suggest that legislation be introduced in terms whereof the United Party in the Free State will get a few nominated members in the provincial council. Surely that argument does not hold water.</p>

<p>I wish to confine myself in all seriousness to the clause. When this Bill was introduced the hon. the Minister voiced his objection during the second reading to the fact that the members of the existing Coloured council were to-day and in the past referred to as &#x201C;stooges&#x201D;. Why should we create a similar opportunity for the same argument to be used&#x003F; The hon. member referred to the Coloured Advisory Board during the time of Minister Lawrence. I was about ten years old but I distinctly remember how strenuously the Coloureds opposed that nominated council and many of the extremely leftist Coloureds of to-day are people who woke up at that time and started to take the lead. The Minister gave the example of the Coloured Education Board. I wish to congratulate the Minister on the composition of that board because they are capable people, capable educationists. When the Minister considered the appointment of that board he concentrated on the ability of the people as educationists. What yardstick will the Minister use when appointing people to this council&#x003F; Surely they will be appointed because of their ability or training in a certain profession or in a certain direction.</p>

<p>I shall be glad. The hon. the Minister also gave us the example of the Malays and the Griquas. I do not know who <span class="col_4447-4448" refersTo="page_0916"/>advised the Minister to select the Malays and the Griquas. These people are Coloured and they are known as Coloureds and they want to be Coloureds. The term &#x201C;Malay&#x201D; has become a complete misnomer. They are Coloureds who follow the Mohammedan religion. You cannot distinguish to-day whose forefathers were Malay slaves and whose forefathers were Coloureds. They are Coloureds who follow the Mohammedan religion. Griqualand East falls in my constituency and I know my constituency. I personally have already held meetings, non-political meetings, at Griqualand East, together with the nominated Griqua representatives in the existing Coloured council and I have had to protect that man and ask the meeting to give him a hearing. They said: You are a Griqua; we are not Griquas, we are Coloureds. That has happened at Kokstad, at Umzimkulu and at Rietvlei in Griqualand East. You are trying to create a completely artificial barrier by suggesting that the descendants of Adam Kok constitute a separate race in South Africa. Under the new set-up Griqualand East will of course form a constituency or constituencies, and I can assure the Minister that the people in those constituencies will not elect people because they are of 100 per cent Griqua descent or whatever it may be. Things have changed completely with the passage of time and the Minister should really abandon the idea of specifically selecting the Malays and the Griquas. I do indeed expect certain parts of my constituency to put up Moslem candidates because they are leading and capable figures. I know of two, for example, who, if they are willing to stand as candidates, will in all probability be elected. They follow the Moslem religion. In the case of one it is obvious that his background is Indian, but the other one is a Cape Coloured who has embraced the Moslem religion.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) gave the example of the Senate. I cannot see, however, how we can in the same breath compare this new council with both the provincial council and the Senate. The Senate forms part of Parliament, it is one of the three constituent elements of Parliament and in theory at least it is regarded as the House of revision. But in this case you have a Coloured Council and not a parliament consisting of three constituent elements. On the ground of my experience I want to plead in all seriousness that the whole council should be elected. This will create confidence amongst the Coloured people and it will quash the criticism there has been in the past. We have been told that the existing council wants this. Of course that will be the position where the majority of members are nominated members. They want to have nominated members because they would like to return. It is true that the executive committee of that council suggested that two-thirds should be elected members and one-third nominated but I know of two members on that executive committee who, after they had gone back and addressed meetings and conducted investigations, came back and said they had changed their minds and that the entire council should consist of elected members.</p>

How can the hon. member accuse me of having instigated them to say that&#x003F; Whenever I have had the opportunity I have attended meetings of the Coloured council. I have never yet used any information I have gleaned there in this House. I have observed the rule but my experience has time and again been that when a councillor adopts a certain attitude in that council another member jumps up and says: &#x201C;You should not say that; you know nothing about it, you are a nominated member whereas I am an elected member.&#x201D; I seriously think that if you want a council which will command the respect of the Coloured population and which will be beyond any criticism, it should be an elected council. The hon. the Minister need not be afraid that the best men will not come forward. The moment it is to be a freely elected council he will get the right people. The extremists whom the Minister does not want there will not get the support of the Coloured population. I had that experience in my constituency in 1958. Somebody opposed me on that occasion. I do not know whether he was a communist or not but he had already been detained under emergency regulations, etc., and there was general talk that he was a leftist. People who were prominent members of the erstwhile Communist Party assisted him and he got 93 votes. Surely that clearly proves that we can trust the Coloured population.</p>

<p>In the highest forum in this country some of the members are nominated, namely, the Senate. That is one of the legislative bodies of our country and all these years there have been nominated members and hon. members opposite have never objected to that. But I particularly cannot understand the United Party objecting to nominated members. That party is a firm believer in the system of nominated members, the system of appointing members. In the old days when I was still a member of the United Party the ordinary United Party member could elect his candidate but the party departed from that principle and gave the Leader of the Opposition the right to appoint their candidates. I am now talking about the system of nominated members and I wish to indicate that they apparently have more confidence in the Coloured than in their own party members. They do not even allow their own party members to nominate their own candidates. Sir de Villiers Graaff, the Leader of the Opposition, appoints them. There you have the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). The United Party members of Bezuidenhout did not want him. He was appointed, he was nominated. There you have the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller). Houghton rejected him so they fitted him in at Florida and one of the chairmen of the United Party resigned because they did not want him. The members were not given the opportunity of electing him. The Leader of the Opposition said: &#x201C;You have no say. You are much worse than the Coloureds who can elect their own people; I am telling you you are going to accept Hymie Mille.&#x201D; But let us return to the Coloureds. Look what Sir de Villiers Graaff did to the Karoo! Look at the injustice he did the Coloureds of the Karoo constituency. Did he say to the United Party Coloureds. &#x201C;Nominate your own candidate&#x201D;&#x003F; Not at all. To-day they say Coloureds can become members of their party. I would have thought that where an official candidate had to be appointed, as in the case of Karoo, they would have told the Coloured voters they could choose their own candidate but did they do that&#x003F; No, they then appointed the miserable member who is sitting here to-day. They forced him on to the Coloureds and told the Coloureds they would not be allowed to choose but that a candidate would be nominated for them.</p>

But I am dealing with the question of nominated members. I want to tell the Minister that I believe he is making a cardinal mistake in insisting on over a third of the members of this body being nominated. We know what the attitude was of the Coloured people to the council established by Mr. Harry Lawrence. It was raised by the Minister himself. Those were nominated members. If the Minister wants to establish something really worth while, what he should do, and what this House should do, is to take its courage in both hands and to say, to show our <i>bona fides:</i> We believe you people can progress and play a very important part, and we are putting the Whole of your future in your own hands and it is up to you to make a success of it. Sir, we can never make a success of this type of body by nominating so many members. Possibly a case could be made out for nominating a limited number of members.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a philosophy which is quite obvious. The hon. member surely knows that a responsible guardian will not simply allow his ward to play with political dynamite. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said that he was going to tell the Coloureds to destroy this council because he had no confidence in it. We know of the communist and liberal influences in our country, and surely the White guardian cannot allow the Coloureds to be indoctrinated with communist and liberal ideas. We know that those hon. members are not interested in making a success of this council. They call it a &#x201C;mockery&#x201D;. Whence suddenly their interest in this council&#x003F; Now they do not want to allow the Christian White guardian to ensure that in the high political and constitutional spheres of the national life of the Coloureds they should not only be represented by people of their own flesh and blood, but that the guardian should have a choice. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) said there were no leaders amongst the Coloureds whom we could select and nominate, but every group has a leader. It is obvious that in all spheres of national life in the course of time leaders come to the fore in the educational, spiritual, social and economic spheres, and they are the natural leaders. Here the White guardian now allows a thorough selection to take place in a responsible manner and not to nominate all the members of the council, but these people have to go through a gradual process of development. We want to have a sort of balance there, so that people who have already proved their worth in all the different spheres of life may be selected by the White guardian, and not the communist agitators. Not only do we want to know that these people will be governed by people of their own flesh and blood, but we want to know how they will be governed. I think one of the best methods to achieve effective government is for the Christian guardian to make selections from those people who have already come to the fore. I think that is one of the best arguments one can advance. [Interjection.] We cannot simply throw them to the wolves. The hon. member for Kensington said that he was going to tell the Coloureds to destroy this council, and what is the best way of doing it&#x003F; It is to give the communist and liberal elements an opportunity to get the political power in that council into their own hands, and that is what those hon. members want. They do not want the White guardian to make a thorough selection from the natural leaders who come to the fore in every sphere, so that there may be a balance, and in that way to give them the necessary training. That is the main reason why I believe that at this stage we should nominate these people, and to the extent that they become politically mature&#x2014;and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) in fact said they were immature &#x2026;</p>

<p>Then somebody else must have said it.

If the guardian succeeds in getting such people on the council, it does its duty and does not shirk its responsibilities. And there has never before been as much goodwill towards the Coloureds as there is today, and I think that the White guardian should set to work very cautiously at this particular time. The Minister knows which people have come to the fore and who are the conservative elements in the national life of the Coloureds, and that he should make use of them to stimulate an interchange of ideas in that council, which will result in achieving balance and obtaining the best result in the interests of the Coloureds as a whole.</p>

<p>Now, this hon. Minister spoke about the Other Place and dealt with persons there, and the hon. member for Malmesbury did the same.

I believe the Minister of Labour is one of them. Is there any chance whatever that the Minister of Labour will vote against this Government&#x003F; Is there any chance that he will express an opinion contrary to Government policy&#x003F; Is there any chance, with the experience we have of nominations made by this Government, that any one of these 16 people will do anything else but what the Government wants&#x003F; Quite obviously not. Sir, when you look at the powers which this body has&#x2014;and I use the word &#x201C;powers&#x201D; in inverted commas&#x2014;particularly if one looks at Clause 20 &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am only trying to illustrate what the functions of these members will be&#x2014;&#x201C;on request to advise the Government in regard to all matters affecting the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured people&#x201D;. Is any one of these members going to advise the Government that it is in the interest of the Coloured people to abolish job reservation, for example&#x003F; If that man were to go to the polls and ask the Coloured people to elect him, and he were to say that he stands for the abolition of job reservation, and another man says that he stands for the maintenance of job reservation, who do you think would win the election, Sir&#x003F; The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) gave the game away when he said that these were the Minister&#x2019;s representatives on this council. Let me say that the hon. the Minister has the power in terms of this Bill to attend the meetings of this council and to talk at those meetings. What the Minister is doing now is allowing his supporters to take part in this debate because he started sulking. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>But he has the right to go to this council and persuade them that what he wants them to do is the correct thing. Is that not the very basis of this Bill, that this is what the Coloured people want, firstly, and secondly, that it is good for them and, thirdly, that it will do more for them than anyone else&#x003F; And if the Minister is sincere about that, what is he afraid of&#x003F; Is he afraid that when he puts his case to the Coloured people they will reject it&#x003F; Of course he is, otherwise why does he have to load this body with more than one-third of nominated members&#x003F; I hope the Minister will give us an answer. He has not <span class="col_4455-4456" refersTo="page_0920"/>indicated that he completely rejects the amendments which have been moved. I think this Committee is entitled to know what his attitude is.</p>

<p>Let me say something to the hon. member for Vereeniging, who is not here now. He spoke about choosing candidates and asked why we did not in the Karoo election go to the Coloured people and ask them to choose a candidate for themselves. But that is what we did. We put a candidate in the field, and the Coloureds voted for him, a United Party man who stood against the nominee of the Nationalist Party. Is that not what happened&#x003F; [Interjections.] And for them to talk about Florida when they have the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Information, whom they took to the by-election in a concerted effort to break through to the English-speaking people there, is nonsensical. The people of Florida made a decision. If the Minister is going to insist on calling this a representative council, he must also allow the council to be representative. Sir, this is not a Senate. It is a &#x201C;Volksraad&#x201D;, is it not&#x003F; Or is it not&#x003F; Or is this just a body which the Minister is putting up as a facade, as an empty shell for him to practise &#x201C;baas-skaps&#x201D; apartheid in&#x003F; Or is this not going to be a body with some chance to deliberate and to tell the Government what it wants&#x003F; Does the Government really want advice from this body&#x003F; That is what it really boils down to. Or is it going to go on pretending, as it does with South Africa, that we are not what we are, that we are really something which belongs in a new dream, and we put up all sorts of structures which look very pretty from the outside, but when you go inside there is practised the very policy that the Government is trying to bluff not only South Africa but the world with&#x003F; Will the Minister not get up now and stop pouting&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The point I want to make is that the hon. member should not try to threaten me. If he cannot take a beating he should not make threats. What does he mean by saying that he will do this, that and the other&#x003F; The hon. member should not be so conceited. I leave him there in his ignorance and his conceit.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Outeniqua put certain questions to me. Let me first say that I did not resume my seat a moment ago because I did not want to talk further; I concluded my arguments. Then I told hon. members that if they did not want to listen to me I would not try to reply to them. Now, the hon. member for Outeniqua asked me what I intended, to whom did I want to give representation by means of these nominations&#x003F; I told him it was an intelligent question, and I want to reply to it. In the first place there is nothing odd about providing for nominations. One finds it right throughout history where representative government was granted, and whether this is now a &#x201C;mockery&#x201D; in the eyes of the Opposition or not, this is a form of representative council for the Coloureds where they are given certain powers, and on the principle followed everywhere in the world where representative government is granted, provision is made for nominated members. Why is it that if we do so it is wrong, but when other countries do it it is not wrong&#x003F;</p>

<p>There may be certain Coloureds who do not wish to stand for election. There may be educationists or medical men or other people whose professions at this stage do not make it possible for them to embark on a political struggle. That is the first type of case. One may have the position that after the electorate has elected the elected members, one finds that certain facets of the life of the Coloured are not represented on that council. The hon. member knows it just as well as I do, and I do not wish to mention names, but he and I know many prominent Coloureds who will not stand for election but who will be prepared, if they are approached, to serve on this council because they want to make a positive contribution on behalf of their people. I do not want to mention names, but that is so. There are some of the most responsible Coloured leaders in the Peninsula and in the Western Province and in other parts of the country who will not be prepared to enter the ordinary political arena, but who will be prepared to say: In the sphere of medicine or culture or education or commerce I am prepared to make my contribution. Those are the people whom I have in mind in the first place.</p>

<p>But in the second place I have in mind filling those gaps which are left after the election has taken place. My argument is that hon. members need not like me and they need not trust me; that makes no difference to me, but I ask only one thing: Look at the appointments I have already made. Look at the Education Advisory Council, and tell me if I made a single bad appointment there. Then I do not think hon. members have the right to carry on in this unreasonable way.</p>

I have already said that it is difficult to handle this portfolio of Coloured Affairs. It would be difficult for any man, not only for someone on this side of the House; it would be difficult for any member on that side of the House also.

They will find no Coloureds to subscribe to that standpoint. Even Coloureds who differ from me politically will tell them that we treat them in the most reasonable manner, under my guidance.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Such a person might think that things have become a little ridiculous because earlier on we had the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) and the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) seriously advancing the argument that the situation of the Coloured people in the northern provinces was different from that of the Coloured people in the Cape, and in the Western Cape in particular, because according <span class="col_4459-4460" refersTo="page_0922"/>to those hon. members the Coloured people in the northern provinces have not the political experience of their counterpart in the Cape. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) went further and quoted a member of the existing Coloured council as making the statement from which he took that point of view. Sir, as has been said by way of an interjection, these statements, not from backbenchers on the Government side but from a man who is constitutionally close to this Bill and from a senior organizer of the Nationalist Party, is complete and absolute support for the policy which this party adopts in regard to the Coloured people in those provinces and flies in the face of the considerable time which the hon. the Minister spent yesterday in trying to make our policy look ridiculous. I do not want to take that point any further, but where the position becomes quite absurd to an outside observer is that here we have a clause for the establishment of a Coloured Persons Representative Council &#x2014;that is how the clause is labelled&#x2014;and we have the hon. the Minister spending some two hours arguing against the proposals against this clause put up by the Coloured Representatives. How absurd can a situation be when you have a Minister trying to persuade an Assembly such as this that he is introducing a clause designed to establish a Coloured representative council for the benefit of the Coloured people and in order to do that he has to spend a great deal of time opposing the arguments of the duly elected Coloured Representatives in this House! Sir, if one is not imbued with the outlook of members on the Government side, if one tries to look at this dispassionately, what more ridiculous situation can you have than that a Bill is introduced designed to provide for the representation of the Coloured people&#x2014;and this particular clause deals with that very point&#x2014; against which the duly elected Coloured Representatives have to argue most strongly. Surely, Sir, that can only mean one thing. If the hon. the Minister wishes to be logical and if he wishes to make the thing look at all sensible, he must accept every amendment put forward by the Coloured Representatives. How else can the thing be made to look sensible unless that attitude is adopted.</p>

<p>Sir, I was merely trying to discuss the points of view which have been raised in regard to the establishment of this council.</p>

<p>Now I come to the argument which has been raised in an attempt to compare the situation in this council with the Senate of South Africa. There is, of course, no comparison at all. We are here dealing with what purports to be an elected body whereas the Senate in South Africa is not an elected body. But in any event those who are nominated in the Other Place are nominated for one reason only, and it may give the reason for the necessity for nominating members in the Coloured council. Members of the Other Place are nominated because otherwise the points of view of the people whom they are put there to represent would not be heard. That is why they are nominated. The Coloured races in South Africa have no representation in the Senate. Consequently there are nominated members there to represent their point of view, and that is the only possible justification the Minister can have for nominated members in this council; that is to say, that the point of view of the Government would not otherwise be represented in that body and that that is why he wishes to have nominated members. There is no other justification for it. We have had references from the hon. the Minister to the British system of nominated members in the various legislative councils of the British colonies. There again there is no comparison with the situation of this council.</p>

<p>But why was it used there&#x003F; Firstly, because the point of view of the Imperial Government in colonial times was not represented in the electoral Assembly by the elected members, and secondly, because it was felt that in those cases where there was an executive function, the Minister concerned with Justice or Defence or Finance should be an elected official who had experience in that regard. There again there is no comparison with this body because there is no such executive function to be exercised by any of these people. So you come back, Sir, to the one reason which holds any water at all and that is that the hon. the Minister is so satisfied that the point of view of the Government will not be represented by a fully elected body representing the Coloured people that he must have nominated members in order to see that that point of view is represented there. Sir, he has said one other thing which carries no weight at all and that is that there are people such as teachers and doctors who would not allow themselves to be nominated in an election because they do not like taking part in politics due to the position they hold.</p>

<p>I do not want to reply to the hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke), because he is referring to the old composition of the Legislative Assembly <span class="col_4463-4464" refersTo="page_0924"/>of South West, where there were nominated members, but we in fact abolished that! The hon. member was quite wrong.</p>

<p>Sir, we have had remarkable arguments advanced here to-day in dealing with this clause and the amendment. The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) raised the question of the Senate; that has been discussed already, but just let me add this: The Senate is supplementary to an elected body. But that was not my argument; my argument was that in respect of the Senate we have Whites nominating Whites. One can still understand that, but here we will have a case where the Coloured council, which is supposed to be representative of the Coloureds, will consist of elected and nominated members, and the unfortunate element being introduced there is that a White Minister, representing a White body, will nominate those Coloureds. I think it is very important, when one is dealing here with a racial body; it puts the nominated members in an unfortunate position. Sir, I would tell the hon. the Minister this: If he refuses to accept this amendment, and if he then has prominent Coloureds whom he feels it is difficult to have elected, is he then prepared to allow them to be co-opted by the elected members of the Coloured council&#x003F; Will he then accept such an amendment, namely that the elected members of the Coloured council may co-opt the other 16 members, so that Coloureds will do the nomination and not a White body&#x003F; Will the Minister consider that&#x003F; I think it is wrong in principle for a White authority to nominate more than one-third of the members of this Coloured body.</p>

<p>A second point raised by the hon. member for Malmesbury was that if there are only elected members, this council will be &#x201C;packed with agitators&#x201D;. In other words, what is he intimating here&#x003F; That the Government is already afraid of its own creation. That is what the hon. member implied: I am afraid of my own creation and I do not dare to have a council consisting only of elected members.</p>

<p>If you give a right to the Coloureds you must give them the right to exercise it as they like. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) said that the Coloureds in the northern provinces had never yet voted and therefore there must be nominated members. But eight of the 16 members will be nominated from the Cape Province where there have been Coloureds in the provincial council, and where the Coloureds vote for members of the highest legislative body in South Africa, the House of Assembly. What sort of experience must a man then have to be able to decide whether he wants to vote for Mr. A to represent him, or for Mr. B&#x003F; The Government did not require experience on the part of the tribal Natives to vote in the Transkei. The Coloureds have been voting for years for cultural bodies, Church bodies and political bodies. Sir, we have never before heard such ridiculous arguments as we have heard here to-day. Another argument advanced is that the Coloured council asked for it, but of course they would ask for it. A large proportion of the members are nominated members and it is obvious that for safety&#x2019;s sake they will ask that in the new council there should also be a number of nominated members.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The elected members also want to ensure that if they perhaps lose the election they can get in as nominated members. That does not surprise me. I am quite convinced&#x2014;it is a matter of opinion and the hon. the Minister can tell me that he differs from me if he likes&#x2014;that if one asks the Coloured voters whether they want a wholly nominated body or a body of which half the members are nominated, or a wholly elected body, then the mass of Coloured voters will say that they prefer a fully elected body. The hon. the Minister asked during the course of his speech: What is wrong with Coloureds supporting the Government&#x003F; Sir, there is nothing wrong with it; a Coloured has every right to support the policy of the Government, and he also has the fullest right to support a different policy. That is not our point, but what we say is this: Let those who support the Government nominate their candidates and get them elected. That is the point. If the Minister is correct, that the Government does so much for the Coloureds that there is now a better spirit towards the Government than ever before, then surely he need not be afraid; then his supporters will be elected. But if the Government nominates a large number of members, it surely is not really a representative body; then one cannot say, that it is an independent representative body. In any case, the hon. the Minister destroyed his own argument. I was in the Chamber when he told the hon. member for Karoo: &#x201C;You do not represent the Coloureds; you sit in the caucus of the United Party; you are a member of the United Party.&#x201D; In other words, because the hon. member is a member of the United Party the Minister tells him that he does not represent the Coloureds. That is precisely what the elected members in the Coloured council will say of the nominated members! They will tell them day after day, in the same spirit as that in which the hon. the Minister treats the Coloured Representatives in this House: &#x201C;What are you doing here&#x003F; You do not represent the Coloureds; you have not been elected.&#x201D; That is precisely what we want to avoid. Hon. members opposite have pointed out that at the time Mr. Lawrence established the Coloured Advisory Council he <span class="col_4465-4466" refersTo="page_0925"/>also nominated people. That is correct, but that was an advisory council, whereas this one is a representative council. Then the hon. the Minister said: What hope will members of a minority group have of being elected&#x003F; He mentioned the case of the Malays and said how would they be elected if one did not create an opportunity to have representatives of a minority group like the Malays&#x003F; But here again the hon. the Minister is wrong. People are elected on their merits. In spite of the fact that the Malays are a minority group, there are Malays in the city council to-day and Dr. Abdurahman sat in the provincial council, in the same way that Malays also served on bodies like the divisional council and the Hospital Board of the Cape. These Malays were elected on their merits by other Coloureds, and I am convinced that the Malays will be strongly represented by the elected members. It is therefore no argument for the hon. the Minister to say that he has to protect the minority groups. These people will be elected on their merits. I think the Minister is rendering this council a disservice by saying, as he did to-day, that he considers it necessary that supporters of the Government should be appointed. By doing that he stigmatizes them, and it will therefore be his fault if they bear that stamp. He says that it is difficult for any man to be the Minister of Coloured Affairs, but he makes his own position difficult through the attitude he adopts. There are four Coloured Representatives in this House who were all elected. For the highest legislative body in the country the Coloureds are allowed to elect four representatives, but hon. members opposite say that the Coloureds are not developed enough to elect their representatives for a more subsidiary body; more than one-third must be nominated. Sir, not a single convincing argument has been advanced from that side of the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry I have to rise again. I shall not participate in the discussions again. I merely wish to furnish the House with information on two points. I really resent the manner in which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) has misrepresented this whole clause. What other object has the hon. member if not to stir up strife&#x003F; Take his last utterance for instance. He says we do not trust the Coloureds to choose their own representatives. The fact of the matter is this, that whereas they have only 12 to-day, we are now giving them 30. Whereas at the present time they constitute a minority in the present council, we are giving them a majority of 14 over the nominated members, but the hon. member comes here and states without blushing that we do not trust the Coloureds sufficiently to let them choose their own representatives. Sir, have you ever seen a more blatant attempt to stir up strife, just to sow enmity&#x003F; The hon. member for Bezuidenhout surely knows better; he is an intelligent person; he is a man who knows the National Party&#x2019;s policy in its positive form also; at one time he even advocated it. Why does he make such a statement, when he knows for a fact that it is calculated to cause trouble&#x003F; He does not tell the House that he admits that a minority of elected members now becomes a majority; he does not tell the House that their number is increased from 12 to 30. No, he says we do not trust the Coloureds to elect their members. Then he refers to the Malays to whom I have said I wish to give representation. Sir, anybody in South Africa who knows the Malay group knows that the Malay community is satisfied to be assimilated with the Coloured community, but the Malay community possess certain qualities they would like to preserve; they wish to be known as Malays. When the population register came into being, the Malay community came forward and said they wished to be classified as Malays and we had to do so on their insistence.</p>

<p>He does not know about that; he does not know these people; he is just talking. He is not living with these people; he does not deliberate with them all day long. All he does is to foment trouble among them. He does not try to further the interests of these people. The same applies to the Griquas; the Griquas came forward with the request that they wished to be classified as a sub-group. The hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) to my surprise came here and said that because the Griquas in Griqualand East are adopting a certain attitude, we should deviate from this point of view. But does the hon. member not know about the strong attempt being made among a large section of the Griqua population to have even their own territory&#x003F; Does he know that, or does he not&#x003F; Has he ever had dealings with the deputations from the Griquas with whom we have to deal from time to time&#x003F; However, Sir, all this is part of the process of equalization forming part of the policy of those hon. members; they want to destroy everything of which people are proud. They first want to destroy the Malays and the Griquas and make the Coloureds equal, and then they want the whole lot to be absorbed in the White community and then eventually have the lot absorbed in a greater community. That is their whole attitude in principle. We disagree with that attitude, and because we differ, we are making provision for the preservation of the inherent pride and the inherent values of these people, and that is why we want them to be represented in this council. I wish to hear the voice of the Malays there specifically, and I wish to ensure that I shall hear the voice of the Malays there. I should like to hear the voice of the Griquas <span class="col_4467-4468" refersTo="page_0926"/>in this council specifically, and I should like to ensure that, and I am ensuring that in accordance with the wishes of the existing council, consisting of members originally labelled &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; but who, according to the admission of the United Party to-day, have thought independently in many respects. I admit that I do not always agree with what the council advocates. In respect of this matter there is no difference of opinion between me and the existing council; that is my reply to the hon. member. But in the third place, we wish to make a success of this council, and for that very reason we wish to constitute it in this way. I have given my reasons to the hon. member for Outeniqua, and I think if he wants to be honest he will admit that there are people who will not be prepared to participate in the ordinary political fight, and they are valuable people. If I had no sense of responsibility I should have liked to mention the names of those people here, but I am not going to mention their names. I am not going to bandy about in advance the names of those people here and so give the United Party an opportunity to drag them about and kick them about here. But there are Coloureds for whom I have the greatest regard, people who culturally are doing much for their own people, people who are doing much for their own people in respect of welfare; people who as medical doctors go out of their way to serve their own people; there are people here who are taking the lead in the business world of the Coloured people, and I desire the certainty that the voices of some of those people will be heard in this council, for I know they will not take their seats in this council merely to echo the opinions of voters; they will take their seats in this council really to serve the interests of their people on the merits of matters. Sir, I meet many of these people, and it is a strange thing to me that when we meet at the conference table, and discuss the merits of the difficulties and problems of the Coloured people, these people are prepared to make analyses which, if they were to do so on the political platform, would render it impossible for them to win an election. Nevertheless they remain the responsible people in their people&#x2019;s lives. That is why, in spite of the fact that all the members of this House are elected members, we have various councils to which our most prominent people in our economic life and in other spheres are appointed, because we need their advice and because we need their guidance and because this House cannot always provide the necessary guidance in respect of all our problems. Hours are wasted here on the kind of debate we have had here this morning. That is why we ourselves sometimes make a mockery of ourselves, and that is why we have to fall back upon leaders outside in order to consider matters on their merits. That applies also in the life of the Coloureds. What I envisage in this council now, is that I shall ensure that those responsible people, who are unwilling to lend themselves to dancing about politically, but who nevertheless are prepared to give advice on the true interests of the Coloured people, will become members of this council. If it were true that I desire to control the council through stooges, surely I would have made provision for a majority of nominated members, but I am making provision for a minority, am I not&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Now at this stage the hon. the Minister is starting to complicate this issue more than ever. The Minister stands up and says he could have appointed a majority of nominated people to this council. Of course he could have, Sir. I am not questioning that. But why did he not&#x003F; Because this council is being established in this Bill in this form because of undertakings given to the Coloured people by the hon. the Prime Minister. This Bill is primarily designed to implement that undertaking. Had the Minister nominated the majority he would, of course, not have implemented that promise. He would have made it so obvious that the idea was not to fulfil the Prime Minister&#x2019;s undertaking that the thing could not possibly have succeeded. What has he done&#x003F; He has designed the ratio of elected to nominated members in such a way that it will give to this council exactly what the hon. the Minister wants to give to it. That is why we have this ratio of 30 to 16. That is the answer, Sir, you can read it right through the Bill. The hon. the Minister has seen the amendments we have on the Order Paper, amendments which, had they been adopted in the drafting of this Bill, would have made nomination unnecessary.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that after the members have been elected he may find that various aspects of Coloured interests are not represented. He knows how to overcome that. Had he widened the election basis of these elected members to a republican basis instead of confining it entirely to a provincial basis, he could have had all the interests of the Coloured people represented. Then he says there is the question of the Malays who because of their approach, etc., and religion do not like participating in politics. If they do not like participating in politics what assurance has the Minister that they will accept nomination on a political body&#x003F; If that argument of the Minister&#x2019;s is correct that they will accept nomination, as he is assuming they will, then surely they will also be prepared to fight an election for the purpose of representing their people on this council. I do not think that is an argument at all. But why does the Government adopt this attitude towards those people&#x2019;s feelings and religious reactions to politics&#x003F; On the basis of the Minister&#x2019;s argument, in formulating the policy for electing members to this hon. House, one would have had to take into account the various religious groups in our country, but this Parliament rightly does not. The country is divided into constituencies which represent the interests of all the people in those constituencies irrespective of their religious feelings or anything else. You have the position where people are called up to serve their time in the Army.</p>

<p>I am just dealing with the argument of the Minister, Sir, that he is suddenly prepared to take the religious feelings of those people into account. That argument does not hold water at all. Because, when it comes to the Indian group, for example, because of certain aspects of their religion, this Government introduced legislation to bring those into line with the practices of the rest of the community of South Africa. Yet, at this late stage of the debate on this clause, the Minister brings in all these various aspects.</p>

<p>Sir, there is a solution to all these problems. If this hon. Minister sincerely wants to give these people what he purports to be giving them, if he wants to give them a truly representative council, he knows as well as we do that that council can only be elected. He knows that he must remove from that council all suspicion of interference by the Minister, by his party or any other party. Those people must of their own accord choose their own people.</p>

The hon. member for Bezuidenhout accused the hon. the Minister of being afraid of his own creation and said that for that reason he did not want to nominate its members. If the hon. member has a young baby and he takes that baby by the hand every time it tries to walk, does that mean that he is afraid of that child&#x003F; Or does he want to assist the child to become a mature adult and not come to any harm in the process&#x003F; That is precisely what we are doing here.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when business was suspended I was explaining that the United Party have indicated to us through the medium of their own members that they are not in earnest with the amendment that they have moved. They accuse this side of the House, and particularly the hon. the Minister, of not trusting the Coloureds because of the provisions of Clause 1. The hon. the Minister has clearly stated that the present council itself asked that the members should be nominated. They asked for this provision themselves and now the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the previous speaker do not want the Coloureds themselves to have any choice in connection with the composition of this council. They want to make the choice for the Coloureds. How is it that they know the requirement of the Coloureds better than the Coloureds do themselves&#x003F; Here we have proof that the Coloureds themselves asked that the members on the council should be nominated because they know what will happen if all of those members are elected members. They want to have a conservative element there. There are responsible Coloured people who know precisely what is going to happen. It appears as though the Coloureds on the present council know the history in this regard far better than hon. members opposite do. On the one hand they do not want the Coloureds to ask for nominated members but on the other hand the hon. member for Bezuidenhout wants the proposed council to nominate Coloureds. On the one hand they do not trust the Coloureds but on the other hand they do trust them. In asking that the council should be able to nominate people &#x2026;</p>

<p>It is not only here in South Africa that the principle of the nomination of members is applied in the process of evolution.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>It was a failure in the countries in which they gave independence to undeveloped people too soon. We know that. They realize that themselves; they say that they gave these people their independence too soon. Chaos has resulted in countries in which independence has been granted too soon&#x2014;for example, in the Congo. We also have the example of Kenya. As long as the nominated officials were there, they were able to lead the people in the right direction. History has proved that in the nomination of members&#x2014;and not only members but also officials&#x2014;those people who have been nominated have been able to lead the country in the right direction. The hon. the Minister is not nominating officials; he is not nominating Whites; he is nominating Coloureds of a high standard. What is wrong with that&#x003F; There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Those people are held in very high esteem by their own people. The Coloureds prefer these members to be nominated. Mr. Chairman, I am sure that you will agree that we must carry out the wishes and the desires of the Coloureds. In this case the Coloureds have asked the hon. the Minister to nominate members and not to allow all the members to be elected members, but the United Party say that this is wrong. How is one to reconcile their arguments&#x003F; It is absolutely impossible to do so. On the one hand they say that the wishes of the Coloured people must be given effect to and on the other hand they do not want to give effect to the wishes and desires of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I feel that I must reply to a very reprehensible and contemptible insinuation that was made here to-day against certain hon. Ministers. I refer to the statement of the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). I am sorry that he is not here now. He insinuated that because the hon. the Minister of Labour&#x2014;and in his arrogance he also included the hon. the Minister of Information&#x2014;was nominated and because the hon. the Minister of Information was appointed only in order to impress the English-speaking people, they dare not give their opinion of the provisions of this clause. I say that that is a shameful and mean accusation.</p>

He is their Member of Parliament, elected for that constituency, and they are his electors. I challenge him to tell this House that he has consulted those Coloureds in any shape or form, directly or indirectly. That is the hon. member who comes from Natal whose Coloured voters have been disenfranchised for ever in this House, who have been prevented, except those already on the Voters&#x2019; Roll, from coming onto either roll, and some of those remnants are still on the Voters&#x2019; Roll in the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency.</p>

<p>There are seven remaining on that Voters&#x2019; Roll. [Laughter.] Hon. members laugh. They laugh because they have got a guilty conscience about what they have done to the Coloureds in Natal, and this hon. member now wishes to come and dictate to South Africa on this clause as to how this new council should be constituted. He has not consulted his own voters and he has lifted not one little finger to do anything for the Coloureds of Natal in regard to their political representation. In fact he has gone against the interests of the Coloureds in Natal, but he has the temerity to claim that they are now doing something in the interest of the Coloureds, when he is jointly responsible for the evil that has been already done to them.</p>

<p>I want to return to the hon. the Minister. The hon. Minister has found himself on the horns of a dilemma. He is faced in this clause with reconciling the promise which was made to the Coloureds by the Prime Minister, and in creating the impression that he is keeping that promise in full, he is now creating a body on which he himself has the right to select nearly one-third of the members. That dilemma led the hon. Minister to make an incredible statement here this morning which cannot pass unchallenged. That statement was that he wanted nominated members because they would not be responsible to an electorate, and therefore would not consider matters, as he put it, &#x201C;hulle sal nie kyk na die stemme as hulle sake behandel nie&#x201D;. He stated by implication that those members who are elected to this council will not be capable of dealing fairly and in an unbiased manner with the issues before them on their merits. He <span class="col_4475-4476" refersTo="page_0930"/>says that those nominated will not be responsible to voters and therefore can deal with matters on their merits. If that is so, then the Minister clearly implies that a person who is elected does not deal with matters on their merits. As he has no confidence in the Coloureds who are to be elected, and as he implies that they are not going to deal with matters on their merits, why then have them elected at all&#x003F; Does he imply that this House, everyone of whose members is responsible to an electorate, is not capable of dealing with matters on their merits&#x003F; Because that is the implication of his statement, that if you are responsible to voters you are then going to look at everything purely in the light of the effect it will have on your voters. He is telling his own supporters, and this side of the House, that they are not capable of dealing with any matter on its merits. We take the strongest exception to that. It is obviously true of many of his own members. They are not interested in the merits of the case, but they are interested in the effect of their actions on the electorate, not on the effect it will have on South Africa. That is why the hon. Minister takes up this attitude. He is so used to his own supporters being blind to the welfare of the country, and alive only to the electorate that he believes the Coloureds will be the same. We have more confidence in the Coloureds and their ability to give a clear and unbiased judgment on issues placed before them. We have that confidence which the Minister lacks because of the experience he has had on his own side.</p>

<p>There is one other matter which he raised that cannot pass unchallenged. The Minister said here deliberately that the policy of the United Party was to destroy groups, firstly amongst the Coloureds, so that they could be absorbed into the White community, &#x201C;in een mengelmoes&#x201D;, and then that &#x201C;mengelmoes&#x201D; community absorbed into a greater Black &#x201C;mengelmoes&#x201D;. That is untrue and false and the Minister ought to know that that is false if he is a student of politics. I say here on behalf of this party that that was a false statement, untrue in every respect. That is not the policy of this side of the House. This side of the House stands clearly for social and residential separation in accordance with the traditions of South Africa. We have always done so, and we maintained that tradition without the trappings of law which that side found necessary in order to maintain it. We as a Government maintained those traditions without legislation.</p>

The Minister is indicating now exactly what we alleged and what the hon. Minister originally denied. He is indicating that this is not going to be a legislative body. It is going to be purely an advisory body. Obviously. Because if the hon. Minister cannot trust elected members, and elected members are to form the majority then obviously he cannot entrust them with legislation or with powers. In other words they are to be the trappings, the trimmings, they are going to be the icing which is going to be put over the real people to whom he is going to listen, namely the nominated people. The hon. Minister gave examples of those nominated people. He spoke of educationists. His own Department has made it impossible for an educationist to be elected to this body.

<p>No, this is what happens when you get into a corner. The hon. Minister is in a corner. In trying to defend his Bill, he has been forced to make statements which more and more, as they get wilder and wilder, give away the weaknesses which are in this measure and the weakness which is in this clause particularly. The Minister mentioned educationists as persons who could not be elected and whom he might want to consult. Now he tries to wriggle out of it and he talks about retired teachers. Retired because they took part in politics&#x003F; The hon. Minister has tried to prevent many of the natural leaders of the Coloured community from expressing views on behalf of their people, and now he is using the elected members to give a facade of legitimacy to the council which is going to be constituted.

<p>The blood pressure of the hon. member who has just sat down rose quite a few points in his efforts to put certain words into the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mouth and <span class="col_4477-4478" refersTo="page_0931"/>I just want to discuss a few of the incorrect statements he made. In the first place, he asked the hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) whether the hon. member had consulted his Coloured voters in Vryheid. But the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) also has Coloured voters in his constituency and I want to tell him that he did not consult his Coloured voters. I also want to put a question to him: Is it his policy to consult his voters first in regard to every aspect of proposed legislation, to consult every group of his voters in regard to all legislation that is introduced into this House&#x003F; Or do his voters have sufficient confidence in him to leave matters to his discretion&#x003F; I do not think that the statement made by the hon. member holds water. But when the hon. member became so heated about this matter and said that the hon. the Minister had made a statement here which was wrong, and, what was more, that the hon. the Minister knew that it was wrong, he was putting words into the mouth of the hon. the Minister which he had not used. In his argument the hon. the Minister told us that in certain cases the nominated members would be able to adopt a more independent attitude or express more independent ideas in regard to certain subjects because they would not be responsible for any electorate. Does the hon. member doubt that&#x003F; Will he say that there are no such cases&#x003F; I know of many occasions on which that hon. member has voted with the United Party but on which I could have sworn that he did not hold the same view as they did. He is aware of that fact. No, the hon. the Minister did not say what the hon. member tried to make us believe he had said, and I do not think that it behoves the hon. member to put words into the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mouth this way. He made another statement that I want to deal with. He said that the Coloured Persons Education Act forbids Coloured teachers to participate in politics and he asked how the hon. the Minister was going to be able to nominate educationists to the council when teachers were not permitted to participate in politics. I want to ask the hon. member how many ex-teachers there are in this House and how many there are in the provincial councils. I want the hon. member to mention to me one provincial councillor or one Member of Parliament or one Senator who is still teaching to-day. The hon. member should not be so childish and petty in his arguments. We know that he must oppose this legislation and that he must spend as much time on Clause 1 as possible but then he should at least advance better arguments. The hon. member has told us once again that the powers of this Coloured council will be advisory powers only. Has he not read this Bill&#x003F; Has he not read the provisions of this Bill which set out the powers of the council&#x003F; The hon. member for Durban (Point) has been trying to lay a smoke-screen here but I am afraid that he has not been successful. We on this side believe that it is necessary, initially at least, to nominate certain of the members of that council, particularly as it is to be a new Coloured council. The elected members are going to be called upon to fight an election. They are going to have to stand for election even though they have had no previous experience in this regard. It will be the task of the hon. the Minister to try to obtain the services of people who have already shown that their services on the council are necessary in the interests of the Coloureds themselves. Therefore, the hon. the Minister must have the power to be able to nominate one-third of those members.</p>

<p>Well, the second reason given was that the Coloured people had not yet reached that political maturity that is necessary. But I want to show that in this clause the Minister does not give representation to these people on that basis. The Minister does not admit that they are not mature politically. Because here he gives one nominated member to Natal, one for the Free State, and the balance in the Free State will be elected. Now if these people are not mature, why must there be one nominated member from the Free State&#x003F; For what purpose&#x003F; One will be nominated in respect of Natal, the rest will be elected. What is the purpose of this one man&#x003F; Why is it necessary to have this one man in the Free State and one in Natal&#x003F; In the Free State there are some25,000 Coloureds and in the Transvaal 100,000, Will the Minister tell me that those 100,000 people in the Transvaal are not capable of electing their own people&#x003F; The Minister says: I will nominate two people.

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, Mr. Chairman, Clause 1 says that 16 members will be nominated, and I am trying to indicate that <span class="col_4479-4480" refersTo="page_0932"/>it is not necessary to nominate anybody. The only possible loophole that the Minister may have is that by mischance&#x2014;I do not agree with him&#x2014;the Griquas may not be able to have a representative on this council if there is an open election, or there may not be a representative of the Malay community. I do not agree with the hon. Minister, but he may have a case when he says that he wants to see that those groups are represented in this council. But according to the Minister there can only be two Malays and two Griquas for sure. But why then have nominated people for the rest when the whole area will be divided up in constituencies and they will have an opportunity to elect people to the council in accordance with their numbers&#x003F; What is the purpose of this one man going to be in relation to the elected members&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, you have ruled me out of order, but I want to show that the process of nomination was first mooted in the Act of 1951, 13 years ago, and one can understand the reason for nomination in that case. In accordance with Section 14 of the Act of 1951, there were to be nominated non-European members. I can understand that as the Coloured people of the Transvaal, the Free State and Natal could not have any elected members, their interests should be represented and the only way was by way of nomination. That I can understand. That is reasonable and is logical. But that reason does not exist anymore to-day. Whereas in 1951 the only way to get them on the council was by way of nomination, that does no longer apply to-day because they are now going to have the right to vote on a Roll and to elect people. Therefore the interests of the Coloured people will be advanced by the elected members, and the original reason for nomination has fallen away. Then in 1956, the original Act was amended and the number of members was increased, and four members were to represent the Province of the Transvaal. To-day, there will only be two nominated members in respect of the Transvaal. In other words, the hon. Minister now admits that it is not necessary to nominate so many for the Transvaal because the elected members are going to be there. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>If that argument is out of order then I want to point out that the argument of the Opposition that the Coloureds already have a very long history of constitutional development behind them and that as a result of this fact they have reached a stage where they now want full rights, is not quite correct. I want to say that the qualified vote of the Coloureds does have a long history and background behind it. But they will now be given an unqualified vote for the first time and that unqualified Coloured vote does not have a long history of development behind it. It is a completely new thing. Because the unqualified Coloured vote is now to be made general for the first time, I say that the Coloured people must go through the same procedure which we had to go through right from the start up to the present stage. They must go through those various stages as well. It need not take so very long and that is why this provision is not at all in conflict with the undertaking of the hon. the Prime Minister. As I have already said, the Coloureds with their unqualified vote will have to go through the period of development which we had to go through from 1825 to 1872, but it need not take so much time. In any case, it can be dealt with as it was dealt with in the Transvaal. Where a start was made in a small way in the Cape with a legislative council in 1834, precisely the same thing was applied to the Transvaal in 1902 when they had 12 nominated members. There were 6 officials and 6 members on the council, all nominated members, and in 1902 that council had control over the Transvaal and the Free State although it was a brand new body. From 1902 they went through a number of stages until 1907 when they were given responsible self-government and were able to join the Union in 1910. This need not be a protracted process. This qualified Coloured vote system will start now, in 1964. We have here the first constitutional development in this regard. They are starting where the Whites started in 1834. I say that things can develop at a very swift pace and, as things are at present, this Coloured council will be able to make fairly swift progress in its efforts to attain its eventual status. But, and this is the argument that I want to add, in any council, in the initial stages of any constitutional development we always have nominated members and elected members. That is a principle which one finds throughout.</p>

<p>I would like to reply to the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). I am sorry he is not here. He is one of the members of this House who rather prides himself upon making slick debating points in this Chamber, but I thought he made a very poor one this morning with specific <span class="col_4481-4482" refersTo="page_0933"/>reference to this clause.

Because of course the absurdity of his comment is just this, that the purpose of this council, in terms of the Minister&#x2019;s own second-reading speech, is to form the basis of the Coloured parliament which was promised to the Coloured people by the Prime Minister in 1961, and if the hon. member for Vereeniging or anyone else can tell me that there is any Parliament, any House of Assembly in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the world which has nomiated members I shall be surprised.</p>

<p>There is no unanimity on the Government side about this matter. The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) said the other day that the Coloured people in the Transvaal were far more qualified to manage their own affairs than any other group of Coloureds in the country, so it is no good the hon. members telling us we must have nominated members because the Coloured people in the different provinces are not competent, as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) said earlier. The hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) spoke about the danger of letting agitators into this council, and that was one of his arguments in favour of having a percentage of the members nominated, but of course all that is is a confession of fear and failure.</p>

<p>I should like to remind hon. members that where this question of the capability of the Coloureds is concerned, 90 per cent of the Coloureds live in the Cape Province, and for many years there have been more Coloured children than White children at school in the Cape. Therefore there is a large percentage of extremely able and civilized Coloured people in this province and many others who are quite competent to run this council.</p>

<p>I want to deal with only one other issue. The Minister, in his reply just before lunch, made the specific statement that our only object in opposing this Bill was that we deliberately wished to sow suspicion amongst the Coloured people. We refute that statement. In the first place, the Minister should know that in this day and age, when things are developing in the political field as they are, to suggest that for us in the Opposition to advocate a better deal for the non-Whites is in fact an attempt to stir up trouble is nonsense. It seems to me that his argument demonstrates the poverty of his case because I should like to know why the Minister saw fit this morning to adopt the attitude he did. Why can he not argue this matter on its merits&#x003F; Why was it necessary for the Minister to say something very significant to me&#x003F; He said that we view with suspicion everything that the Nationalist Party has done in the field of race relations, and I asked whether he was surprised.</p>

My experience is that if we act in such a way that we cast suspicion on measures that have to be taken, we arouse suspicion in the minds of the Coloureds not against the Government but against the White man.

<p>The hon. the Minister has said that it is nothing unusual for provision to be made for nominated members. I agree. We also know that until 1948 South-West Africa also had nominated members. But my attitude in regard to this clause is that I am fully aware of the fact that if the hon. the Minister accepts the amendment whereby all the members of the council will be elected, he will inspire a degree of confidence which has never existed before in the history in this country and which we have never before had an opportunity of inspiring. The suspicion that there was against the Coloured council in the past and the suspicion that exists to-day against the proposed council exists because of the fact that the members will be nominated. Unfortunately, I have to point out to the hon. the Minister, with great respect, that in my opinion he made a great mistake in mentioning the case this morning of the minority who may support the Government and to whom he wants to give representation on the Council through the medium of nominated members.</p>

<p>I cannot remember the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s exact words but that was the impression that I gained. Indeed, the argument was repeated and the hon. the Minister did not deny it. That is what upset me, but I do not consider my personal feelings; I think of what the effect of such a statement may be on the people who must have confidence in this council. [Interjections.] I was under the impression that the hon. the Minister mentioned a minority group which would not have representation. [Interjections.] Hon. members on both sides of the House have spoken about consultation with the Coloureds. During my second-reading speech I said that there was no satisfactory method of consultation. I regard this council, an elected council, as a body which can be consulted. This is our opportunity. As long as its members are nominated, this council does not have the character that I should like to see. I accept the arguments of the hon. the Minister. I know the circumstances of the people whom I represent and I respect his argument because I know that it is true that there will be people who will be an asset to this council but who, as a result of circumstances, do not want to fight an election. I would like to see such people on the council, but if we want to be consistent, then the same thing applies to this House. I think of a person like Dr. Tienie Louw who would be an asset to this House, but if he were to become a member, our economic development in which he has played a role would suffer. As I say, I accept what the hon. the Minister has said and that he is honest in saying that he wants these people on that council, but on the other hand, I am faced with this problem: I want the Coloured people to have the necessary respect for and confidence in this council. They have already been lied to and tricked &#x2026; [Interjections.] By whom does not concern me. It is a case of the pot calling the kettle black but both are equally black. Here we have a golden opportunity not only to inspire confidence in and to promote respect for the council and to do away with the belittling remarks of the past, but to prove that this is a truly democratic body on which people can give expression to their political feelings, air their grievances or lend their support, as the case may be, and at the same time set up a body for the first time in the history of South Africa which one can consult. But it will not retain that characteristic as long as its members are nominated.</p>

<p>I want to repeat another point to which the hon. the Minister replied when he spoke about the sub-groups, the Malays and the Griquas. The hon. the Minister asked whether I knew about the Griouas who wanted their own residential area. That is, of course, impossible. But there is another sub-group, the Basters of Upington who, under their leader Piet Darries, want the whole of the Gordonia area because they say they inherited it from their forefathers. We know that it is impossible to give it to them. Are we also going to establish a Baster sub-group and give them representation on the council&#x003F; It is all very well to say that the Malays asked for a Malay qualification. The Basters also think the same way. But I want to point out to the hon. the Minister, and I hope he will give his attention to it, that my colleagues and I find ourselves in a difficult position because we also represent the Indians. The Malays are Moslems. After all, we do not have a classification for the Jewish religion. But we have this position as a result of this sub-classification; I had people in my office this morning, people from Bonteheuwel, who complained about the Indians who are classified as Coloureds and who own the businesses at Bonteheuwel. With all these trivial things we only create an opening for more problems and grievances. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister not to sub-divide the Coloured group further by making provision for a Malay representative and a Griqua representative. These people are Coloureds and their religion has nothing to do with the matter.</p>

<p>I rise to correct a misunderstanding that has arisen. The hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) is under the impression that the hon. the Minister said this morning that it was necessary to have a number of nominated members because there may be a minority group of Coloureds who support <span class="col_4485-4486" refersTo="page_0935"/>the Government and who have no representation. [Interjection.] The hon. the Minister said very clearly that because there are various groups of Coloureds, there may be a minority group who do not have sufficient numbers to enable them to elect one of their people to serve on this council. He said that since he would like those minority groups to be represented on the council, he wanted, by means of this clause, to enable those minority groups to be represented on the council through the medium of a nominated member. That was the argument of the hon. the Minister. There was no mention of a minority group which support the Government.</p>

An hon. member opposite carried the argument even further and I then said: &#x201C;If the argument of the hon. member who has just sat down in regard to the representation of minority groups is to be accepted, then I hope he will suggest that legislation be introduced to give the United Party in the Free State a few nominated members on the provincial council.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I was under the impression that the hon. the Minister had said that there were minority groups which supported the Government and which could be given representation in this way. Immediately I felt that that was the most fatal argument that he could use. We will see what the hon. the Minister had to say from the Hansard report of his speech. Because I was under that impression, I adopted the attitude that it was wrong on the part of the hon. the Minister to use those words and that by doing so he was aggravating the position. I want to see the clause amended in such a way that a council about which there can be no suspicion can be constituted. In any case, I do not accept that council as a permanent body. I am prepared to go along with it as a first step but then it must be a council in which the Coloured people have confidence. It will be of great assistance if a time limit can be fixed and if the hon. the Minister will even go so far as to say that provisionally, for the first five years, the council will consist of a certain number of nominated members but that when the next council is elected, it will be a council consisting of elected members only. If the hon. the Minister is prepared to make provision for this, then I shall support the clause. But as things stand now, I must accept that this is a permanent body and in my view it will not be a representative body worthy of any attention. [Interjections.] The United Party want to consult with the Coloureds, but so far that consultation has been a farce. Can I tell the United Party to consult with the Coloured council while 16 members of the council are nominated members&#x003F; I cannot do so.</p>

<p>I shall reply to the hon. the Minister. Fortein consulted his people in Griqualand East before he accepted the nomination and he is absolutely convinced that he represents the Coloured people. As far as outsiders are concerned, however, he does not represent the Coloureds; he represents the Minister who appointed him. Is the hon. the Minister aware of the fact that a member of the Coloured council stood up when this Bill was under discussion there and moved that the whole council should consist of nominated members&#x003F; I refer to a certain M r. Langenhoven who is an elected member, but he probably made this suggestion because he was afraid that he would not be reelected. So there is also a counter-argument to the argument of the hon. the Minister. I am being sincere and honest when I say that a body must be established as soon as possible&#x2014;and here we have the opportunity&#x2014; which cannot be said to have any ulterior motives. It must be representative of the Coloureds. If we have such a free elected body both the Opposition and the Government will be in a position to say: &#x201C;We have a body here which represents Coloured opinion and we can therefore consult it.&#x201D; That is what I am striving for. I also want to correct the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) who said that a Coloured teacher could not become a member of this council. He can. The only point is that he may not be a member of a political party. I repeat that all I am concerned about in this matter is the establishment of a fully representative council, where it will not be possible to accuse some of the members of being nominated members. It must be a body which both the Government and the Opposition can consult.</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Botha states that the Coloured community is strongly divided into smaller groups such as the Cape Coloureds, the Malays and the Griquas. This statement is patently incorrect. A walk through District Six, for example, would convince Mr. Botha of this. There has been so much social, economic and cultural integration that it is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between the various groups, and any cross-section of the numerous housing projects will prove this point.</block>

<p>As an old Capetonian, I can support this. If the Minister goes through any of the municipal housing schemes he will see that it is almost impossible to differentiate between these groups, and I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.</p>

<p>Now I want to go on to another aspect of Clause 1, which is germane to the discussion. In support of the plea made by this side of the House to have an elected representative council, I want to quote a statement made by the Prime Minister in this regard, and I refer again to the statement made by the Prime Minister when he addressed the present council in December 1961. He spoke, firstly, of the work the council had done, that they had been established as an advisory body, and then he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be developed into a more representative union control board, actually as a Coloured parliament which must control all Coloured interests in the country, with administrative and legislative powers and officials to carry out its decisions.</block>

We are now asking the Minister to give effect to the promise the Prime Minister made to the Coloureds, to have a representative parliament which would represent the entire community.

<p>A more representative body.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>That is all we ask for, and it can only be more representative by having the people elected. Who has ever heard of a parliament nominated by the Government&#x003F; The Government has introduced this Bill. They find themselves in this unfortunate position that they are introducing this sectional system of legislature. No one has asked them for it. They have decided to inflict upon this country a sectional form of legislature, and the Prime Minister said it would be a Coloured parliament; no argument that the Minister has advanced up to now has convinced us that this body should not be fully representative and a truly elected body.</p>

<p>Now I want to go on to another aspect of the matter. It is quite obvious from the attitude of the Minister that he is not prepared to accede to the pleas to have a truly elected body. In that case I propose to try and see whether I can make the ratio between the nominated members and the elected members more realistic. By means of the amendment I will move presently, I want to try to see to it that we have a much larger number of elected members as compared with the 16 nominated members. Sir, I have on the Order Paper an amendment to the effect that the 30 elected members should be increased to 40. I understand there is a possibility of that amendment being considered out of order by reason of the fact that an acceptance of the amendment may involve an increase of expenditure not envisaged in this Bill. May I, with your permission, just briefly address you on that aspect of the matter&#x003F; I understand that the objection to this amendment is possibly based on the fact that in terms of Clause 22 of this Bill the moneys required for the exercise of the powers and the performance of the functions and duties of the council shall be made available annually out of moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purpose, and it might be contended that an increase in the number of elected members from 30 to 40 would increase that amount. In support of my argument that the amendment is not in conflict with the provisions of this Bill and that it will not involve additional expenditure, I would like to draw your attention, Sir, to the provisions of Clause 19 (1) which merely says that the members of the council shall receive such allowances as the State President may determine. All that would happen, as I see it, is that the State President, in other words the Minister, would say: &#x201C;We are prepared to set aside R10,000 for the allowance of members elected or nominated to this council,&#x201D; and all that would happen is that that R10,000 would be divided either between 46 members, the number provided for in this Bill, or 56 members if this amendment is accepted. I submit to you, Sir, that this amendment is in no way in conflict with the rule that no amendment can be introduced which has the effect of increasing the capital expenditure under any Bill. I do urge upon you, Sir, that there is substance in the point I make. As I have said, no amount is specified in Clause 19; it merely <span class="col_4489-4490" refersTo="page_0937"/>says that members of the council shall receive such amounts as the State President may determine. Then again no amount is specified in Clause 22, so whatever globular amount is set aside by way of salaries will be divided between 56 members instead of 46 if this amendment is accepted. I therefore move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 9, to omit &#x201C;thirty&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;forty&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of this will be to bring about a more realistic ratio between the elected and the nominated members. Up to the present moment the hon. the Minister has not advanced any good and sufficient reason as to why we should have 16 nominated members and only 30 elected members. Sir, I plead with the hon. the Minister to give at least some semblence of truth to the assertion made by the hon. the Prime Minister himself when he envisaged a Coloured parliament which would control the interests of the Coloured people in this country, and held out the prospect that it would be a more representative body than the present Union Council for Coloured Affairs. I think it would be a much more representative council if the hon. the Minister would agree to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, but if he is not prepared to do that, let him at least show the Coloured people that he is prepared to give them a bigger say in their own affairs by allowing the number of elected members to be increased from 30 to 40. This is not asking too much, Sir. It is not too much to ask that a body controlling the affairs of 1,500,000 citizens of this country should consist of 56 members, and I would plead with the hon. the Minister at least to agree to this small improvement.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has just alleged that this Bill is not in conformity with the promise which the hon. the Prime Minister made in connection with this matter. Let me quote the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s precise words to him. Referring to the Advisory Council he used these words (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be developed into a more representative Union Control Council&#x2014;a Coloured Parliament as it were.</block>

<p>He did not use the word &#x201C;converted&#x201D;. He stated very clearly that it should be &#x201C;developed&#x201D;. Does the hon. member know what &#x201C;develop&#x201D; means&#x003F; Development is something which has more than one phase. Why is the hon. member so concerned about the fact that we are not immediately converting the existing council into a parliament, as he sees it&#x003F; A development process is being put into operation here and the hon. the Minister is giving full effect to the promise of the hon. the Prime Minister. If we had set up a council of this kind in its final form, the hon. member would immediately have objected and would have told us: &#x201C;Here you are establishing something new whereas you told us that you were going to &#x2018;develop&#x2019; something.&#x201D; Sir, that is how we know those hon. members; if we do one thing, they want another thing. I hope I am correctly interpreting what has been said here to-day when I say that those hon. members object to the nominated members on the grounds that they will not be full-fledged members of the council and that the council will therefore not be truly representative of the Coloureds. I want now to put a specific question to the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) and to all the Coloured Representatives here to-day. When we look at all the present representative councils, we find that the chairmen of those councils are all nominated members. Indeed, they are all public servants. I challenge those hon. members to say that those people have not represented the interests of the Coloureds in the past. I can mention certain names here. I challenge the hon. member for Karoo to say that Mr. Cloete, the chairman of Steinkopf, does not represent his people. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that if he makes such a statement across the floor of this House not one of the Coloureds at Steinkopf will ever vote for him again. Mr. Cloete has the confidence of those Coloureds because the hon. the Minister appointed the best man he had in his Department there. Mr. Cloete is the best man for that post; the Coloureds are aware of that fact and yet he is a nominated member; he is an official. I want to mention another example. Would the hon. member say, for example, that Mr. Coetzee of Concordia does not represent his people capably and that he is not dealing with a representative person when he deals with Mr. Coetzee&#x003F; I want to assure the hon. member that his Coloured voters refuse to do anything without the guidance of those officials. Those elected members would never dream of taking a decision without consulting those officials. No, I think hon. members have advanced a stupid argument here and if they continue with this argument then they must tell us clearly that they feel that a person who is nominated cannot represent his own people properly. We must remember that we are dealing here with Coloureds who have not yet had the opportunity of moving around and becoming well known amongst their own people in this large country of ours. There may be two or three extremely competent leaders in a specific area but only one man can be elected. I do not think the voters would elect the worst candidate; we do not want to suggest that for one moment. But there may be two or three extremely competent men in an area, as is the case in the area represented by the hon. member for <span class="col_4491-4492" refersTo="page_0938"/>Karoo. They are first-class men but only one of them can be elected. The hon. the Minister may want one of the two remaining men to become a member of the council too because he feels that it will be in the best interests of those Coloureds. But the United Party are now seeking to tie the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s hands because that man is not yet known; he cannot stand in another constituency as we Whites can because we move around the country and we become known to the people. That man is not known to the voters in another constituency. This Bill now gives the hon. the Minister the opportunity; apart from making use of the services of the other elected and capable man to make use of the services of such a capable man to look after the interests of his own people. If hon. members of the Opposition regard those people as &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; when they are nominated, I should like them to stand up and say it. Those people who have served as nominated members on the council up to the present time will be very grateful to them; I shall also tell the voters in their own constituencies that that is their attitude.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>In answer to the question put by the bon. member who has just sat down, I went to great pains to say that there were no men so far as I was concerned in the Union Council for Coloured Affairs who could be called stooges. I expressly used that expression; I said that these men were criticized by their own people because their own people do not know what goes on in these places. Nobody mentioned the qualifications of Mr. Coetzee or Mr. Cloete. Sir, this is the sort of left-handed argument that we get from hon. members opposite. They postulate a certain question and then ask us to deny it.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet the hon. the Minister made a great point of the fact that there are nominated persons on other councils and on the Union Council for Coloured Affairs. He said that he had consulted with these people. May I just say to him that the fact of the matter is that the Coloured community as a whole&#x2014;I made this qualification as well&#x2014; with few exceptions rejects the sort of council which is being proposed here, and the reason for that is this: The Minister in setting up the Union Council for Coloured Affairs gave a preponderance of nominated members as against elected members. The hon. the Minister knows full well from his experience that the Coloured community have never had any confidence in the activities of the council; they have had great difficulty in finding out what goes on in the council, and they have organizations amongst themselves which have been very critical of the nominated members in the council. Even the elected people have been subjected to criticism for the reason that the Coloured people feel as a group of South Africans that their interests have not been served to the best advantage along these particular lines. The hon. the Minister has now decided to change the composition of the council. I would like to put this question to the hon. the Minister: If the Union Council for Coloured Affairs as an advisory body was satisfactory and if advisory bodies are going to work, why does he change the existing advisory body when a few minor amendments to the original Act would have done the trick&#x003F; The answer to that is surely this &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the nominated members, even in the council set up by the hon. the Minister, have been criticized. It has been suggested here that because we oppose nominated members we have some charge to lay at the door of these people in their personal capacity. That is not true at all. The position is that nominated people are never satisfactory. A nominated person, to whom reference has been made by the hon. the Minister in connection with other boards, is either appointed to a committee or a board to carry out a particular policy or because of special knowledge, or to make recommendations of a particular kind on a particular subject, and in that direction nominees are quite acceptable, but in a body of this kind it is a very different story. The hon. the Minister spoke about Griquas and Malays; I shall deal with that later and explain to him why we on this side of the House think that it is wrong in perpetuating this representation by way of nominees from those particular groups. Sir, many hon. members have spoken here about the effectiveness of nominated men. It is absolutely true that until such time as we make up our minds to make these bodies fully elected bodies we will never gain the confidence of the Coloured community.</p>

<p>I just wanted to emphasize it because it should be repeated very often.

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the arguments are varied and plentiful. The hon. the Minister covered a very wide field, a field which was not dealt with by previous speakers, and I look to your discerning judgment, Sir, to guide me in this matter, because we are dealing here with 1,500,000 people and we want to provide them with something which is acceptable to them. The Coloured community as such do not <span class="col_4493-4494" refersTo="page_0939"/>accept nominated people. I say that as a representative of the Coloured community. The four Coloured Representatives here have advanced every argument that can possibly be advanced to persuade the Minister that the majority party is wrong in assuming that nominated members are acceptable to the Coloured community because they are not, and I do hope that even now the Minister will realize that there will have to be a complete change. Sir, as you so rightly said time is running out. I want to deal with just one aspect of this legislation as it affects the Griquas. I want to confirm that the idea of trying to isolate the Griquas is fallacious. The hon. member for Outiniqua (Mr. Holland) spoke about East Griqualand. I will speak about Griqualand West. I just want to say to the hon. the Minister that when the Group Areas Act was in the course of being implemented an inquiry was made at Kimberley to ascertain the numbers of Griquas in that area. The individual who came to do the inquiry and the investigation had great difficulty in finding Griquas. Since then they have resorted to race classifications. As you know, Sir, in earlier days the Griquas had a privilege which the Bantu did not have; in other words, the Griquas were allowed to purchase liquor, but they live in the Bantu villages in many, many instances and in other instances they lived in Coloured villages, where they could. I want to say to the Minister that it is a mistake to try to identify the Griquas as a group.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Now that it has been established that there shall be nominated members I want to deal with the question of the geographical, the racial and religious allocation of persons who shall be eligible to be nominated. I want to say to the Minister that the Coloured community does not wish to be, and should not be, broken up into minor groups. The hon. Minister has referred to one group, the Griquas, but I do not believe they are as many as we were led to believe. The Griquas, as a group, got special rights many years ago and as the years have gone by those rights have fallen into line and become part and parcel of the Coloured community. I would like to confirm what the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) said in regard to the Griquas, that they are really not a group apart, but that there are people &#x201C;known as Griquas&#x201D; and that there was no special way of identifying them as such except by the cards they carry. In an investigation made at Kimberley, which is a part of the country where the Griqua originated, great difficulty was experienced in the urban area in searching for Griquas; they could not find enough of them to form a group. The reason for that investigation was the allocation of a township to the Griquas. So I can assure the hon. the Minister that the question of Griquas is not acceptable to the Coloured community as such.</p>

<p>When replying to a question under the previous clause the Minister said that the Malay community had requested to be regarded as a separate group. For years the Malay community expressed opinions and wished to be considered, and eventually were successful in being included in the Coloured group. To all intents and purposes and for all practical purposes they are Coloured people. The fact that they are Moslems has nothing whatsoever to do with election to this particular type of council or with nomination to this particular council. I cannot see what the Minister will have to consult the Malays about that he could not consult the elected body about on any of the subjects which may come up before it except on this question of religion. I do not think religion makes an acceptable difference or that there is any advice the Minister might need on Mohammedanism. Be that as it may, there are people in the Upington area who call themselves &#x201C;Basters&#x201D;. They prefer to be referred to &#x201C;as die bruin mense&#x201D;. They will say to you: &#x201C;Ons is nie Kleurlinge nie, meneer, ons is bruin mense.&#x201D; I put it to the Minister that there are other groups as well which could also be regarded as constituting separate groups. There is a group in Namaqualand who call themselves &#x201C;Die Kleurlingvolks-vereniging&#x201D;. They regard themselves as a special group as well although they are Coloured people and regard themselves as such.</p>

<p>Let us examine this break-down of eight in the Cape, two in the Transvaal and one each in the Free State and Natal. The hon. the Minister has said that there are people who could be used. Many persons who are presently serving on the Union Council for Coloured Affairs expect to be the nominated ones when the elections are over which will take place as a result of this Bill. I am extremely doubtful whether the persons who are going to be brought in for purposes of giving advice will be the type to whom the Minister referred, namely, the professional people who do not want to be involved in elections. I can see no reason whatsoever why the number of nominated members should be limited to one in the case of the Free State. How do we know that there are not more than one person there who is competent to give advice and who will be willing to serve on such a board. The Minister says there are many competent ones, but apparently there is only one in the Free State. The same applies to Natal whereas in the Transvaal there will be two. Four will be eliminated in the Cape because two will be Griauas and two Malays, so there will be four in the Cape. It is generally conceded that the number of civilized, advanced people in the Cape Province is high. It seems to me that the Minister is making a mistake in restricting his choice to four and to giving two other groups representation, on the basis of a group in the case of the Griquas, and on the basis of religion in the case of the Malays.</p>

<p>I would say the correct procedure to be followed is to widen the field. I want to tell <span class="col_4499-4500" refersTo="page_0942"/>the hon. the Minister that his choice of members who have been nominated recently has created a considerable amount of dissatisfaction. The people are not worried about the qualifications of the persons who have been nominated but they are critical of the methods of nomination. They want to know who nominated those people. I can speak of experience. When I saw the Commissioner of Coloured Affairs in a certain city I asked him: In appointing this particular group of people for nomination to this board whom did you consult&#x003F; He was unwilling to tell me. I do not wish to pursue the matter in detail but that is the difficulty with all these nominees. Who nominates these people for election by the Minister&#x003F; What happens is this: Wherever nominees are called for by Ministers or by Administrators from authorities who are requested to make such nominations they are invariably asked to submit two or three names. These are usually well-known people and it is left to the Minister to make a choice. In this clause we just have a bald statement that there will be so many from each province. In view of the statements made by Government speakers yesterday that the idea is to get the best Coloured people, I submit there should not be any geographical boundaries or any restrictions on the choice of persons. I take it that the Minister will lay down by regulation how these nominees are to be selected, such as who is to recommend them before the final choice is made and as to whom these people shall be and in what capacity they shall serve. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>In connection with the problems raised by the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden), I should like to say to him, in the first place, that at the present time the Coloured Council, whether or not it is effective, is the one mouthpiece consisting of Coloureds, and I consulted them. They came along with this proposal. I did not at any time dictate to the Council that it should be done in this manner. This proposal emanated from the council itself. I am now doing what is the result of consultation with this council, and the hon. member says it is wrong. The second reply I wish to give him is that the Malays and the Griquas made strong representations to the Government in the past already to be identified as Malays and Griquas.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I may tell the hon. member there have also been strong representations from the Bastards in this connection. In other words, these people wish to be recognized as such. The Malays and the Griquas possess certain traditional characteristics that are peculiar to them, apart from the fact that they are prepared to form a part of the Coloured group. We feel that by recognizing this, we are stimulating their pride to some extent. The Malays have certain customs; they have a certain way of life which differs in many respects from that of their fellow Coloured people. It is a good thing they have that. We even went so far as to proclaim their own group area for the Malays, namely Schotsche Kloof. Schotsche Kloof has a long tradition behind it; there are certain buildings we wish to preserve; there is a certain culture there we wish to preserve because we believe that the development of that will benefit the whole country. So there are things which are peculiar to the Malays. There are things which are peculiar to the Griquas. These people want it like that. In the present council there is a Malay representative and a Griqua representative who, according to them, is a descendant of their Chief. Knowing these two members are there, the present council had regard to that fact, and saw to it that they received protection. I am told all day long I should have regard to the sentiments of the people, but when we do so, when we act on their request, where we have regard to even small communities, hon. members come along and say: Wipe this out, and wipe that out with one stroke of the pen; your Malays must be Coloureds. Is that what a Coloured representative should be urging here now&#x003F;</p>

<p>Of course he did. What did he say then&#x003F; Can the hon. member for Karoo see now what happens when we merely make political statements&#x003F; These people have their idiosyncrasies and let us take that into account. I believe we shall give satisfaction by doing so. I hope that the things that are fine in the life of the Malays and that the things that are fine in the life of the Griquas will, through the voices of their representatives in this Council, continually be brought to the notice of the authorities and will continually be advocated in this council, for it is only when you enable these people to plead for these things in their Council, and to ask for the protection thereof, that you will not only give satisfaction to those groups, but will afford them an opportunity to contribute to the diversity of riches in South Africa. I am not prepared summarily to wipe out these people. If it appears in the future that the Malays have changed their minds&#x2014; they are a decreasing group; we know they are being assimilated&#x2014;there will always be time to change the position. But at this stage I most certainly am not prepared to accede to these pleas and I shall stand by the clause as printed.</p>

<p>It is in this regard that I object to this Malay-Griqua classification. The hon. the Minister has the power to appoint members; he has said that he will consider these matters and I am pleased to hear it. As far as I am concerned&#x2014;I do not know the views of the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) in this regard because they are his voters&#x2014;the Basters are a group living more in the past than in the present or in the future; they say that the whole area of Gordonia must become Baster territory and so forth, which I know is impossible, but they have certain aims and they adopt a certain attitude in this regard. We are now going to have a Coloured council and the hon. the Minister is going to give them representation on that council. But it would be silly to expect the hon. the Minister to give representation to every group. We admit that there are many sub-groups amongst the Coloureds. The outlook of the Coloureds in Namaqualand is completely different to that, for example, of the Coloureds in the northern parts of my constituency. It would be silly to expect the hon. the Minister to have to give representation to every sub-group of the Coloureds on this council.</p>

<p>I cannot agree in principle that the Coloured groups should be sub-divided. That sub-division is absolutely unnecessary at this stage. I can tell the hon. the Minister that even as long as 62 years ago that sub-division was unnecessary. The greatest leader whom the Coloureds have ever had in this country, the only leader who was ever able to weld the Coloured group together and under whose leadership the Coloureds reached a peak, was a Moslem, Dr. Abdurahman. The Coloureds had no objection to him as their leader. Indeed, they had such a high regard for him that in the Cape, where the vast majority of his voters were Coloured voters and not Moslems, they elected him to the Provincial Council. All that I am asking for is that we must stop making a race classification in respect of every small group of Coloureds which raises its voice and then making provision in a law whereby that specific group will be given representation on the council.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know what the hon. the Minister means, but there is another problem. Griqualand East falls into my constituency. The leading figure there is a Coloured by the name of Mr. Fortein, who is a member of the Coloured council. Mr. Fortein is the school principal of Kokstad, and he is chairman of every Coloured organization in the Transkei and Griqualand East. He cannot take more upon himself; he is always elected to these posts. That part of South Africa is the home of the Griquas. I attended meetings at Kokstad with a nominated Griqua representative of the Coloured council&#x2014;they were not political meetings; matters of general interest Were discussed&#x2014;and I had to protect that person because he was always talking about the Griquas. The people said: &#x201C;We are not Griquas; we are Coloureds.&#x201D; I admit that there is a small group at Kokstad who call themselves the &#x201C;Pioneer Council&#x201D;, and who are proud of <span class="col_4503-4504" refersTo="page_0944"/>the fact that they are Griquas, but they are very much in the minority. My question is this: Why does the law make provision for special representation to be given to the Malays and the Griquas but not to the Basters&#x003F; The hon. the Minister says that he will give them that representation, but why is it not specified in the law&#x003F; Why is provision made in this legislation for the sub-classification of the Coloured group&#x003F; Why specify in legislation that the Coloureds are going to be sub-classified in this way&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>With the greatest respect, Mr. Chairman, I have a very strong argument which I want to use in this connection because I went into the whole question of the history of the Griquas in connection with the celebration of the trek of Adam Kok. When we held a meeting in the City Hall at Kokstad, under the chairmanship of the Mayor of Kokstad, to discuss this matter, a Griqua, a nominated member of the Coloured council who was with us on the stage, was nearly prevented from speaking. We had to ask the people to give him a hearing because, when he started speaking, he started speaking as a Griqua to Griquas, and they told him: &#x201C;We are not Griquas, we are Coloureds.&#x201D; [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to give further information just once more in connection with this matter. When we look at the numerical strength we find, according to a conservative estimate of the Department of Census, that there are approximately 96,000 Malays in the Republic, of whom approximately 57,000 are in the Cape Peninsula alone. These people have their own organizations. They have their own Malay choirs, for example; they hold their annual gatherings and they fight and struggle to retain their identity as a separate community. But hon. members who are supposed to represent them here now come along and say, &#x201C;No, wipe them out; do not recognize them; do not give them an opportunity to build up their own culture and to retain their historic possessions.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Why should those things not be given legislative recognition&#x003F; Sir, the hon. member does not want me to recognize the Malays and I hope that the Malays will take notice of the fact that their so-called representatives in this House begrudge them these rights. Let us take the Griquas. There are approximately 20,000 Griquas. They form a small little group, but everybody who knows these people, whether he agrees with their ideas or not, knows that they attach great value to their past. They live in Elsiesrivier, for example, in the Erica Estate here in the Cape; in the Caledon district there is a group of Griquas at Hawston; there are Griquas living at Vredendal, in Plettenberg Bay and in Franschhoek. And let me tell the hon. member that if he really wants to represent his constituents, he will have to take notice of the wishes and the frame of mind of the Griquas living in Franschhoek. There are also Griquas in Koffiefontein, Jagersfontein, Blouleliespos in the Humansdorp district as well as in Port Elizabeth. The hon. member wants us to believe that all the Griquas live in the immediate vicinity of Mr. Fortein in East Griqualand. Sir, I say that a very good case has been made out in support of the desire of the Coloured council that recognition should be given to these two groups. They are recognized to-day in the existing council. One of the most valuable members of this council is a Malay, a respected man, a man with a fine background. a man who is respected wherever he <span class="col_4505-4506" refersTo="page_0945"/>goes. He is a member of the existing council, and I challenge any hon. member to deny what I have said here.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Despite what the hon. Minister has just said&#x2014;that regardless of what we might say, he is not going to change this clause&#x2014;I want to tell him with great respect that the very second clause of this Bill has immediately had the effect of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> on the whole Bill; moreover, by the time we get to Clause 2, and there are another 29 to come, the hon. Minister is already in a dispute with the hon. member for Outeniqua on the one side and the hon. member for Karoo on the other side, and they both represent Coloured people, and the hon. member for Hospital on the third side&#x2014;he represents White people. I want to show how this clause works. The hon. member for Outeniqua feels apparently, as does the Minister, that the characteristics of a group within a group, be it for example the Malay or the Griqua group within the Coloured group, should be retained and maintained. Did I understand him correctly&#x003F; Yes. Sir, on the other hand the hon. Minister himself feels that the Griquas are different from the Malays and the Malays are different from my hon. friend&#x2019;s basters (I don&#x2019;t mean that in any unfortunate connotation), and yet despite the fact that the hon. Minister and the hon. member for Outeniqua agree that there are these differences between the one sub-group, as it were, and the other sub-group, within the Coloured group as a whole, they cannot agree about the representation of the group. This is the very dilemma in which South Africa as well as the Coloured people find themselves when this Bill is analysed. This particular clause shows conclusively that if the hon. Minister were convinced that the Malays are worthy people&#x2014;and he says they are very worthy people&#x2014;and the hon. member for Outeniqua will agree with him, then he could nominate all these 16 members, for example, subject to the reservations contained in 2 (2), as Malays, because 2 (2) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The members nominated under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of sub-section (1) may include persons belonging to the race or class known as Malays and persons belonging to the race or class known as Griquas.</block>

<p>In other words, the Minister is not bound to nominate people because they are Malays, and he is not prohibited in terms of this clause from nominating them because they are Malays. He can please himself. So although it is suggested in this clause that he is going to appoint two for the Malay group, he is by no means bound to do so. If that is the position, then one wonders how the hon. Minister will finally solve this problem which has been posed, I think, from different angles, but very pertinently by both the hon. member for Karoo and the hon. member for Outeniqua. Amid the conflicting and warring interests that seem to be bound up in this matter of the subgroups within the common group, how is the hon. Minister genuinely, honestly and objectively going to nominate and satisfy all the people concerned that he has nominated fairly&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. Minister another question.</p>

Now I ask the hon. Minister with great respect: Why only one member from the Free State&#x003F; What is the hon. Minister&#x2019;s yard-stick&#x003F; I know that he will say that numbers are relevant.

<p>Nobody blames the hon. the Minister for adopting a standpoint, but then he should at least set out from the right standpoint, and I must object to the Minister&#x2019;s standpoint. His whole standpoint was that this side of the House wants to eliminate diversity. But who pleaded for that on this side of the House&#x003F; That is what he based his whole argument on, that we want to eliminate diversity. Who on this side asked that any diversity between the various population groups should be eliminated&#x003F; Even if one wishes to do so one cannot, because the diversity which exists between, e.g., the Malays and the Griquas is as old as history itself, and it does not exist as the result of laws. These are of course differences which do not come into conflict with one another; They form part of the colourfulness of the South African scene. Nobody asks for them to be eliminated.</p>

<p>But I will tell you why this is a very bad argument the Minister uses. The Whites are not in a different position. Where can one find more differences than amongst the Whites&#x003F; We have the Afrikaans- and the English-speaking peoples, a strong group of German-speaking people in South Africa, large group of Greeks, etc. There are great differences amongst the Whites, differences in language, culture, history and religion. But that is not put into an Act. We do not provide that every group should have its own political representation. Must I now take it from the Minister that because these differences are not recognized in our Constitution therefore he wants to eliminate the differences between e.g. the Afrikaans- and the English-speaking people&#x003F; He says the Malays have their own choirs and various other things. Of course, the Afrikaans-speaking people too.</p>

<p>Will you admit that the only entrenched section in the Constitution is the one dealing with the rights of Afrikaans- and English-speaking people&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, we have two official languages, and that is what is entrenched. The hon. the Minister has two languages. English is just as much his language as Afrikaans, and the same applies to me; and the language of the English-speaking people should be Afrikaans too. His comparison cuts no ice. Nobody on this side wants to eliminate differences. We merely say: Do not put it in the law; do not continuously cut up and divide, because you are just creating differences, and if you continue creating differences which have the force of law, then you create animosities and ill-will. That is what we want to eliminate.</p>

<p>But the one point which I think the Minister misses above everything else is this: He says there must be different representatives so that they can represent the interests of the various groups. He referred to the Malays. If there are 95,000 of them, they will in any case have elected representatives. But I go much further. They have so many talents that in any case they will be elected by the Coloureds generally as leaders, as is the position at present in the existing bodies. But what does a man do who is elected&#x003F; Surely he looks after the interests of his voters. If Mr. X is elected by, e.g. Malays and Griquas, and he is dependent on those voters, surely he will fight for the protection of the interests of both the Griquas and the Malays. I do not think there is anybody who wants to destroy the rights of anybody else. The man who is elected as a member of the Coloured Council will look after the interests of his voters and the interests of everybody, whatever diversity there might be. The interests of the Malays and the Griquas will be quite safe in the hands of the man who represents them. It is, therefore, not our standpoint to eliminate the diversity. We recognize it. But we do not want it to be laid down in legislation that we are continually creating a clash of interests in South Africa.</p>

<p>One argument which the hon. the Minister also continuously advanced is that the Council asked for it, and he asks whether he should not take notice of that. In general, one gains the impression that in most cases the Minister takes no notice of their recommendations. But supposing I am wrong, I still think the Minister should at least study the motives with which a man submits a request to him.</p>

<p>Sir. when I raised this question of the Griquas and the Malays being mentioned specifically in this clause, I gave my reasons for doing so. and I did this in all honesty and on the basis of the knowledge I have acquired about the feeling amongst the Coloureds, including the Griquas and the Malays. I do not know what the motive of the hon. the Minister or his intention or his aim is in this regard. In putting my point of view to the House, as I have just done, I am not going to allow myself to be frightened by what the hon. the Minister is going to tell the Malays. The Coloureds in my constituency who are Moslems by religion know me. I have served them for the past six years. The hon. the Minister can tell them what he likes. I maintain that this is unnecessary. I agree with the hon. the Minister that there are certain groups amongst the Coloured people, like the Malays and the Griquas. who may in certain respects be different or have different characteristics. But my whole point is that the hon. the Minister can make the necessary provision if he feels that a group is strong enough or is important enough to be represented on the council. My whole attitude is that we should not carve up the Coloured population into groups by legislation.</p>

<p>No, it is no reason why we should not be here. We leave that to our voters to decide. But the person whom the hon. the Minister has mentioned is not elected; he is nominated. This brings me to another aspect of this matter. Hon. members opposite keep on telling us that the Coloured council has asked for the sub-classification of the Coloured people; that this should be laid down by legislation and that it should continue. Who are the two representatives on the present Coloured council who represent the Malays and the Griquas&#x003F; Were they elected by the Malays and the Griquas or were they both nominated by the Minister&#x003F; The test is: If it is the wish of the Coloured people and of the Malays and the Griquas that this sub-division of the Coloured people should continue and be laid down by legislation, then let us see what will happen to one of those gentlemen if they stand for election in a constituency. Let us see what will happen if this is one of the points at issue. It is impossible to apply the test because although the hon. the Minister has mentioned certain figures here they are not true figures and it is impossible to arrive at the correct figure. It is impossible to arrive at a correct figure in respect of the Malays. If a person is a Moslem, he describes himself as a &#x201C;Malay&#x201D; on his census form. There is not such a great difference as we are led to believe. But I accept what the hon. the Minister says&#x2014;I have never denied it&#x2014;that if there are such population groups then we must consider those groups as far as the nomination of members is concerned. But is it unnecessary to sub-divide the Coloured people into groups by legislation&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister wants to tell the Malays how weak their representative in this House is, how he ignores them, then for my part I shall apply that test to see whether everything that the hon. the Minister has said here in connection with the Coloureds, the Malays and the Griquas, is precisely what those people want. It is impossible, as I am sure the hon. the Minister himself will admit. We have the Odendaal Report which is under discussion at the moment. It looks as though South West Africa will undergo a change of status. What is going to happen to the Coloured there&#x003F; Is the hon. the Minister going to make provision for a third group, the Rehoboth Basters, to have representation on the council&#x003F; And is he also going to make provision in the Bill for them&#x003F;</p>

I want to say to the Minister with regard to the representative of the Malay section on the present council that he appeared with others before the inquiry which was held by the Group Areas Board as to whether District Six should be a White or a Coloured area, and this gentleman pleaded not that it should be a Malay section or a Griqua section, but that it should be a Coloured section.</p>

<p>How are these people going to represent the different sections&#x003F; How are the Malays going to represent the Malays specifically&#x003F; Is the Minister trying to suggest that any legislation passed by this council will be on a different basis&#x003F; Will it not be only for the Coloured people&#x003F; All the laws passed by this council will be for the Coloured people, including the Malays, the Griquas, etc. There cannot be any legislation other than in the interests of the Coloured people. I think it is wrong for us to perpetuate the differences between these people. I think there is a very excellent feeling to-day between the Malays and the Coloureds and there is a considerable amount of intermarriage. If we do what the Minister suggests they will not promote the interests of the Coloureds as a whole in this council, but the interests of a particular section. May I ask the Minister to explain what apparently seems to be a repetition in the clause&#x003F; The clause says that two members of the council shall be Malays and two shall be Griquas. I take it that is the minimum amount, but I am not sure, because it goes on to say in sub-clause (2) that members nominated in terms of (a), (b) and (c) may include people belonging to the Malay or Griqua groups. In other words, the Minister may have five or six Malays and five or six Griquas. Is that the intention of the clause&#x003F; If the Minister wants to limit it, why does it say in the first part that there shall be two of each, but then it goes on in sub-section (2) to say that he may nominate more&#x003F; I should like to know exactly what it means, whether it will be a minimum of two. [Interjection.] If the Minister wants to, he can nominate eight people for the Cape and they may all be Malays. He can nominate two for the Transvaal and they can be Malays, and also in Natal. I think the Minister should explain why sub-section (2) is there, when sub-section (1) apparently limits the number.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to what the hon. member for Boland has just said, and which I tried to point out a little earlier. Apart from the four persons nominated by him in terms of sub-section (1) to represent the Griquas and the Malays, he can pack this council, as to the other 12 nominated members, with Griquas, Malays or Basters. I say that the Minister will be able to nominate as many as he likes&#x2014;up to 12&#x2014;from one race group. I am sorry I could not get an answer from him in my first attempt, and therefore I want to know how he proposes to deal with this question of representation&#x003F; The Minister says this is a representative council, and regardless of our difference of opinion as to the basis on which it is constituted, it should surely, to the greatest possible extent, represent the various groups. Having divided the country into the four provinces, and having said that he would give provincial representation, I think this representation must bear some relation to population figures&#x2014;because he has no other yardstick. In the case of the Free State with its 14,000 Coloureds, he is now going to appoint one, and when I tell him that in terms of his own publication, published on behalf of the Coloured Affairs Department, the population of one municipal area in the Transvaal alone, Johannesburg, is now over 60,000, he still says there will be one for the Transvaal&#x003F; So there is one for the Transvaal with 60,000 in Johannesburg alone and one for the Free State with 14,000!

<p>A further point is this. Is the Minister aware that in this insistence on his part&#x2014;which has become apparent here this afternoon&#x2014;to divide the Coloured people not only provincial-wise but in terms of sub-groups, he is going contrary to the policy of the Prime Minister as stated by him on 12 December 1961&#x003F; What does the Prime Minister say about the Coloured people&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are two points arising out of the Minister&#x2019;s remarks. He mentioned that the Malays are an identifiable group and that Schotsche Kloof has been set aside for them. I want to put it to the Minister that nobody is for a moment suggesting that the Malays are not civilized people, etc. What we are saying is that if a Malay wishes to stand for election, good luck to him. What we object to is that he is elected just because he is a Malay and not because he is a good man or a qualified person. That is the point we are trying to establish. The Minister himself has said that they are being absorbed to a degree, and the hon. member for Boland confirmed it, and I also agree. The number of Malays in the Western Province is 75,000. I put it to the Minister that it is not unreasonable to suggest that in dealing with nominees they should be dealt with on the ground of their qualifications as individuals and their achievements in the community, and not because they belong to a particular religious group. The second point is that the Griquas are scattered over the Cape Province like a charge of buckshot, and 20,000 people throughout the Cape will have two nominees. Who is to do the nominating&#x003F; Who is to select them&#x003F; The Minister says a member of the family of the captain is on the Council. This is not a question of personalities. We simply maintain that it is bad in principle to start dividing the Coloured community up, because the Bill says that every Coloured person over the age of 21 years can vote, and Coloured persons are defined as those who are not classified as Whites or Bantu. They are grouped together for purposes of making the Bill work, but as soon as we get to the nominated members we find ourselves hiving off into all sorts of religious and other groups. I do not wish to labour the point, but I say again that the Coloured community does not wish to be cut up, and the Malays are regarded as Coloured in terms of the law.</p>

<p>I go further and say that there are many Malays who work amongst the Coloured community and are leaders among them. They are the chairmen of various clubs and committees, and they are recognized as belonging to the Coloured community, and that has nothing to do with their religious beliefs. I want to go even further, and say there are many Moslems who are not Malays. Although there are many Malays in the Western Province, there are people in other parts of the country who are Arabs or Persians, and they are all Moslems and are qualified for this particular purpose as Malays, but they are completely different people. Finally, I want to say that each of the Malay communities revolves around its own mosque and its own Imam or Sheik, and they are not an organized body at all. There are differences in the groups in each of the towns in which they reside. There are different mosques. They have an association because of their religion, but they are different communities, and I want to know who will make the selection from all the mosques and communities which exist throughout the Republic.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what has given rise to a great deal of fear in the minds of certain hon. members is the presence in this clause of sub-section (2) which was referred to by the hon. member for Boland. I think it is necessary to look at the matter in the light of what we have already passed in Clause 1. That says that no person other than a Coloured person shall be nominated or elected as a member of this Council. A Coloured person is defined in the Bill as any person who is classified under the Population Registration Act as a member of the Cape Coloured, Malay or Griqua group or the other Coloured groups. So it means that no one can be elected to this Council, or nominated, who is not a member of the Coloured group as defined. In Clause 2 provision is made whereby two members of the Council shall be members of the group or class known as Malays, two shall be members of the race or class known as Griquas, and then the clause goes on to say that the rest of the members, i.e. the remaining twelve of the nominated members, shall be nominated to represent the provinces, eight for the Cape, two for the Transvaal, one for Natal and one for the Free State. Then for some extraordinary reason sub-sec. (2) is inserted, and I think this requires an explanation by the Minister, because it says that the members nominated in terms of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) to represent the provinces may include persons belonging to the race or class known as Malays and persons of the race or class known as Griquas. But what about the Cape Coloureds or the other Coloured groups&#x003F; I think I know what the Minister means, but he has not stated it. It is the inclusion of this sub-section which has created all this doubt in our minds. Up to <span class="col_4517-4518" refersTo="page_0951"/>now no one has told us what it means. I think I have made myself clear. I think what the Minister means to say, but has not said, is that what he intends doing is that he shall have the right to include at least two Malays and at least two Griquas, and in addition, in respect of the provincial nominees, he shall be entitled to elect any other members including Malays or Griquas. The Minister nods his head to indicate that is his intention, but it is far from clear in terms of this clause. It is very badly drafted and I would suggest to the Minister that he might give consideration to eliminating sub-section (2), which I think is unnecessary, but if he wants it to remain then he should add &#x201C;and may include persons belonging to the race or class known as Cape Coloureds or persons belonging to the other Coloured groups.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, accordingly agreed to. On Clause 3,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>This clause in many ways follows the Electoral Act&#x2019;s procedure governing the registration of European voters and the registration of Coloured voters on the separate roll for the election of Coloured representa-tives in Parliament. In this Bill the hon. the Minister does not, in the first instance, make registration compulsory. This clause provides for optional registration, and I do think that that will defeat the whole object of this Coloured Parliament. I think if you want to have a representative number of people voting for the Coloured People&#x2019;s Parliament, the registration should be on the same basis as the registration of European voters and the registration of Coloured voters who vote for the Coloured representatives in Parliament. Clause 3 (2) (b) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any such list shall contain the names of all persons who during a period of ninety days ending at four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon after the appropriate date fixed in the relevant proclamation under sub-section (1), have in accordance with the provisions of section <i>six</i> applied for registration as voters in their division in question and are entitled to be so registered.</block>

<p>Sir, I think that is wrong. I think that to start with the Minister should make this a general registration and that he should give people who are not registered within a certain period the <span class="col_4519-4520" refersTo="page_0952"/>right to apply, and if he does not want to allow them to register the second time, that is for him to decide and he can then come with an amending Bill. I say again that under this system of application to be registered as a voter you will get the minimum number of people applying to be registered. It is extremely difficult to have these people registered. The hon. the Minister knows that in the last registration drive that he had for the separate roll, he only found 2,000 people in my area to vote, whereas in 1958 there were 8,000. It is very difficult indeed to get people to register because they are away at work and so on. How are you going to make this Parliament a real Parliament or a real Council, if the Minister does not like the word &#x201C;Parliament&#x201D; unless you have the people registered&#x003F; Sir, you are going to make a farce of this. I want to tell the Minister in advance that under this Clause he will find that a minimum number of people will apply for registration, and he will never be able to boast that the people elected to this council represent the majority of the Coloured people. I would like therefore to move that this clause stand over for the Minister to consider how he can amend it to bring it into line with the present system of registration. I would like the Minister to tell us why registration has to be voluntary. Perhaps I can answer this question myself because I think the hon. the Minister did give some indication. If I am wrong I withdraw this, but it has been said that the clause has been framed in this way because if you make the registration compulsory you will get people on the roll who will really destroy the purpose of this council; that you will get boycotters and Leftists. It has been suggested that under this system you will cut out the boycotters and Leftists and that you will only get on the roll those people who really want to vote. I say that under this system of voluntary application for registration you will never get a sufficient number of Coloured people on the roll for the Minister and the Government to say that the Council has been elected by the Coloured people of South Africa. I think the Minister should hold this clause over until we can find some way of remedying the situation. This is not the type of law that I would like to see on the Statute Book.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that I cannot accept the suggestion of the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) that the clause should stand over. This clause has been very carefully considered in co-operation with the Department of the Interior and it has been decided for various reasons to accept this voluntary basis. I mentioned one reason for this during my second reading speech. The second reason is that there are many Coloureds who are really not at all interested in whether they have the vote or not who would then be compelled to register, perhaps under difficult circumstances. There are some people who cannot sign their names and one does not want to force those people to register. I think it is high time for us to teach the Coloured people to have some sense of responsibility. They must also learn that they have a certain amount of sacrifice in order to become voters. We also had voluntary registration in the case of White voters for many years. I cannot discuss the matter now but if the hon. member will look at Clause 6 he will see that it is very easy for the Coloureds to be registered. We decided to frame the clause in this form for various reasons and, what is more, it was framed in consultation with the Department of the Interior. If we compel these people to register, we must also provide penalties for people who do not comply with this requirement. I think that the hon. member will agree that if I were to make it compulsory, a great fuss would be made about it and I would be told that I was going to prosecute people and compel them to vote for this &#x201C;mockery&#x201D;!</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to debate this clause but I would like to suggest to the Minister that he should have sub-clause (2) re-drafted. I think the wording here is very misleading. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The persons whose names appear on the Coloured voters&#x2019; list for any electoral division, shall be entitled to elect a member of the council &#x2026;</block>

<p>I think the intention is that they should elect a person to represent them on this council. The wording here implies&#x2014;and it is the same in the Afrikaans too&#x2014;that they can only elect a member of the council to represent them. I think it is just a matter of re-wording.</p>

<p>The answer is of course that these clauses were framed by the law advisers who have had many years experience in formulating Bills of this nature. I will take up the matter with them if it is a point at issue but I do not think that any mistake has been made in the formulation.</p>

<p>On Clause 8,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there are certain amendments which will be moved by hon. members on this side of the House in relation to this clause. This is the clause which provides for the manner of dividing provinces <span class="col_4521-4522" refersTo="page_0953"/>into electoral divisions. As the Minister will have seen from the Order Paper the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) has an amendment which proposes a completely different system. As he has now arrived I&#x2019;m sure he will be able to deal with this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>In dealing with Clause 8, the same provisions appear to apply as in the case of nominated members in the clause that we disposed of earlier. It has now been agreed that there are going to be 30 elected members. I want to move the amendment as printed in my name in a slightly amended form; in other words, I propose to substitute &#x201C;thirty&#x201D; for &#x201C;forty-six&#x201D; in the amendment as printed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;the&#x201D; where it occurs for the second time in line 35 up to and including &#x201C;province&#x201D; in line 55 and to substitute:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Republic into thirty electoral divisions in such a manner that the number of persons registered on the Coloured voters&#x2019; list residing in each electoral division will be as nearly as may be equal to the quota referred to in sub-section (2).</block>

<block name="quote">(2) For the purpose of any such division the quota shall be obtained by dividing the total number of Coloured voters in the Republic as ascertained from an examination of the current Coloured voters&#x2019; list by thirty.&#x201D;</block>

<block name="quote">; in line 71, to omit &#x201C;each province&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the Republic&#x201D;; and in line 74, to omit &#x201C;province concerned&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;Republic&#x201D;.</block>

<p>My reason for that is that in dealing with elected persons I think it is only fair and reasonable that the numbers per constituency should be equal as nearly as possible.</p>

<p>As was said by the hon. member for Boland, if these registrations are going to be voluntarily the voters&#x2019; roll itself can quite conceivably contain a large number of voters in one province and a lesser number in another which, divided by the number of seats proposed by the hon. the Minister, will give a state of unbalance to the seats in the various provinces. I therefore think that in view of the fact that the intention is to ascertain the wishes of the Coloured community every constituency should contain as near as possible the same number of voters as any other constituency. A section of this clause provides for a load or unload of 15 per cent which is common practice and takes care of community interests and the other qualifications which are necessary in deciding the delimitation. I think that will be sufficient to deal with the particular aspect of the compilation of the roll and the division of the Republic into electoral divisions.</p>

<p>The Minister when dealing with the question of the nominated members refrained from giving me a reply to my question as to the basis on which he has arrived at the number of nominated members per province. He took refuge in the fact that it was a recommendation of the Union Council of Coloured Affairs. We feel that the correct procedure here is to deal with the matter on a basis whereby every member who is elected to this Council shall represent a similar number of people. It can quite conceivably happen that one seat in, say, the Western Province or in the Johannesburg complex could have a large number of voters whereas a seat in Natal, for instance, will only have a few and even fewer in the case of the Free State. In order to make it a workable Council and to give as fair a delimitation as possible without having the sort of thing we have in Parliament itself where the loading and unloading has reached the stage where certain seats are enormously over-loaded due to the shifting population, the correct procedure would be to have more or less the same number of voters in each constituency. It may be that as the country grows the numbers suggested by the Minister may become quite unrealistic in the light of development which will take place in the fast developing mining areas of this country. We have the Orange River scheme and a large portion of that falls within the Cape Province. A large number of Coloured persons are already engaged on that scheme and their numbers will increase more and more as the scheme develops. I would therefore ask the Minister to accept what I am offering this afternoon that in deciding on the electoral division he should break away from the provincial attitude. I think it is out of date; it is an anachronism. We have examples where provinces have had varying allocations but this is a growing country and where we are launching a Coloured Representative Council I feel that it should be as representative as possible and I therefore move accordingly.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry but I cannot accept the amendment. I agree with the council that the provincial basis should remain. I think that the council considered this point very carefully when they laid down these proportions as far as the representation of the various provinces is concerned. I think that we must first see how the council operates before we interfere with its composition. There is a further reason why I do not want to eliminate the provincial basis and that is because I foresee, under given circumstances, that the members of this council will be able to form committees which will function in respect of the interests of the various provinces. This is one of the possible developments which the council may yet experience in the future and so I do not want to disturb that basis. We must make it possible for committees of this council to function in respect of various provinces or in regard to particular interests which may have to be looked after in a particular province. I hope <span class="col_4523-4524" refersTo="page_0954"/>therefore that we are not going to interfere with this basis. We can do sums if we want to. When I first saw this basis, I also asked myself whether these proportions could not be worked out on a better basis. I think that each of us could work out a sum to show that we had found a better basis than this one, but once we start doing sums, each one of us will come forward with his own sum. That is why I say that this agreed basis must remain. We must first put it into operation and retain the provincial basis so as to enable us to make use of it in regard to specific committees.</p>

<p>I am sorry that in spite of what the hon. the Minister has said I would like to make a &#x201C;sommetjie&#x201D; and that &#x201C;sommetjie&#x201D; has also been made for me by officials of his own Department and by the Bureau of Census and Statistics. Here I have what one might call the &#x201C;Handbook&#x201D; of the Coloured people of South Africa, published by the Department of Coloured Affairs. On page 9 it deals with the distribution of the Coloured population. There is a very graphic illustration of that distribution. The total population is given and also the break-down in respect of the four provinces and South West Africa. Each symbol represents 10,000 people according to the Department. The &#x201C;sommetjie&#x201D; I am compelled to make, based on the Department&#x2019;s figures, is that in 1960, for example, there were1,285,000 Coloured persons in the Cape of Good Hope, 110,000 in the Transvaal, 45,000 in Natal and 15,000 in the Orange Free State. I am obviously not concerned with South West Africa. The Minister now proposes to provide the Transvaal with six electoral divisions and the Orange Free State with three.</p>

<p>I want the Minister to accept that I am not disputing any up-to-date figures he may have at his disposal&#x2014;but I merely say here is one yardstick, the last one available to me, and those are the 1960 statistics.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Obviously I accept them. As far as I know the ratio as been constant as between the population of the Cape of Good Hope, the Transvaal and the Free State. I submit to the Minister that there has been a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the Coloured population of the Transvaal as there has been in the Orange Free State. I come back to the figures of the 1960 census and to the symbols given by the Department. I say therefore that the ratio has not changed. If that is correct, as I believe it is, I once again say to the hon. the Minister that despite that ratio of population&#x2014;which is obviously the criterion he elected to use for the distribution of the representation and of the seats&#x2014;the position remains that he proposes to give six seats to the Transvaal and three to the Orange Free State.</p>

<p>There are two possibilities as far as I can make out the position. If the representation for the Orange Free State is adequate, whether on the 1960 figures or on the <i>pro rata</i> increased figures in 1963 or even in 1964, in the form of three representatives, then proportionately the province of the Transvaal must have 22.5 representatives. I am prepared to make the Minister a present of the .5! Then the Transvaal should have 22 representatives. Conversely, Sir, if the representation of the Transvaal is the criterion, namely that six representatives are adequate for the Transvaal&#x2019;s Coloured population of 110,000, then the Orange Free State is entitled to .85 of a representative&#x2014;and I give the Minister the difference of .15, and they can have one representative! The Minister says &#x201C;ek kan &#x2019;n sommetjie maak en hy kan &#x2019;n sommetjie maak&#x201D; but one thing is clear, and that is that these considerations are based on facts and figures. One is compelled, as the Minister has already done, to make a &#x201C;sommetjie&#x201D;. The Minister must surely be prepared to explain why he has agreed to this distribution, as he says, at the request of the Coloured Council&#x003F; I can give him one explanation, and that is that because the Coloured Council is based on the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, the bulk of its members live in the Cape Province, and they have persuaded the hon. the Minister to give a minimum of representation to their own fellow-citizens in other provinces. I fail to see the equity in that. If anything, the people who have moved away from their &#x201C;heartland,&#x201D; as it were, from the Western Province, should be entitled to a stronger <i>pro rata</i> representation than the people who are in the heartland and who, in a sense, control not only the numbers but also whatever their economic strength may be&#x2014;and therefore their political strength. If anything, he should load the number of seats allocated to the Transvaal and the Free State, certainly in the case of the Free State. I do not want to deal with Natal, because I am sure other hon. members will do so. But the Minister should load their representation favourably and give them more than they are entitled to in terms of his &#x201C;sommetjie&#x201D; or mine. I don&#x2019;t want to pursue this, Sir, but I say that the hon. Minister has some other reason, that <span class="col_4525-4526" refersTo="page_0955"/>is, other than the fact that this is what the Coloured Council asked for.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the question of objectivity and impartiality as it exists in the Coloured Council as constituted to-day, and as it will obviously exist in the new Coloured &#x201C;Parliament&#x201D; of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>The other day, in regard to this question, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) who appears to have been the architect of this constitution&#x2014;in fact, when he rose to speak I expected cries, as there are on the first night of a play of &#x201C;Author, Author&#x201D; &#x2014;told us in the second reading debate that three out of the four Coloured Representatives in this House could not be objective because they belonged to the United Party. Yet he expects me to believe that this council which recommended this distribution of seats in the Coloured Representative Council, is being objective when it recommends that the Minister should give three seats on that council to the Free State with a Coloured population of 15,000 and only six seats to a population of 110,000 in the Transvaal! These population figures are for 1960. Now. I have already said that if three seats stand in proper relation to the Coloured population of the Free State, then Transvaal on that same basis should have 22.5 seats. Conversely, if the province of Transvaal is properly represented by six seats for its Coloured population, then an objective council should have recommended that the Free State on that basis should get .85 of a representative. Some people in this House I believe, constitute less than .85 of a representative. This, however, is not a point which I want to debate now. Let us, for the sake of argument, say that the Free State under those circumstances should on that basis be entitled to one representative. Now I submit that if the hon. the Minister was persuaded by the recommendation of the present council to bring in this clause and the distribution of seats set out therein, it cannot be said that the council, in making this recommendation, was really objective. And if this provision goes through and becomes law, then the Coloured &#x201C;Parliament&#x201D; itself will also not be objective in so far as the Free State and the Transvaal were treated unfairly in regard to the representation given to their respective Coloured populations.</p>

<p>I have many other things to say about this clause, but before I do that I should like to give the hon. the Minister an opportunity of replying to the points made thus far.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place I want to point out that the figure of 15,000 mentioned by the hon member as being the Coloured population of the Free State, is wrong. Perhaps the graph in the document that he has there has been printed wrongly by mistake in this respect. The correct figure is 25,000. being 14,000 for the urban areas and 11,000 for the platteland. Those were the 1962 figures. Accordingly I think that the figures which the hon. member has there have either not been checked or else the graph has been printed wrongly by mistake.</p>

<p>Let me say in connection with the proposed representation that I myself, when I had to consider the Bill in its final form, doubted whether this was the correct approach. That was why I also sat down and made sums. But I came to the conclusion that it would be possible for each one of us to do sums and to reach a proportion which in our eyes was better than that of somebody else. In doing my sums, however, I took into account another aspect of the approach to this matter of the committee which made the recommendations. This approach was formulated as follows by the aforementioned committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to make the council more representative of the Coloured population of South Africa, your committee recommends that there should be more elected than nominated members and that representation be distributed as follows &#x2026;</block>

<p>I have already quoted this. The committee went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As has been pointed out already, the Cape Province is at present being represented by 20 members&#x2014;12 elected and eight nominated. Your committee took into consideration <i>inter alia</i> two factors in determining the future representation in this province; (1) the large concentration of the Coloured population, and (2) the geopraphical extent of the province with its scattered rural community which makes it difficult for representatives to carry out their duties properly.</block>

<p>Your committee has, therefore, decided to increase the elected members by six and to retain the number of the existing nominated members.</p>

<p>In other words, they considered these two aspects and made provision for an increased number of elected members.</p>

<p><i>Transvaal</i>:</p>

<block name="quote">Because this province has a population of over 100,000 Coloureds, your committee decided to make its elected representation equal to one-third of the Cape Province and to allow for two nominated members.</block>

<p><i>Natal and the Orange Free State:</i></p>

<block name="quote">Your committee has decided to recommend that equal representation be given to these provinces. It is true that Natal has a larger Coloured population but from the foregoing <span class="col_4527-4528" refersTo="page_0956"/>figures it will be seen that Natal has a high percentage of urban population whereas that of the Free State is scattered over a large area. The representatives of the Orange Free State thus will have a large geographical area to cover.</block>

<p>And so the committee took various considerations into account before deciding upon this proportion. I think therefore that we must allow ourselves to be guided by the committee&#x2019;s recommendation. As I have already said, it will be possible for me, as it will be for any hon. member, to sit down and work out another proportion, but the fact is that disproportions are present at every delimitation. Indeed, our Constitution also contains disproportions. In a country like England, delimitation results in some constituencies having as many as 90,000 voters while the number of voters in other constituencies is far fewer. We must not think that by doing sums we can make the provisions of this clause absolutely perfect. The committee considered every factor before it arrived at its decision as regards how the representation should be apportioned. In doing so, they made provision for more elected members and for the special circumstances prevailing in every province. That is why, in my opinion, we must accept the position as it is.</p>

<p>At this point I should like to indicate that I do not intend moving the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper. This is a consequential amendment relating to an amendment on a previous clause. As that amendment was negatived, there is no point in my moving this amendment now. I should, however, like to avail myself of this opportunity of discussing with the Minister the proposal which has now been made, i.e. that we should divide the Republic in so far as the Coloureds are concerned into 30 electoral divisions. In this connection I wish to ask the Minister to bear with me and make no decision as yet. This is a matter which is worthy of the most careful consideration. I know the Minister has already pointed out to this Committee that he has based the calculations envisaged in Clause 8 on recommendations made to him by the present council. Despite that, however, I think he as well as the members of the council will appreciate that several minds put together are better than one and that, consequently, complete justification exists for reviewing the particular provisions of this clause.</p>

<p>I can appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s desire to see to it that the various provinces are represented in this proposed Coloured council. But we have already safeguarded that because in Clause 2, with which we have already dealt, we made provision for allowing the Government to nominate eight members for the Cape Province, two for the Transvaal, and one each for Natal and the Orange Free State. So here already there is direct representation on a provincial basis. There is, moreover, also provincials in this Bill for due regard to be taken by the commission when defining these electoral divisions of various aspects which might militate against any particular section of the Coloured people living in any of the provinces. Provision is, <i>inter alia,</i> made for the commission to take due regard of community or diversity of interests, of means of communication, physical features and existing or future sparsity or density of population. The commission will have the right to depart from the quota under certain circumstances. In addition, there is the 15 per cent loading on either side. If, in the circumstances, one approached this matter from the general point of view of the electoral divisions for the whole of the Republic, there need not be any hardship if we do not at this stage determine what each province shall receive.</p>

<p>Apparently there is a conflict between the figures quoted by the Minister and those quoted by the hon. member for Hospital. I have here figures which have been handed to me a few minutes ago. They come from the Department and are as follows: In the Cape there is a Coloured population of 1,314,392; in the Transvaal, 105,217; in Natal, 43,093; and in the Orange Free State, 25,565. From these figures it is obvious that the Cape Province has approximately 13 times the population of the Transvaal. Yet, what has been suggested by the Coloured council&#x003F; This, that the Cape should only get three times the number of representatives given to the Transvaal. As related to Natal, the Cape has a population of 30 times more and yet the proposal made by the Council for Coloured Affairs to the Minister is that the Cape be given six times the number of representatives as that of Natal. In the case of the Free State, the Cape has 52 times the population of that province. These figures speak for themselves and it is obvious that the number of representatives proposed for the Cape is unfair towards this province in view of the fact that here is the largest concentration of Coloureds, i.e. 1,314,392. Surely the Cape, on this basis, is entitled to a much larger representation. Surely, the fairest way of dealing with this matter is to say that there are more or less 1,500,000 Coloureds throughout the country; let the commission which is going to be appointed consequently divide the entire country into 30 electoral divisions on the basis of population taking into account all the factors I have already enumerated, i.e. community or diversity of interests, means of communication, etc.; let this commission on this basis then work out where the electoral divisions are going to be. The Free State and Natal will still get their representation bearing in mind the loading aspect in addition to the representation they will get amongst the nominated members. The Transvaal also will get representation on that basis although less than the figure stipulated here.</p>

<p>I speak particularly for the Cape because it is here where the vast majority of Coloureds are living. I plead therefore, on behalf of the Cape, that the Minister should give some consideration to amending this clause on the lines suggested. If the Minister is not prepared to go <span class="col_4529-4530" refersTo="page_0957"/>the whole hog, as suggested by the hon. member for Karoo, i.e. to divide the country into 30 electoral divisions, then he should at least give an indication that he is prepared to revise these proposals and give more than 18 electoral divisions to the Cape. Perhaps we can at this stage adjourn so that the Minister can consider the matter. It merits favourable consideration.</p>

<p>I want to say to the Minister that it is dangerous to allocate a certain number to each province because of the shift of population which is going on right now. We read in the newspapers of a day or two ago that the Free State is alarmed at the influx of Coloured people into that province. As a matter of fact, it was reported that the Coloureds were coming into the Free State at such a rate that the provincial authorities were going to make representations about the matter.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>They, apparently, come from the Cape. By the time this Bill has become law and the commission has to delimitate the electoral divisions, it might be found that the number of Coloureds in the Free State has doubled in the meantime and that the number in the Cape has correspondingly diminished. In other words, it is dangerous to say that the Free State is sparsely populated by Coloureds, whereas that might not be the case in a year or two. I want to emphasize this so as to indicate that one ought not to legislate on the basis of numbers. It will have to be according to the number of people within the province and in terms of the amendment of the hon. member for Karoo that remains possible. You might find that in the Free State within three years, if this influx continues to to which the Church has raised objection, those three or four people will represent many more people than in the Transvaal. In order to obviate any further amendments of this Act in future as to the representation&#x2014;the Minister shakes his head and takes up a granite attitude &#x2014;the Minister himself admitted that it was possible that the figures may give a different number of representatives for the provinces. The Coloured people have written in the papers and have called this a &#x201C;Parliament&#x201D;. If the Minister gives this Council the same status as a Parliament by spreading the constituencies over the Republic, and not having them on the basis of provinces, I think that would be the best. It will obviate the work of following up the number of Coloureds in the various provinces as they increase, and it will obviate a lot of trouble. I think the Minister would be well advised by having it on the basis of constituencies rather than on the basis of numbers.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I think I should make it clear that I have not in any way dealt with the representation in the Cape Province. I said I recognized that the weight of population and of economic power and therefore the weight of political power is in this province, but if I may summarize that aspect of the matter I say that this cake apparently has been cut in a certain way on the recommendation of the Council for Coloured Affairs with the co-operation of the Minister, and it was cut in such a way that the Cape gets three-fifths of the cake and the rest of South Africa gets two-fifths. Now let us assume that that is a fair distribution. Then my complaint and my submission is that that two-fifths has not been fairly sub-divided, because whether you take the figures which I cited from the Department of Information, and which the Minister now tells me are wrong&#x2014;which means that three times this week, since Tuesday, the Minister of Information has been wrong!&#x2014;or whether we take the figures the Minister gave in his reply a few minutes ago, or whether we take the latest figures given by the hon. member for Peninsula, the allocation or the cutting-up of that two-fifths of the cake in respect of the Free State, the Transvaal and Natal is completely wrong and unfair, and the reason why this has been done is obvious. At the present time, in the Union Council for Coloured Affairs, the representatives of the Cape Province have the majority. [Interjection.] So I submit that whichever way the Minister looks at it he should reconsider the matter, and perhaps he may well come to the conclusion before Monday that regardless of the information given to him by the Council, he has been wrongly advised in regard to the allocation of the seats and the representation of those three provinces. I sincerely hope he will realize that far from this being an objective recommendation by the Council, it is inspired by the ordinary political motives of retaining political strength in the hands of the majority in the present Council, and perpetuating it for the Cape Province in the new Coloured &#x201C;Parliament&#x201D;. This is not the way a completely new concept of representation should be approached, particularly in the light of the legislation which should come before this Parliament very soon in regard to the electoral affairs of the White community in South Africa, where we are taking great pains in order to ensure that we will in fact provide representation on a fair and proper basis, having due regard to such important factors as population distribution and the changes therein.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>At the last consideration of Clause 8, I, for one, had made the point that the sub-division of the Coloured people into the various sub-groups, as they have been called in this debate, first of all of Cape Coloureds as the main group, and then the Griquas, Malays and so on, was not a realistic and not even a fair way of approaching the question of representation for the group as a whole.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, Sir. The letter writer says that anyone who walks through District Six will find that Mr. Botha&#x2019;s statement is completely incorrect, and that he will in fact form an impression contrary to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s statement. The point he makes is that there has been so much social, economic and cultural integration that it is difficult in fact impossible, to distinguish between the various groups, and that any cross-section of the numerous housing projects will prove this.</p>

<p>Sir, if this is correct, and this appears to be an opinion of a Coloured person who, if I may say so, writes a very intelligent letter about the whole Bill&#x2014;and not all of his comments are critical of the Bill or of the Minister&#x2014;if this person, taking just one part of the municipal area of Cape Town, District Six which is, as we know, a Coloured area, is correct when he says that it is virtually impossible to separate these groups because of the way they have become not only mixed up with each other, but virtually become integrated in all their customs, in their form of life and in their economy, then I believe that the Minister should give some heed to the representations that we have made on this clause and not persist, as he said he intended to do, with a representation based purely on a sub-division of the Coloured people into these various groups. I do not want to press this point unduly, but I rose merely in order to give the Minister the assurance that the opinions expressed by us in regard to this clause and in regard to the point at issue, are not superficial, not merely the opinions of certain members of this House, but apparently also represent a considerable body of opinion among the Coloured people themselves. For those reasons I sincerely hope that the hon. Minister will find the time and the opportunity to give us a specific reason, quite apart from what he says he has been asked to do by the present Council for Coloured Affairs, a specific reason why he thinks it is in the interests of the Coloured people of South Africa and in the interests of the various sub-groups which he claims make up the Coloured people, to provide them with representation in such a &#x201C;split personality&#x201D; way as to ensure that they are never considered, from the point of view of the Government, as a complete group with its own culture and its own needs.</p>

<p>Sir, I am saying that paragraph (b) does away with the provision of the Electoral Act which requires the electoral officer, at the end of each month, to provide certain bodies, as well as political parties, with the changes effected to the Voters&#x2019; Roll during the course of that month. I can see no reason for that because the hon. the Minister will agree that it is most important that political organizations be provided with that information every month and that requirement <span class="col_4535-4536" refersTo="page_0960"/>now falls away in respect of the Coloured Voters&#x2019; Rolls which means that they will have to manage without it. I think the only reason the Minister can advance is that he believes there will not be any political groups amongst the Coloureds. But I think the hon. the Minister will agree that with the passage of time there will be such groups and one envisages that in the not too distant future political parties will also come into existence amongst the Coloureds. When such parties do come into existence I think the Minister will agree that it will be of the utmost importance to them to be informed every month of any changes to the Voters&#x2019; Rolls, like all parties are normally provided with that information. It may perhaps be argued that when that time arrives the necessary amendments can be effected, and the Minister may say there are not any political parties amongst the Coloureds yet, but I say they will come and then it will be necessary for the Minister to come to this House and amend this clause. I, therefore, do not think the Minister should let this clause go through as it stands at the moment.</p>

<p>I cannot agree to the amendment of the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) just simply being accepted, an amendment which will amount to this that White political parties will in future receive copies of these Voters&#x2019; Rolls. I think the hon. member realizes that that will be wrong. But what I think is a reasonable request is that if Coloured political parties were to come into existence, their rightful representatives should be provided with the lists. I have already undertaken, together with the Department and after consultation with the legal advisers, to formulate an amendment which will make it possible for the rightful representatives of Coloured political parties to acquire such copies. We shall do that in consultation with the Department of the Interior and, if possible, introduce an amendment in the Other Place.

<p>My attitude is that it is to the advantage of the Coloured to be kept out of the politics of the White man. I can imagine what will happen. No matter what the attitude of the Opposition or of the Government party towards the Coloureds may be, I envisage that, when this council has been established, there will be participation in politics, and that the Coloureds will be dragged into the politics of the White man to their own detriment as well as to the detriment of the Whites. Personally I think this provision in the existing Electoral Act that Voters&#x2019; Rolls should be made available to political parties monthly is a mistake and I think I am quite entitled to think so. My position is that because I do not belong to a recognized White political party I have to buy my Voters&#x2019; Roll whereas I understand all political parties get their lists free of charge.</p>

You will find that the Coloured organizations which are not political organizations at the moment will be dragged into the politics of the White man. One important thing will flow from that. Sir, and that is that a certain class of Coloured which is of the greatest importance to-day, the teachers, will be completely ousted; they will not be able to participate.

<p>Oh, I am getting tired of this Daantjie Scholtz story of the hon. member for Wynberg. She and her party are too afraid to say what Daantjie Scholtz said during the election and that was why I assisted him. [Interjections.] This continuous cackling gets us nowhere, Sir. We must confine ourselves to facts. Under the existing set-up I foresee that, with the next election for this Coloured council, the United Party will compete with the Progressive Party. They will throw in their money and their organizers which will result in the absolute frustration of the Coloureds and dissension amongst them and you will never know what the Coloureds really think. That is why I do not think political parties should be provided with these lists and for that reason I support the clause as it stands. I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Maitland because the object of his amendment is not merely to put the Coloureds on an equal footing, because had that been the object of the United Party it would have been reflected in their policy. The object of this amendment is not to put the Coloureds on an equal footing as far as elections <span class="col_4537-4538" refersTo="page_0961"/>are concerned but simply to give official recognition to participation by White political parties. I have information at my disposal to prove that there are members of the United Party and of the Progressive Party who are already organizing for the election of members to this Coloured council. [Interjections.] I respect the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) as an honest member who states her attitude in this House but she cannot deny that the Progressive Party has already appointed organizers amongst the Coloureds. [Interjections.] Sir, we have already heard this story before. If they do it in the Transkei why would they not do it amongst the Coloureds&#x003F; I am not reproaching anybody; I am merely stating it as a fact and it applies to the other parties as well. I think we have reached a stage where we should obtain an objective view of the future of the Coloureds alongside our own, and we can only obtain that if we allow those people to set about things in such a way that they will be able to give an objective opinion, an opinion we shall be able to respect as such. The position is that there is a difference between these Voters&#x2019; Rolls. Political parties have so far always had access to the Voters&#x2019; Rolls for members of the House of Assembly. That is why I have to buy mine while the Nationalist Party and the United Party, both of which have a great deal of money, get theirs free of charge. If there is a political party who wishes to gain control over the Coloured Representatives in this House let them avail themselves of existing legislation but I appeal to all political parties to regard the position of the Coloureds objectively. Reference is continually made to consultation. You are not consulting the Coloureds when you throw in your weight as a political party in order to get people on that council, people who will state your point of view while they cannot even become members of your party. They cannot become members of either the Nationalist Party or the United Party. I think we are doing our fellow-citizens an injustice in this regard. A large section of the White population feels we have reached the crossroads; who feels we have reached the stage where we have to find out what goes on in the mind of the Coloured and what he wants. If we want to be honest we should leave it at that and we should leave those people alone so that they can serve on the proposed council and give us an objective opinion, an opinion we shall be able to respect as representing the Coloured attitude. We should not cloud the issue by throwing money around and by appointing organizers as in the past.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) is concerned, it is naturally a pity that he does not support me. I am somewhat surprised because I have always believed him to be somebody who supported the Common Roll. But I am nevertheless pleased that the Minister is becoming more inclined to support my view in regard to the question of making Voters&#x2019; Rolls available to political parties. What worries me, however, is the hon. Minister&#x2019;s reference to Coloured parties as such. It is possible that the Coloureds will also want to belong to the Nationalist Party in which case I will find it strange that the law does not make provision for the Nationalist Party also to obtain the necessary information.

<p>With reference to what the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) has said I want to adopt a very firm attitude. I want to say explicitly that in no circumstances am I prepared to make arrangements for the lists to be made available to White political parties. That was exactly what I meant when I replied to the hon. member. If there are Coloureds who are of the opinion that parallel development is in their interests and they wish to belong to an organization to put that principle into practice they are at liberty to establish such an organization. As far as the National Party is concerned we do not allow Coloureds to become members and that is generally known. But there is nothing wrong with it whatsoever if Coloureds who subscribe to that principle want to establish their own organization. In that case we shall arrange for the lists to be made available to them if they want to take part in elections for their own council and the same must also apply to the United Party. I find it very strange, seeing that so far we have only heard about this &#x201C;travesty&#x201D; and this &#x201C;farce&#x201D; and this &#x201C;mockery&#x201D; which we are establishing, an attempt is now made to make Voters&#x2019; Rolls available for the use of White political parties. Where is the logic&#x003F; Hon. members opposite must not forget that they have adopted an attitude on principle that they want nothing to do with this whole thing. Then they must be logical and say they want these Voters&#x2019; Rolls in order to take part in this &#x201C;mockery&#x201D;. If the Coloureds wish to establish organizations to fight seats on their council on certain principles, let them do so, but I am definitely not going to accede to the hon. member&#x2019;s request. I trust I have made myself very clear.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I say that if there is a farce, it is this Minister&#x2019;s argument. There are recognized political parties which allow non-Whites to be members. There was a time when the Coloureds could be members of the Nationalist Party as well as of the United Party. They are represented in this House, and because the Coloureds&#x2019; Representatives sit here the political parties must take notice of elections in which the Coloureds take part, and therefore we found that a man like Mr. Daantjie Scholtz stood as an independent but he had the machinery of the Nationalist Party available to him. No, let us be reasonable. The fact is that the Coloureds are represented here, and the existing political parties must take note of it. Hon. members here have said that we should keep the Coloureds out of White politics, but surely it is unrealistic to say that. What is &#x201C;White politics&#x201D;, and what is &#x201C;Coloured politics&#x201D;&#x003F; Politics affects the life of every man. Three-quarters of what we discuss in this House consists of Native affairs and Coloured affairs. There is no such thing as &#x201C;White politics&#x201D;. Our lives are interwoven and what happens in the Coloured council will affect the life of the White man, just as what happens in this House affects the life of the Coloured. There is no such thing as White politics and Coloured politics. It is incomprehensible that there can be a Parliament in the year 1964 which is so unrealistic and quarrels about such inanities. But let us now view the matter from the point of view of the Coloured himself. Forget about the political parties, but let us view the matter from the point of view of the voter or the man who wants to stand as a candidate. Here the Government is now giving something to the Coloureds, but then one should at least have confidence in the Coloured voters. Then one should at least allow them to stand as candidates for the parties or organizations which they support. If a Coloured wants to stand as a candidate for a new political party, he must have the right to do so. If he would like to stand as a candidate of the United Party, then he can, as far as this party is concerned, be granted permission to do so and the voters can then elect him or reject him. But, Sir, you will see that every argument advanced by the Minister time and again amounts to a curtailment of the privileges of the voter. What else is this than a lack of confidence in the voters&#x003F; Why cannot the Coloured voter have the right to decide in what capacity he wants to stand for election to this Coloured council&#x003F; If he wants to stand as a candidate who has the co-operation of the United Party, why can he not do so&#x003F; That is his right. My objection is that the Government time and again derogates from the rights of the voter and the rights of the candidate and the rights of the voters to elect their own candidate under their own flag, whatever that might be.</p>

Surely it will only be reasonable to make an amendment so that candidates who stand under the flag of a political party which registers itself in respect of the election, or which intimates that it wants to participate in the election, whether it is the Nationalist Party or the United Party or the Progressive Party or a new party, will have the right to get information in regard to registrations in the same way that the existing parties get it today.</p>

We are now dealing with another fact; we are dealing with the fact that this Coloured council will consist of Coloureds. White people will not be able to stand as candidates for this council. The candidates will, therefore, not be Whites; they will be non-Whites. What on earth do the White political parties want to do with these voters&#x2019; lists&#x003F; That was what the hon. member for Outeniqua meant when he referred to non-White politics and White politics. Here we are dealing exclusively with a body consisting of non-Whites with which the Whites have nothing to do whatsoever. A White person cannot with the best will in the world make himself available for election to this council. Sir, one asks oneself this question: What does the United Party want to do with those voters&#x2019; lists&#x003F; They only want to stir up racial ill feeling; that is the only reason why they want these voters&#x2019; lists.</p>

I wish to remind the hon. member for Maitland that during the last three years I sat in this House as a member of the United Party, which does not support a truly Common Roll, I stood by the policy of the United Party, as it behoves a member of the United Party caucus. But since I have been freed from that he cannot give me one example where I have not expressed myself in favour of a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, and I mean a Common Roll in the true sense of the word. As a matter of fact I clearly said in my second-reading speech on this Bill that I expected this to develop in a certain direction. The hon. the Prime Minister was present when I said I demanded from the Government that this should lead to full-fledged citizenship.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I shall return to the clause, Sir, by saying that if the Voters&#x2019; Rolls for the Coloured council were made available to White political parties, the interests of the Coloureds will not be promoted in any way; it is a falsehood to say that; it is only a trick in order to be able to take part in the politics of the Coloureds. I shall in a moment deal with the distinction the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has drawn between the politics of the Coloureds and that of the Whites. If he draws that distinction I just want to ask him why his party also discriminates between the Coloureds in the various provinces, and between White and Coloureds. I want to say in all sincerity and honesty that I am of opinion that it would be fatal for those people whose interests I try to promote here and whom I represent here with all my heart and soul, to be dragged back into the politics of the White man at this stage. Why should the Coloured be concerned, as he has been concerned over all these years, with what happened on both sides during the Boer War and what had happened to the descendants of the Boers and what happened to the descendants of the English who took part in that war&#x003F; Why should the Coloured continually be concerned with the rights of the Afrikaans-speaking section and the English-speaking section&#x003F; I am firmly convinced that it was fatal for our Coloured fellow-citizens to have been concerned in that struggle because only their votes were used and they derived no benefit from it.</p>

<p>I find the attitude of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) interesting, because during the six years I have been sitting in this House I have heard him, in the same striking and eloquent way, stating the attitude of three different parties in connection with the Coloureds and when he <span class="col_4543-4544" refersTo="page_0964"/>talks he talks equally effectively, no matter on behalf of which party he talks.

Sir, I believe that in terms of the Act we are a recognized group in Parliament and that we are entitled to have our voters&#x2019; lists sent to us.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I just want to bring this thing into perspective. The amendment asks for the returns to be submitted to the political parties. What are these returns&#x003F; They are the deletions and the additions. The actual question of a Voters&#x2019; Roll is quite a simple matter. Any person who wishes to stand for this particular council can buy himself a copy of the roll; there is no difficulty about it whatsoever, but in order to keep the machinery going somebody has to take an interest. So, I want to put it to the Minister this way: He is prepared to give the roll to a recognized Coloured political party. There are four words there&#x2014;&#x201C;recognized&#x201D;, &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D;, &#x201C;political&#x201D; and &#x201C;party&#x201D;. How does a political party start&#x003F; What stage does it reach before it is recognized and what can a Coloured man&#x2019;s principles in his political party be that are not covered by the present political scene&#x003F; A Coloured man to-day is either for the Common Roll or for separate development. The one is expounded by the Nationalist Party and the other by the United Party. The Progressive Party has another point of view, and then there is the Liberal Party which also has a point of view. There may be others. The Minister has said several times that it is the aim and ambition of the Nationalist Party to uplift the Coloured man. I am quite convinced that in his anxiety to uplift the Coloured people he is not going to throw them to the wolves to develop politically in any direction they please. He is going to do his best to influence them to accept separate development. He may not do it as a Minister of State, but I am quite sure that the organization to which the hon. the Minister belongs is interested in what is going to happen to this council. They have to make it work, and I think we should keep these things fairly and squarely in the forefront of our minds. Do not let us think for a moment that the Coloured man is just going to be cast adrift and allowed to go wherever he likes. We must guide him. That has been the whole theme of this debate; he is to be guided into the proper channels. The vast majority to-day are in the proper channels, supporting the United Party.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, whether they are members or not is a side-issue. We are dealing here with the availability or otherwise of the returns in connection with the roll. It is only a matter of time, of course, before we will find that the Nationalist Party will be advocating these things in the same way as we do. They will be advocating separate development and they will probably want to keep the rolls up to date. I put it to you, Sir. How can a population of 1,500,000 Coloureds in the whole of the Republic get themselves organized without some sort of guidance from somebody&#x003F; I fought an election on the principles of the United Party and I intend to assist them because they made a correct decision, and that was in the hurly-burly of politics. Those principles were enunciated on public platforms in the course of an election campaign and they <span class="col_4547-4548" refersTo="page_0966"/>were accepted, so do not let us take refuge in the fact that these people do not know what their political affiliations are, because they do, and there are many Coloured people who are Nationalists. I think there is a picture extant showing Bruckner de Villiers of Stellenbosch being carried shoulder-high into this House on the shoulders of Coloured people. I mention this merely to show that there are or were Coloured Nationalists. I think there are very few now. The hon. the Minister as a onetime party organizer himself knows the difficulties. He is aware of the difficulty of keeping these rolls up to date. Let me put it to him this way: When there are deletions and people&#x2019;s names have been removed from the roll, whose job will it be, to see that their names are restored to the roll&#x003F; They may not know what to do. Somebody must tell them what to do. When they are disqualified because what they regard as a competent witness turns out to be an incompetent witness, what happens to them then&#x003F; These are the points that we are putting forward this afternoon and these are the points which we suggest the Minister should concede, because as an ardent politician himself he knows the value of keeping the Voters&#x2019; Roll 100 per cent up to date. Do not let us become confused on the question as to whether or not I as a member get a Voters&#x2019; Roll. I buy mine and I always have done so. I think one pays little enough for a Voters&#x2019; Roll. The political parties are spread right throughout the country and there are jobs to be done. There are deletions to be attended to and there are additions to be made, and these must be done continuously. It is no use leaving things until election day and then finding that the candidate and his helpers are abused by people who were left off the roll. Sir, I make an appeal to the hon. the Minister, who is a very knowledgeable man on this subject to accept that other knowledgeable men see these difficulties and ask him to accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to plead once again with the hon. the Minister. I foresee difficulty if the clause is amended in this way. Paragraph (b) deals exclusively with the effective working of any political machine, whether it be that of the Nationalist Party or of the United Party or any other party. The hon. the Minister has already said he has made a concession because he feels it is essential for Coloured parties as such to get the relevant Voters&#x2019; Roll information. I think it is an improvement but I think the hon. the Minister places himself in a difficult position when he starts talking about a White and a Coloured party for the simple reason that we already have parties in South Africa which are neither White nor Coloured; we already have mixed parties; some of them are represented in this House; we have the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party. It will be a brave man who says these parties are exclusively White parties or exclusively Coloured parties. But I fore see the day when the electoral officer will have to sit in judgment and that he may decide that those parties are Coloured parties in which case, for the sake of argument, you will have the position that the Progressive Party will have a Voters&#x2019; Roll and not the Nationalist Party. No, I think the hon. the Minister is creating a great deal of difficulty for himself when he tries to define when a party is a White party or a Coloured party because we already have two parties in South Africa which can be regarded in political society as mixed parties.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>As far as I personally am concerned, there are two cardinal points in regard to this clause and this amendment. The first is an anomaly in terms of the Electoral Act as it reads now, namely that I as a member of the House of Assembly cannot obtain the necessary data from the electoral officer provided for in the Act. I cannot get that information. If I want it I must buy the Voters&#x2019; Roll, and the 35c or 45c it costs, and which the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) never spent in the three or four years he was the provincial councillor for the Northern Cape, is not the point; it is not the money but the principle which is concerned. As a Member of Parliament I cannot get those data. The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) will forgive me if I correct him. Where he got his Voters&#x2019; Roll from I do not know, but he must have got it via a political party.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>The electoral officer ruled that if I want it I must buy it. A political party which does not do a tickey&#x2019;s worth in connection with the representation of my people, into which I put my heart and soul and which costs me hundreds and thousands of pounds a year, representation which I have done in such a manner that no objection can be raised against me, as the hon. member for Karoo knows, can get Voters&#x2019; Rolls and supplementary rolls, but I, as the sitting member, cannot. I feel that when we get to the stage where a Coloured council has to be elected, of which not a single member can be a member of the United Party or of the National Party, then those parties should not be entitled to the privilege of having Voters&#x2019; Rolls made available to them, because in my opinion that is quite wrong. Here we are now going to have a state of affairs where I am asked by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout: How can you talk about White politics and Coloured politics&#x003F; He knows that his own party discriminates between White and Coloured, and even between Coloured and Coloured. The fact remains that my voters cannot be members either of the United Party or of the Government Party, and then they still say I dare not distinguish. They say I may not take a distinction from our history. When it comes to Coloured political parties I think it would be a tragedy for the Coloureds at this stage if Coloured political parties were to be established <span class="col_4549-4550" refersTo="page_0967"/>now, but if it has to happen, let us review the position so that they can exist in the light of the circumstances. But at the moment there are no Coloured political parties as such.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo advanced certain arguments, but I do not know whether you, Sir, will allow me to reply to them. If you will allow me, I just want to say that reference was made to elections and to how clever the Coloured voters are, and to the hurly-burly of politics in which they were the decisive factor, but surely the hon. member is now misleading the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In view of the fact that the amendment to Clause 1 has lapsed, I do not intend moving the amendment printed in my name. I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-sections (1) and (2) and to substitute the following new sub-section:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) No person shall be nominated or elected as a member of the council unless he is qualified as provided in sub-section (1) of Section 4 to be registered as a voter.</li>

</ol>

<p>In view of the fact that this clause deals with the qualifications of members of the council, I think it is necessary to ask ourselves how the status of this council compares with that of a body like, e.g., the provincial council. He will see, Sir, that many of these qualifications are applicable to provincial councillors. In the first place, this is not a provincial council as regards status; the Minister has given this council the status of a parliament. Its field of operation is country-wide; it is not limited to specific provinces. In regard to the laws which this council can make, they will be applicable to the whole of the country. I therefore think that where one is dealing with a body which has a status approximating to parliamentary status there should not be any fundamental differences between a candidate who wants to stand for election to this council and one who wishes to stand for the Parliament of South Africa.</p>

<p>What qualifications must a candidate for this council comply with, Sir&#x003F; In the first place, a White candidate must be qualified to be registered as a voter. How does that compare with a Coloured candidate&#x003F; There are two types of candidates, the one who is nominated and the other who is elected. In the case of the one who is nominated, he must comply with two qualifications. Firstly, he should be qualified to register as a voter. In the case of the one who is elected, it is provided that he should not only qualify &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; to register, but his name must actually appear on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. Apart from the fact that there is discrimination here between the elected and the nominated member, it is also true, on the other hand, that there is a real difference between the qualifications with which a White candidate for this House must comply and those with which a Coloured candidate for this council must comply. In so far as the discrimination is concerned, I honestly think that the hon. the Minister should reconsider this matter before going so far as to draw a real distinction between the qualifications necessary for a nominated member and those necessary for an elected member. In fact, I really think that the person who is only qualified to be registered is really the person whom the voters should elect. The Minister is here granting the Coloured voter the sovereign power to elect somebody himself and I do not believe that that sovereign power should be less than that of the White voter.</p>

<p>In the second instance, we have the question of the residential qualification. The Coloured candidate must have lived in the province for two years before he can be a candidate. That is of course applicable in so far as provincial councils are concerned. Here the council is therefore again on a provincial council basis, although its status is that of a parliament. But the Minister says no, whether he is nominated or elected, the member&#x2019;s status is not really higher than that of a provincial councillor. I really think the hon. the Minister should reconsider the matter. He should clearly tell these people: Just as a White Member of Parliament will have the right to live anywhere, so you will have the same right. If the voters want a particular person, it should be their exclusive right to say that they want him. The Minister should not tell them which candidate they should elect. If the hon. the Minister wants to nominate somebody, he perhaps still has that right, but when it comes to an elected member, and where the Coloured people now for the first time have the right to exercise one man, one vote, even in the language of the Government, the Minister should not say to them: Look, I say you must appoint this or that candidate because of his residential qualifications. If, for the sake of argument, the Coloureds of the Free State want to elect a candidate who lives in the Transvaal, they should be at liberty to do so. Unless we do that, Sir, I think we are discriminating unnecessarily <span class="col_4553-4554" refersTo="page_0969"/>against the Coloured. I really do not think the hon. the Minister should have too strong feelings in regard to this matter. I therefore hope that he will accept my amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (b) of sub-section (1); and to omit sub-section (2).</block>

<p>In terms of Clause 4 (1) which this Committee has already approved, we have already laid down the qualifications that must be complied with in order to become a voter on this new Voters&#x2019; Roll. Clause 4 (1) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of this Act every Coloured person who is a South African citizen and is over the age of 21 years, and who is not subject to any of the disqualifications &#x2026; shall have the right to be registered as a voter on the Coloured voters&#x2019; list.</block>

<p>In other words, every Coloured person who is a South African citizen and who is over the age of 21 years shall be entitled to register as a voter. All that we ask in my amendment is that it shall be competent for a voter to be nominated if he is qualified to become a voter under this list. In other words, once he is qualified as a voter there should be no bar to his being nominated as a member of this proposed council. Clause 10 (1) (b) places further restrictions on anyone who wishes to be elected as a member of this council. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(b) he has for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of his nomination resided in the province he is nominated to represent, and continues to reside there.</li>

</ol>

<p>I do not think there is any reason for this additional restriction. The provisions which apply to persons who desire to become members of this House are dealt with in our own Constitution, Act 32 of 1961. Section 46 of that Act says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall be qualified to be a member of the House of Assembly under this Act unless</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) he is qualified to be registered as a voter to the election of the House of Assembly &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>in any one of the provinces, Sir, and&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(b) he has resided for five years within the limits of the Republic &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>Mark this, Mr. Chairman, this is not continuous residence; then he must be a White person and a South African citizen. All we are asking is that similar provisions should be incorporated in this Bill as far as the Coloureds are concerned. In other words, Sir, that a man or woman who qualifies in terms of Clause 4 (1) to be registered as a voter should be entitled to be nominated or elected as a member of this council. We think it imposes an unnecessary restriction on the Coloureds by allowing 10 (b) to remain in existence. The same provision does not apply in the case of the Whites and we see no reason why it should apply in the case of the Coloureds. We see no justification for imposing a further restriction upon the Coloured people.</p>

<p>We think the provision in regard to a continuous period of residence in a particular province may lead to a great deal of hardship. I want to point out that this same provision does not apply in the case of Whites and that has not been imposed for a very good reason. There have been many instances of people being elected to this House who have never at any time of their lives resided in the constituencies they represent. There have been cases where members have never resided in the same province in which their constituencies are situated. Take the case of the present Minister of Foreign Affairs. His is a very good example. The constituency of Beaufort West decided to elect a person who is normally resident in the Transvaal. They chose him, Sir, and why should they not have that right&#x003F; There is another instance. When the hon. Minister of Finance resided in Cape Town permanently he represented a constituency in the Free State and they chose him voluntarily. Why should that position not obtain in the case of the Coloureds&#x003F; If the Coloureds in the Transvaal know of an outstanding man who lives permanently in Cape Town why should they not have the right to elect him&#x003F; The point I wish to make is this: As long as they are South African citizens and as long as they qualify in terms of Clause 4 (1) to become registered voters and as long as they are resident in the Republic of South Africa there can be no harm at all in giving them the same freedom of action as that enjoyed in electing members of this House. There is no politics involved in this, Sir; this is a reasonable request. I would urge the Minister to give consideration to what is proposed in this amendment.</p>

<p>In any case, I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to sub-section (2) as printed. It is absolutely meaningless as printed. The English version reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person other than a person registered on the Coloured voters&#x2019; list who has for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of his election resided in the province in which he is situated &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is quite obvious that the hon. the Minister himself must move the deletion of &#x201C;he&#x201D; in line 58, otherwise this is meaningless. I do not know whether it is a bad translation or a printing error.</p>

Why should they not have the same right as the voters of Beaufort West had of electing the person of their choice to represent them in this House, notwithstanding the fact that that person does not live in that constituency or even in the same province&#x003F; I would earnestly urge upon the Minister to give serious consideration to this reasonable request.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will see some merit in both the amendments moved by the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) and the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). If the hon. the Minister were to look at this clause again, he will agree that he is making it unnecessarily easy for him to nominate a member to this council, and he is making it unnecessarily difficult for the Coloured people to elect a member to this council. I do not believe that was his intention. I especially wish to draw his attention to the marked difference in approach as between sub-section (1) (a) of Clause 10 and sub-section (2). Sub-section (1) (a) permits the Minister to nominate a member to this council even if that person is not on the Coloured Voters&#x2019; Roll, but is merely qualified to be on it. One would assume, Sir, that any man who regarded this council with sufficient respect&#x2014;which means, of course, that he agrees with the Minister&#x2019;s valuation of this proposed council&#x2014;would certainly take the trouble, if he were qualified, to make sure he was on the roll. I would imagine that one of the criteria the Minister would apply before electing a nominee for this council would be the interest of that particular individual, not only in the general interests of the Coloured people, but in the Coloured Persons Representative Council itself as an instrument to make known the wishes of the Coloured people. The hon. the Minister must agree that there will surely be cases where he wants to nominate somebody, but finds that that person is not on the roll despite the fact that he is qualified to be on it. Will he, in that case, say, &#x201C;despite the fact that the man has not even taken the trouble to register I am going to nominate him&#x201D;&#x003F; I think he will agree that that will create a very poor impression among the Coloured people, because the position will then arise where he will have disregarded the failure of an individual who is qualified to be enrolled as a voter to make sure that his name is on the roll, as being evidence of the fact that he is not even interested in exercising his vote! With that disability a person such as that surely would have, as the Americans say, &#x201C;a strike against him&#x201D; when the Minister comes to consider a list of nominees. Nevertheless, as the clause stands the Minister takes unto himself the right to nominate a person who is not on the roll. But when it comes to (2), Sir&#x2014;and the point has been made in another way by the hon. member for Peninsula&#x2014;then the Minister says that the person concerned, being the elected member, must have resided for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of his election in the province in which the constituency is situated which he represents. In support of the hon. member for Peninsula, I give the example of a constituency, say Coronation-ville in Johannesburg, in the Transvaal, wishing to elect a person as their representative who has always lived where the majority of the Cape Coloured people live, in the Western Province; as one sees it now, this is not going to be a full-time job, nor is there any indication that the remuneration of a member of this council will be on such a scale that he will be enabled to resign from all other employment, or surrender all other sources of income&#x2014;that person will then be faced with the choice of either accepting nomination two years in advance of an election, moving to the province from where the nomination has been offered him, as it were, and thus qualify himself to be a representative of that constituency, or refusing to serve his people! I doubt whether the hon. Minister intended that&#x2014;that is, if he was serious in saying, as he has said in this House, that the Coloured Persons Representative Council is the instrument of the Coloured people in which they will express their opinion, and which is the means whereby they will be able to uplift themselves. &#x201C;Uplift themselves&#x201D;&#x2014;the do-it-yourself technique of uplift is the one that he prefers. If that is the case, you may well have the position where a Coloured man has lived, say in Cape Town, for many years and knows as a leader of his people that there is a dearth of leadership among the Coloured people, say, in the Transvaal, and is self-sacrificing enough to go and live there years before an election so that he may have the opportunity of representing, shall I say, Coronation-ville, as a constituency, because there they have not found anybody in whom they have sufficient confidence to ask that person to represent them. According to this clause, this genuine Coloured individual who wishes to help his own people&#x2014;which is what the Minister says he wants that man to do&#x2014;will be precluded from making that sacrifice, from taking up residence say six months before an election in the Transvaal, in Johannesburg, even in the constituency itself, Coronation-ville, because the hon. Minister says that he must have lived there for two years before he can be a candidate. For all those reasons I think the case has been made out to be completely unanswerable&#x2014;except on the basis that the hon. Minister will accept the amendments <span class="col_4557-4558" refersTo="page_0971"/>proposed&#x2014;and I sincerely hope that if he is not going to do so, the Minister will give us some reasons for the refusal of these arguments that have been directed to him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not say much. Sir, because I have already dealt with the matter during the second-reading debate. The problem we are dealing with here is totally different from the one in regard to the Whites. The persons who will be elected will be persons who will act as the leaders of that community. It will not assist that community in the least if a person living in Johannesburg, for example, makes himself available for election in Queenstown. Within perhaps ten years, or any time in the future, when upliftment work has been done, the position may possibly change. I foresee one practical difficulty, however, and that is in the case of a person who lives, say, in Aliwal North, represents that constituency, and just moves across the Orange River. In that case it may perhaps be possible for the Minister to effect an amendment to the effect that where a person moves across the river the Minister will have the right to approve of his representing that constituency. I foresee that practical difficulty. We have had the case of Jan Kempdorp where a person may perhaps go and live just across the border in which case he is disqualified. However, I think that is a problem which we can easily solve. Generally, however, I think it is quite right to retain the two-year qualification. It will not assist that community in the Queenstown constituency at all if their leader lives in Johannesburg. Of what value will he be to the Coloured community in Queenstown&#x003F; That is the whole problem. As I said during the second-reading debate, the Coloureds themselves say the person should be living in the constituency and that nobody from outside must represent that constituency. That was how strongly they felt about this point because they felt that person must do upliftment work.</p>

<p>The position of the Whites is completely different. The non-White persons remain the leaders who have to uplift that community. Hon. members must please remember that the Coloureds themselves realize that they have not reached that stage of development which the Whites have reached. They themselves argued in the Coloured council that they would much rather have the person who is their leader living in that constituency so that he can give the necessary lead in order to uplift that community. As far as the two-year residential qualification is concerned we must retain that in order to maintain the principle of leadership.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Before the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) spoke I could not conceive of any possible justification for the inclusion of this clause and now that I have heard the hon. member, I still cannot see any justification. I cannot imagine how one can say to a representative: You will be confined to this constituency as long as you represent these people and you must have been there for two years before you can be elected. The example I gave in the second reading, which has not been mentioned in Committee, was this: Supposing the hon. Minister decides that the seat of this parliament will be in Cape Town. I can quite conceive a Johannesburg representative or a Free State representative saying: Now that I have been elected I am going to live in the Cape, but I shall be coming back to the Transvaal or the Free State in the recess. As I do now; I go back to the Transvaal whenever I have the opportunity. But we are constrained to remain here in Cape Town while Parliament is sitting. These members from the Transvaal and the Free State, should the seat be here in Cape Town, would then perhaps find it convenient to live in the Cape. If the hon. Minister says that the seat is going to be in Pretoria, I can quite conceive that Cape Town members would wish to live in the Transvaal. Why we should say to these Coloured people, &#x201C;You are the leaders of your community and therefore you must stay in your province&#x201D;, I cannot understand. As the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) says, he cannot even move across the river, he cannot live across the river. I think it is the height of absurdity. I can think of nothing that will bring greater ridicule upon us more readily than the inclusion of a provision of this kind.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) wants a member to limit his constituency and he advanced certain arguments in favour of that. But the point here is that a person, if he wants to become a candidate, should have lived there for two years previously. Even though he may decide to live there after the election, he is still prohibited from standing as a candidate because he must have resided there for two years previously.</p>

<p>There are two objections we should like to raise to this clause. The one was dealt with by the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel). To us it seems to be an anomaly that a man who is nominated need not be registered on the Voters&#x2019; Roll, but only the man who has to be elected. I cannot see the sense in that anomaly. Nor do I think that the other provision in regard to the period of two years can be justified in any way, and it is unfair towards the voters. The whole object of the election surely is that one wants to give the people the opportunity to elect somebody whom they like, whom they trust, who is able to say what he wants to say and who will look after their interests. The Minister may now say that we raise this point for other reasons, but purely on the merits I believe that one should trust the voters. One must give the voter the opportunity to decide whom <span class="col_4559-4560" refersTo="page_0972"/>he wants to have, and if he wants to have a man from another community, then let him. Why should we now tell him that he may not elect this or that man. I think it is an unfair limitation on the voters themselves. Let us mention one or two practical instances which come to mind. One may have the case of a Coloured youth who grew up in a particular district and went to study, e.g., in the Cape. There is only one Coloured university. Now he comes to the Cape for three years, and after having studied at the Western Cape University he decides to remain in the Cape a little while longer to study further. Now an election takes place. He grew up in a district in the Transvaal where an election is taking place. Now this youth who was born there but who was absent temporarily for some reason, and who knows the community well, cannot stand for election. During those two years he was not resident in that constituency continuously. Therefore they cannot elect their best candidate because he was absent from the constituency during the two years preceding the election, because he was being educated elsewhere, or for other purposes. One can also mention other instances to indicate that it will be the voters who will suffer. I think that this is an unnecessary and unfair limitation on the voters.</p>

<p>It also creates much uncertainty. We know that in terms of our own laws when it comes to taxation, etc., the term &#x201C;residence&#x201D; is one which creates problems. There are people who have interests in various provinces, and they often have trouble with the Receiver of Revenue in regard to where they actually reside. There are people who reside in more than one place. But now a second element comes into it. Now the Minister is still creating the element of continuous residence. That is another complication. It is very difficult to prove that a man has lived in a place continuously for two years. Take the case of a Coloured builder. He may have gone to work in another province temporarily. He settled there only for a few months, but that breaks his continuous residence for two years before an election. The question then immediately arises as to what his legal position is. Did he live at his old address for two years, or did he not live there continuously for two years&#x003F; One has the same problem with relief staff. I think the whole thing is not only unnecessary, but it will create a large number of difficulties, the difficulty of proving the residential qualification plus the continuous element of it. In any case, the people who are elected are not going to represent provinces; they will represent people, and the Coloureds do not differ so much from province to province. I do not think there is any good reason for it, and we want to ask the Minister urgently to reconsider this matter and to amend it. I suspect that one argument may be that this is the position in connection with the provincial councils, that a man who wants to stand for the provincial council must live in the province and that he must be a registered voter. That applies to the provincial councils, but we should remember that there are four provincial councils, and in essence the provincial council is a body which represents the province, and therefore this limitation exists, and it is understandable. But here we are dealing with a Union body. The name of the present body is the Union Coloured Council. If there were four representative Coloured councils, one for each province, it would be logical. But one cannot compare this Coloured council with the four provincial councils in the various provinces. This is a Union body and the standpoint ought to be quite different. But there is a further complication, viz. that if a man changes his place of residence after his election, even though it is only temporary, he loses his seat. Then he disqualifies himself. Then the problem will crop up of the man who is, e.g., a builder. We will have difficulties continuously. His opponents will complain that he has lost his qualification. The Minister will find himself in one difficulty after another, and there will be one by-election after another. If his voters have elected him and they want him and he has to go to another province to work there, why should he then be disqualified&#x003F; This clause creates a multitude of problems, and I really cannot see why the Minister wants to retain this clause.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>We can only live up to the spirit of the parliamentary system if we take into account the diversity of the population of the country when it comes to the distribution of the representatives. Where we are living in such a big country like South Africa we are faced with various problems and various aspects of problems in the different far corners of the country. The parliamentary system can only function effectively, can only be democratic in essence, if you take that diversity of problems into account. That is why we have the position, when it comes to the delimitation of constituencies, that you try to get various people who live in the same circumstances, in the same constituency. I admit we do not always succeed but that is the object of our delimitation. Why is that so&#x003F; Because we try to bring certain group interests together when delimitating constituencies. That is even the position more so when you are dealing with an area the size of South Africa where the problems of the Free State differ of necessity from those of the Cape Province, for example. You want the people of the Free State to deal with their own problems and you do not want to send people from the Cape Province to go and force things down their throats. The position is that we shall be undermining the entire democratic system if we were to say: &#x201C;Look everybody is free to stand anywhere.&#x201D; That particularly applies in the case of the Coloureds. We must take into account the fact that we are dealing with people who have not yet had a great deal of experience of the parliamentary system.</p>

<p><span class="col_4561-4562" refersTo="page_0973"/>What means have we at our disposal, if our attitude is to protect certain people who, as a group, have the same interests&#x003F; The only means, of course, is to ensure that a specific person from within that group, and from within those interests, is elected for that group. That is the only method because if you did not have that restriction it will mean that once somebody has been elected, you will have no means at your disposal to get rid of him or of getting him to resign. There you have the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). At one time he represented the people of Namib who asked him specifically to become a South West African. The hon. member knows there is a provision in the constitution of the National Party of South West Africa that nobody who is not resident in South West may, without permission of the head committee of the party, be elected in South West.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>That is not a legal provision.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is a provision in the constitution of the National Party and that shows what the desirable position is. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is aware of it. The National Party of South West, in particular, realizes the value of such a provision. But I want to go further. What other weapon can you use against a person who, having been elected, goes and lives somewhere else and you cannot get rid of him&#x003F; The only remedy you have is the one provided for in this Bill, namely, that he must have resided in that particular constituency for a period not less than two years (or any other period). I am talking about a constituency but our provinces have such a variety of problems that what applies to a constituency applies all the more to a province. If this provision were deleted it would mean that a political party in the Cape Province, for instance, any Progressive Party or Liberal Party or Nationalist Party or United Party amongst the Coloured which had the money would be able to afford to force his candidate down the throats of people in the Free State or Natal or the Transvaal. Others may perhaps not have the money to organize on such a country-wide basis. What will be the result&#x003F; Eventually you will have a Coloured council which will simply consist of people who incidentally had the money to organize effectively so that they were all appointed to that council. The interests of the voters in the Free State, for instance, will simply not be represented on that legislative body. That is why I say the only way of protecting the Coloureds themselves, is by means of this particular provision. We do not wish to protect the agitator type or the type who organizes on a country-wide basis. We want to protect the Coloureds as a nation because we are anxious for them to exercise their influence in this Legislative body and I think this is the only way in which it can be done.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. Minister will reconsider this question. The arguments which have just been put up by the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe) are not a justification for the clause before the House at all. He has referred to the clause, but in the whole of his discussion he has justified it only by the example of his party in South West Africa which requires not that a person must reside in a constituency but that he must reside in South West Africa. What the hon. member in effect put up was a plea that the person concerned should reside in the province in which the particular constituency is. That is not what this clause says. It says that the person must reside in the particular division for which he is standing.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am sorry, but the effect of the introduction of limitations of this nature simply brings about that you get a council which will be less able than the council which could have been elected, and a council which is not necessarily in accord with the wishes of the people in the constituency concerned. It will have that effect. Limitations of this sort have not been found necessary so far as this country is concerned. The case which has been quoted of the provincial councils is not in point at all. This is a council for the whole country and I hope that the hon. Minister is prepared to reconsider this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>The brevity of the speech of the hon. member, who is a frontbencher, proves that he has not read the Bill, otherwise he would have spoken at greater length. He missed the whole point because we are dealing here with provincial boundaries and not with the boundaries of constituencies. The hon. member was honest enough to admit that he had made a mistake. But speaker after speaker of the Opposition tried to make the outside world believe that this Bill imposes the restriction that the so-called candidate must live in the specific constituency in which he stands as candidate. Of course, that is not the case. The clause provides that he must live within the province. The entire argument of the United Party therefore collapses because they are trying to compare the powers, the rights and the position of the Coloured council which is to be constitute, with those of this Parliament and because they want to give the same rights and powers and privileges to the council as those enjoyed by this Parliament, whereas the Coloured council as it is constituted here is not going to be the equal of our Parliament but the equal of a predecessor of this Parliament many years ago. That is why I want to compare the position of this council and the question as to where the candidates have to live with a corresponding body and a corresponding position in our constitutional development, that is to say, the Legislative <span class="col_4563-4564" refersTo="page_0974"/>Assembly of 1834 and its position in those days. That Assembly was more or less on a par with this Coloured council although the Coloured council will have wider powers than that body had.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hasson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. HASSON</person>:</from>

<p>That was a provincial body.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>At the time, of course, there was still no Union. That Legislative Assembly had to deal specifically with the whole of the Cape Province at that stage. The Free State and the Transvaal were still Republics at that stage and they had nothing to do with this development. That Assembly of 1834 consisted of 12 members all of whom were nominated. Six of those nominated members were officials whose names could not appear on the Voters&#x2019; Roll because they were not allowed to participate in politics. Six of those members were officials who were appointed by the Governor at the time. The other six were colonists who were also appointed. All 12 were appointed. I do not say that the present council is more or less the same but they are more or less comparable. The next step in that development was Representative Self-Government in 1854. That body consisted of two houses, an upper house and a lower house, and once again had very strict limitations imposed upon it. Eight of those members had to be resident in and eligible for election in the Western Province and seven had to be resident in and eligible for election in the Eastern Province. There was that specific delimitation. The next step was the Legislative Assembly which consisted of 46 elected members but in this case there were not such strict limitations. This specific provision did apply, however, to the executive authority of this body. That is why one cannot compare this Coloured Council which is to be established with our own Parliament. We should compare this council with a body of equal standing in our process of development and then we will be able to make true comparisons as far as rights and privileges are concerned. I also want to make this next point. In their policy the United Party draw a distinction between the Coloureds in the Cape and Natal and between the Coloureds in the Free State and the Transvaal. According to their policy, the Coloureds in the Cape and Natal will be put back on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll while the Coloureds in the Transvaal and the Free State will be placed on a separate roll. The reason which they specifically mention in their statement of policy is that the Coloureds in the Transvaal and the Free State have not yet had suffici&#x00EB;nt experience of constitutional matters, that they have not developed sufficiently and that they do not have the necessary background. That is what their own policy provides for. When this Bill provides that a candidate must reside in the province in which he stands for election, I say that that is being done deliberately so that the Coloureds in the provinces which have not yet had the necessary experience of constitutional development and in which they have not yet had the opportunity to develop, will be placed in a position where they can elect their own representatives who can gain experience in regard to this matter and will then be able to guide their own people. We do not want the Cape Coloureds to represent those people. In this way all the provinces will benefit and will be able to reach the stage of development which is their eventual aim. Once the work of upliftment has been done and the necessary experience has been gained by the Coloureds in the Transvaal and the Free State, this Union body can eventually grow and develop into a full-fledged parliament. We will then be able to make provision to enable them to choose a candidate from any part of the country. But in the meantime, it is necessary for this protection to be given. The Cape members object. They say that the inexperienced Transvaal Coloureds should not be allowed to stand as candidates in the Cape. I think the picture is very clear; I think that is the purpose behind the whole clause and that the Opposition are making a mistake in trying to compare this body with this Parliament. It is not the equivalent of this Parliament. They must not distort my argument by saying that I want to transport the Coloureds back to 1834. This process development will be able to take place far more quickly. The same Legislative Council of 1834 in the Cape was also set up in the Transvaal in 1903, and during the period of four years up to 1907 developed into a free parliament governing themselves That is why it is perfectly clear that the Coloured will not have to start so far back but he has to start somewhere and develop to the next stage and the length of time it takes him to do so will depend upon the Coloured population itself.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>There are two very important aspects I wish to deal with immediately. The first is that I want to repudiate with all the emphasis at my command the statement by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel), and which the Minister has also made from time to time in this debate, that the Coloured people have not yet reached the standard of political maturity. I repudiate that on behalf of the Coloureds. I say there are thousands of Coloured people whose intellectual standards and sagacity are much higher than those of many members of this House. I say it is an insult to the thousands of Coloured intellectuals to continue to base this type of legislation on that erroneous, insulting basis that these people have not reached that standard.</p>

<p>My next point is that the Minister wishes to place a restriction on the Coloureds politically which is not placed on the White people, and I will accept nothing less for the Coloureds than what the White man has. Therefore I demand for the Coloured man the same political rights as the White man has. Why does the Minister restrict the right of the elected member, but not of the nominated member&#x003F; The Minister knows that there are one or two members of the present council whom he will <span class="col_4565-4566" refersTo="page_0975"/>renominate.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I am trying to prove that the restrictions on the elected member in terms of Clause 10 do not apply to the nominated members. I do not want to mention names, but there is one man who will be renominated to represent the Malays. It does not say the Malays of a particular province. If that man moves from the Cape to the Transvaal six months before he gets the nomination, he can still be nominated. It does not matter where he lives. [Interjections.] Whereas there is a restriction with regard to the elected members, at least with regard to some nominated members there is no restriction as to where they should live. I therefore suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this.</p>

<p>I also want to make this point. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) tells this Committee that he was influenced, together with the Minister, by the present council. They did not even want the man to be resident in the province, but in the constituency. The majority of the present council are nominated members who the Minister says he nominated because they follow his policy. I say there are sufficient people amongst the Coloureds in South Africa to-day who have the education and the experience and the political acumen who can stand for this council and be a credit to it, but the Minister is placing a restriction on people who can represent the Coloureds.

<p>I am sorry, but I cannot accept the amendments moved by hon. members. In the first place, reference has been made to the difference in approach as far as nominated members are concerned&#x2014;the fact that they are only expected to qualify for registration as voters. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) referred to the principle laid down in sub-section (2) in regard to elected members, that is to say, that they must be registered voters. Yes, there is a difference in this regard and it is a practical difference. It is possible in nominating a member to determine in advance whether he complies with the qualifications. A certain amount of time has to elapse while an investigation takes place and by the time the Minister has made the nomination he will have satisfied himself that that man has the necessary qualifications. But in the case of the elected member he is nominated immediately and it may not be possible within the limited time available to ascertain whether he complies with the qualifications or not. That is why this proviso has been inserted.</p>

As far as the representations made to me to suspend the two-year provision are concerned, I just want to say that I think the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe) has given the House a very comprehensive reply in that regard; he has answered all the objections raised by hon. members and I do not have much to add to what he has said except to say this: The other day, when we were discussing another clause, I said that it was our intention&#x2014;I said that there was a strong possibility that this would happen&#x2014;to allow this council to develop in such a way that its members can be divided into subcommittees in order to look after the interests of specific provinces in regard to certain matters. That is why it is of primary importance to retain that principle. The same position obtains in our provincial councils. But there is a second reason and that is that we are dealing here with an electorate, 70 per cent to 80 per cent of whom have no knowledge of the vote and legislative bodies and it is necessary therefore for people who know what their interests are to represent them. Secondly, however, one is dealing here with people the majority of whom are poor. One therefore places the person who is a local resident in a disadvantageous position if he has to compete with a candidate who is imported from elsewhere by a financially strong group to fight the seat. That is one of the reasons for this provision; we want to combat the influence of unhealthy and financially powerful groups in a particular constituency. Hon. members may argue that they demand the same treatment for the Coloured as for the White. These are all &#x201C;clich&#x00E9;s&#x201D; because we know that 70 per cent of these people do not have the political experience of the White man. For these reasons I do not see my way clear to comply with the requests of hon. members. I have listened very carefully to their arguments but I think the clause must go through as it has been drawn up.</p>

<p>I do not altogether agree with the arguments advanced by the hon. the Minister. I still think that these two amendments are very good, and I want to raise two aspects which worry me. The one is based on the question of where do these Cabinet Ministers reside&#x003F; It is becoming obvious that the intention is that this council should function mainly through its executive. If that is the case, the executive which will do the work will consist of about four people who will be like Cabinet Ministers. If four people constitute the executive and they are going to look after education, <span class="col_4567-4568" refersTo="page_0976"/>local authorities, health, etc. throughout the Republic, they will obviously be four very busy men, and if the seat of the council is in Cape Town, they will not only come down here just when it is in session, they will be full-time and will have to be in their offices for 12 months of the year. The point is: Where do they reside under those circumstances&#x003F; Will they in fact reside in their constituencies or where will they in fact reside&#x003F; I foresee that difficulty and I want to put it to the Minister at this stage. On the wording of the clause I think that will constitute a difficulty. A man may be on the executive and he comes from the Northern Transvaal, but he will be constantly required to be present in Cape Town, and it will not take him long to make up his mind that he cannot travel backwards and forwards, and he will live as near to his job as possible.</p>

<p>Read the clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Well, let us read it. Let us take first of all the nominated members. He has for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of his nomination to have resided in the province for which he is nominated, &#x201C;and continues to reside there&#x201D;. What does that mean&#x003F; What happens if he does not continue to reside there&#x003F; The point has been made here, and it has not been denied, that if he does not continue to reside there he loses his nomination. Why have the double qualification&#x003F; If he only needs two years&#x2019; residence to qualify for nomination, why add &#x201C;and continues to reside there&#x201D;&#x003F; Why are those words added&#x003F; Would it not be better to take out the words &#x201C;and continues to reside there&#x201D;&#x003F; Then we come to the position that the Minister tries to put to us, but as long as it remains as it is it means that he must continue to reside there after he has been nominated, and the same applies to people who are elected. It is obvious that the Minister has the same impression of it. He must first qualify for nomination or election by residing there for two years continuously, and then having been nominated or elected he must continue to reside there, and if he does not continue to reside there he is no longer qualified. If I am wrong the Minister should tell me.</p>

<p>My next point is this. I cannot quite align the control envisaged by this clause to a request made by the hon. the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, in addressing the Coloured people, expressed the desire that they should come back to the Cape Province, although he made it quite clear that there was no compulsion on them to do so, at any rate at this stage. His ultimate objective is to bring the Coloured people from the other provinces back to the Cape as far as possible. If that is the desire and the policy of the Department, what happens to a Coloured man, e.g. from Natal, who would like to comply with that request and come back to the Cape&#x003F; He may be a representative of the Coloureds in Natal, and he might bring a big group of people from Natal whom he has represented there. He comes to the Cape and he is automatically disqualified for two years from either being nominated or elected to represent those people with whom he comes, or to whom he returns, because he might be returning to a group of his own people. But he must live with them for two years before he can represent them. As the Minister has said, these will be working class constituencies where people have to work, and those people might well ask such a man to come and live amongst them and represent them, but for two years he cannot do so, so who will represent those people&#x003F; The Minister may say it is improbable, but it can happen, because the Prime Minister has expressed the wish that the Coloureds may return to the Cape, and the Minister may find himself in the position where he might have to do some delimitation and has to re-allocate seats between the provinces. What happens to these people then&#x003F; These people will be automatically disqualified under this clause from being nominated or elected for two years.</p>

<p>The hon. member has convinced me as far as the words &#x201C;and continuously reside there&#x201D; are concerned. I think those words should be deleted in both cases.

<p>We welcome this change, even though it does not go far enough. We now understand that if a member changes his place of residence after his election, it will not affect his seat. But I am still not satisfied with the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in regard to the difference between nominated and elected members in so far as registration is concerned. Whatever the Minister may have said in regard to residential qualifications, this point in regard to registration is not satisfactory. The Minister&#x2019;s argument was that it is possible, if a man is nominated, first to ascertain whether he complies with the qualifications, but that it is not so easy to do so if he is nominated as a candidate in an election. That is surely a very weak argument because every Member of Parliament, on the day he is nominated before the presiding officer, must afford proof that he qualifies to stand as a candidate, and if anything is wrong he is disqualified. Who will dare to do so, because surely anybody knows that sooner or later it will be discovered and then he will be disqualified&#x003F; I really think that the Minister has not made out any case here at all. What causes one further concern is that he is now again going to give a special advantage to the nominated people. Now the elected person is again in an unfavourable position as against the nominated one, and that will continuously be hurled at him. I think the Minister is causing trouble for himself, and his argument is not well founded, and I ask that he should change the position so that the two types of members have to comply with the same qualifications.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I think the committee appreciates that the Minister has decided to omit the words &#x201C;and continues to reside there&#x201D; in sub-section (1) (b) and sub-section (2) of Clause 10. It is certainly a step in the right direction, but I want to ask him to give some consideration to eliminating the words &#x201C;for a continuous period&#x201D; of not less than two years. I want to put this to the Minister. It may well be that a prominent Coloured man has resided for many years, possibly all his life, in a particular area in a particular province, who for a period has to go elsewhere for, say, professional reasons. Take the example of a Coloured doctor who has lived in the City of Cape Town for many years. He then proceeds overseas to specialize; he comes back and finds that he is in the midst of an election. That man will not have resided for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of his nomination, in the province. He may only miss it by&#x2014;who knows&#x2014;a few months. Surely a man like that should not be debarred from being elected as a representative of the Coloured people if he has their confidence. I again want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to what the position is in terms of our own constitution. In terms of our own Constitution, Act 32 of 1961, which is the Act constituting the Republic of South Africa, we bore in mind this very aspect that I am dealing with when we dealt with the question of qualification of members of the House of Assembly. What we said there was that no person shall be qualified to be a member of the House of Assembly under this Act unless, amongst other things, he is qualified to be a registered voter, unless he is a White person and a South African citizen in terms of our Citizenship Act, and the other proviso was, &#x201C;unless he has resided for five years within the limits of the Republic&#x201D;. Sir, all I am asking the hon. the Minister to do is to change this clause effectively so that if a man has resided for two years within the limits of the province, he will be entitled to be elected. If you are going to impose this very onerous restriction that he must have resided here for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of his nomination, then you come up against these cases that I have already mentioned. I mentioned the case of an eminent doctor, for instance, who travelled overseas to specialize. He is away for a period and comes back in the midst of an election, although he has resided in the Cape Province all his life; such a person will be debarred from election because it so happens that for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of his nomination he has not resided within the province. Then again there are Coloured people, for example, in the Public Service. A man may have been resident in Cape Town for many, many years or practically all his life, but because of the exigencies of the service he is suddenly transferred out of this province, to another province; he comes back here in the midst of an election; he has the confidence of his fellow-Coloured men; he wants to stand as a candidate and they want to elect him as their representative but they are precluded from electing him merely because he has not resided in this province continuously for a period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of nomination. If we want to be helpful to the Coloured people, if we want to give them the facility of electing people of their own choice in whom they have confidence, then I say the hon. the Minister must give consideration to what I suggest is a very reasonable approach to this matter. Once the obligation to continue to reside in the province is eliminated, what earthly reason can there be for precluding a man, who has come back to the province in which he formerly resided, from being elected merely because he does not happen to have been here continuously for two years preceding the date of nomination. I honestly feel that the hon. the Minister would eliminate a great deal of unnecessary hardship in the case of the Coloured community if he were to give consideration to the suggestion which I make to him seriously and that is to place the qualifications and the rights of Coloured candidates on the same footing as the qualifications of Europeans who stand as candidates for election as members of the House of Assembly. I think if the Minister leaves this clause as it now reads he will merely be inflicting a hardship on these Coloured <span class="col_4571-4572" refersTo="page_0978"/>people, and I ask him therefore to reconsider his attitude to the amendments which have been proposed here.</p>

<p>Sir, I wish to speak to the amendment standing in the name of the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood). With your permission, Sir, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 27, to omit &#x201C;a casting vote only&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;no vote&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The object of this is to bring it into line with the procedure followed in other statutory bodies where the chairman for the time being, for good reasons, being an official of a Department he should have and in fact has no vote of any sort, including a casting vote. I want to give you the example of one statutory body, namely, the South African Pharmacy Board appointed by regulation arising out of legislation. In the case of that board whose activities are regulated by <i>Government Gazette Notice</i> No. 438 of 7 March 1930 and by several others up to 23 August 1957 under the heading &#x201C;Rules Relating to the Conduct of the Business of the South African Pharmacy Board and other Matters&#x201D; it is provided that at the election of president or chairman&#x2014;of course, the matter of the election of a chairman is relevant here&#x2014;and in the case of an equality of votes a further ballot shall be taken, and if that be indecisive, the elections shall be decided by drawing lots. The hon. the Minister may have a very good reason for not adopting this well-worn procedure which is apparently recognized in our Statutes and choosing, in this case, to give the Secretary for Coloured Affairs or his nominee, when acting as chairman, a casting vote. To me. Sir, the reason for that is obscure. I realize that where there is a deadlock, an equality of votes, it is necessary to find some means &#x2026;</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, Sir, I cannot be confused by what the hon. the Minister has agreed in the case of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Peninsula. I am going to speak to the amendment which I have moved, and to which, Sir, you have said I was entitled to speak. I do not see what the hon. the Minister is trying to do to me; I am already sufficiently mixed up, in his view; why does he want to mix me up further&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to say again that I am unable to ascertain why the hon. the Minister and those who have advised him have decided that in the case of an equality of voting over the election of a chairman, instead of the usual procedure being followed, the hon. the Minister should seek to give an official the right, not only to preside at such a meeting for the election of a chairman of this very important body, as the Minister seems to think, but also to vote. I do not see why the hon. the Minister should place that official in the rather invidious position, where there is an equality of voting, of having to determine who shall be the chairman of the council. I therefore say that since, in the first place, the clause does not follow the normal procedure and since, in the second place, it places the Secretary for Coloured Affairs in an unnecessarily invidious position in that for all time he will be the man responsible for having determined who shall be chairman of this Coloured parliament, the hon. the Minister should accept this amendment. And if he finds himself unable to do so he should be kind enough to state clearly to this Committee what his reasons are instead of seeking to draw a red herring across the trail being the other amendment.</p>

<block name="quote">The person presiding at a meeting of the council shall in addition to his deliberative vote also have a casting vote.</block>

<p>If that is the provision and that provision is acted upon there can never be an equality of voting. We are all agreeable to accepting the amendment moved by the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). So the clause will read&#x2014;</p>

<p>The person presiding at a meeting of the council shall in addition to his deliberative vote also have a casting vote: Provided that in the case of an equality of votes for the election of a chairman or acting chairman of the council the contesting candidates shall draw lots for such appointment and the winner of such drawer shall be so deemed.</p>

<p>Am I to understand that this is to provide only for the election of a temporary chairman&#x003F; It seems to me that there is still some confusion. I do submit this should be looked at carefully, after the acceptance of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Peninsula. Because the form still seems to be somewhat confusing.

<p>I should like to say just a word or two with reference to the implementation of this clause. It was emphasized during the second-reading debate that as far as the future pattern of development of the Coloured people was concerned, there was no question of freedom in a separate homeland. I just want to suggest that a great deal of imagination will be used in deciding upon the seat of this council. As the hon. member who has just sat down has said, there is no indication in the Bill as to where the seat of the council will be. I want to express the hope that the seat of this council will be in the new Bellville-South complex. I do not think we can consider any other area for this purpose. I just want to add that if the seat of the council is in the vicinity of Bellville-South, it must definitely form part of something which will be in the nature of a Coloured capital or metropolis which will be strongly symbolical of a separate and exclusive Coloured area. They do not have a separate homeland but I do think this area should serve as a nucleus. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to emphasize this one point.</p>

It will have to be set up in an area where the housing will be of such a nature as to make it an economic proposition. Some of these matters are receiving attention at the moment.

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;council&#x201D; in line 42, to the end of the clause; and to add the following new sub-section at the end of the clause:</block>

<ol>

<li>(4) The council shall meet in public.</li>

</ol>

<p>The object of this amendment is to remove the proviso to sub-section (3) which gives Drivilege to the members of the council, privilege in the ordinary sense in which that word is understood in any deliberative elected body anywhere in the Western world. I must say this is the first time I have ever seen privilege bestowed on any elected body and then in effect taken away. As the hon. the Minister knows the matter of privilege goes back a long way. It goes into the roots of English constitutional history. It goes back to Haxey&#x2019;s case in 1937 and it was formulated for very good reasons. Since this issue was resolved in the English Constitution every elected body anywhere in the Western world has adopted it, certainly for its highest elected body, for its body politic in which is gathered the representatives of the people.</p>

<p>We in South Africa adopted it in the old Cape Parliament, in the South African Parliament, and we then granted the same right to the provincial councils. Our provincial councils have granted the same unrestricted right which we have in this House to be local authorities themselves in the Transvaal. And then when new assemblies of the people were formed in accordance with new concepts in this country&#x2014;a classic example being last year with the Transkeian Bill&#x2014;the Transkeian Council was given exactly the same privileges without this proviso, this proviso which in effect takes away the privilege.</p>

<p>This is no longer a privilege, Sir, at all. It merely gives them protection in respect of libel and any defamatory thing they may say provided it is not defamatory of a certain group of specified people.</p>

<p>What did the hon. the Minister say&#x003F; He advanced the extraordinary argument that in the case of the Transkei the position was quite different; that he was not creating a nationhood here but that he was creating a separate state there. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that unless and until he does in fact create an independent state exactly the same officials, in the sense that they are officials of the Public Service, are going to be dealing with those persons; exactly the same public utility corporations are going to be dealing with those people. I think, in making a comparison like this, the attitude of the Minister is an insult to the Coloured people. On the one hand he says the Coloured people are 70 to 80 years behind the White people and that they may abuse this privilege and on the other hand the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development granted this privilege to the Bantu of the Transkei. Who is behind the times, Sir&#x003F; Who has been more assimilated into the White group the Coloureds or the Bantu&#x003F; The Bantu of the Transkei are, of course, being delivered along a road completely different from us, yet they are given this very privilege. I hope the hon. the Minister will produce another argument and give us another reason as to why he is going to restrict that privilege. Is it plainly and simply because the Coloured people are going to criticize White officials&#x003F; If that is the reason let him say so then we shall at least know where we stand. But if you are going to give freedom of speech to a body then why should they not criticize in this regard and say things which they would not say outside the Chamber because they might be defamatory&#x003F; Why must only the public officials be protected&#x003F;</p>

<p>I do not understand how this was drafted; why was &#x201C;parliament&#x201D; put in there&#x003F; Because if this did not exist in the proviso at all Parlliament&#x2019;s privileges would not in any way be affected, nor would a court of law be precluded, were this not here, from punishing the person responsible with contempt.</p>

<p>But this goes much further. The medium by which the views of the councillors and the decisions of the council are going to be conveyed to the Coloured people and to everyone else in South Africa is going to be the Press. One would have thought that the hon. the Minister would have had some appreciation of the difficulties that are going to arise out of this. In the good old days of yore there was a man called Stockdale. On the order of the House of Commons, certain things which were defamatory of Mr. Stockdale were published.</p>

<p><span class="col_4581-4582" refersTo="page_0983"/>He sued the person responsible, Mr. Hansard and from that day the principle was established that anything that is published is also likewise privileged.</p>

<p>We now have the position that if any member of this Coloured council criticizes Mr. Jones the Press has to find out not only whether he is a public servant but also whether he is a member of the Banana Board, or the Mealie Board or the Dried Fruit Board or any of the 101 boards which might fall under the definition of a &#x201C;statutory body&#x201D;. The Press must go to all that trouble before they dare publish anything which looks slightly defamatory, apart from finding out whether it is in fact defamatory. I hope the Minister has given some thought to this because I would hate to be the person responsible for disseminating this. I would like to know how the Press is going to cope with the position. It is bad enough that there are banned people that you are not allowed to quote but in their case you can have an index of them. But this provides no such rule of thumb. In this case you have to be a legal expert and you have to know exactly what everyone in South Africa is and whether he or she is a member of any statutory board. I want to say this to the hon. the Minister. The Minister says they should not say anything which is libellous. If that were an argument at all the privilege in relation to this House would be quite unnecessary because you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Speaker when the House is sitting, would not allow a defamatory statement in connection with another member to be made, for example.</p>

<p>There are certain things one says which are defamatory but it is a defence, if you are sued in court, to show that it was fair comment on a matter of public interest. What about the member who wants to make fair comment on a matter which is not of public interest but is a matter of interest to one of his constituents&#x003F; Is it not his duty to raise that matter in the way it was brought to him and to suggest what was suggested to him to the best of his ability&#x003F; Is that not what he should suggest&#x003F; [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken was so carried away by his liberal ideas that he lost sight completely of the practical aspect of this matter. The hon. member has got the idea into his head that because there is absolute freedom of speech in certain elected bodies in Britain, that must necessarily also be the case here. I just want to refer him to Clause 20 in which the powers given to this council are set out. He will see there that there is a very good reason why it is provided that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of this Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>there shall be freedom of speech. What are the various powers given to this council&#x003F; I shall read them out in English for the edification of the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council shall have power&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) on request to advise the Government in regard to all matters affecting the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured population of the Republic.</li>

</ol>

<p>This is straightforward enough but then we come to the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To make recommendations to the Government in regard to any planning calculated to promote the best interests of the said population.</block>

<p>Let us imagine that that planning relates to certain plots which have to be purchased or which have to form part of an urban area and so forth, and that this Coloured council cannot go into committee but has to hold all its meetings in public. It will mean that a matter of this nature cannot be dealt with in committee but will become common knowledge. This may give rise to an enormous amount of speculation as far as this particular matter is concerned. I want the hon. member to look at another sub-section, subsection (5) which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council may with the approval of the Minister granted after consultation with the Minister of Finance, acquire and dispose of property, appoint servants and do any other thing which it considers necessary in the exercise of its powers or the performance of its functions.</block>

<p>Let us imagine that there is a discussion in regard to persons who have to be appointed. The council will then not be able to go into committee if the provision does not read as it reads at present. This provision enables the council to go into committee; in other words, to assemble behind closed doors when discussing a matter of this nature. The hon. member must remember that this council is not only a legislative body. It cannot only discuss laws, like Parliament; it is also a consultative body. It also has to advise the Minister. Before the council can decide what advice it is going to give the Minister, it must have the right to assemble behind closed doors in order to consider a particular matter.</p>

<p>What about Clause 21 &#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We will come to Clause 21 just now; at the moment we are dealing with Clause 20. Clause 21 deals with the legislative powers of the council but Clause 20 deals more specifically with its advisory powers and its function of advising the Minister. For this purpose it is necessary that the council be permitted to assemble behind closed doors when it wants to advise the Minister. That is why this provision is also subject to laws and regulations. It has not <span class="col_4583-4584" refersTo="page_0984"/>been inserted in order to prevent freedom of speech when legislation is being discussed but it has been inserted in order to make a certain amount of secrecy possible between the Coloured council and the Minister for advisory purposes. A certain amount of mutual trust is promoted if a meeting is held behind closed doors when advice has to he given to the Minister. If this has to be done at a public meeting, that advice will no longer be advice; it will then be common knowledge and everyone will know what the advice is which the council has given to the Minister. Because of this fact, the purpose of the council will be frustrated and the functions which are allocated to it will be hampered, as far as Clause 20 is concerned. I am not discussing Clause 20 now because it deals with legislative powers. If legislation is discussed it will probably be discussed in public. The regulations will be able to provide that when legislation is discussed, the meeting will be open to the public, but that when the council has to advise the Minister, it must be able to deliberate behind closed doors.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>If one listens to the views of the hon. member who has just sat down, then it seems that the purpose of this particular council which we debated in the second reading is, as we said, purely consultative&#x2014;it will be purely a consultative body with no powers at all. It will have discussions only with regard to rules and regulations or with regard to certain appointments and other matters in regard to which they will be asked to give advice. If you look at Clause 16, then it appears that the viewpoint of that hon. member is not entirely borne out with regard to the manner in which this council is to be conducted. It says here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council may from time to time adopt standing rules and orders not inconsistent with this Act, for the regulation and conduct of its proceedings and the dispatch of business.</block>

<p>Subject to the provisions of this Act and any regulations made there under, and of any standing rules and orders, there shall be freedom of speech and debate in the council.</p>

<p>The third sub-section deals with the protection against legal proceedings by virtue of petitions, draft law, resolutions, motions or otherwise, or by virtue of anything a member may have said before the council. All that seems to clearly indicate that the council will meet and that certain discussions will take place, and the clause itself has the reference in the rubric to &#x201C;freedom of speech in council&#x201D;. If the hon. Minister is sincere in presenting a council which he hopes will over a period of time develop into something that is going to be representative of a group of people in this country and that it will gradually grow to a stage where it will be able to administer its own affairs and legislate, then why this restriction&#x003F; It is not only a question of what Britain or the British people have laid down as part of their democratic constitution and that the British Parliament has provided a certain freedom of speech, but our Parliament and all our traditions have been founded on the traditions of the mother of parliaments, a tradition which has spread over the world. This silly parochial reference that the hon. member has made is indicative of his attitude in these things.</p>

<p>To him it seems that if you follow any established tradition, if it has been established in any other country then it is inimical to our traditions or the manner in which this country should regulate its affairs. Sir, we are founded on that tradition, this whole House is founded on this tradition, and strangely enough our republican constitution jealously guards many of the traditions that we have lived by over the very many years that Parliament has been conducted in this country. But the position is that &#x201C;freedom of speech&#x201D; has a connotation of its own. It means absolute privilege to the individual. To bear out what the hon. member for Durban (North) has said, you can pick up any book on constitutional law, and here is one written by a man called Hoof Phillips which makes this statement in support of what the hon. member has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Freedom of debate on external interference does not mean that individual members have unlimited licence to speak and act as they like in the House. The Speaker or Chairman has the power and the duty to preserve order and <i>decorum</i> by applying the rules of debate, and the House has power to enforce order on members by censure, suspension or committal for any period up to the end of the session, and expulsion.</block>

<p>In other words, it is an accepted tradition that although you have absolute freedom of speech and you are protected by absolute privilege, there is a duty on the Speaker, or the Chairman of Parliament or a similar institution to avoid any unbridled licence in respect of the abuse of privilege. That is an accepted position. Now, Sir, what are you doing in this provision&#x003F; You are virtually subjecting these members to possible continuous litigation should they become a little more fervent in their approach to their own problems, because you are then throwing them on the free market of qualified privilege where they may have to defend their attitude in regard to malice, and where all sorts of proceedings can take place.</p>

<p>Sir, we have the same privilege of criticizing officials. We criticize state authorities. But is that abusing a place like this House of Assembly&#x003F; And why should it be abused unnecessarily&#x003F; Is it not better to avoid the members in these councils being constantly hampered <span class="col_4585-4586" refersTo="page_0985"/>by the inhibition that they may perhaps say something which an official does not like and so will take certain steps to deal with them&#x003F; Our appeal to the hon. Minister is that if he wants to try and do something which has any semblance of realities and any semblance of practical application, why does he not make the use that he apparently is looking for of this opportunity to let them say what they feel, say what they want and putting their ideas before the council and debating them so that the Minister and the Cabinet will have some idea of what is required by the majority&#x003F; If on the other hand it is purely going to be a puppet body which is going to be controlled only by the nominated members, who are more than one-third, if it is going to be a puppet body where things cannot be discussed that should be said, if it is going to be a puppet body where people have to hide what they feel, and where they do not have the opportunity of saying what they feel and of expressing the sentiments of their own people by whom they have been elected, what then is the value oi the entire organization, with all the goodwill that the hon. Minister thinks he is engendering in creating an institution of this nature&#x003F; I think this is a test of the sincerity of the hon. Minister and of his purpose. If his purpose is to do something worthwhile, then the opportunity must be given for people to speak. Sir, you can look at any authorities&#x2014;the law of libel is contained in many, many volumes (the law of defamation as we call it in this country)&#x2014;and you will find that there are times when a man is permitted to make defamatory statements anywhere, provided there is a common interest and it is either in the interest of the community or of common interest to himself and the person of whom he says it. There are all sorts of circumstances both in our law and in English law where a qualified privilege is provided. But it has been the subject of litigation over a considerable number of years and case after case can be quoted of this difficulty with regard to qualified privilege. I think advantage should be taken of the purpose to enable these elected people to at least have an opportunity, as elected people, to talk on behalf of those who have elected them. The hon. Minister himself has said that his objective is to take 60 per cent or 70 per cent of a community, who are backward, he says, far behind the standard which the White man has reached, and to gradually train them up to a certain standard, so much so that he is even making provision in the Bill that they can eventually have legislative power. How is he going to achieve this if he is going to provide every obstacle and hindrance which will give them even a semblance of an institution that will grow to what he says it will grow in terms of this Bill&#x003F; For that reason the plea is made that this proviso be dropped. In my view this proviso virtually negates the whole purpose of this particular council and the whole purpose of what the Minister has in mind. Why do we even, as I mentioned, show in the rubric the appellation &#x201C;freedom of speech in council&#x201D;&#x003F; No person who understands the normal interpretation of &#x201C;freedom of speech&#x201D; will be prepared to believe, unless he read it in print, that this type of proviso can be included in a clause which purports to institute this freedom of speech.

<p>I have an amendment on the Order Paper to omit the proviso to sub-section (3), but as the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has the same effect there would be no point in my moving the amendment. I therefore want to identify myself with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) and I want to support the arguments which have been put forward so vigorously by speakers on this side of the House. I would like to say immediately that I cannot understand the logic of the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). His view, as I understand it, is briefly that by reason of the fact that in terms of this Bill this council will have powers &#x201C;to advise the Government in regard to all matters affecting the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured population of the Republic, and to make recommendations to the Government in regard to any planning calculated to promote the best interests of the population&#x201D;, we should not give them this entire freedom of speech which other statutory bodies in this country enjoy. I cannot understand the logic of that. I want to say that the very inclusion of Clause 16 in this Bill negatives the suggestion made by the hon. member. The very fact that the Minister has seen fit to incorporate in this Bill Clause 16, which deals with the question of freedom of speech, negatives the suggestion made by the hon. member for Heilbron that they should be denied this freedom of speech because they have got these powers.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I will deal with that in a moment. Let me first finish my argument in regard to freedom of speech. The clause, as pointed out by previous speakers, has the headline &#x201C;freedom of speech in council&#x201D;. What does this mean&#x003F; I suggest it means that freedom of speech in the council has the ordinary meaning that is applied to any statutory provision which confers upon anybody freedom of speech. In relation to our own Constitution, I want to point out that they use the same appellation, for instance &#x201C;freedom of speech <span class="col_4587-4588" refersTo="page_0986"/>in the Provincial Council&#x201D;. We have provided in our law that there shall be freedom of speech in the provincial councils and that no Administrator or any member of the executive committee of a province or any member of a provincial council shall be liable to any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages by reason of any matter or thing which they may bring by petition, draft ordinance, resolution, motion or otherwise, or have said before the Provincial Council or by reason of their vote in the council. In the first part of the clause, the hon. the Minister purports giving them the same freedom of speech as that granted to provincial councils and other statutory bodies. But then he adds this provision, this important proviso which, I suggest, completely negatives the idea of freedom of speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that the provisions of this subsection (i.e. (3) of Clause 16) shall not relieve a member of the Council of liability in respect of anything said or done by him in regard to the Senate, the House of Assembly, a provincial council, a court of law or a statutory body or a member thereof or an officer of the Public Service &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what will these members be talking about other than about the laws which have been passed by the central Parliament affecting the Coloured people&#x003F; Either by way of criticisms of those laws, or by proposals for amending those laws, they will of necessity have to criticize something which has been said in this Parliament, and of necessity, therefore, the action of some members of this House &#x2014;either ourselves on this side or hon. members opposite. Why should they not have that right&#x003F; This is supposed to be, in the words of the Prime Minister himself, a Coloured Parliament! Why, then, should they not have the right to criticize where criticism is justified&#x003F; If in the course of such criticism they say something libellous, then, surely, they should have protection&#x003F;</p>

<p>But the prohibition to criticize does not stop with the central Parliament. It also applies to any statutory body or a member thereof. What freedom of speech is this if they are precluded from saying what they feel in their hearts about a certain member of one or other statutory body&#x003F; Let me illustrate this. There are the personnel of the Coloured Affairs Department. At present these are men who are held in the highest esteem by the Coloured people generally. There is the former Secretary, Dr. du Plessis, to whom we paid tribute and there is his successor, Mr. Bosman, and his staff to whom we also pay tribute. But the time may come when there is an official in that Department who may not deal as decently and fairly with the Coloured people as the gentlemen I referred to. As a matter of fact, you may have an official who is completely unsympathetic to the cause of the Coloured people. Why, then, should this council not have the right to criticize his actions&#x003F; And if in the course of such criticisms council members feel they may say something which may be libellous, why should they not be protected&#x003F; That is the point which I want to make, because the imaginary gentleman I am referring to will be an officer of the Public Service and in terms of this provision, anything said about him by the members of council will not be protected under the rule of privilege. We know unfortunately&#x2014;and I say this with great regret&#x2014;that there have been instances in this country where the police have had to be criticized. Thus it might be necessary for this council, which after all is to be a Coloured Parliament, to criticize a policeman or a particular officer of the Police Force. &#x2026;</p>

<p>Why should a member of the council be afraid to say what he feels in his heart about such an officer&#x003F; Why should he be afraid because he might be faced with an action for libel&#x003F; Surely, Sir, once you impose these provisos, freedom of speech in the proposed council will be entirely negatived. The danger, as I see it, is not so much this, i.e. that it will negative freedom of speech. The proposed proviso is so wide in scope that it embraces not only anything which might be said about the Senate, the House of Assembly, or a provincial council, but also anything which might be said in connection with any member of a statutory body or any officer of the Public Service. Surely, Sir, that is going too far&#x003F; In my opinion it goes far beyond the realms of necessity.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, I think the Minister might very well pay heed to the appeals which are being made from this side of the House, i.e. that if he is going to allow the members of the proposed council freedom of speech, then let it be the freedom of speech we have allowed to other statutory bodies. The Minister ought to know that in whatever comes before this body, the members thereof will be guided to a large extent by what the Minister and his officials feel about such matters. To that extent he has the upper hand. He ought to know that. In conclusion, I want to say that if this clause is allowed to go through in its present form, we might as well drop the clause in its entirety.</p>

<p>I really cannot believe that hon. members opposite are in earnest in objecting to this proviso. I gain the impression that they know that their objection will not be accepted because if they had thought that it would be accepted, they would not, because of their sense of responsibility, have argued <span class="col_4589-4590" refersTo="page_0987"/>in this way. At the same time I feel that hon. members opposite are creating the wrong impression about this matter. If they object to the sidenote, which is &#x201C;Freedom of speech in council&#x201D;, then I think the matter can be easily rectified. I do not believe that there will be any objection if the sidenote is altered to read &#x201C;Freedom of speech in council with provisos&#x201D;. These provisos form part of the clause. But hon. members opposite make use of the wording of the sidenote to argue that there should be no provisos in the clause at all. A few hon. members opposite in fact used this argument. They said that because the sidenote made no mention of provisos, the clause itself should contain no provisos. That is why I say that there will be no objection if the wording of the sidenote is altered in this regard.</p>

<p>Oh, yes! I shall vote for it because certain provisos are included in the clause. The wording of the sidenote will then simply reflect the contents of the clause. But when one considers the provisions of any clause, one does not simply consider the wording of the sidenote to the clause; one must surely consider the contents of the clause itself. As I see the matter this clause makes provisions for freedom of speech. But now the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) says that this freedom of speech is being completely removed. That is not so. It is not true that the freedom of speech for which provision is made in sub-section (3) of this clause is again being taken away completely by the proviso. I know, of course, that that freedom of speech is subject to certain conditions; in other words, that freedom of speech is limited. But that freedom of speech definitely does exist. That is obvious. The result is that the hon. member&#x2019;s allegation that the freedom of speech which is being allowed is again being taken away by the proviso is certainly not correct.</p>

<p>But there is no comparison between the two! Hon. members can work it out for themselves. The Coloureds do not have their own separate geographic area in South Africa. Nor is it envisaged that the Coloureds will eventually obtain complete political independence as is envisaged as far as the Bantu in the Transkei are concerned. [Interjections.] Hon. members are trying to distract me from my argument. I am quite prepared to debate the question put to me by the hon. member if I have the time to do so. But I want to come back now to the statement of the hon. member for Durban (North) to the effect that the freedom of speech granted in sub-section (3) is being completely removed by the proviso. That is not so. In actual fact, they are at liberty to criticize anyone or anything, except as far as the few cases mentioned in the proviso are concerned. [Interjections.] But that is so! Hon. members cannot deny it. Take as an example the thousands of companies that we have in South Africa. Any one of those companies and the business that it is doing can be freely criticized by the Coloured council, and not only criticized&#x2014;by the way, I want to discuss this word &#x201C;criticize&#x201D;; the council will also be indemnified as far as that criticism is concerned. In other words, even though they may say something which is libellous, they will still be protected. [Interjections.] Do hon. members opposite deny that this Coloured council will have the right, and be given the necessary indemnification in this regard, to make libellous accusations about any company in South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then the members of the council will also have the right to express themselves in regard to any individual, excluding members of the Senate, the House of Assembly, the Provincial Councils and public servants. I do not now want to discuss the merits of the exception made, for example, in the case of the House of Assembly; I shall deal with this matter in due course. I have mentioned these exceptions merely to show that what has been said by the hon. member for Durban (North) is not quite correct. He has created the impression that freedom of speech is being given in the first instance, but that that freedom of speech is being removed by means of the proviso. I say that his statement is not correct. In actual fact, the council still enjoys a large measure of freedom of speech. But there are certain conditions in this regard, and I want to deal with them now.</p>

<p>Hon. members, including the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg), have said that during the course of the discussion in regard to some matter or other these people may perhaps want to criticize some or other person. The hon. member for Peninsula referred here to a Secretary for Coloured Affairs whom the members of the council might want to criticize because of the fact that he is not such an amenable person. There is nothing to prevent their criticizing him. I am sure hon. members know that there is complete freedom of speech outside this House, and in our case as well, as long as we do not say libellous things about people whom we want to criticize. If I hold a public meeting, I can criticize I people right and left as long as I do not say <span class="col_4591-4592" refersTo="page_0988"/>libellous things about them. For example, I can criticize any individual or criticize the House of Assembly or the Senate as long as I do not make libellous statements about them. Nor will I be permitted to say libellous things about our Supreme Court or about any individual, because then steps can be taken against me.</p>

This is not so, because the council can discuss these matters. Hon. members opposite are also trying to give the impression that if councillors criticize these bodies, they will be doing the wrong thing. But that is not so. Although we in this House have freedom of speech, it happens very seldom, if ever, that hon. members say libellous things about people outside this House. At the same time it cannot be said that, because we do not make libellous statements, we are not doing our duty properly.

<block name="quote">Wat het die agb. lid vir Kensington ges&#x00EA;&#x003F; Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat die lede van hierdie raad nie kritiek mag uitspreek op &#x2019;n lid van &#x2019;n ander raad of &#x2019;n lid van hierdie Raad of &#x2019;n Staatsambtenaar nie.

<p>That is the point, if it is to be a Parliament. And who is it who told us that it would be a Parliament&#x003F; Nobody other than the hon. the Prime Minister. This is what the Prime Minister said when he told us that this body would be established&#x2014;</p>

<p>You see, Sir, what I have in mind is this: It is not whether a man says things which are libellous or not. That is not the point. A man may make a speech innocently, which is not libellous, and find himself involved in a court action. The rich man who attacks the member can do so, because he has the money. The poor man has to defend himself, and he can be ruined financially. Therefore, we have, under the English Rules of Parliament, the fact that they developed their own system, as Erskine May has described it for us. We in this Parliament have it recorded in the work of Mr. Ralph Kilpin. The point I wish to make particularly is this: It was also misunderstood by the hon. member for Smithfield. I do not say you cannot criticize. The point is that you are vulnerable; you can be attacked if you have not freedom of speech, and freedom of speech must be absolute; it is indivisible. You cannot say, when you speak of freedom of speech, that you are allowed to go to a certain point provided you do not become involved in a case outside. That is not the meaning of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is stated in perfectly good legal language in the Transkeian constitution. We all know what it says there. It says it is the same as for this Parliament. Freedom must be absolutely free. We have only one answer here, to delete the whole proviso. These men meeting together as Coloured representatives will have to discuss things and say things as we do in this House. I quite agree with the hon. member for Ceres. We very rarely say things that are libellous, but we hardly give it a thought because we know we cannot be prosecuted. We know our authority here is Mr. Speaker. He must lay down the rules for us, and we control our own affairs. What I should like to see for this Coloured Council is this: I am now referring to the right of the Transkeian Parliament to make rules. It says: &#x201C;The Legislative Assembly may from time to time adopt standing rules and orders not inconsistent with this Act for the regulation and conduct of its proceedings and the dispatch of business, for the passing, entitling and numbering of laws, and subject to confirmation by the State President for the presentation of such laws to the State President in terms of Section 40&#x201D;. But they should have their own rules. Their rules may be subject. e.g., to the consent of this Parliament. That is possible; I concede that. Seeing that we are putting through this law, we may go so far as to say that if they have their own standing rules and orders these must be subject to the approval of this Parliament. But to say to these people that they can have a measure of freedom of speech is impossible. [Interjection.] It is subject to this clause which we <span class="col_4593-4594" refersTo="page_0989"/>want eliminated. Hon. members may agree that they may make their own standing rules and orders subject to the approval of this House. That, I concede, is reasonable, but to say that their freedom of speech can be restricted is impossible.</p>

I do not have very much to add to what I said in this regard except to say that we must have clarity in regard to one matter for the sake of the truth. The truth is that Clause 16 deprives no member of the Coloured council of the right to criticize any person or body.</p>

<p>I repeat that Clause 16 does not deprive any member of the Coloured council of the right to criticize any person or body. In other words, any member of that council can criticize any body or institution or person in South Africa. There must be no doubt on this point at all.</p>

<p>But in the second place, the members of the Coloured council also have the right to criticize officials. I want to make this very clear because the opposite is actually the impression hon. members opposite are trying to create. These councillors can also criticize members of the Public Service. In other words, these councillors may differ from the Secretary for Coloured Affairs or his deputy or an under-secretary or any official in the service of the Department. They will have the right to say: &#x201C;We differ from him; we think that he has acted unfairly and wrongly and we do not think that he should act in that way again.&#x201D;</p>

In other words, hon. members opposite maintain that irresponsible members of this council should be given the right to libel other people in responsible positions.

No. They are fighting for the right to be given to irresponsible members of this council to commit libel against other people in responsible positions. That is to my way of thinking an inexplicable approach to this matter. Just listen to what the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has to say.

<p>Every one of us, except when we speak in this House, continually runs the risk of being summonsed for libel and that is why all of us are careful when we express ourselves outside this House. That stops us from creating pandemonium in this country. I am sure that hon. members will agree with me in this regard. But what is the position in this House&#x003F; This House which is the highest sovereign body in the country, has passed a law which provides that no member may question the honour of another member. There is no other body over us which can lay down a rule of this nature for us; we have laid down that rule for ourselves. We have imposed that restriction upon ourselves. We have also subjected ourselves to a second restriction&#x2014;that a member of this House may not slight the honour of a member of the Other Place, and <i>vice versa.</i> But we are the highest body in the country; we are a sovereign body. There was no other body over us which could impose that restriction upon us and so we had to impose it upon ourselves. That is my reply to hon. members. But what is more, if an hon. member were to stand up in this House to-morrow and make a personal attack upon the Secretary of a Department you, Mr. Chairman, would immediately call him to order. That is something which is just not done and hon. members know it. There are laws in terms of which action can be taken against public servants if they overstep the mark. In other words, my reply to hon. members of the Opposition is contained in the composition of this body itself. That is my reply to them.

The Minister was at great pains to tell us that the whole purpose of this clause was to protect the members of the council; that they have not had much experience in legislating or in conducting council affairs of this nature and therefore he wishes to protect them. He wishes to protect them from making defamatory statements against Parliament, the Senate or Government officials. Sir, what we cannot understand is this: Why is the Minister so careful to protect the public servants of this country and not members of the public themselves&#x003F; Why must officials be protected and not the general public&#x003F; You see, if the Minister had said, &#x201C;I am not going to have the members of this council who are inexperienced getting into trouble by slandering people outside the council,&#x201D; then we could understand it, but he said with great emphasis that the reason for this clause was to protect the Councillors themselves. What is he protecting them from&#x003F; He is only protecting Parliament, the Senate, statutory bodies and Government officials, and he has not told us why it is not necessary to protect the general public from irresponsible utterances by Councillors. Had he told us that in its enthusiasm and inexperience this council might say things about the public which it should not have said and that this was merely a step to warn them we might have appreciated it. But neither the hon. the Minister nor the hon. member for Ceres has told us why a difference is made between the general public and the public officials.</p>

<p>Our point is this. Why has the Minister introduced this clause at all&#x003F; I cannot understand that. If he left this clause out the ordinary rules of libel would apply and the ordinary protections would apply; the ordinary rules of privilege would apply. But the hon. the Minister has gone out of his way to insert it under the pretext of freedom of speech. He has of course done so because he has tried to follow the Transkeian Constitution to a certain extent. What we cannot understand is this: Why should the Coloured people, who certainly have much more experience in matters of this kind, be protected and not the Bantu. Why must the Bantu be given absolute privilege and not the Coloureds&#x003F; This, of course, is in line with the Minister&#x2019;s statement earlier in this debate, that 70 per cent of the Coloured people were not sufficiently civilized or educated to take part in self-governing bodies of this nature. If the Minister is genuine when he says he wants to give them some standing I say he must give them the same privileges as are given to the Parliament of the Transkei. Unless the Minister can tell us why he differentiates between the general public &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and public officials, why we differentiate between public companies and statutory bodies we shall persist in our opposition to this. Why should statutory bodies be protected&#x003F; How is the ordinary councillor to know which is a statutory body and which is not&#x003F; He won&#x2019;t know, Sir, and he won&#x2019;t know whether a certain person is a member of a statutory body or not. I submit the privilege granted here is meaningless and I ask the Minister to reconsider this and accept our amendment.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>In order to give the hon. the Minister some time to think about the excellent points raised on this side of the House I want to deal with something else, i.e. this phrase: &#x201C;The council may from time to time adopt standing rules and orders.&#x201D; I don&#x2019;t know what the Minister means by &#x201C;adopt&#x201D; because it is contrary to what is stated in Clause 26 which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may make regulations in regard to (a) the sessions of the council; (b) the regulation of the proceedings of the council including the maintenance of order in the council, disciplinary measures and the rules of debate.</block>

<p>Whereas Clause 16 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council may from time to time adopt standing rules and orders not inconsistent with this Act, for the regulation and conduct of its proceedings and the dispatch of business.</block>

<p>These two seem to be contradictory, to me, unless the Minister tells us what he means by &#x201C;adopt&#x201D;. Does it mean that they can adopt the regulations made by the Minister in terms of Clause 26&#x003F;</p>

<p>That they can make regulations. Read Clause 26. To me the two are inconsistent.</p>

<p>No, they are not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Then the Minister must explain to me why they are not inconsistent. When we come to Clause 26 in due course the Minister will ask us to pass a clause in terms of which he makes the regulations in regard to the way the council must behave. At the same time he gives this power to the council in terms of Clause 16. In the case of the one the word &#x201C;adopt&#x201D; is used and in the case of the other the &#x201C;Minister shall make&#x201D; is used: I say the two clauses are inconsistent. As time is running out I shall not press it now but I shall continue with my argument on this clause in connection with that particular point.</p>

<p>I just want to continue the argument in connection with the proviso. I want the Minister to realize that this is very wide. I agree with those hon. members who have spoken about a statutory body and members thereof or officers of the public service. What is meant by the &#x201C;public service&#x201D;&#x003F; Does it mean any Government servant any Post Office official or police officer or does it only mean the Public Service Commission&#x003F; I want to tell the hon. the Minister right now that I have had representations made to me by at least one member of this Coloured Council. He feels that they should have complete freedom of criticism, and that if they do say something by accident they should be protected. The Minister has not made out any good case why they should not be protected.</p>

<p>I want to say this in conclusion&#x2014;the point has already been made&#x2014;that they will feel insulted if they are not accorded the same protection in their Coloured Council as that accorded to the Bantu in their Parliament in the Transkei. I cannot see any reason for this differentiation.</p>

<p>I know, Sir; I do not want to labour it. I think the Minister should reconsider this. It is most unfair. As I have said earlier in this debate it is a further indication that the Minister does not seem to trust the very people he will nominate, number one, and the very people the Coloured people will elect to that council to manage their affairs.</p>

<p>Let us take the case of the Group Areas Board. That board is a statutory body and I can assure you, Sir, that there are many complaints about that board. Are these Coloured councillors not entitled to get up and say that things have happened in the Group Areas Board &#x2026;</p>
