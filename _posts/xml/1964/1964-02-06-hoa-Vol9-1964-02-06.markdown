<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, last night we had the extraordinary situation where the Government was unable to put up any member from that side of the House to reply to the attacks which had been launched from this side. [Interjections.] <span class="col_861-862" refersTo="page_0445"/>Sir, they can squeal as much as they like; the simple fact is that when our last speaker had finished speaking no one got up from the Government side to reply. They can claim all the misunderstanding in the world but they cannot get away from the fact that throughout this debate they have been unable to answer the charges and the attacks which have been launched against them from this side. The last straw was when the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. (Hickman) last night, in a brilliant speech, pleaded the cause of the underprivileged in South Africa. As long as you are talking about &#x201C;kaffers&#x201D; and &#x201C;koelies&#x201D; they are all ready to join in the fight, but when you are talking about the welfare of the underprivileged in South Africa, as the hon. member for Maitland was doing, when you are dealing with the day-to-day lives of people and their suffering and their misery, then you get silence from that side of the House; then they are not prepared to come in and support us in our pleas for the people who live in backyards and in shacks in poverty and in misery, the senior citizens of this country, people who have spent their lives in service to the country and who are now abandoned by the Government of that country to their suffering. We have heard speaker after speaker on the Government side talk of this Garden of Eden, this Utopia, this land flowing with milk and honey because of their good government&#x2014;money in the reserves&#x2014;money flooding throughout the country. Why, if that is the position, should we have to come and plead for the people in South Africa who so desperately need help and get no support from any member on that side of the House?</p>

<p>We have charged that the policies and the maladministration of this Government have hampered, harmed and impeded the progress of South Africa. Speaker after speaker from this side of the House has substantiated that charge. Speaker after speaker has given facts and has asked questions, the replies to which South Africa is entitled to have. But what answers do you get? I admit the ability, the very clever ability of that Government to ride on the back of Lady Luck. Give them a little bit of luck and they will ride it until it is hollow-backed, and heaven knows they have had enough luck in the last 15 years of their government. Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot govern a country on luck.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member must address the Chair.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I apologize, Mr. Speaker. Sir, they have ridden Lady Luck as long as they can possibly do it. I also admit their ability to exploit the innate wealth, the innate strength of the South African economy; that too they have done and that too this side has acknowledged. Where there have been bright spots&#x2014;and there are bright spots as we have stated quite openly and as we acknowledge&#x2014;where there are bright spots those bright spots are not attributable to this Government, they are attributable to the people of South Africa, to the industrialist of South Africa who is prepared to gamble and to invest despite, and not because of, the policies which this Government is following. It is attributable too to those foundations which this Government inherited from us. Sir, you will find in every sphere of our national life where things are going well that that progress is based on a foundation laid before this Government came into power.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>What about Sasol?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>They know that we initiated that. Hon. members may laugh but have they forgotten what the United Party Government did to lay the foundation, the experiments, the research and the investigation that were carried out long before they came into power? There is an Act on the Statute Book, the Oil from Coal Act of 1946, that will prove what I say. So you can go through every single aspect of our life, Sir, and you will find that the foundation was laid by this party when it was in power. They are even trying to destroy those foundations. Even those foundations they are trying to destroy&#x2014;not only the foundations of our wealth, but the foundations of our country as a whole. Our economy is asked to develop, people are asked to invest, to risk their capital in investing, when they have before them a country about to be fragmented. That aspect every speaker opposite studiously ignores. Every speaker runs away from that as though it is poison. It is poison, Sir, it is poison for South Africa, for the future of this country. When we try from this side of the House to get details of that fragmentation again you find a silence on the part of the Government. We have tried for some two, three, four years to find out from this Government&#x2014;I relate this to their hope that they would develop the economy of South Africa through border industries&#x2014;exactly what their plans were. We have heard from Government members praise for new border industries. They have a &#x201C;new-frontier&#x201D; mentality. Surely, Sir, if they want new frontiers for a smaller South Africa then we are entitled to ask where those frontiers lie. You are entitled to know where that border is on which the industrialists of this country are asked to create border industries. No member on that side of the House has been prepared to give us those frontiers, to tell us where those borders are, to tell us what South Africa will be like in a year or five or ten years.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Mr. Speaker, I challenged the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development as to whether there had been any discussions whatsoever in regard to the change of borders of the Transkei&#x2014;to deal with only one of the many Bantustans which are to be established. The hon. the Minister denied it. He said there had been no discussions. I asked whether there had been no reference to the annexation of specific districts. I mentioned specific districts: <span class="col_863-864" refersTo="page_0446"/>Mount Currie, Queenstown, Harding and Port Shepstone. The Minister said: &#x201C;You know it is not true.&#x201D; He got excited about it. He denied it. Well, Sir, two years ago the Transkeian Territorial Authority made certain demands to the Government. There were three resolutions dealt with by that Authority. One asked merely for extra land. One asked for the acquisition of specific land and another one asked for the annexation of various districts. Those resolutions were discussed by that Authority. I want to quote from the Hansard, the verbatim report of that discussion. One resolution, No. 19, &#x201C;The Acquisition of Land for Bantu Settlement&#x201D;, was withdrawn. The chairman asked the mover why he had withdrawn that resolution and this was his answer:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Salukapatwa: The reason why I decided to withdraw the motion is because it was framed a long time before the draft constitution for the Transkei was drawn up and the constitution seems to contain provision for this. I therefore found that my wish would be met because these parts would ultimately belong to us.</block>

<p>That was the view of the mover who withdrew the motion, namely, that the Transkei constitution met his wish and that that area would eventually belong to them. I challenge the hon. the Minister to tell this House that that allegation was denied by his Department or by any official; or that this statement made by a speaker in that Parliament has been repudiated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>We never discussed that matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The other two resolutions were passed. The one demanded the annexation of Mount Currie and various other districts. Item No. 20, &#x201C;Annexation of certain districts &#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;Districts&#x201D;, Sir, not parts of them&#x2014;&#x201C;that the districts of Elliot, Maclear, Mount Currie, Indwe, Ugie be annexed to the Transkeian territories&#x201D;. The Department of Bantu Administration, in their Minute No. R.145/12 on C.B.A.C. file 66/G, replied to that resolution. They rejected the annexation but for this reason. The reason given for the request was that the population of the Transkei was increasing. The answer given by the Department was that the population of the whole world was increasing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is obvious that no country or nation can claim additional land merely by reason of the increase of its population. The districts referred to are in any event already fully populated.</block>

<p>Then they concluded with this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The mere annexation of such populated land to the Transkei will therefore not solve the problem &#x2026;</block></speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but we never discussed it with the leaders of the Transkei.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the Minister says it was never discussed with the leaders of the Transkei! This is the verbatim report of the discussions of a body elected and appointed as the Territorial Authority of the Transkei. It passes a resolution, the Minister&#x2019;s Department replies to that resolution, in writing, and then the Minister says it was never discussed with the leaders of the Transkei! But that is not the end of the story, Sir. We had previously challenged the hon. Minister on this. Then towards the end of last year, the present chief Minister of the Transkei issued an election manifesto. After claiming in that manifesto that &#x201C;I am competent to deal with any situation on a national or international level&#x201D; Kaiser Matanzima goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the question of land in the Transkei, he said, it should all belong to the Bantu including municipal land in the 26 villages. &#x201C;This will be done by the gradual elimination of the Whites which must be carried out expeditiously&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I now skip a section dealing with the Native Trust, and I come to this particular issue under discussion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Areas would be gradually &#x201C;zoned&#x201D; until they were wholly occupied by the Bantu. &#x201C;Additional land formerly occupied by the Bantu would, after consultation with the Republican Government, be added to the Transkeian Territories. I refer to such land as in the districts of Queenstown, Lady Frere, Indwe, Maclear, Elliot, Ugie, Mount Currie, Harding and Port Shepstone.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was issued as an election manifesto by the present chief Minister of the Transkei. I ask the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development whether he or the Government have repudiated that manifesto or whether they allowed the Bantu of the Transkei to go into an election and to make their decision based on a promise which they would find to be false? Either the Government should have repudiated that undertaking so that the people of the Transkei would have known where they stood, or if they kept silent, then by implication, it allowed the people of the Transkei to elect a chief Minister on the basis of an election promise which the Government, by implication, supported. It must be one way or the other. Sir, the Government cannot remain silent. Did it mislead the voters of the Transkei into believing that they were voting for the annexation of territories in selecting a chief Minister on the basis of his promises? If that is not so, then I ask the hon. the Minister now, I ask him in the interests of South Africa, in the interests of the White people in all those districts, to tell us whether this Government is or is not <span class="col_865-866" refersTo="page_0447"/>prepared to annex those territories to the Transkei. Mr. Speaker, it is the duty of this Government to those people and to all South Africa so say clearly and unequivocally that either it is, or it is not, prepared to hand those areas over to the Transkei. It cannot escape that responsibility, Sir. It owes a duty to South Africa. The Minister cannot continue to sit there silently leaving South Africa in doubt as to the boundaries that will ultimately be the boundaries of our country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, those are only the first; what about the other territories? I asked the Minister whether we would now be permitted to see a map of the Bantu areas of Natal. He has not answered me. I ask him again: Is he prepared to allow South Africa to see the map of Natal showing the Bantu areas which are to form a Zulustan or is he going to keep that secret from the people of South Africa until they wake up when it is too late? South Africa is entitled to that information, Sir. We asked for it last year but it was refused because it would be &#x201C;confusing&#x201D;. Yes, Mr. Speaker, it would be very confusing, confusing to the followers of this Government, if they were to know the truth. Now I ask again, as we have asked repeatedly: Let South Africa see the map showing the exact boundaries of Bantu areas throughout Natal and indicate thereon the boundaries of the future Zulustan.</p>

<p>How can you expect the economy of South Africa to survive when the very country in which it must grow is a country with undefined borders, a vague and undefined area, which is to be the ultimate South Africa? How can any person wanting to invest take that risk without knowing where his markets are going to be&#x2014;which are going to be internal markets and which are going to be foreign markets? I want to conclude by directing a question, not to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, but to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. Will the Minister of Economic Affairs tell us&#x2014;as the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) has asked&#x2014;the full story of the major border area weaving industry, the Cyril Lord factory? Because, Mr. Speaker, it is common talk that there has been some horse-trading going on behind the scenes. South Africa is entitled to know whether that is so or not. Were any undertakings given? Were any promises made which will mean a rise in the cost of living in order to attract that industry? If so, what were they? I say this, Sir, because the hon. the Minister accused and warned the shirt manufacturers of South Africa about increases in prices. Those increases are due directly and solely to the promises made, and now carried out, to impose duties to protect that factory. The Minister is trying to cast suspicion on the shirt manufacturers. I ask him to tell South Africa the full story of that industry and what it is going to cost every single person who wears a shirt in South Africa. That price which every person who wears a shirt in this country must pay, is part of the price that we must pay for the ideological nonsense which this Government is imposing upon South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not propose to reply to the politicking of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I might just say, Mr. Speaker, that I consider it to have been in really poor taste to have made such a fuss about the fact that this hon. member moved the adjournment last night. It was arranged between the Whips &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">*HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; that somebody on this side would move the adjournment of the House at 10 p.m. Surely it is the greatest nonsense in the world to allege that there was no member here to move the adjournment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to start with the items of lesser importance mentioned yesterday by the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) and North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst). The hon. member for Simonstown mentioned the fact that there were absolutely no sport facilities at Youngsfield. He went so far as to say that we did not even supply them with a pair of rugby posts. I want to give the House the sport facilities they have at Youngsfield. They have a swimming pool; they have a squash court; they have a tennis court; a cricket field; a cricket practice net; two soccer fields; a trampoline and three judo mats.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No jukskei field!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>That is the type of interjection we get from that hon. member. What does he mean by that? Juskei is a very fine sport, and if they want it they will get it. In addition to that they have the sport facilities at the Wynberg military camp. They are transported there by means of military transport. There they have two rugby fields, a cricket field and an athletic track. Well, Sir, that is a very different picture from the one painted by the hon. member for Simonstown yesterday afternoon. The only advice I can give the hon. member is this that when he comes with grievances he should investigate them better before he raises them in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me whether we had vocational guidance for the youngsters in the military camps. No, Sir, we have not. I know the British Army gave vocational guidance during the years they had conscription. Then they had the young men there for two or three years. We have them only for nine months. They get vocational guidance at school and I do not think we should interfere with that guidance during the nine months that we have them in our camps. He also asked me what study facilities we offered the youngsters. I do not know what the hon. member means by that. They have a library, a reading room and a writing room, but we do not provide them with other study facilities. <span class="col_867-868" refersTo="page_0448"/>I can assure the hon. member that they are tired in the evenings; and they have not much time to study anything else but military affairs.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand asked how it was possible for expenditure at the General Botha to have increased so tremendously in one year and for the number of students to have decreased so much. It is because this is the transition period. We gave the people there a two-year course of training, but as the result of an agreement arrived at with the bodies concerned, we now give only a one-year course there. All the former activities are now transferred to the technical college. We now train these people for one year only, and even that training will be stopped, and then the General Botha, it is envisaged, will become the naval training college, in the same way that we have Air Force and Military colleges. During this transition period we must make use of all the lecturers there. We are, however, not wasting their time because the number of students has decreased. We use them for the training of ballotees allocated to the Navy.</p>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>That is a reasonable explanation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Now I come to the more important matters raised by hon. members yesterday. They asked what was going on in connection with irregularities and in regard to military purchases. If irregularities exist in regard to military purchases, it is a very serious matter. As the Minister of Defence, I made it clear right from the beginning that I would show no mercy in regard to any attempted malpractices in connection with the purchase of military requirements. Millions of rands of the taxpayers&#x2019; money are spent annually in connection with military purchases, and we dare not allow any irregularities to take place. We are on our guard against that. I may just mention here that the matters referred to here were investigated by the Department of Defence. At a certain stage the Department handed the matter over to the police. We were not asleep. It is we who discovered it and handed the matter over to the police to take action, which they did. How the case is to be tried is not a matter which concerns us. The hon. member for North-East Rand knows that the Judge consented to the case being heard in that way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>You recommended it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that we recommended it. I agreed that that was the best method of holding the trial, and I will tell you why, Sir. In these days in which we live military security is of the utmost importance to our Defence Force. Last year we had an investigation by a foreign power in connection with our military security. The report we received was excellent. I can assure hon. members that when we acquire military requirements or arms which are on the secret list of other states, it is absolutely essential to apply the most stringent security measures. We know that in cases of this nature, if they are tried in public, questions may be put which may possibly violate the security which we have promised other countries to apply. We dare not run that risk. It is not to protect anyone; the proof exists that nobody was protected.</p>

<p>The second matter is this. In these days when so much is being said by so many people in so many countries about the supply of military requirements to South Africa, it is necessary to maintain the greatest possible secrecy in every possible sphere. The hon. member said that if the matter had been tried publicly it would have eliminated quite a lot of rumours and gossip. It may be that it would have eliminated a certain amount of rumour, Sir, but nothing ever evolved by man has been able to put a stop to rumours and suspicious thoughts. We will always have that. I want to give the House and the country the assurance that no malpractices will be allowed in connection with military purchases. On that I stake my honour. We dare not allow it. If there are further malpractices, I give hon. members the assurance that we will investigate them and act mercilessly.</p>

<p>Then another matter was raised here. I do not wish to say that it was done in a carping spirit, but it was mentioned here that there are rumours to the effect that we are buying inferior material for our defence. If hon. members opposite make definite accusations and tell me what those things are, I can have the matter investigated. But I know there were rumours that the automatic rifles we purchased, and which we are now manufacturing ourselves, rifles which can fire hundreds of shots a minute, cannot continue firing for a long time because then the barrel wears out or expands in certain places. That is so, but no automatic weapon with a high rate of fire has ever been made in the world which can continue to fire for a long time. And even a military fool would not use them in that way. There is a technique for the use of such weapons. It came to my ears that somebody had said that even these anti-aircraft guns we purchased, which fire 500 shells a minute, cannot continue firing for a long time, because then the barrel becomes worn out. Sir, I would certainly expect such a barrel to become worn out. No barrel in the world can take that. No barrel ever made by man will be able to last. But nobody uses them in that way. Who on earth uses an anti-aircraft gun, which has to shoot down a fast-flying aircraft, for a minute continuously? Surely that is ridiculous. It cannot be used in that way. They fire a volley of shots and everything is over in a few moments. This type of rumour is being disseminated by people who have no technical knowledge at all, either of the weapon or of the use to which it is put. If the hon. members have specific cases which they want <span class="col_869-870" refersTo="page_0449"/>to bring to my notice, they may do so. I want to tell hon. members that within a few weeks I will invite them to attend a firing demonstration of these anti-aircraft guns, and thereafter, when my Vote comes to be discussed, they will have the opportunity of tackling me if those guns are a failure.</p>

<p>Put Vause Raw up as a target.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Somebody says I must use the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) as a target. No, he will be no good; he and I are both too easy to hit.</p>

<p>The other matter raised here, and which is always being raised by hon. members opposite, both here and in the Other Place, is that too much secrecy exists in regard to our military affairs. The question is: What do hon. members expect of me in this time in which we live? In these days of threats made against South Africa, in these days of the announcement of boycotts, do hon. members expect me as the Minister, who at this stage bears the responsibility, to see to it that we get as much equipment as possible for the defence of South Africa within our financial means? If that is so, then I think that in these days in which we live we should show a little confidence. We should realize that the opportunity should be given to me and to my officers to get whatever is possible in the circumstances. I want to mention it again. If we can acquire weapons which are on the secret list of certain states, nobody in the world can expect me to reveal that fact, not even to a broad Committee of this House or to any other group of people.</p>

<p>The question is put as to what we are getting for our money. How can I as the Minister of Defence reveal to this House and the country what we are getting for our money? Surely we must use our eyes. Look at our Navy and how it is being expanded. It is true that certain of the material now being delivered was ordered years ago and that a contract was signed for it, but we are now paying top prices for it. Must I reveal to the world how many aircraft we purchased and ordered to support our Navy? Is it in the interest of the defence of South Africa to tell the world that we ordered so many maritime aircraft, that we have received so many, and that we still expect to get so many? I would like to ask the hon. member for North-East Rand if I would be correct in doing that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>It would frighten off many people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but now I want to reply to a few other points. It has been said that if we revealed what we have to the public it would keep the morale of our people high. I frankly admit that, but the question is: What is the best thing to do, to raise the morale of our people a little (and I think it is high enough) or to give the outside world the opportunity to say: See how the military power of South Africa is expanding! We know what is being said every day. The other day a leading article appeared in one of the State-controlled newspapers in Africa in which they said: &#x201C;Black Africa has missed the bus to attack South Africa. They are too late now.&#x201D; If those people believe that, that is all very well, and it fits in with what the hon. member over there said. But I want to tell him this, that we have not in the least finished making our preparations yet. We still need many things, and we will continually need many things, and to summarize the position, I believe that it is to our advantage to say as little as possible. If those hon. members want to know the value we receive for our money, let them just look at our skies. Why should it now be said here and proclaimed to the world? Just the other morning somebody telephoned from Cape Town and said: &#x201C;In heaven&#x2019;s name what is going on in the Cape? There is something terrible going on in the sky.&#x201D; That was not peculiar. We knew what was going on. Our people need only look at the sky to convince themselves as to whether they are getting value for their money in that direction. Let them look at our stores and equipment. I held an inspection only last Friday. Do hon. members expect me as Minister of Defence to say what is in those stores? Greater foolishness than that nobody in the world could expect of me. Go and look at our factories, and see how much military work they are doing. We need just walk around here in Cape Town to see one factory costing R10,000,000, which will start operations in March in connection with military requirements. There are numerous other examples in the country. I am not going to say what things these people are making. Nobody can expect me to do so. Look at the expansion of our radar system, which cost many millions. Look at the progress being made. In March I am going to open one of the biggest stations in the country. It cost a tremendous amount of money. That is where the taxpayers&#x2019; money goes, for their own defence and their own safety. Look at the expansion of our manpower. We are training our manpower in this country on an unprecedented scale. And when hon. members know that it costs us R5,000 to train one single artisan, they will realize where the money goes to. At the moment we have between 1,000 and 2,000 apprentices, and it costs us R5,000 to train each one of them. If it is remembered that it costs us R200,000 to train a jet pilot to a certain stage of efficiency, hon. members will realize what is being done with the taxpayers&#x2019; money. Just think of research in the military sphere and the success we have already achieved there. But do hon. members expect me to say what is being spent in that respect and what they are busy with? I am thinking now only of one item in regard to which we have achieved success. The outside world clamoured for South Africa not to be <span class="col_871-872" refersTo="page_0450"/>supplied with tear-gas. I cannot understand it. It is particularly tear-gas which prevents deaths. Why we should not be allowed to have it I do not know. But, Mr. Speaker, if that is the sort of bagatelle in regard to which they want to boycott us, it is just a joke. Our own researchers within two months developed a gas for us which is much cheaper and much more effective than any gas we could ever have imported. I mention these things to show where the money goes.</p>

<p>Now the very serious matter of our changed strategic position has been mentioned here. The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) called it &#x201C;the total change in our strategic position&#x201D;, and the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) also referred to it. It is true that events in East Africa have brought about a tremendous change. But it is no use our now jumping around like a cat on a hot tin roof because this thing has happened. We have long been prepared even for such eventualities. I referred a few years ago to possible threats to our country. I was ridiculed then. Here we see it to-day. We know that the West has dug itself in thoroughly on the West Coast of Africa, but what has happened now? Now one of the most catastrophic break-throughs one could ever have expected has come on the East Coast. We know what that break-through means to us. We know that now for the first time in our history the communists have a base in the Indian Ocean along the East Coast. We are quite aware of what that means to us, and the Western countries ought to be aware of what it means to them. All the arguments we can advance will not make it more clear to the West because they ought to know what the position is. The question was asked as to whether we had devoted attention to it? How can such a question be asked? In 1960 already I gave instructions that a proper military appreciation should be made for South Africa. That military appreciation was made and I received it in 1961. It is a basic appreciation, based on possible threats to us, and it is continually being supplemented, to the extent that we are physically and economically able to do so, and to the extent that these threats change. We are busy with these matters daily. Last week I dealt with it <i>ad nauseam.</i> Our new appreciation, as the result of what has happened, has already been submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Defence. We are fully <i>au fait</i> in regard to these matters. We are prepared to combat it as far as possible. But the problems we have to face are manifold, and as far as I can see we can only face those dangers if we as South Africans stand together in the sphere of defence. I am therefore glad of the objective discussion of defence matters in this House, but I want to direct this appeal to hon. members. Do not let us come along with all kinds of petty matters just for the sake of saying something. These minor matters can be discussed under my Vote. We are now dealing with the more important matters, and I just want to tell the House and the country this afternoon that we are doing everything, possible for the defence of South Africa. And we are doing it under difficult circumstances. Hon. members say that the circumstances are difficult as the result of the policy of the Government. No, Mr. Speaker, let me now tell you this: Our circumstances are not more difficult than those of any other country with a mixed population in the world to-day. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) said that the future would prove that our policy cannot be implemented. He is wrong. The future may prove it, God forbid, but the difference is that history has already proved that the policy of the United Party has no chance of success at all. That is the difference. I want to appeal to hon. members to stand together in regard to defence.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown is very much in earnest about a military council, and I promised him last year to investigate two matters, firstly the issue of a White Paper in connection with our Estimates, and secondly, whether it was possible to establish a military council. I thoroughly investigated this matter of a military council, and I discussed it with those higher up. A preliminary submission was put before me. But in all honesty I must say that having studied South Africa&#x2019;s present circumstances I have come to the conclusion that we cannot compare ourselves with the U.K. and America, which have such councils, because their position to-day is quite different from that of South Africa. Our military activities at this stage demand more secrecy, and for that reason I do not think we can now establish such a council.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>There will be opportunities later on in the Session to deal with the reply which we have had just now from the hon. Minister of Defence on the points raised by this side of the House. I was interested in the one fact which he gave us and that is the cost to the country of the training of skilled artisans for the Defence Force, not only the cost in money, but also the tremendous cost in manpower, and that factor has a bearing on what I desire to discuss this afternoon, namely, our manpower position.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Minister of Labour and the hon. Deputy Minister of Labour are present, because what I want to say in part answers some of the statements which have been made very recently in respect of this side of the House in regard to the policy as <span class="col_873-874" refersTo="page_0451"/>far as our labour and manpower shortage is concerned. I think the best way of illustrating what we are up against is not to use the statements that we read from time to time from commerce and industry, but to rather examine the reports submitted to the Minister by the Industrial Tribunal in respect of job reservation (Section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act). If we do that, we will discover that although job reservation is claimed by the Government to be of tremendous importance, according to the reports submitted to the Minister it can be readily seen that it is not the answer by any means to the problem facing South Africa as far as manpower is concerned. I think that the report which I feel we should look at more closely than we have done so far is that submitted to the Minister last year dealing with the building industry in Natal and in the Cape Province. If we test this policy of the Government against the findings in that report, then we will discover some things that I think are quite illuminating and also alarming. We find for instance that job reservation for Whites can only be applied without disruption to an industry where the workers in particular trades in the industry are in a majority in a particular area. Secondly, we find that strong trade unions can safeguard the position of its members without job reservation. Thirdly, we find that the failure to apply the principle of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; has led to the application by employees for job reservation.</p>

<p>Now we come up against some to my mind inescapable conclusions as a result of the report I have referred to, and the first is that where job reservation is applied to protect White workers, we can expect a continuous shortage of workers in that industry because of the shortage of White recruits. Secondly, where job reservation is not applied and the rate for the job is not enforced, wage agreements stagnate. Thirdly, the solution lies in strong trade unions, not in strong Government action.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at the Government&#x2019;s record in regard to trade unions. We warned the Government when the Industrial Conciliation Act was amended that their interference in the internal workings of the trade union movement as such would lead to the type of problems which are coming to the fore now. I am speaking particularly of the splitting of the trade unions themselves. We have warned the Government that the splitting of trade unions on racial lines would endanger the White workers, and that is precisely what has happened. The fact that industrial council agreements on racial lines are now possible, is directly due to the Government&#x2019;s policy of splitting the trade unions on racial lines. By that I mean, Mr. Speaker, that it is now possible for unions to negotiate with employers of the same race and come to an agreement, and the wage rates being paid being lower than those agreed to by the White unions in consultation or agreement with their White employers. The hon. Minister and the Deputy Minister know that this has happened and know that the remedy is not job reservation. I will come to that later. I think that the position that has developed in that regard is amply borne out by the report I have referred to, because we have this position that in the Cape for instance job reservation was asked for in the building industry, and the Tribunal came to the conclusion that it could not recommend job reservation for Whites to be applied in all of the trades in the Cape. The reason? That there are not enough Europeans to continue with the work in the building industry in the Cape if job reservation were applied to Whites. That is the simple fact. And in Natal the position is the same in regard to some of the trades. So that the issue we are up against is: Where do we get the recruits from in those industries where job reservation has been applied and where we are dependent upon Whites for the maintenance of the manpower in those industries? Where do we get the recruits from? The Deputy Minister of Labour has said that the manpower shortage will be overcome partly by immigration, but more particularly as a result of the amendments to the Apprenticeship Act of last year. The Deputy Minister said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The improved conditions for apprentices ensure our having improved manpower in future.</block>

<p>I would agree with the hon. Minister if it were possible to get the apprentices, but I think the House will agree that the improved conditions which were approved of last year, can only be applied if we get the recruits, if we get the apprentices indentured. But if we cannot get them to become apprentices, those conditions are not going to help us at all. The Minister, I think, will agree that unless we can get our young people to become indentured, we cannot look forward to an improvement in the manpower position by way of the Apprenticeship Act. The main inducement offered by the Government in the amendments introduced into the Apprenticeship Act last year was in the field of wages. I think the hon. Minister will agree with me that what we hoped for last year in this regard has not as yet materialized, and I think it is necessary to discover why. I went to the trouble to discover what the position was in relation to this problem in the Cape as far as the building industry is concerned, and I find that if we are going to accept the new proposals (that is that wages of the apprentices should be based on a percentage of the artisan rate as laid down in the various agreements), if we are going to apply that as far as the building industry in the Cape is concerned, it is not going to take us very much further as an inducement to get more apprentices, because I find that the percentage scale of payments if applied on the basis of the current rates being paid to artisans, means that a first-year apprentice will receive an increase of R1.34 per week, all inclusive. In his fifth year he will receive 80c per week less than he is receiving at the present <span class="col_875-876" refersTo="page_0452"/>time. That is in the building industry in the Peninsula area where the position is desperate in so far as trained manpower is concerned, particularly in the building industry. The figures given to us by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) in respect of all the skills make it imperative that we should examine the reasons why youths are not coming into the trades as they did in years gone by. But if we turn to the metal industry and look at the record of the Government in this regard, we find that last year, when we debated these improvements as far as wages are concerned, I made the plea to the Government to do everything possible as quickly as possible to bring about the improvements in the wage structure in respect of apprentices, and I was given an assurance that everything would be done by the Government to bring about an improvement so that the intake of apprentices in 1964 would be against the background of improved wages. Well, the information that I have been given is that the National Apprenticeship Committee for the Metal Industry recommended an increase in wages on 28 August 1963, and that the recommendation was in turn recommended by the National Apprenticeship Board on 10 December 1963. I do not know what caused this delay of almost four months, and I hope the hon. Minister will be able to give us an explanation for that. Further, the new wage rates would also apply to existing contracts, and that revised sets of conditions of apprenticeship were being prepared for eight industries, including the metal industry. Sir, that reply was given recently, and at the moment they are still being prepared. The reply continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The National Apprenticeship Committee for the Metal Industry recommended increase in wages on 28 August 1963. Recommendation was in turn recommended by National Apprenticeship Board on 10 December 1963.</block>

<p>Why this long delay of four months?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">New wage rates will also apply to existing contracts. Revised sets of conditions of apprenticeship are being prepared for eight industries including metal industry at moment. Will be submitted for approval by Minister shortly. Delay due to preparation of complete sets of revised conditions and translation. Apart from Metal Apprenticeship Committee&#x2019;s recommendation, Transvaal constituent members of S.E.I.F.S.A. on own initiative decided to pay apprentices increased remuneration as from 1 January 1964.</block>

<p>Now we have this position that we passed these amendments last year and they are not yet in operation, and the hon. Deputy Minister has said that the answer to our manpower problem is in getting more apprentices, and one of the main issues is: How do you get more apprentices if the wage rate offered is ever so much lower than that offered by other undertakings? Take for example the Minister of Transport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I am getting enough.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, because you pay R50 a month to an apprentice in his first year. Compare that with what is being offered by outside industries. There is no comparison and I plead with the hon. Minister to speed up this whole matter and to carry out that part of the recommendations of the Apprenticeship Committee that I have mentioned, bearing in mind that the number of apprentices to come into the trades in 1964 would depend on whether or not the wage structure would be made attractive enough. Now the information I have been given is that the improvement in the commencing rate for apprentices has not yet been gazetted, and I do not know how much longer we will have to wait for it. I say that if you consider this position and remember that the Deputy Minister has as recently as a fortnight ago said that the Government depended on these improvements in the Apprenticeship Act to improve the manpower position, here we have the position that no action has been taken for the last seven months.</p>

<p>Now I come to another issue and I want to ask the Minister whether any consideration has been given to the problem facing employers and to the overall problem of the shortage of manpower in the skilled trades, in respect of exemptions from military training for those who are apprenticed in these key industries. I am putting this forward because the information I have received from the Department of Defence indicates that in 1964 there are 11,875 citizens who should go into military training and who will not be required. The Defence Department will have more than enough recruits. They will have a surplus of 11,875, and it seems wasteful to me to allow apprentices in key industries, where there is an extreme shortage of manpower, to spend nine months doing military training when there are other youths surplus to the requirements of the Defence Department, who are not doing any military training whatever, and they are not employed in key industries either. So I ask the Minister of Labour, who deals with exemptions, whether any action has been taken to try to improve our manpower position in the skilled trades by utilizing the apprentices to the fullest extent so that they will qualify as soon as possible? What purpose is there in having an early trade test if we are going to lose nine months in military training, which is unnecessary because there are more than sufficient other youths who are not in these key positions and who are not being trained because the Defence Department has enough trainees? That is one issue and I think the Minister should go into this question and give some indication as to what he intends doing about it. We cannot afford this kind of waste of manpower. I say that the information given <span class="col_877-878" refersTo="page_0453"/>to us by the Minister of Defence indicates what a costly thing it is to train an apprentice to become a skilled worker. It is a tremendous expense, which is of course also borne by industry, who are very loath to take on an apprentice who has not yet completed his military training. But the point I make again is that it is not necessary for these youths to do their military training when there are others who are available for military training, and more particularly, if there is an emergency and these youths are required they will not be allowed to go on military service. So for what purpose are they being trained, in view of our manpower position? I say we should go into this matter very carefully indeed. I hope the Minister will give it his attention and give us a reply to the charges I have made, because it is no use saying that there must be job reservation to protect the White workers if in the long run we discover that because there are not enough White people the whole of the country will have to suffer. I make that observation because of what I have seen in this report I have referred to in connection with the inquiry by the Industrial Tribunal into the building industry, which makes it quite clear that they cannot apply job reservation unless there are sufficient workers in that particular trade to maintain the continuous training of others in the industry. So we are up against a blank wall and we hide behind job reservation as a means of safeguarding White workers, when all the time what we are in desperate need of are facilities for training the artisans of to-morrow, irrespective of whether there is job reservation or not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in connection with the question of the shortage of manpower, I really think there is a danger of this shortage being exaggerated. To exaggerate it would be economically to our great detriment. That may result in labour inflation. If we talk about a manpower shortage which does not exist to that extent in season and out of season, I really do not think we shall be doing our economy any service. Nobody denies that, as a result of the surprising development which has taken place in the country under this Government, there is a shortage of trained men in certain spheres, but to exaggerate that shortage may give a wrong picture and it may result in labour inflation.</p>

<p>As far as the manpower shortage is concerned, it is just as well that we face up to the position. We are aware of the manpower requirements. Various members of the Government have during the last recess referred to the shortages in the scientific and technical field; that is no secret. But it is also well to bear in mind what is being done to meet the manpower shortage. The other day when the matter was raised here I said I was convinced that as far as our manpower position was concerned, we could be optimistic about the future. That does not mean that we are denying that there are shortages, but when we consider what is being done at the moment and what was done during the past year or two to strengthen our manpower position to meet the increasing requirements, we have every reason to say we can be optimistic about the future in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member has once again referred to what I said about immigrants. I want to repeat what I said the other day, but more specifically so. Last year, as far as skilled labour is concerned, we benefited as follows by immigration: As far as factories and construction works are concerned we gained a total number of 5,055 really qualified men last year. As far as professional men are concerned, we gained 2,589, a total, therefore, of 7,644. That was our net gain as far as skilled labour is concerned from the stream of immigrants last year. As you know, Sir, this stream of immigrants is being maintained and according to our policy it will be maintained for a very long time to come. These people are of great value to us and they constitute one of our main sources of manpower.</p>

<p>But that is not the only source that we tap to stabilize our manpower position. We also see to it that we train the available manpower in such a way that they will be able to produce more than previously. I want to produce further proof in this connection. Take for example the training of our youth in technical schools. In 1958 we had 16 technical schools in the country with 5,000 pupils. Last year the number of technical schools rose to 24, and the number of pupils doubled to 10,349. All in all we had 52 schools, technical, commercial and apprenticeship schools, etc., in 1958 where 18,000 young men were trained. Last year the number increased to 76 where 30,000 were trained. That is also proof of the willingness of the Government to do everything in its power to provide our young men with that technical training so as to stabilize our manpower position.</p>

<p>But that is not all we are doing to convert all our available human material into a usable labour force. I want to refer to the extension that has taken place in our training facilities for adults, not only those that exist at West-lake but those that have been started at our technical colleges this year, something which is quite revolutionary in this country. We started by training young people as operators at our technical college at Pretoria where they were given a quick course of three months so that they could be placed at Iscor or any of those places where they started immediately with a good salary and could do their share as smart operators. But that is not all we are doing. In co-operation with the Departments of Labour and Education we are busy at the moment arranging things in such a way that those adults who in the past were only trained at Westlake and Olifantsfontein can in future attend evening classes at our technical colleges and schools in order to enable the man who is a lift attendant to improve himself. I think <span class="col_879-880" refersTo="page_0454"/>it is surprising what we are doing in this connection. It is not fair to belittle the efforts that have been made in connection with apprentices and to say they are of very little importance. The Apprenticeship Act was only passed last year. You cannot expect to derive full benefit from it within the space of a few months only, Sir. I appealed to employers last year to make use of the new machinery created under the Apprenticeship Act to pay their apprentices higher wages so as to attract more apprentices and to produce a better type of worker. So far eight of the apprenticeship committees have reacted. During the past few months the Department has approved various wage increases for apprentices in various industries, something that will help to attract young people to those industries. But there are still numbers of committees in the country which have not reacted to the appeal of the Government. That is why I am very pleased that the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) has raised this matter because I hope that will assist to bring it home to the apprenticeship committees and the employers in particular, that they too should do their share to produce better apprentices. It is not only the task of the State and of the Government. We have created the machinery and it is their duty now to use it. I have no doubt about it that the improved training facilities that have been created will also provide us with better workers. Alongside this we have the concern of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana about the apprentices who have to do military service. He says that reduces our manpower. The position is that the Exemption Board treats apprentices with the greatest sympathy. In most cases if the apprentice has been indentured he is exempted so that he can complete his apprenticeship. Only in exceptional cases that is not done. Where the name of an apprentice is drawn before he has entered into an apprenticeship contract we see to it that he is placed in the Defence Force in a section which is as far as possible the same as the trade for which he has indentured himself. In other words when he has completed his nine months&#x2019; military service he has already received training in the trade for which he is going to be trained. It is totally wrong, therefore, to say that military service is affecting the manpower position to any extent.</p>

<p>The hon. member once again came with the story that the manpower problem is related to job reservation and he stated that job reservation was no answer to the manpower problem. I admit that job reservation cannot provide us with more men than we have at the moment but it has this effect on our manpower position that job reservation is the most important way in which we can ensure a happy and satisfied manpower force. Had we not had job reservation South Africa would not have enjoyed the industrial peace which she is enjoying to-day. The Opposition is apparently suffering from the illusion that the industrial peace we are having to-day is something that has fallen from the heavens. No, it has not fallen from the heavens. This industrial peace is the direct result of our labour relationships and our labour machinery of which job reservation is one of the main pillars. If we were to abolish job reservation to-day you would immediately endanger that industrial peace. The White workers will immediately feel that they have now been thrown to the wolves. What strikes me time and again is the fact that the United Party, in season and out of season, rant against job reservation and it was only the other day that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition described it as an evil, but the hon. member for Umhlatuzana comes from a province where the United Party is in power and in that province the Provincial Administration applies nothing but job reservation. I want to quote from an article written by one of the Natal Provincial Council members in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 28 November 1963. Mr. A. T. Allison, M.P.C., wrote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It may be true that the United Party preaches the rate for the job, but it is undeniable that here in Natal, where they are in power, they practise job reservation.</block>

<p>He refers to a hospital at Edendale where he has pleaded with them to employ non-Whites and where they have refused to do so. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I was told no, as there is a waiting list of European artisans seeking employment.</block>

<p>That was why he could not persuade them to employ Coloureds at that hospital. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other words, artisans&#x2019; jobs in Natal at non-European hospitals are reserved for Europeans if Europeans want them. I also asked whether, if vacancies occurred, consideration would be given to the employment at non-European hospitals of non-Europeans. I was told: If and when Europeans are not available.</block>

<p>He says: &#x201C;If this is not job reservation, what is it?&#x201D; However, that is the same province about which the City Council of Durban recently said the following in the <i>Natal Mercury</i>: &#x201C;Coloured Labour: City Council attacked,&#x201D; and then it goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Durban Corporation&#x2019;s policy for the employment of Coloured people was nothing but job reservation, Mr. E. G. Rookes, Chairman of Ward 10 Coloured Ratepayers&#x2019; Association, said at a meeting of the association in Durban last night.</block>

<p>That is what the United Party practise in their own domain, but when they can attack South Africa on that score they do so. I say when they can attack South Africa on this score they do so because what other object can they have with these continual attacks on job reservation? <span class="col_881-882" refersTo="page_0455"/>Do they think they will get the support of a single White worker in this country with those attacks in job reservation? Do they think they will get the vote of a single White worker? If that were to have happened surely they would have won seats during the last election where the White workers were the deciding factor, but on the contrary they are going downhill at such a rate that they cut a pathetic figure in this House. No, the United Party are not launching these attacks on job reservation with the object of gaining the support of the people inside the country because they will not get it as is proved in the same report to which the hon. member has referred, the report of the Industrial Tribunal on the building industry in Natal and the Cape Province. They state in that report that workers from Durban appeared before that Tribunal and said that the rate for the job offered them no protection in that area whatsoever. And the workers from the Cape Province said the same. The United Party realize that this thing will not win them a single White constituency. They have one object only and that is to place South Africa in a bad light in the eyes of the world. They are the people who, in season and out of season, talk about the bad image of South Africa. Job reservation is the main culprit which places South Africa in a bad light in the world outside, according to the Opposition, and that is so. Job reservation is one of those things which leaves a nasty taste in the mouth of the outside world to the detriment of the good name of South Africa. I want to ask of the United Party whether they cannot treat this subject in such a way that it does not besmirch South Africa&#x2019;s good name in the world? Can they not approach it objectively? They should not find that difficult. If they apply it in their own Durban City Council, their conscience ought to allow them to view this matter in its right perspective. The United Party is doing this not to gain votes locally but in the hope that they will harm the Nationalist Government from outside and to me that remains the serious charge against the United Party, the United Party who have acted in this debate as people who still totally lack a South African spirit.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There is nothing I would enjoy more than crossing swords with the Deputy Minister of Labour on the question of job reservation, which is one which interests me very much indeed, but I have to content myself merely by saying to the Deputy Minister that when it suits the Government they inform everybody to what little extent job reservation really has been implemented, but when it does not suit them, as this afternoon, the hon. the Minister puts forward job reservation as the foundation stone of the Government&#x2019;s policy and of South Africa&#x2019;s present economic prosperity. I should like to take this up with the Minister on another occasion. I have a private member&#x2019;s motion on the Order Paper, and I will deal with the subject at a later stage. Unfortunately I have to devote my entire time in this debate to replying to the hon. the Minister of Justice, who I understand is unable to be here this afternoon. But I have to reply to him in regard to the discussion we had and the consequences thereof, in the no-confidence debate, on the whole question of the 90-day detention.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will remember that I undertook to give the Minister certain instances of abuses which I claimed had taken place under this law. Since then the hon. the Minister has made a statement to the Press to the effect that he was surprised that the information I had given him was so meagre, that the mountain had laboured and produced a mouse, although he said he would investigate the mouse, and thirdly the Minister indulged in what I can only call the adolescent device which one has come to expect from the former Minister of External Affairs, of getting one of his own backbenchers to put a question so that he could give a 64-dollar answer in this House. He had his backbencher put a number of questions asking exactly what had been supplied to him by a member of the House of Assembly and he gave the answer of course about the meagre information that had been given to him. I have no alternative, therefore, but to describe to the House some of the information I sent to the Minister and to let the House itself judge whether in fact it was a mouse I produced or a rather more dangerous animal.</p>

<p>Perhaps the third alternative is that the Minister has just not done his homework, and I believe that is the case. Let us have a look at what the Minister said I gave him. The Minister stated that he had received only one affidavit about electric shocks and two references to evidence in the Look-smart case, but did the Minister take the trouble to look at the record of that case? If so, can he simply dismiss these allegations so nonchalantly? The two references cover nine pages of the court record. They detail the evidence that six witnesses were prepared to give under oath about electric shocks, and four who were prepared to give evidence about other forms of assault. Ten others were also prepared to give evidence under oath of assault. If the Minister had looked up the references, he would have read Tlale&#x2019;s sworn evidence, and he would have seen the allegations about the treatment this man received, electric shocks and other treatment. Has the Minister instituted an inquiry into these allegations, such as arose out of the court record of this particular case, and if not, why not? What has he done about the detective-sergeant of his Special Branch whose name appears over and over again throughout the evidence in this case? What has he done about this man, and what has he done in particular about the Pretoria Central Police Station, <span class="col_883-884" refersTo="page_0456"/>where most of these tortures are alleged to have taken place, and where counsel appearing for the relatives of the deceased man claimed that a technique of torture had been developed? Now the Minister also referred to a scrap of paper with eight names which I gave him and in connection with which it is merely alleged that they complained that they were assaulted. No statements were attached, said the Minister, in reply to the question so cunningly put by the hon. member for Brakpan. I thought I had made it clear when I mentioned these eight statements that they had in fact been handed to one of the Minister&#x2019;s own police officers at the Bellville Police Station. I wonder whether the Minister bothered to send for these statements? I must say that I did not expect to do the Minister&#x2019;s work for him. After all, it is the Minister of Justice and not I who took responsibility for the implementation of this repulsive clause. I think I had better quote from some of these eight statements which the Minister referred to as &#x201C;eight names on a scrap of paper&#x201D;. One man, Simon Xamulatshwe, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I was told to undress except for my trousers. One African policeman was called and handcuffed me with my hands behind my back and a sack was put over my head. On my small fingers electric wires were connected to a current. I cried and fell down. I was knocked with fists and sticks. I then promised to talk. When I complained I was being killed, wires were once more connected. When I fell down, a policeman stood on my head with his feet. My face was swollen and my jaws were stiff. I was unable to eat for a week; I could only drink liquids.</block>

<p>Another man, in the same eight statements on a scrap of paper said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I was taken to the Bellville Police Station where I was handcuffed whilst still in the van and a canvas sack was put over my head. I was then told to squat. A stick was pushed in between my legs and arms. Something like a ring was put on my two thumbs and I was told to give all information. Thereafter I felt a shock and was shocked twice and then again. I was not hit at this stage but the bag was held tightly over my mouth so that the screams were muffled. Thereafter I was told to stand and was beaten on the head and ribs.</block>

<p>Sir, so I could go on reading from all these statements, these so-called eight names on a scrap of paper.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member is expressing exactly the sort of attitude that all hon. members adopt on the other side of the House; they judge people guilty long before they have been charged.</p>

<p>Answer my question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When people have been properly charged before a court of law and have been given every opportunity to defend themselves, then I would say there would be some sense in the hon. member&#x2019;s rather nonsensical question. None of these people had as yet been charged with any offence. They were assaulted in order to get them to make statements, and therefore I say that not only is their evidence unreliable but they are not proven saboteurs as the hon. member would like to imply.</p>

<p>So much for the eight names on a scrap of paper which I ask the hon. the Minister to examine. He clearly did not send for the statements, otherwise he could never have given the answer which he did in this House.</p>

<p>Now I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to another court record, and this time I ask him to send for the record and to peruse it. I refer to the court record in the case of the State v. Kaleb Matshaba and 18 others.</p>

<p>I had first better quote from the evidence of one of the State witnesses who gave evidence in that case&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He hit me; he said I must admit that I am a soldier who was going to the soldiers. When I would not admit that I was going to train as a soldier he hit me many times. He struck me with his fists in my face. He kicked me in the ribs. He threatened me with starvation. I was beaten again a second time when I was taken to the Pretoria Central Police Station. The third time I agreed with what he wanted to write down.</block>

<p>The cross-examination then went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because you were afraid of being hit again?</block>

<p>His answer was &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. By the way that case was heard in the Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court on 29 November last. Sir, I am prepared to quote, if the Minister requires it&#x2014;since he said that I had produced this mouse&#x2014;from 20 further statements which I have. I am assuming that if I quote from these statements the hon. the Minister will give protection to these people. Can I assume that?</p>

Will the hon. the Minister give his personal assurance that he will give protection to the people whose statements I would like to read out to this House and which, furthermore, I would like to hand to the hon. the Minister across the floor of this House? Because I want to point out that these people are either already serving a term of imprisonment and therefore are in the charge <span class="col_885-886" refersTo="page_0457"/>of the very people who assaulted them, or if they have been freed, run the danger of rearrest under the 90-day clause.</p>

I do not mean departmental inquiries. They do not have any value because again the same people who are in charge of these people conduct the inquiries and they are unlikely to give evidence against themselves.

<p>No, I want a judicial inquiry and Dr. Steytler is not a Judge. I want a judicial inquiry into this, a proper, independent inquiry. What is the hon. the Minister afraid of? After all, he told us that there had been 49 complaints made. Originally he said that there was not a shred of evidence. After wards he told me in reply to a question that 49 complaints had been made, that 32 had been investigated so far and that nothing had been found, as far as he was concerned, to give any foundation to these charges. I want a proper independent judicial inquiry because I cannot attach any importance to a departmental inquiry. Again I ask: What is the hon. the Minister afraid of?

<p>No, not because I say so but because everybody, every thinking person is suspicious of the implementation of this 90-day clause. Every person who values the Rule of Law is suspicious because allegations have been made in the overseas Press, not by me but by others, as the result of evidence given in court, and it is up to the Minister to disprove these statements. That is why I ask for an independent judicial inquiry. I want to point out to the Minister that if I give him these 20 statements he must not assume for a moment that these are the only statements available.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>They are the only ones you have got from the Black Sash so far; you will probably get more.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister is far off the beat again. This does not come from the Black Sash. I have statements here from all sorts of people, including attorneys who have been defending these cases, people whom the Minister will, of course, immediately describe as neo-communists and leftists. It does not occur to the hon. the Minister, with his idea of justice, that people are entitled to be defended against accusations made against them. If a lawyer takes a case like this he is not necessarily either a communist or a leftist but just somebody who happens to be interested in the maintenance of the Rule of Law. Sir, what the hon. the Minister must realize is that for every statement made, there are, of course, dozens of detainees who have made no statement at all, and there are lots who have made statements saying that they were not assaulted, and I have some of those as well. I am delighted, for instance, to be able to say that not a single White detainee was in fact tortured. They are simply left, of course, to the refined torture of solitary confinement. I am able to say also&#x2014;and here I wish to correct an erroneous report which was made on my last speech; I never said it but it was erroneously reported&#x2014;that no non-White female detainee had suffered any physical torture as far as I knew. As far as I can see from the statements that I have here nobody was tortured by the police in Johannesburg, either at the Fort or at any of the police stations falling under the Johannesburg police authorities, but I cannot say this about Pretoria Central, about Marabastad Mamelobie, about Middelburg, about Witbank, about Bellville and about many other police stations. What I think ought to be done is that every single one of the 566 non-White male persons who were detained under this 90-day clause should be called before an independent, judicial inquiry and asked about their experiences, and only then, with that protection which they will enjoy, will the hon. the Minister be in a position to say that there is not a shred of truth in the allegations which have been made about the implementation of this clause. Sir, I want to tell the Minister again that I for one attach very little importance&#x2014;and I am pretty certain that I speak for everybody who believes in the Rule of Law&#x2014;to the type of investigation which he says has already been instituted. They are carried out in secrecy in the prisons and by the very people against <span class="col_887-888" refersTo="page_0458"/>whom the accusations have been made. There is nothing judicial or independent about such an investigation and it is difficult to see how anyone can call these inquiries impartial. I want to say further that all the information I have adds up to the conclusion, the quite ineluctable conclusion, that the 90-day law is being used far beyond the purposes for which the Minister claimed it would be used&#x2014;as if that was not bad enough in all conscience. Sir, the police themselves have made these admissions. They have made these admissions in the course of evidence given at the various trials. One man said that the 90-day law was a mighty weapon in the hands of the police. Another policeman, a detective-sergeant, said that he did not use the 90-day clause for questioning people; he used it to keep them in custody to prevent interference from outside. Sir, how does this tie up with the assurance which the Minister gave this House that the object of the insertion of this section in the Act &#x201C;was not to isolate persons or to punish them; it was not to prevent them from conspiring with other people; it was to obtain information from them; that was the official and only reason&#x201D;? How does this official and only reason tie up with the statement of a witness in one of these trials that he had been detained for 65 days before the police even took a statement from him, and then for a further 55 days before they returned to complete the statement? How does this official and only reason tie up with the overwhelming evidence of assaults and beatings? How does it tie up with the making of false statements under duress, with the threat of indefinite detention, with the re-arrest under the 90-day clause of people who have already been acquitted in the courts? The hon. the Minister is misinformed. He told me in reply to a question the other day that only one such person had been re-arrested. I have the names of 13 such people; I will give them to the Minister and he can check and see whether his information is correct or whether mine is correct. And this only applies to people who were immediately re-arrested after having been acquitted of the charges laid against them. If the intention was not to isolate and punish people why are detainees kept in solitary confinement? What has the security of the State got to do with the exercise and the diet and the reading material of detainees&#x2014;reading material which the non-Whites find so difficult to get? What has the Minister&#x2019;s assertion that this was not meant as a punishment got to do with the intolerable conditions under which most non-White detainees have been kept? If the intention was not to punish or to victimize people, can the hon. the Minister explain the position of detainees who are endorsed out of the urban area when they are released after their detention under the 90-day clause and who find themselves unable to get permission to take jobs again, even though these people have apparently acquitted themselves and have done everything which the Minister wanted of them? Will he explain to us whether or not it is in the spirit of this law of his that the non-White trade union movement is clearly being smashed; that dozens of officials of non-White trade unions have been taken into custody and detained under this Act? Will he tell us whether there is any connection between this Act and the fact that Mrs. Tlale, the wife of the chief witness in the Looksmart case, has not been allowed to renew her licence to trade in Alexandra Township? Finally I want to ask the Minister what inference one can draw from his dark statement about communist and leftist advocates and attorneys who are interested in the defence of these people, bearing in mind the fact that we know that the hon. the Minister intends to introduce legislation to restrict admission to the Bar and the Side-Bar? Can he tell us if there is any connection between this law and the warning recently issued to a woman, who is by no stretch of the imagination a communist, who has been warned to desist from activities promoting Communism when all this woman has been doing has been to assist 90-day detainees to obtain defence? Can the hon. the Minister tell us that the law is being implemented within the bounds within which he assured this House it would be implemented, although I have no good word to say for this law, however narrowly it is in fact implemented? Sir, I say that there is nothing in the world that hon. members opposite would like more than for all trials to be held in secret, for no defence to be provided and for no publicity to be shed on any of these things. I hope I am wrong and that as far as the Minister is concerned that is not his desire. If I am wrong and if the Minister does not share that desire for secret trials in dark places, for trials where no defence is given, for trials on which the light of publicity never shines, then I can assure the hon. the Minister, if he is interested in seeing justice done, if he is interested in doing more than just saving face, I say to him that in view of all the publicity abroad about the allegations which have already been made, he would do South Africa a service by instituting a completely independent inquiry into the 90-day clause and its implementation. Then and only then, if the allegations are dismissed, the hon. the Minister can face his accusers with the weight of evidence on his own side, and if they are not dismissed then at least the hon. the Minister will have shown that he and his Government take their responsibilities quite seriously and that they are not prepared to give tacit approval to what I can only call Gestapo methods of extracting information.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I did not want to waste my valuable time on replying to the hon. member who has just sat down but it has become almost impossible not to respond to her accusations. Mr. Speaker, one asks yourself what attitude the hon. member has adopted during the whole period when the two General Law Amendment Bills were before <span class="col_889-890" refersTo="page_0459"/>this House? How can you reconcile the attitude she adopted then with the sort of justice she pleads for here or can you only attribute the attitude she adopted then with a desire to step into the breach for people who break the laws of this country? I remember, when the first Bill was under discussion, that that hon. member moved six amendments. Of course she did not have a seconder in her own party but she got one in the ranks of the United Party, and on six occasions on one day she led the United Party with Leader and all across the floor of this House to vote for her amendments. When the second General Law Amendment Bill was discussed she led the United Party across the floor of this House on five occasions to vote for her amendments and every one of those amendments was aimed at paralysing that General Law amendment legislation. What was her object? Sir, when you state a case you have an object, and I am convinced in my soul&#x2014;I am averse to fighting with ladies but they can be so obdurate at times that you have to do something about it&#x2014;that the hon. member has adopted that attitude because she is sympathetically inclined towards Communism or towards law-breakers. If she says she is not sympathetically inclined towards Communism then she is sympathetically inclined towards law-breakers because she has consistently refused to give those laws a chance to rope in those law-breakers. The hon. member to-day said something very revealing. She asks the Minister for an inquiry but it must not be a departmental inquiry. She is not satisfied with an inquiry by magistrates or persons who have to maintain the law. She wants an inquiry that will absolve the type of person she protects here. She does not want a fair inquiry; she wants them to be absolved. That is the attitude she has adopted from the very outset up to to-day. She does not trust the Minister; she does not accept his word. She does not trust the magistrates of the country; she does not trust the Judges of the country. Whom does she trust?</p>

<p>I do not trust her either.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I also want to say a few words to the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan). He has made very serious statements in this House. I cannot devote too much time to him, however, because I have a long list of subjects I want to deal with and I really want to talk about agriculture to-day. That hon. member shouted very loudly simply because he wanted the Press representatives to hear what he had to say but he ignored what was subsequently said to prove that his statements were unjustified, unfounded and insulting.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) who has now emerged as one of the main speakers on the United Party side for the simple reason that he has acquired the knack of not stating the true position; of saying things which are absolutely wrong. He came here with the greatest untruth you could think of, Sir, by stating that the Minister of Agriculture was supposed to have said that he did not want the farmers to get a reasonable price for their products. Mr. Speaker, have you ever heard greater nonsense that that? Have you ever heard greater rubbish than that? I apologize for the gross expression but what the hon. member has said is untrue, and anything that is untrue is rubbish. We get the untruth across the floor of this House that the Minister is supposed to have made such a statement, that Minister who is sacrificing his whole life and all his energies in the interests of the agricultural industry. Mr. Speaker, ask those of us who know, those of us who live in the drought-stricken areas. Do not ask those people who farm along the coast where there are no droughts. We know what the hon. the Minister is sacrificing in the interests of those farmers who get into difficulties. The hon. member made that allegation because there is nothing else he can lay at the door of the Government. We had the same thing in the motion of no-confidence debate. When they could not find anything on which to attack the Government, they selected an Afrikaner organization as something to get their teeth into. Mr. Speaker, I am a person who shows gratitude, and I belong to a nation who shows gratitude and I also belong to a party which shows gratitude, but I am grateful for the attitude the United Party has adopted during this Session and also during previous sessions, because what we have not been able to prove to the world, what we have found impossible to prove, they have now proved by the petty way in which they have acted. In other words, they have proved to the electorate that they have nothing to offer this House or this country. All they can do is to sow suspicion and to be petty. That old truism has again become very clear to me to-day, Sir, namely, that irrefutable facts are the weapon of the wise man, but rebuking, the sowing of suspicion, belittling, untruths and chattering are the weapon of the man who has no facts and they are also the weapon of the man without wisdom. That was what we had from the hon. member who made that attack on an honourable Afrikaner organization. I want to say this to the credit of the English-speaking members on that side: When that attack was made on that organization of the Afrikaners the English-speaking members on that side did not participate in it to the extent to which the Afrikaans-speaking members on that side did&#x2014;the doctors and those people. The English-speaking section deserved to be praised for their behaviour. They expressed their agreement but these attacks on that group of Afrikaners against whom they could not prove anything came from the Afrikaans-speaking members on that side. It was a case of sour grapes, Sir. This sort of attack you only get from a certain group of people, as a matter of fact, it also came from people who were <span class="col_891-892" refersTo="page_0460"/>refused membership of that organization. It is a case of sour grapes.</p>

<p>That enemy is to-day destroying hundreds of irreplaceable farmers; farmers who cannot be replaced by other farmers. The biggest enemy of agriculture in the world is busy destroying those people. Those people who know something about the lowveld will agree with me that after four years of drought hundreds of farmers are destroyed by that enemy. They are consumed by the drought. I say we cannot replace those people and I should like to describe that type of person so that hon. members can understand him, because I understand him. He is the type of person who, when he walks behind the plough, picks up a handful of soil every now and then, holds it to his nose and inhales its fragrance; it is as if he wants to inhale the fertility of that soil. He is the type of person who, after a shower of rain, walks in his bare feet through his lands, between the plants, so that his feet sink into the loose soil. It is as if he wants to draw strength from the soil, the soil that gives strength to the plants. I do believe that he draws spiritual strength from it because he makes his living from the life that surrounds him, from the natural strength that flows from that natural life. You cannot replace that type of person, Sir. You can replace any artisan or any worker but you cannot replace that type of person in agriculture. It is a fact to-day that many of those people are destroyed by the drought, that enemy which I regard as the greatest enemy of all the enemies against whom we prepare our self in the military field. That enemy is busy conquering South Africa. The South African nation has not yet reached that stage. We must protect ourselves against that enemy to the same extent to which we protect ourselves against attacks from outside, because that is an enemy that wants to destroy our country. We have a large amount of brain power that can be used for that purpose. I do not think there is a group of people who is more grateful to the Government and the Ministers who have done everything in their power. You can ask me, Mr. Speaker, because I know; that was why I told you a few moments ago everything the Minister had done. I am a member of the committee that is trying to do something for those people. Never have they knocked at the door of this Minister and this Government without getting a sympathetic hearing. I heard it when the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) said that the Minister was supposed to have said that the small farmer must leave the land. I have never before heard greater nonsense. Only a person with a hard heart can say such a thing and neither of those two Ministers has a hard heart. I know; I know what they have done.</p>

<p>Will it be wrong on my part if I ask that brain power that we have in this country, brain power that is concentrated in various organizations, organizations that were established with the object of trying to solve the problems of the country, to pool their resources to try to find some way in which to fight this great enemy of the farmer in South Africa? My reason is this: If we want to cope with the development that is taking place in this country we shall have to expand our agricultural industry. We are in urgent need of that type of farmer whom I have just described to you, Sir. We cannot do without him. We cannot import him. We can import other types, but not his type. That is why I am asking that they should be protected. My request is that that brain power, whether it exists individually or whether it is concentrated in a body, should come together and devise a plan, firstly, to fight that enemy, and secondly, to influence and to convince the <span class="col_893-894" refersTo="page_0461"/>country and the people, even those people who want to kill the Minister because of the good service he is rendering, that they must see to it that the Minister of Finance has enough money, even if a special taxation has to be imposed, to provide the Minister of Agriculture and Water Affairs with money, so that he will have the only weapon in the world, namely water, in his hands to fight the drought enemy; so that he will be able to make that weapon so strong in this country that he will be able to fight that enemy and do away with all fears for the future. I do not think I am asking too much when I ask those people who have had the God-given privilege of studying and developing a sound brain, those people who have formed large organizations, to utilize their brain power in order to assist in seeing that the funds are available so that it will not be necessary for the Minister of Water Affairs to say that he lacks the funds. I make this appeal to the brain power of South Africa, to the whole House and to the group opposite who can sometimes be so obdurate.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I am aware that it is part of the tradition of this House that a new member, speaking for the first time, is expected to deal with some matter that is not controversial. The same tradition applies, of course, in the Provincial Council from which I have just come. I am aware also, Sir, that the Rules of the House prevent me from reflecting upon any of the statutes already passed by Parliament. With those restrictions in mind it may still be possible to indulge in a piece of special pleading on one issue or another, although it becomes increasingly difficult in the field of South African public affairs to find any subject which is not controversial in one degree or another, if not to all then at least to some.</p>

<p>Sir, since one might be said to be in a stage of transition from provincial government to that of national government, I should like this afternoon to speak on the rights and powers of local government. Local government in this country has been in a state of what might be described as mild decline for some 15 to 20 years. The clearest symptom of this decline is the loss of powers and responsibilities by local authorities and the provincial councils. No one, I think, would contest the statement that the rights and powers of the provincial councils have been considerably curtailed in recent years. There are some, no doubt, Sir, who consider that to be a deliberate and even a desirable object of policy. It would be pleasant, of course, if one could off-set these losses by announcing gains in other directions but I can see none at all. Looking at the picture as a whole, Sir, the losses outweigh all else. But that is not all, for the position of local authorities, to-day, even in regard to the matters for which they remain responsible, is by no means what it was some 20 years ago.</p>

<p>The chief danger to local government here and elsewhere is that it will become, if indeed it has not already become, a subordinate agent, a rubber stamp merely of the central government, instead of a free and responsible partner within the sphere of its own activities. I think it is correct to say that our local authorities in South Africa to-day are controlled to a unprecedented extent by central government departments.</p>

<p>Hon. members may say that he who pays the piper will always call the tune. But the trend is unfortunate none the less, and for a number of reasons. I propose to deal briefly with the matter to-day on the basis of general principles and to leave it at that. Mr. Speaker, the decline in local government in South Africa, which we have all witnessed, has taken place during a period when there has been a vast expansion both in the economic field and in the functions of the State itself. No doubt most of us are agreed that the provincial councils, in conjunction with Parliament, should formulate the broad principles of policy which local authorities have to follow in providing services of general importance. The question at issue to-day, however, seems to me to be to what extent the provincial councils are consulted and to what extent they are given their orders. I am sure that hon. members on both sides of the House will agree with me that it is quite essential in this country, as in any other, to preserve and strengthen the qualities of local initiative, local civic pride and a public spirit, because it is from these things that the ultimate political activities and interests of the nation spring. I would say that we weaken them at our peril. It is not simply a question of being parochial or provincial in our thinking in these matters. I think it goes a great deal deeper than that.</p>

<p>Local government is, after all, the best instrument with which to distribute power in any country on democratic and sensible lines. It offers a fairly certain method of avoiding the dangers of what is known as a managerial society. In South Africa we have a very adequate machinery for this purpose, with the provinces exercising control on a regional basis and they, in turn, delegating authority to the municipal and divisional councils, village management boards, hospital boards, school boards and so on. There are those who state openly and unashamedly that they would like to abolish the provincial councils&#x2014;that they consider them to be something of a constitutional anachronism at the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that our thinking should tend in this direction at a time when a country like the United Kingdom, with a highly developed system of local government, has just appointed a Local Government Commission which is considering the breakdown of the country into regional councils (councils which would be somewhat similar to our provincial councils) for the more efficient control of local authorities&#x2014;and the better to cope with local problems. I want to quote <span class="col_895-896" refersTo="page_0462"/>briefly from an article which appeared in the <i>Spectator</i> of August of last year written by Mr. W. A. Robson, perhaps the greatest authority on local government in the United Kingdom. It is headed regional councils. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have already mentioned the need for a regional body to deal with the mounting problems of the south-east. But there is an urgent need for similar bodies elsewhere. A more far-sighted policy would be to go the whole hog and set up regional bodies for the whole country. They should be directly elected, with paid membership, and they could take over many of the functions at present exercised by Government Departments as well as being given new powers.</block>

<p>In other words, Sir, the tendency is towards greater decentralization and not the reverse. There is a marked and, I think, an unfortunate tendency in the higher echelons of government in South Africa to-day&#x2014;and here I am not referring to any particular political party, it might be said to apply to them all&#x2014;to regard with some degree of patronage, to dismiss with a wave of the hand even, those who are occupied with provincial or local affairs. I find that trend unfortunate, wherever it manifests itself. We have heard a good deal recently of the extent to which the mass of the people are losing touch with Parliament and those who have the privilege of representing them here. The most essential link in this chain is the direct involvement of the largest possible number of ordinary public-spirited South African citizens in local government, from which as I have said the national interests and policies inevitably spring. I know that there are those who will argue that centralized control makes for greater efficiency. It is a very old argument indeed. But it is the basis of my case to-day that efficiency was never intended to be the sole object of local government. It has always been considered important that ordinary people should be associated with the provision of local schools, roads, hospitals, municipalities and their attendant services and amenities. It has always been considered important, we accept that, that they should plan them, vote the money for them, pass the contracts, supervise their construction, and feel that they were really their own schemes, and not merely those of a distant benevolent Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this process sometimes takes longer and is, to that extent, perhaps less efficient than if the central government decided what everybody should do and what everybody should have. But it is essential to the democratic process and its results have invariably been to produce good citizens as well as good roads.</p>

<p>Sir, not all problems are central problems. I think we sometimes forget that and we are making a very grave mistake if we think that they are. The systematic removal of powers from the provincial councils in recent years faces South Africa with a vital decision. Sooner or later we have got to make up our minds as to what we want: more and more centralization, leading to a high degree of impersonal, bureaucratic control, or genuine representative government at every level. If it is the latter, as, indeed, I hope it is, we must accept that it may involve compromise and difficulties, local inefficiencies and local inequalities, in some cases. I submit that that is one of the prices that has to be paid for the education of the electorate in the art of becoming active and responsible citizens. I think it is a price worth paying provided an intelligent balance is struck.</p>

<p>There is one last point I should like to make and it is this: Constitutionally in South Africa the Provincial Councils derive their powers from the central government which retains the right to reduce, extend or abolish those powers. In practice the ideal is accomplished by a partnership between the Government and the Provincial Councils&#x2014;or should be. It is important never to lose sight of this partnership&#x2014;I repeat the word &#x201C;partnership&#x201D;, Sir; I think we should reaffirm it as a vital principle, i.e. that the smaller regional body is not subordinate to the larger; it merely does a different job. In other words, there are two levels of authority responsible for larger or smaller areas and therefore undertaking larger or smaller tasks.</p>

<p>Constitutionally the Provincial Councils in this country are independent, parallel authorities. Their ordinances have the force of law as much as any Statute passed by this Parliament. They therefore govern in the legal sense. Our own experience should have taught us that Councils which are merely subordinate or advisory tend to lose interest&#x2014;their members become apathetic and their functions meaningless. I regret to say that there has been a general tendency for the central government to act towards the provincial legislatures as though they were entirely subordinate and not parallel authorities functioning at different levels. We in the Cape, for instance, have on several occasions been placed in the individious position whereby large sections of existing provincial legislation have been rendered null and void as the result of legislation passed by Parliament over the heads of the Provincial Councils. For a long time now the trend has been also towards an increasing delegation of power, through Parliament, to the various Ministers to enable them to override local authorities and the Provincial Councils.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in three out of the four provinces in South Africa the present Government has a majority. Can it not be left to the Provincial Councils to see that Government policy is implemented? No one, surely, would suggest that Natal has been as intractable as all that! I say further, Sir, that this unfortunate approach to provincial government and to local government is having a deadening effect and that people are losing <span class="col_897-898" refersTo="page_0463"/>interest. The repercussions are already becoming evident in the sphere of national politics, particularly amongst voters in the urban areas where the interference has been greatest You cannot expect public interest in the country&#x2019;s affairs to be satisfactorily maintained merely by asking people to cast their vote in a general election once in every five years. That is not enough.</p>

<p>I will concede, Sir, that a genuine need for co-ordination in one field or another may from time to time exist, or that in the national interest the Government may feel obliged, in certain circumstances, to exert its authority to compel a local authority or a Provincial Council to fulfil its obligations, failing this to take the necessary powers to perform the work itself. If such legislation was confined to broad directives of national policy in the one instance, and to temporary measures of direct control in the other, it might be more acceptable. But the reluctance of Government Departments to lessen their grip is becoming increasingly apparent and local government is deteriorating as a result.</p>

<p>Our experience in the Provincial Councils is that this has led, in the last few years, to the formulation of a mass of supervisory and concurrent powers relating to such things as road and transport regulations, the administration of urban Bantu affairs, employment conditions, the designation and control of separate local authorities and group areas, population registration, slum clearance, the allocation of separate amenities, types of schools and the division of education, and so on. The list is endless. Many of the additional powers now exercised by the central government duplicate powers already conferred upon the Provincial Councils and set down in Ordinances passed by them. The disease is infectious, Sir, for whilst the Provincial Councils have been steadily losing their powers to the central government, they themselves have been busy depriving smaller bodies under their jurisdiction in a similar way.</p>

<p>In conclusion I regret to say&#x2014;it is merely an observation of fact&#x2014;that during the past decade the prevailing tendency has been to act on matters of vital importance to the provinces, not as though the Administrator and his senior officials did not exist, but as though the Provincial Councils themselves, as legislative bodies, do not exist. In other words, the South African people themselves are being disregarded. They have often been treated with a remarkable disdain. The tacit dismissal of the Roussouw Commission&#x2019;s report on Separate Local Authorities in the Cape Province is a case in point. I am convinced, Sir, that in deciding how responsibility is to be shared between the central government and the Provincial Councils, it is a mistake to try to be too precise, or to cast the division of responsibility into a permanent mould. Local government, as hon. members know, like any other form of government, is not a static thing, and its relationship to the centre is constantly having to be adjusted to meet growing and changing situations. We accept that.</p>

<p>As a general rule, Mr. Speaker, it may be said that it is right that Government Departments should give guidance on national policy, should keep a watching brief to ensure that standards are maintained and should scrutinize expenditure where the national taxpayer&#x2019;s money is involved. But it is bad, Sir, when guidance on policy degenerates into interference in details which provincial and local authorities can best settle for themselves. And it is bad when public-spirited local citizens are deprived of the right to make executive decisions on matters of immediate concern to themselves. It is therefore my contention today, Sir, that this unfortunate tendency of interference by the central government over a long period in the affairs of local authorities and of the Provincial Councils has weakened the whole fabric of democratic government in South Africa to-day. I plead that the Government give this matter the serious consideration it deserves.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to avail myself of this opportunity to extend my hearty congratulations to the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) on her maiden speech in this House. She chose a subject on which she can speak with authority. I admit that I do not agree with everything she has said. I think I have the right to say that because I was a member of the Provincial Council myself for a period of ten years. I also know something about provincial matters, Sir. She stated her case very well and in a calm manner and I trust she will continue to speak in that reasonable and calm manner in future. My sincere congratulations on your maiden speech.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. G. de K. Maree) made a speech here last night which greatly impressed me. He expatiated on the potentials of that area. He pointed out the tremendous development that could still take place there. He then raised one matter which I felt should receive very serious attention. He referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to the building of roads in that area. Mr. Speaker, there is another part of the Republic also situated in the Cape Province, where the development is only in its initial stages and where it is impossible at this juncture to gauge what riches can be derived from it. I am, of course, referring to the Northern Cape Province. I want to say at the outset that hon. members need not be afraid that I will enlarge on the potentials of the Northern Cape Province, because everybody knows that the future of the Cape Province lies in that area. There cannot be much doubt about that. The possibilities are there. Very little is lacking. The only thing that is lacking is to tackle the work and to start the development. Under the policy of the Government to harness the waters of the Orange River tremendous development will take place in the Republic. <span class="col_899-900" refersTo="page_0464"/>That being the case we should, as it were, plan ahead so that when the proposed area of 360,000 morgen of land come under water and we reap the full benefits of it, we shall be in a position to meet that increased production of the country. Before the First World War, during the period of great development in Germany, she concentrated on two aspects in particular. In the first instance she ensured that her railways could transport the products of the country. In the second instance Germany concentrated on the construction of roads. That was why during the First World War Germany was in a position to offer the strenuous resistance she did offer.</p>

<p>What is the position in our country, Sir? As I say we too must plan for the future. Before Union we had the Republic, we had Natal and we had the Cape Colony as it was called in those days. Every one had its own system. The old Cape Parliament saw fit to introduce a system in 1855, known as the Divisional Council system, under which roads were constructed and maintained. That system was introduced in the year 1855. That means that that system has been in operation for a period of 109 years. You must take it, Sir, that if a system has stood the test of time for a period of 109 years it certainly cannot be a bad system, that it must have been a very good system otherwise it would have been done away with. The old Cape Parliament saw fit to allocate certain sources of revenue to the divisional councils, because the divisional councils were interested bodies. In order to fulfil their function the old Cape Parliament empowered the divisional councils to levy a tax on fixed property, to introduce a dog tax and a wheel tax. When Union was established the Union Government thought it fit to retain the divisional council system as a well-tried system that had served well under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Councils which were then created as new bodies. But before Union the traffic on our roads was of such a nature that it was not necessary to spend large sums of money on the construction and the maintenance of those roads, It may interest hon. members to know that when the first divisional council was chosen in Steynsburg my father was a member of that council. When I subsequently became a member of the divisional council I looked up the old minutes and I found that he had reported to the divisional council that he had given a stretch of 12 miles under contract to be constructed and maintained at the colossal amount of &#x00A3;7 10s. per annum. Where the divisional councils already had the power in those days to levy taxes, you will appreciate, Sir, that the circumstances with which they had to deal were of such a nature that they did not call for great expenditure. But as we developed the position changed completely. Then we had Union and as the country developed and as the cart and the wagon were replaced by mechanical means of transport that system, of course, became obsolete and there were radical changes. The divisional councils still retained the right to levy taxes and the provincial councils then said they would pay the divisional councils a certain amount as a subsidy to meet the increased expenditure and on the other hand the Union Government, of course, supplied the provincial councils with funds, or subsidized them, to enable them to fulfil their duties in that connection. That was how the system worked and how it developed further and further. It called for more and more money until we find today that tremendous amounts of money have to be spent on the construction and maintenance of roads, roads that have to be suited to the methods of transport we have to-day. Where each province was responsible for the construction and maintenance of its roads the Union Government nevertheless found that the Provincial Council with its divisional councils in the Cape Province could not meet the costs and the Union Government decided to introduce a national road system. The costs in connection with the construction and maintenance of the national road were borne by the Union Government. That was a great relief to the provincial councils, as well as to the divisional councils in the Cape Province. But in spite of that relief, as the country developed further, the position became extremely difficult. When you think of it that we have about 1,000,000 motor cars in the Republic to-day using the roads in the Republic, Sir, it is understandable that the position has changed completely because the motorist who also pays his additional tax has every right to say: I want a road on which I can travel in comfort with the vehicle on which I also have to pay a tax. Where the Union Government has established the national road system we find to-day that there are 5,020 miles of national road in the Republic which were exclusively constructed by the Union Government and the Union Government also maintained them. But the Union Government realized that even that was not enough and it introduced a system of special roads under which it took certain responsibilities off the shoulders of the provincial councils. The Union Government also assumed the responsibility of financing that second system of roads. That brought further relief. As far as the Cape Province is concerned, however, it is very definitely not enough. There has been such development that that relief is not sufficient. I want to point out to the House that the Cape Province is larger than any of the other three provinces. The Cape Province has more miles of road than any of the three other provinces. We have the system of divisional councils in the Cape Province and those divisional councils with the assistance of the provincial councils, have to build a certain mileage of roads and maintain them. Let me just say in passing the costs the Union Government has had to bear in connection with the 5,020 miles of national road and the 453 miles of special road, amount to R252,644,059. That shows you, Sir, how essential it was for the Government to assist <span class="col_901-902" refersTo="page_0465"/>the provincial councils to build decent roads to meet the transport needs of the country.</p>

<p>Over what period?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the National Roads Act came into operation in 1937 and the amount I have mentioned was for the period up to 30 June 1963. A certain distance of roads still has to be built and maintained by the Provincial Council and the Provincial Council in the Cape Province, and that distance is no less than 96,000 miles. It is impossible for them to finance that. I am sorry my time has nearly expired because I should have liked to enlarge on that, but in the Cape Province especially the position has become impossible. As far as traffic is concerned to-day provincial borders no longer exist. Motor traffic knows no provincial borders. Where we have these long stretches of road in the Cape Province that must be constructed and maintained, with the accompanying costs, I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to have the whole position inquired into. When you think of it, Sir, that it costs at least &#x00A3;10,000 to construct one mile of national road you will realize that it is an impossible task for the province and the divisional councils to keep pace with the tremendous development which is taking place. That is why I am asking the hon. the Minister to have the whole position investigated with a view of a new set-up as far as the financing of road building in the Republic is concerned. I am not talking about the Cape Province alone, but of the whole Republic. If we can place the road system of the Republic on a sound basis I go so far as to say that we shall be able to reduce the terrific loss of life that we have on our roads annually and if we succeed in that I think we shall have achieved a great object. I want to ask the Minister, therefore, to try to devise a new setup for the construction and the maintenance of roads in the Republic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to say to the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) that I very much appreciate the courteous way in which he thanked the hon. member who preceded him, and I would like to agree with him that his praise was well merited and that we are looking forward to many youthful contributions by the hon. member in this House.</p>

<p>Before dealing further with the hon. member&#x2019;s speech I would like to say a word in respect of the speech of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) who referred to certain matters which, so far as this side of the House is concerned, were dealt with exhaustively by my Leader earlier in the Session during the no-confidence debate, and I do not propose to follow the hon. member when she raised those matters to-day.</p>

<p>I would like to join with the hon. member for Kimberley (North) in regard to the importance of roads in this country. I think all of us in this House agree that it is tremendously important that we should continue to build on the very sound foundation which has been laid. It is quite obvious that in a modern state one of the most important services which can be rendered is that you have adequate road services. I would like to carry what the hon. member said a little further. I believe that quite apart from the building of adequate roads in the rural areas, there is a tremendous job of work waiting to be done in many of our great urban areas, and I would say that so far as the Witwatersrand is concerned, I am entirely dissatisfied with the slowness of the progress in the provision of trunk roads along the length of the Reef, through the large urban areas, and by-pass roads which will remove a great deal of the traffic which is tending to choke up the centres of our large cities. I have been trying for some time to get something done about the airport road, and I am glad to note that a start has been made with the double track, but examination has shown that it is quite clear that unless work is speeded up to a great extent, even that development is going to be inadequate before the time is reached when the six main highways are completed according to the present programme. I believe that the building of these trunk roads in our major urban areas is something which is an urgent necessity; certainly in many of these large urban centres in the event of an attack on this country, there is no question that there would be chaos from the point of view of the traffic which the roads in many of our great centres can bear. Therefore I join with the hon. member. I believe that it is absolutely essential to get down to this job and see to it that the road system which we have is worthy of this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned that the cost of our national roads up to date has been the sum of R252,000,000. I would like to point out that the gold-mining industry, in respect of which I wish to say a few words this afternoon, actually spent in stores last year an amount more or less equal to the sum quoted by the hon. member. The amount which the gold-mining industry spent in respect of stores last year was R253,500,000, and the amount which was spent out of that amount on South African stores was R235,347,873, of which of course a great portion came from our great farming industry. I mention that figure as a comparison to the figure quoted by the hon. member, to show the very great importance of that industry.</p>

<p>There were a number of matters I wished to refer to in regard to the mining industry, and the one I want to mention now is pneumoconiosis. It had been hoped to deal in this debate rather exhaustively with some of the complaints which have come from miners in this regard, but the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher), who is particularly well qualified to deal with this matter as he is a medical man who practises in an area where <span class="col_903-904" refersTo="page_0466"/>there is a large number of miners is not here, and we will have to reserve that matter for the Budget debate. But I would like to say to the hon. Minister very seriously that we are not satisfied that the new Pneumoconiosis Act has provided the solution to this problem which the hon. Minister hoped it would provide when he introduced it a couple of years ago. We believe that there are still cases which require to be looked into. But I do not intend to carry that matter any further at present.</p>

<p>What I do wish to refer to is the very great importance of the fact that I believe that this Government should wake up to the fact that we are losing very great assets by reason of the fact that it is impossible for some of the older mines to carry on, because the Government is not giving realistic assistance, and extract some of the gold which they have to bypass because it is of too low a grade, and once it has been bypassed (as the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) will agree) is probably bypassed for ever. Sir, we know that there are many mines, and Crown Mines is one of them, which are in that position. We had the privilege of visiting the Crown Mines during the visit to the mines arranged by the Chamber of Mines during the recess. In passing I would like to say that those visits were of the utmost value, I believe, to members of this House, and I most sincerely hope that they will be continued, and I would like to express my appreciation and that of members on this side of the House to the Chamber of Mines for having arranged those tours, which were tremendously instructive and, I believe, have better qualified all those of us who are interested in mining to do our job as members representing mining constituencies. We are very grateful indeed to them. But those who were on the same tour as I was, will remember that in the case of Crown Mines, the facts of that mine were put to us by the manager. It is a well-known fact that as the reef begins to dip, the tendency is for values to lessen. The cost of extracting gold in some of the older sections is relatively high, for various reasons sometimes, and it is perfectly clear that in respect of the Crown Mines alone ore running into tens of millions of pounds will be bypassed, and we are assured that once that has been bypassed, never again will it be possible to return and extract that gold. There are great assets that may be bypassed in that way, and I do beg the hon. Minister that as a matter of urgency he should go into this question, because it is clear that this and other of the marginal mines and the dying mines are bypassing and leaving buried in the ground gold which obviously could be of great value to this country.</p>

<p>Are you now accusing the management of the mine?</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>The complaint is not against the management of the mine. I believe they are doing all they can. It is the job of the Government to see that they are not wasting assets. But my belief is that these mines desire to get those assets but that in the circumstances of to-day and without Government assistance, much of that gold will have to be left underground for ever unless this problem is faced. I would like to pay a tribute to the workers in the mines. We saw the conditions under which they work and they unquestionably deserve the thanks of this country for the magnificent job which they are doing. But to come back to this question I would like to quote from the speech of the then President of the Chamber in 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A mine that has been closed, stripped of equipment and allowed to flood is probably lost for all time. It would not be economically possible to recommence operations on a material scale even if the gold price were raised very substantially, although, as in the past, some degree of reclamation work would probably be possible in the upper levels where the heavy re-equipment and operative costs of major shaft systems, pumping and ventilation would not be involved.</block>

<p>Sir, the prosperity of this country, we know, is based in a remarkable degree on the mines, and I would like to make a plea for those towns which exist as the result of the mines, and I believe that it is vital that their prosperity should be maintained, that it should be the aim of Government policy to maintain that prosperity and that they should ensure that they will not at any time become ghost towns. It is utterly unnecessary if there is a sufficient encouragement of industries. There is no reason why we should have any ghost towns in this country if industries are developed, and while I am pleading for towns in the mining areas, exactly the same applies to any town which may perhaps be retrogressing in another part of the country. I am not making a plea for the concentration of industries only in those areas, but I do plead that the policy of the Government should be such as to ensure the maintenance of the prosperity of those areas, and unquestionably in the absence of a more sympathetic policy on the part of the Government, in the course of time some of our towns which are mining towns and which have played a very important part, will obviously have to go backward instead of marching forward. That is quite unnecessary, and unquestionably this can very easily be done through the following of a proper policy on the part of the Government. I would draw attention to the fact that in those areas we have the electricity, we have the water and through keeping the existing mines going as long as possible and following a policy which does not extract industries from these areas, but will encourage adequate industry to go to those areas, it is quite possible for us to maintain the prosperity of those areas for all time.</p>

<p>No, Sir, the position is that industrialization through the great work of the city councils of a large number of reef towns, a great deal is being done in this regard, but it is perfectly clear if one examines the number of mines in that area which will close over a relatively short period that the tempo of industrialization in those areas will have to be stepped up, and I personally believe that apart from the efforts of private enterprise, the sympathy and full support of the Government is essential if the prosperity of those towns is to be maintained.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not believe that that is necessary, but the hon. Minister will not deny that there are cases of industries that wish to come to these towns but who have been encouraged by official circles to go rather to other areas. The policy of the Government some ten years ago in respect of the provision of Native areas, has, I am very glad to say, undergone a change, because that policy was such that if it had been continued it would have led to a chaotic situation on the Witwatersrand. Fortunately there has been some change, but even at this stage I believe that while it is necessary to diversify industry, to spread industry, and while I do not raise the slightest objection to the building up of new industrial areas, I believe that always the Government should keep in the forefront of its thoughts the idea of maintaining the prosperity of those areas which are prosperous. Sir, I would say this in respect of many areas on the Witwatersrand that without this what is called a boom which has come on us during the past year, the situation would have been difficult. But the situation quite clearly is this that an enormous responsibility rests upon the Government in respect of this matter, and I believe that if that responsibility is discharged the prosperity of those areas can be maintained and that it need not hamper the development of other industrial areas in other parts of the country. It would only assist in the more rapid development of South Africa as a whole. That, Sir, is my plea. Other matters in this connection, I feel, we will have to leave over until we come to the Budget debate, but I hope that on that occasion it will be possible to go into very much more detail in respect of the matters on which I have just touched this afternoon.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members will realize that it is quite impossible for me to reply in 30 minutes to all the questions that have been put to me by hon. members in respect of my Departments. But I do undertake if I cannot do so now, to do my very best to give personal replies to the hon. members concerned. I want to give the assurance to the hon. member who has just sat down that we as a Government view the matter just as seriously as he does, that we realize the danger of losing our gold and of the social effect upon communities if the mines there die out. During the discussion on my Vote last year I gave the assurance that we would give our earnest attention to the matter and I said that the Government had already decided to assist the marginal mines by giving them a subsidy in respect of their water problem. In the past we have had consultations with the Chamber of Mines in this connection. But to return to the general debate of these two days, I want to express the view that we have listened to a debate that will probably always have a historical importance in the life of this Government. We have listened to speeches by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and others which will probably always be remembered in the annals of this Parliament. For the first time in all the years that I have been a Member of this Parliament I have been able to listen to a speech by a front-bencher of the United Party in which he openly admitted to the world that things were going well with the economy of South Africa. After everything that we had heard in the past about the weakness and the deterioration in our economy and the sombre predictions about the dark times lying ahead of us, this has been a refreshing change and, as the poet has it, it is almost a new spring. The Opposition have now admitted that things are going well with our economy but they have not been able to do anything else. The prosperity in the country lies about them for all to see, and everyone knows it. Yes, so strong is the stream of prosperity that even the United Party have had to admit it, even though they have done so unwillingly. And not only have they admitted that things are going well with us to-day. Even the hon. member for Constantia had to admit that the signs were there that this prosperity would continue. As though they now realize that they have gone too far, they stand still and warn the Government about the dangers that may spring from this prosperity. Previously they always spoke about the stagnation of our economy and warned us about the dangers that might arise from that weakness. Now we find the strange position to-day that they are telling us about the dangers that may arise from this prosperity. I am reminded of the words of Shakespeare&#x2014;that we find ourselves to-day amidst the &#x201C;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune&#x201D;. Previously they tried to advise us in regard to the way in which we should handle our economic stagnation; now they advise us how to handle our economic prosperity. They have also made the childish allegation that the economic growth in the country is not due to this Government and that if they had been in power this country would have been even more prosperous. When people ask them to what the great revival in the country to-day is to be ascribed to, we find the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) making childish allegations that it is due to <span class="col_907-908" refersTo="page_0468"/>the riches that have been collected in this country and which are manifested in this revival. I wonder where those riches have come from if they have not been produced over the past 15 years under the policy of this Government? They said that if another Government with an ideology like that of the United Party had been in power, things would have been better in this country. Do they contend that the boycotts and the sanctions with which we are threatened would not have existed under their Government? If they do contend this, I want to remind them that the first boycotts against South Africa were started in the last years of the Government of Genera] Smuts by India and Pakistan, countries which boycotted South Africa because of the colour policy of the then United Party Government. Do hon. members opposite not know that these boycotts and threats of sanctions spring from the fact that certain nations want to compel us to give up our policy of discrimination or differentiation on the grounds of race and colour? I want to ask this question: Is the United Party prepared to do away with that discrimination in such a way and to such an extent that it will satisfy those nations? I contend that if they follow the policy which they maintain they are following to-day and if they act in accordance with that policy if they come into power, that pressure will also be exerted upon them and they will also be threatened with boycotts and sanctions as long as they still cling to that policy of discrimination. That pressure will never stop until all discrimination in South Africa has disappeared and we have full equality as the policy of the country. I want to contend that under a United Party Government that pressure will be far greater than it is now under the National Party and that if the nations of the world that demand these things from us discover that there is a Government here which is prepared to give way under pressure, as will be the case with the United Party, that pressure will become even stronger. The more pressure is applied to them, the more they will give way, and the more they give way the more pressure will be applied, until eventually they will not be able to give way any further.</p>

<p>I want to add here that under a Government such as that following a policy of that nature investors and entrepreneurs will hesitate to invest in this country because something which is essential to promote confidence and economic growth will then be lacking; political stability and continuity of policy will then be lacking. Over the past-decade we have seen how the United Party has changed its colour policy from time to time. What will be the position if it is in power and it is exposed to the pressure of the Afro-Asian countries? It will change its policy from day to day. Businessmen will not know to-day what the policy will be to-morrow. The political stability and continuity of policy which is so characteristic of this Government will then be lacking. I also want to ask whether by giving way more and more as they are always demanding of us here, for the sake of our economy, the United Party Government will not eventually reach the stage where they will do away with differentiation in our country completely. This will lead to the destruction of the political authority of the White man and of our economy, and who then will invest in such a country? They speak so often of the disadvantages of apartheid for our economy, but who will risk investing in a country which runs the risk of losing its White leadership? That is why we have already noticed that people are withdrawing their investments from other Africa states or refusing to invest their money in those states unless their governments guarantee those investments for political reasons. That is why we hear to-day of people who say that they are not actually in favour of apartheid in South Africa but that if apartheid is not followed they will not invest their money here. The policy of the United Party may not as yet be one man, one vote but there can be no doubt that it will eventually lead to this.</p>

<p>As far as our internal problems are concerned have the Opposition ever considered what the effect of their economic, social and political policy will be on our own people? They so often express their opposition to work reservation and to influx control and other measures that we apply. Have the Opposition ever asked themselves how our workers, our White workers, will react if their social and political policy is put into practice in our society? Have they ever considered the dissatisfaction and the social unrest and the disorganization that may arise as it arose in the past under their policy? I believe that the social unrest that their policy will bring with it holds greater disadvantages for our economy than is the case to-day under our policy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say in this connection that even if we admit that the policy of the United Party may possibly hold certain advantages for the economy of our country, these advantages will only be of a temporary nature. The abolition of work reservation, the unimpeded influx of Bantu to the cities may temporarily line the pockets of certain people but in the long run they will lead to the undermining of the authority of the White man and the undermining of the authority of the country.</p>

<p>But now the Opposition say that the economic revival in the country has only been of recent duration&#x2014;&#x201C;a sudden upsurge&#x201D;. They try to make us believe that the progress in the country is only visible now and has not taken place over the past 15 years. No, the past 15 years period of National Party Government has to their minds been a period of economic stagnation. I contend&#x2014;and hon. members opposite cannot deny it&#x2014;that the past 15 years of Nationalist Government have been some of the most prosperous that South Africa has ever experienced in the economic sphere, compared <span class="col_909-910" refersTo="page_0469"/>with any other comparable period in our history and compared with any other comparable country in the world. Is it not important to hon. members to know that during this period the national income of South Africa has trebled? Is this not something that is of some importance to them? Is it not of importance for them to know that during the period of National Party Government the national income of the country has risen on the average by 8.1 per cent per annum which is more than the case of Canada, New Zealand, Britain, the United States of America and Belgium? It is true that certain European countries have shown a higher rate of growth, but the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) proved to us yesterday that the circumstances are not comparable because those countries in Europe started on a different basis. They were old industrial countries and started with an experience and a knowledge and a manpower that we did not have. Have hon. members not considered that we have not been able to develop as quickly as those countries have been able to because we have not received foreign assistance in the form of Marshall Aid and so forth, and that our growth has had to come from our own resources? Have they considered that those countries had to grow more swiftly because they were mainly industrial countries while we were chiefly a country producing primary products; that the prices of industrial goods rise more swiftly than those of primary goods and that the rate of exchange has always been against us? Have they considered&#x2014;a fact which we have so often had to mention in this House&#x2014;that we are primarily a gold-producing country the dollar price of which has remained static for more than 30 years? Do hon. members know that the formation of capital in our country rose by 105 per cent and that South Africa is in the fortunate position that where previously she was dependent for most of her growth upon foreign capital, she is able today to raise all her own capital herself? Do hon. members not know that our industrial production has trebled during the period of National Party Government? And this is excluding our motor spares, an industry which is growing by leaps and bounds. Do they not know of the large variety of industries that we have and of the numbers of new ideas to which up to the present we had given no thought but which we are now exploiting in such a way that South Africa is now becoming industrially self-supporting? Do they not know of the tremendous increase in building construction over the past 15 years, to such an extent that cities like Johannesburg and Pretoria have become practically new cities? Are they not aware of the multitude of services which this Government has provided in the form of power and water, housing and transport, telecommunications and education? It is this infra-structure on which the Government has spent millions that has made our industrial growth possible. Do hon. members not know of the tremendous growth in our transport network, the increase in our exports of 46 per cent over this period and the fact that our industrial production has increased to such an extent that to-day it makes up almost 50 per cent of our exports? Do hon. members not know that steel production has risen from 700,000 tons in 1948 to 2,500,000 tons and that the electricity generated has risen from 9,500,000 kilowatt-hours to 26,000,000 under our Government? Do hon. members not know&#x2014;to mention only one significant factor&#x2014;that the unfavourable balance on current account&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;amounted to R341,000,000 in 1948 and that in 1962 we had a favourable balance of R307,000,000, a difference of R648,000,000? Is this progress or do hon. members not want to understand it?</p>

<p>In the time left to me I want to give a brief outline of what I believe the future holds for us. I think that it would be a good thing on this occasion to try to obtain a glimpse into the future and find out what awaits us. I know that the future is always uncertain but I also believe that if there are no unforeseen unfavourable trends for South Africa in international politics, the present growth will continue into 1964&#x2014;no, longer; that in 1964 it will develop a stronger driving force and will continue for a longer period. I base my feeling that we are going to have a further upward trend for a considerable time upon the encouraging signs in international economic conditions as well as favourable internal factors that will have a stimulating effect upon the economy of our country. I believe that we are going to progress even further, in the first place because of the great plans for expansion of the Government and of private enterprise that have already been started and are to be started shortly and which will strengthen our economy. I think of the influence of the large State corporations which will over the next decade spend thousands of millions of rand. This will create purchasing power and have a beneficial effect upon other industries. I think of the tremendous plans that are getting under way in the private sector in connection with the steel and chemical industries, the textile industry and the engineering industry, and particularly in connection with the motor industry, all undertakings that were started by this Government. I should like to give the hon. member of Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) some information in this connection. In the second place I want to deal with our expectations in regard to the influence of the Government&#x2019;s short-term financial policy which is deliberately aimed at promoting expansion. I think that in the third place one of the factors in our future growth will be the relatively liquid position in our banking and financial institutions which will ensure the availability of adequate capital for expansion purposes. Capital should cause us no problems in our plans for expansion. I think of our favourable position in connection with our balance of payments on current account which gives us room for further increases in imports or even a falling-off in our exports, or both. I <span class="col_911-912" refersTo="page_0470"/>think fifthly of the high level of our gold and foreign reserves which gives the Government an adequate margin to enable it to combat both a setback in regard to our balance of payments&#x2019; position or a drop in liquidity. We know that the swift development awaiting us will impose a greater strain upon our balance of payments&#x2019; and foreign exchange position but we also know that our foreign exchange reserves are to-day in such a strong position that this will not form a bottleneck in regard to our further development.</p>

<p>I base my belief in the sixth place on the upward trends in the production of gold and other minerals. We anticipate that for the next few years our income from gold will continue to rise, as it will in regard to other minerals too, and that this will be a contributory factor towards our growth. In the seventh place I base my expectations upon the present activity in the building industry which may even increase in the future. Hon. members know the influence that the building industry has on the economy of a country. In conclusion, I base this profession of my faith in the future growth of our economy upon the general optimism that is revealed amongst our own people and the confidence of our own and foreign businessmen in the economic and political future of our country. These and other factors support my belief that the period of growth that we are now experiencing will not only be of temporary duration but that it will continue for some time yet.</p>

<p>One of the questions put to me and to the hon. the Minister of Finance was: What about inflation and price rises? My reply to this is that we must expect price increases. We have had price increases over the past years, even when there has been no inflation. No Government has ever been able to stop it, not even the United Party Government. There were tremendous price increases during its period of office. That is the price that we have to pay for prosperity. It is a problem that is experienced in many countries to-day&#x2014;to equate prosperity with price stability. Hon. members need only study the literature as economics in Europe to-day. The economic problem in Europe is to equate a rise in prices with economic growth. But in South Africa we do not have inflation as yet. I think that we should say less about inflation. The Government has to consider all these matters and take the necessary action but we can talk ourselves into inflation just as we can into a depression. I do not know whether the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) said anything in this regard but inflation is psychological, to a large extent, just like a recession. Once we start talking about inflation, we will promote it. I want to point out that prices in South Africa compare favourably with those in comparable countries, that the relative rise in prices in South Africa compares favourably with other comparable countries and that the price level of our goods also compares favourably, as does the purchasing powers of our money. I challenge those hon. members who shake their heads in that way to deny that the cost of living in South Africa is far lower than that in any other comparable country. Not only have prices risen but wages have also risen over the past years. Wages and salaries have risen more swiftly than prices have with the result that the real capital income of our people has increased considerably over the past years. If we take a given quantity of services and goods and the number of man-hours that are required to produce those services and goods in South Africa, we find that the number of man-hours required in South Africa to produce given quantities of service and goods is far less than is the case in practically all other comparable countries.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>When the hon. the Minister stood up to reply, he prefaced his remarks by saying that he was going to reply to the various points made by hon. members on this side of the House. But instead of replying to us we found that he delivered a political speech which one would have expected him to deliver on the platteland, and certainly not on an occasion such as this. During the course of his speech the hon. the Minister said that the policy of the United Party was a policy of &#x201C;yielding&#x201D; and &#x201C;yielding every time&#x201D;. Sir, if we can accuse the Government of anything, then it is that its policy is to yield. What is the Bantustan policy other than a policy of yielding to outside pressure? That is the very point that was conceded by the hon. the Prime Minister when he said that Bantustans only came about as a result of outside pressure. There we have a typical example of &#x201C;yielding&#x201D;. Sir, if you want further evidence of a policy of yielding, it is to be found in this 650-page report on South West Africa. Is this not the result of the Government&#x2019;s yielding to outside pressure, and to world influences? Was it ever the Government&#x2019;s policy to cut up South West Africa into ten independent states? Here is the Government&#x2019;s monument to its policy of yielding! The hon. the Minister talks about our policy leading to &#x201C;one-man one-vote&#x201D;. I do not believe that the hon. the Minister is politically sincere when he says that. He knows that that is not so.</p>

<p>I withdraw it. I think he is politically incorrect in making that statement, but where he is correct, is in saying that that is the policy of his party. They have introduced the policy of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; in this country! They have introduced that policy <span class="col_913-914" refersTo="page_0471"/>in the Transkei! How long are you going to stop that from spreading elsewhere? May I also remind hon. members opposite of a fact which is little known, outside this Parliament&#x2014;and when it does become known it will certainly have political ramifications of a serious nature&#x2014;and that is the fact, that the Xhosa women to-day have the vote. Yet hon. members on the other side come along and tell us that we stand for a policy of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. I do not think the hon. the Minister was on safe ground when he attacked us on these lines. I think it was a case of running away from the faults of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>The Minister referred to the fact that there is a large amount of capital available in this country to-day, and that we can depend on our own local resources. That is so, but what he forgot to tell the House is the reason why that money is lying idle in this country to-day. That money is lying idle because the hon. the Minister and his Government have imprisoned capital in this country. They have not allowed capital to leave this country.</p>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>If there is any confidence in this country, let me remind the Minister that that confidence comes about only as a result of the fact that the outside world knows that we have a strong Opposition in this country, an Opposition that is not afraid to express its views, an Opposition that is prepared to face the realities of the political situation in this country, an Opposition which has the courage of its convictions to speak up. That is what has given the outside world confidence in this country. If you want to destroy this party by advancing the type of argument which the Minister has now resorted to, then I say that you are using one of the means of destroying confidence in this country in the outside world. Sir, what is another factor which is responsible for the capital which is available in this country to-day? Let me remind the hon. the Minister that it is not because of this Government that capital is available here to-day in such large quantities; that state of affairs is due to outside factors, factors such as the possibility of a Labour Party victory in Britain and the fact that this country is regarded as the last bastion of capitalism in this part of the Continent. That is why money is available here to-day; it is not because of the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister assured us that he was giving consideration to one of the points raised by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker)&#x2014;that is, the question of the marginal mines. But he left it at that, and said nothing more. Sir he has been &#x201C;studying&#x201D; the position of the marginal mines since 1957! In 1958 the then Minister of Mines said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It appears that there is nothing much that can be done to prolong the lives of marginal mines materially. The Central Government is unable to do much in this direction.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister repeated that at a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Brakpan. That is typical of the Government&#x2019;s approach to this whole problem all along the line&#x2014;procrastination. They are not prepared to face the issue; they are not prepared to try to find a realistic answer to the urgent problem of the marginal mines of the Witwatersrand. The only point that the hon. the Minister made in reply to the hon. member for Germiston (District) was that something was being done about the pumping of water from the mines. I accuse the hon. the Minister and his Government of doing too little and too late in that regard. In 1957 the Round-Table Conference suggested that that was one of the means which should be employed to assist the mines. The Minister waited until last year, and now we have to hear from him that the Government has not got enough money to give effect to that particular recommendation in a way which will be most beneficial to the marginal mines. At a time when this Government is planning to spend approximately R650,000,000 on various schemes in this country, such as the Orange River scheme, the Bantustan scheme, the South West Africa scheme, we are told that the Government cannot find money to assist the marginal mines on the Witwatersrand in connection with the pumping of water. We on this side have suggested different ways and means that can be used in order to give this vital assistance to the Witwatersrand&#x2014;to give it now, not when it is too late in five or seven years&#x2019; time, because every year that you allow to pass you are leaving R15,000,000 worth of imprisoned gold ore underground, which is workable provided working costs can be reduced for the mines&#x2014;R15,000,000 every year, and yet this Government procrastinates and refuses to get on with the job of assisting roughly 650,000 people who are dependent on the mines for their livelihood and who are resident on the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>Sir, last year the hon. the Minister of Railways imposed a surcharge of 10 per cent on all railway goods. During the recess we found that he rebated that 10 per cent surcharge in the case of certain farming commodities. We submitted during the course of the debate last year, that that railway surcharge should not be imposed against the marginal mines as this would push up their cost of production. The Minister saw fit to do away with the 10 per cent surcharge in the case of certain agricultural commodities&#x2014;and I am not suggesting that the farmers are not entitled to it&#x2014;but I do say that this surcharge should not have been imposed against the marginal mines. That would have been a practical measure to cut down the production costs of the Witwatersrand mines. Sir, the hon. the Minister says that he cannot consider the payment of <span class="col_915-916" refersTo="page_0472"/>some sort of subsidy to the mines. I would ask him this: How is it possible for a small country like Southern Rhodesia to subsidize their marginal mines? How is it possible for a country like Canada, which is not so dependent on gold mining as this country is, to subsidize its mines? No, if the Government were not afraid of the fact that they may be accused of helping a so-called &#x201C;capitalist&#x201D; industry, they would do something to assist these mines. When the true facts of this procrastination becomes known to the people of the Witwatersrand, I say that they will give the Government their answer in no uncertain way. I ask the hon. the Minister: Why did he not reply in this House to a statement made by Dr. du Toit Viljoen, the chairman of the Board of Trade and Industries, on 22 August last year when Dr. Viljoen said that it was urgently necessary to find ways and means of absorbing 130,000 men per year in industry as a result of the closing of the marginal mines? Sir, where is the Government&#x2019;s programme; where is their blueprint to provide for contingencies of this kind? Do not give us a blueprint of your policy of fragmentation of this country. Give us a blueprint of what you are going to do to assist the marginal mines.</p>

<p>I am quoting from, I believe, &#x201C;Commerical Opinion&#x201D;, the journal of commerce and industry. Dr. Viljoen also went on to say that that will be the position for the next five years. I see the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) talking to the Minister. He is most probably reminding the Minister that Dr. Viljoen said that at a meeting at Krugersdorp. Sir, the hon. the Minister tells us that he has not got enough money to make provision for the pumping of water out of the mines, let alone the 101 other things that these marginal mines need. May I remind him what the position is with regard to taxation and here I hope the Minister of Finance will come to the rescue of the Minister of Mines. In 1962 12 mines in all operated at a loss on the Witwatersrand. They operated at a loss of R664,000. They produced gold, however, worth R42,125,000 and at the height of their productivity they brought into the coffers of the Treasury approximately R17,000,000 in taxation. This whole position is going to get considerably worse after 1970. The Minister can sit back now with some degree of satisfaction, Sir, for let me remind you that whereas in 1962 42 per cent of the total revenue of the gold mines went into the coffers of the Treasury, by 1970 60 per cent of that revenue will be going into the coffers of the Treasury. Ways and means will therefore have to be found after that date to assist those additional mines which will then be on the decline. Let me also remind the Minister that one mine like Western Holdings is to-day paying more taxation than the whole of the farming community of South Africa! Surely this matter deserves immediate attention. We feel that this procrastination on the part of the Government must stop; there must be some prompt and positive action and some indication must be given to the people of the Witwatersrand that the Government is concerned about their position. Sir, if the Minister of Mines stands condemned because of a lack of positive approach towards the question of the marginal mines, I am sure that the people of the Witwatersrand feel that he stands still more condemned because of the attitude he adopted with regard to the pneumoconiosis legislation. If ever there was justification for calling upon a Government to resign as a result of bad legislation which affects the working conditions and the livelihood of approximately 200,000 people on the Witwatersrand&#x2014;50,000 miners and their families&#x2014;then it is this Government. This Government would have had to resign but for the strong hold that its ideological policy has on the minds of the people of this country. Three years ago, the hon. the Minister bulldozed through this House a piece of legislation which he said was &#x201C;an agreed measure&#x201D;. We pleaded with him not to go ahead with the Pneumoconiosis Act, but to give the workers in the mining industry and everybody concerned, an opportunity to study this piece of legislation and its implications. However we were not given that opportunity, and to-day you have on the Statute Book legislation which is not acceptable to the mineworkers; it is not acceptable to the mining industry and it is bad legislation, as the hon. the Minister well knows. He knows full well that it is bad legislation, because within three months after the passing of that legislation he was forced to send a mission overseas to undertake research in connection with that legislation which he had bulldozed through this House.</p>

<p>I want to start by raising a matter that is very prominent to-day in the minds not only of people in my constituency but also in the minds of everyone in the Cape and that is the question of adequate funds to place the road-building programme in the Cape on an equal footing with that in the other provinces.</p>

<p>The roads are bad.</p>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, every day we hear that our roads are bad, and unfortunately that is the truth. I think that we have now reached the stage when we can no longer tolerate the accusation that our roads are bad. I shall do my best to make a contribution to this debate, a contribution which will enable the hon. the Minister of Finance to give us a glimpse into the future in this connection when he replies to the debate so that we can find a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>On 7 April last year about 1,000 Vryburg ratepayers had a meeting to discuss divisional council rates. As hon. members know, these rates are only of application in the Cape and nowhere else in the Republic. That meeting took a resolution and I want to say immediately that those people went to great lengths to keep this matter outside the political arena. They appointed a committee and tried to have representatives of both parties on that committee so that there would not be the slightest hint of political influence. The meeting decided to request the authorities to abolish divisional council rates. The resolution stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the fact that we in the Republic still live together on a basis of Union and because all citizens are entitled to the same treatment and taxation, and because only we in the Cape Province have to pay divisional council rates, we urgently request &#x2026;</block>

<p>I have tried to send a memorandum on this matter to every member of the House to make them acquainted with the case because representatives of other provinces do not always know how the divisional council system in the Cape actually operates. The position today is that rates are levied on landowners in the Cape, rates which place a heavy burden upon us. I want to continue by saying that the more the country develops and the more the demands for road-building increase, the heavier this burden becomes. It has already become almost unbearable. I can tell the House that a random test indicated that 160 farmers out of 195 in the district of Mafeking paid more in divisional council rates than by <span class="col_919-920" refersTo="page_0474"/>way of income tax. In other words, a double tax system is being applied here in the Cape. Higher taxes are imposed upon farmers in the northern parts of the Cape, that is to say, the northwest and the Northern Cape, through the medium of divisional council rates than in the form of income tax. I want to ask in all humility that something be done in this connection and I want to give the hon. the Minister the opportunity to explain to us what he can do to rectify this position. The divisional council must not be permitted to increase the rates year after year. Heavier and heavier demands are made upon them each year but they cannot simply continue increasing the rates that have to be paid each year by the landowner. I thought that it might perhaps be a good thing to bring these facts to the attention of hon. members and to try and deal with this matter calmly here this afternoon so that the hon. the Minister will have the opportunity of giving us an assurance in this regard. I can assure him that the land-owners who have to pay these rates as well as the normal income tax are deeply concerned. I know that the hon. the Minister has already taken certain steps in this connection but I leave it to him to explain to us what he has in mind. For the information of hon. members I may say that the rates which the landowner has to pay are not only intended for road-building. In a district like that of Mafeking for instance where there is a small White population and a very large Bantu population, the White taxpayers have to pay not only the expenses incurred in the building of roads through the reserves but also for health services. A tax is also imposed upon the landowner for health services and over the past few years that levy has been more or less as follows: In 1950 the expenditure on roads amounted to R3,920,000; in 1962 it was not R3,000,000 but R10,956,000, an increase of 179 per cent. The expenditure on health services was R366,000 in 1950 but in 1962 this expenditure rose to R2,751,000, an increase of 649 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is necessary to say more about the undesirability of this position. I may perhaps be told that the divisional council system in the Cape is 105 years old. My reply is that something which is 105 years old is too old! Nothing in this country has remained unchanged over the past 105 years and we cannot leave these rates unchanged either. We must see these rates against the background of the times in which we are living. We cannot allow a man of 50 years of age to wear the same jacket which he wore when he was a lad of 14 years of age; it will no longer fit him and I think that the time has come when we should get to grips with and rectify this matter. My colleague sitting here next to me has told us that the Cape is larger than the other three provinces put together. As it happens, the northwest Cape and the northern Cape have derived very little benefit from the national road building programme because the national roads have been built to the large centres. Those parts of the country have therefore had the advantage of the national roads but not those extensive and developing areas of the north-west Cape and the northern Cape on which the future of the country may perhaps depend to such a large extent. Those parts of the country have derived very little benefit from the national road building programme.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to discuss this matter any further. I just want to give this House the assurance that it is not the intention of these people to drag this matter into the political arena. The two parties are very well represented on the committee to which I have referred and I have promised them that if they publicize the matter in a responsible and calm way, we as their Members of Parliament will be only too pleased to give other Members of Parliament the necessary information in order to try and rectify this matter.</p>

<p>I want to raise another point although my time is very limited. I want to mention the question of export maize. In our country today it is generally considered&#x2014;and incorrectly so&#x2014;that the country is suffering a tremendous loss through the export of maize at a certain price which, so it is said, results in that loss. That is wrong; that is not so. In reality maize has become a very important commodity. I want to make a quotation from <i>Organized Agriculture.</i> It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maize has contributed most towards the increase in agricultural production in the Republic over the past year.</block>

<p>It goes on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The total value of agricultural produce has in this way risen to R882,000,000. Maize has contributed most towards this rise. The value of the maize crop was about R13,000,000 more during 1962-3 than during the previous year.</block>

<p>I want to make this point quite clear. The price of maize is fixed on two markets. We have the internal market that we control and the maize for this market is fixed at a certain price. But then we also have the foreign market over which we have no control. The two markets together are responsible for the profits of the farmer. That is why the maize that we export is not sold at a loss. It may appear as a loss on paper but it is not a loss. I want to emphasize this fact (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In accordance with the accounting method of the Board the gross producer price, that is to say, before any contribution to the stabilization fund has been deducted is taken as the purchase price. This causes an unbalanced &#x201C;export shortage&#x201D; but the figure that is eventually arrived at must be seen as an accounting loss and not as an actual loss.</block>

<p><span class="col_921-922" refersTo="page_0475"/>The board emphasizes the fact that the &#x201C;export of maize is still a very great asset to the country&#x201D;. I shall try to illustrate this by way of figures (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The value of the exports of maize and maize products increased from R28,900,000 in 1954 to R77,000,000 in 1962. At the present rate it will possibly exceed R100,000,000 during 1963.</block>

<p>We all realize what this is worth in foreign currency. We must not overlook this fact. Maize is becoming one of the most important exports of South Africa. I want to go so far as to say that we expect the crop to be considerably larger in the future and the revenue derived from that source to be proportionately larger as well. This is a very good thing for our country.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that it is not our opinion that further increases in the export of our surplus maize will have a great effect upon the world market. Fortunately, there is generally a better demand in the world to-day for grain fodder. Because of this we do not think there is any danger that we will not be able to dispose of a larger crop at a reasonable price or that our own sales overseas will depress that market to such an extent that it will eventually become untenable. Mr. Speaker, I mention these things because I also want to pay tribute to what the South African Railways have done in regard to the export of this surplus. But I do want to make it clear that if our export surplus increases to 45,000,000 or 50,000,000 bags, that is to say, a crop of 70,000,000 bags and more in this country, the South African Railways will have to make use of all the facilities at their disposal to transport that crop to the harbours. It is of no avail to leave things too late and that is why I am discussing these matters now. We are erecting a grain elevator in East London for that purpose. All I am saying is that we must not think it impossible that our crop will increase to the stage where we will have to export 45,000,000 or 50,000,000 bags annually. Because I am pressed for time I will leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>There is another point I want to mention and that is that our farmers in the north become very worried when they read reports about the locust plague in the north-west Cape. I really thought that with the effective means that we have at our disposal to-day we would be able to combat very effectively a locust plague which constitutes a danger to the rest of the country. But I become disturbed when I learn that swarms of flying locusts come down in the mountains in areas which are almost beyond the reach of the teams that are trying to destroy them. I really want to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to do everything in his power in this connection. I think that the country should give him all the assistance that he needs to enable us to rid the country of locust infestation which can cause a tremendous amount of damage in the grain areas and the agricultural areas of the country&#x2014;and not only in the agricultural areas, Mr. Speaker. I have already had the experience that a locust attack on a farm has had the result that the livestock that had been brought back to the farm for the night had the next morning to be driven away to fresh grazing because the locusts had eaten everything in sight. I have seen that happen. Accordingly it is not only the maize or wheatlands that suffer. This sort of thing can have such a detrimental effect upon any farmer in this country that he may not be able to withstand the shock financially.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in listening to this debate over the last two days I think, perhaps the speech we have had from the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) is one which is a constructive contribution to the debate. He made certain suggestions and pleas to the Government. I hope to deal shortly with two aspects which I deem of importance. We have heard a lot about the expanding economy of South Africa, of a boom in South Africa, which has been lauded by members on the Government side. But what has to be taken into consideration is the overriding factor of sufficient manpower being available for the expanding economy and to accelerate such expansion. To my mind that is one of the most urgent problems, the inadequacy of manpower. I believe that the hon. Minister of Finance can take steps, by his policy to encourage those persons who have the aptitude and ability to further their studies and their education. A report by the National Institute for Personnel Research, which was included in the C.S.I.R. Report of 1962, brought to light alarming factors in regard to the educational qualifications of the young people in South Africa, and I believe particularly in the higher educational groups, the technical group and the technological group of persons that are required in that expanding economy that South Africa will have to look to its own South Africans to provide that manpower. I believe that the shortage of that type of persons is a universal shortage. Perhaps we have missed the boat in regard to immigration to a certain extent in finding suitable persons to fill these important posts. Therefore I believe that steps must be taken to encourage our young people to further their studies and their educational ability. For instance in the survey carried out by the National Institute for Personnel Research it was disclosed that of the persons that they interviewed only one-quarter of the male Whites had any intention of proceeding beyond Std. VII and one-eighth of the male White population had not proceeded beyond Std. VI. They then come to the conclusion in their survey that the higher level occupations would require between 22 per cent and 25 per cent of the male White population to meet the demand, and they say that serious <span class="col_923-924" refersTo="page_0476"/>shortages can be expected in that particular group. Now I believe that there are a number of persons who have the ability to further their education, but due either to economic difficulties or other difficulties beyond their control are often prevented from doing so. For instance the survey also showed that 25 per cent of the White population between the age of 17 and 20 years, could have attained a standard of education of at least one to three years higher than their present qualifications. I think this indicates the urgency of this particular problem, and how I think the hon. Minister of Finance can assist, is by encouraging persons and large industrial concerns and commercial concerns to be allowed to deduct from their taxable income the amounts which they donate as bursaries and scholarships to those persons who could benefit by furthering their education.</p>

<p>The incentive I believe would be there for these people to make available the necessary finances to assist these persons to attain a higher standard of education, and in making a study of the position as it exists to-day, I find that in terms of our Income-Tax Act only expenditure incurred in the production of income may be allowed as a deduction. However, I understand that as a temporary measure and as a special concession for a limited period, companies not exceeding 1 per cent of their taxable income in respect of donations for the purposes of technological training at a university represents a special concession which may be deducted. Similarly that such organizations and firms will be entitled to deduct such money that is made available for bursaries and donations to assist scholarships where the person is a member of the staff of that organization or is intended to be employed by that organization. However, if the person is not employed by that organization and where it is not the intention that he is a prospective employee no such deduction is permitted in terms of the Income-Tax Act. My plea to the hon. Minister of Finance therefore is to review the position as it exists to-day, taking into account the increasing acute shortage of the higher-level persons required in our manpower to develop our economy, and to try and encourage these persons to make available sums of money to those young persons who have the ability and the aptitude to further their studies. I do hope that the hon. Minister of Finance will give serious consideration to that plea.</p>

<p>The other particular aspects which affect our manpower really concern the hon. Minister of labour, and looking at the other scale, after considering the question of the young people who are coming into the labour market, we find that the position of the older workers is very unsatisfactory. I am now looking at the position of persons over 45 years of age, and in spite of the fact that unemployment figures have declined in recent times, it is an undeniable fact that a large number of those persons who are still unemployed are those in the older-age groups. Some of these persons have been displaced, sometimes due to reorganization of staff and other factors. However, they find it increasingly difficult to obtain employment, and I think that the Department of labour should make an effort to encourage employers to take onto their staff those older workers. I believe that a service can be rendered towards improving the manpower position by utilizing the over-45s who are still in the labour market. The interesting thing is that although prejudice has been built up against the older workers in many quarters, a survey was carried out in the United States of America by their department of labour, and that survey certainly proved that the older worker is just as efficient as a younger worker. The result of their survey dispelled many misapprehensions that persons might have in engaging older workers. For instance this survey found that the older worker was likely to be present at his work more often than the younger worker; absenteeism was at a higher rate amongst the under-45s than the over-45s. It is also stated that sometimes the older worker is less efficient in his work. However, the survey disclosed that in actual fact the over-45 year-old&#x2019;s work was up to standard and in some instances superior to that of the younger workers. Sir, they have taken steps in the United States of America to see that that particular age group, the older worker, is fully utilized in their labour force. They base their propaganda and the steps they have taken to encourage the employment of the older worker on three bases. The one is that the worker should be employed on the basis of his qualifications, regardless of age or sex. The second principle is that the worker who knows his work should be allowed to continue on the job as long as he is able to work. The third is that the older worker should have available to him more special work-finding facilities. That is an aspect which we can study in this country. I believe that the vocational services provided by the Department of labour could be greatly improved upon and extended, and I think that in the extension of such vocational services due regard should be had to the training of the older worker to fit him into the labour market and to use him to the full. The question of dealing with the older worker and finding employment for him, as I mentioned earlier, is a pressing problem in the labour field to-day. However, I should like to mention another aspect which is related to the difficulty of the older worker finding employment. That is related to the amendment that was moved by the Minister of labour in this House in 1962 to the Unemployment Insurance Act. That amending Act came into force at the end of July 1962, and I believe it has caused increasing hardship amongst those persons who have made contributions to the fund and now find that after an initial period of 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits they are no longer entitled to claim any further benefits from that fund unless they have been in employment again for a period of 13 weeks. These hardships, I <span class="col_925-926" refersTo="page_0477"/>think, are reflected by a number of organizations which have complained about the difficulties being experienced by contributors to the fund due to these restrictions, not only by means of letters to their members of Parliament, but also organized trade unions have lodged objections to the implications of the amendment to this Act. I have little reason to doubt that hardship is being experienced by these persons, many of them being the older workers. Those who have made contributions to the fund for ten or 15 years have assisted in the accumulation of large sums of money in that fund and have accumulated to their own credit a certain number of weeks&#x2019; benefits which they would normally be entitled to receive for periods of 26 weeks. I believe their complaint is a justifiable one. The Minister of labour replied to a question on Friday 24 January and said that the fund now stands at nearly R115,000,000 and that in the period from 1 June 1963 to 31 December 1963 a further amount of R7,234,000 had accrued to the fund, the contributions being R4,500,000 and the interest R2,500,000. During the same period the amount of R6,290,000 has been paid out in benefits. So the overall picture is a strengthening of the fund by R1,000,000 over a period of six months. I believe this fact has a bearing on the position and it strengthens my plea to the Minister of labour to review and reconsider the whole matter of the Unemployment Insurance Act. The Trade Union Council of South Africa recently asked the Secretary for labour whether they would reconsider this whole question of the working of the Act, and they recall that the hon. the Minister said at the time the Act was amended that it was amended to stop abuse of the Act by certain unscrupulous persons, but more important than that, it was to stop the drain that was occurring on the Unemployment Fund, and that he would review the position in a year or two. Those were the words used by the Minister of labour. With the present employment position as it is to-day, which is even more favourable than it was during the last six months of 1963, I believe that the fund will continue to gain strength. In view of that fact, the Minister should give his consideration to reviewing the present position. We must realize that these persons who have built up this fund, particularly the older workers, who are genuine work-seekers in many cases, find that due to prejudice and other factors they are unable to find further employment and they are denied the right to claim any further benefits from the fund. I believe that these unemployed older workers are in a very serious position. They are genuine work-seekers and they are unable in many cases to provide for their families or for themselves after having exhausted the initial 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits to which they are entitled. They are then placed in a most difficult position of having no income whatever, despite the fact that those credits stand to their name in that fund. It is all very well for the Minister to suggest that they can obtain assistance from the Department of Social Welfare. Sir, the assistance they can obtain from Social Welfare, unless they are over 60 years of age in the case of women or over 65 in the case of men, which entitles them to the old age pension, is only poor relief, or what is now known as public assistance. Surely it is a disgrace to think that those persons who made contributions to the Fund should now have to rely on poor relief.</p>

<p>Cannot the Minister of Finance do something about that?</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I certainly hope that the Minister of Finance will be able to give us some indication whether he can perhaps approach the Minister of labour or whether he can use his influence to bring about an alleviation of the hardship which is being experienced by these contributors to the Fund. After all, there are large numbers of contributors and the number is increasing. I believe that the number to-day stands at about 875,000. This fund has become a strong fund now and I believe that we have reached the stage where the whole system should be reviewed, because the older worker, particularly the person around 50 years of age, finds himself in a very difficult position. I saw a person only this morning who is in a difficult position, who is 50 years of age, who has dependants, who has been unable to find employment for a period of 18 months and who has only received the 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits from the Fund. That person who has contributed to this Fund over a period of 15 years, finds herself in a very difficult position of having no means of support whatsoever. Another 10 years will elapse before she could possibly qualify for an old-age pension. This person is physically fit and is therefore unable to obtain relief from the Department of Social Welfare by way of a disability grant. Some of these persons who have young families are also being adversely affected. I know that as far as the Durban Child Welfare Society is concerned, they have been placed in an invidious position from time to time, particularly since the amendment of the Act in 1962. They have had to remove children from families because the father has been unable to support the children, and the children are then declared in need of care. I think it is a disgrace that this state of affairs should exist in a country which is supposed to be enjoying a boom. These are the persons who are deriving no benefit whatsoever from this boom. The same applies to those people who have to live on fixed incomes and who continually have to reduce their standard of living. They have no alternative but to do so.</p>

<question by="#oldfield" to="#minister_of_labour">

<num>*IV.</num>

<from>Mr. OLDFIELD</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour:</p>

<p>Whether there is a shortage of artisans in the building industry; and, if so, what steps have been taken or are contemplated to improve the position.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_labour" to="#oldfield">

<from>THE MINISTER OF LABOUR:</from>

<p>Yes, but the problem of meeting the requirements of the industry is not a matter which can be dealt with simply by way of question and answer. A shortage of artisans in any particular industry must be viewed against the background of a number of considerations not least of which is the difficulty of arriving at a proper estimate of the industry&#x2019;s requirements over a given period.</p>

<p>As far as the building industry is concerned. I have already had discussions with the Federation of Building Trade Employers and the federation is pursuing the matter in consultation with the trade unions in order to determine ways and means of alleviating the position. Meanwhile apprenticeship conditions for the industry are in the course of being revised in order to attract more apprentices and the training of more adults under the Training of Artisans Act is receiving attention. Steps are also being taken to intensify the recruiting campaign as far as immigrants are concerned.</p>

<p>What responsibility in regard to medical decisions rests on the Director of the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_mines" to="#radford">

<from>The MINISTER OF MINES:</from>

<p>The functions and responsibilities of the Director of the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau are defined by the Pneumoconiosis Act, 1962 (Act No. 64 of 1962), and in particular by Section 3 (2) which vests the direction and control of all medical examinations under the Act in the Director.</p>

<p>The Director is nominally responsible for all medical decisions of the Bureau which relate to the issue, refusal, withdrawal or restriction of certificates of fitness or special certificates.</p>

<p>No personal responsibility for medical decisions relating to the diagnosis and certification of pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis and the classification of disability for purposes of compensation rests on the Director.

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Finance, upon which an amendment had been moved by Mr. Waterson, adjourned on 6 February, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>When this debate was adjourned yesterday, I was dealing with the question of the Unemployment Insurance Act as amended in 1962. Unfortunately, the Minister of labour and the Deputy Minister of labour were not in the House at the time, and it appears that the Minister of labour has also left the House now. I regret that as I believe that a very strong case has been made out for the revision of the Unemployment Insurance Act, as amended in 1962. Those contributors, particularly the older contributors, who have made substantial contributions to this fund now find that they are unable to claim any further benefits after the initial 26 weeks&#x2019; benefits, and in view of the fact that the Fund has improved over the latter six months of 1963, I think a strong case can be made out for revision. During those six months the amount accruing to the Fund totalled R7,234,000 and the amount that was paid out in benefits during those latter six months of 1963, amounted to R6,290,000. So there has been an excess of income over expenditure of R1,000,000. Also in view of the present employment position, it is likely that this fund will continue to gain in strength during the next six months. In view of the fact that a large number of organized trade unions have also made representations to the hon. Minister on this important matter, I do hope that the Minister will see his way clear to bring about a revision of the amendments which he brought about in 1962. I understand that the Trade Union Council of South Africa has made very strong representations to the Department of labour to review the position on behalf of the 758,000 contributors to the Fund. Similarly the National Union of Distributive Workers have also pointed out to the Minister the unfairness of bringing about restrictions in the benefits of those workers who in time of need require assistance from the Fund to which they have made contributions. I do therefore hope that the hon. Minister of labour will realize the necessity for bringing about a complete revision in our present Unemployment Insurance Act, particularly as it adversely affects many of the contributors who are genuine work-seekers and who now find that they are deprived of obtaining any further benefits from the Fund.</p>

<p>I do not want to follow up what was said by the hon. gentleman in connection with the question which he put to the hon. the Minister but there is an important matter on which I want to say a few words. Each year without fail the Opposition raise the question of what is known in this country as job reservation. They try to blame the Government and at the same time they encourage the hon. the Minister to bring more immigrants to South Africa. The answer is simply that if one wants to be practical and wants to attract people from our countries of origin to come to South Africa one must stop telling the silly story in South Africa that one is opposed to job reservation. The question of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; is already known amongst organized labour as the Oppenheimer policy. The &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; is responsible, under the guidance of the Oppenheimer policy, for the fact that the foreign White workers are afraid, particularly the artisans who come to South Africa, because they do not see their way clear to standing shoulder to shoulder and competing with the Native and non-White in this country on the basis of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;. The sooner the Opposition realize that they are responsible for the fact that South Africa cannot obtain the immigrants she requires from our countries of origin, the better things will be for South Africa. Hon. members know that because of the pressure exerted by the Oppenheimer policy a considerable number of industrialists consistently and on every opportunity make it known that they are opposed to work reservation. By adopting that attitude they are responsible for the fact that we cannot obtain the necessary trained artisans from our countries of origin. And so I want to ask the Opposition to give up that inconsistent attitude and to give up frustrating the efforts being made to obtain for South Africa the White artisans that we need so much. We know how over the past years the White people have been forced out of all the industries where the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; has been applied simply because they have had to compete with the Black man on the basis of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;. The sooner the Opposition stop acting as propagandists of the Oppenheimer policy, the sooner South Africa will be able to obtain well-trained artisans from other parts of the world. But as long as they are in favour of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; I can tell them in advance that they do not want to reserve various trades for the White <span class="col_955-956" refersTo="page_0492"/>man in South Africa but that they want them to be taken over gradually by the non-Whites.</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) will forgive me if I do not take up his arguments. I merely want to say it is no secret that I, as a Coloured Representative in the House of Assembly, where I do not want to express my opinion on job reservation or the rate for the job as far as the Bantu are concerned, have always adopted the attitude that as far as the Coloured people were concerned the rate for the job should be applied to them and that there should not be any job reservation, not in the mines, not on the Railways nor in the Public Service. I think when you have a national group which must of necessity attain full citizenship and which is fast developing in that direction, it is unheard of to place a limitation on them and that you cannot maintain a position where they are not allowed to do certain work which they are able to do while they have had the same training and attained the same degrees. I have in mind, for example, teachers who get a lower salary than their White colleagues.</p>

<p>I have always regarded my duty in this House as a representative of the Coloured voters, not only those of the Outeniqua constituency, but also those in other parts of the country, in a very serious light. Where my assistance has been sought, even in the Transvaal or in the Free State or in Natal, I have always felt that my first duty and my first task was to put up a fight for them in this House and to bring it to the notice of the Government that that national group had to be economically and educationally uplifted. Nobody will deny that great progress is being made in that sphere. There are gratifying signs of progress. We need only think of the tremendous housing programme that has been completed up to date. Where building is done at such a pace it is understandable that as far as the type of house is concerned there is some room for improvement. But the fact remains that thousands of houses are still required. I think the national group which I represent here is fast approaching the stage where they can be placed on the same footing as the Whites. When you think of it, Sir, that the Government is assisting in that, you think of the 58 new schools that have been established from 1 January 1962 to 30 December 1963 and of the 17,000 additional Coloured children that are attending school. I regard it as my duty, however, to bring to the notice of the authorities that a host of very unnecessary and superfluous legislation has been placed on the Statute Book since 1948. I do understand that it was placed there at a time when a few &#x201C;old political scores&#x201D; had to be settled, something that was unfortunately done at the expense of the Coloureds. I do understand that it was placed there at a time when apartheid was the battle cry and when many people in their ignorance thought that that would be the salvation of the White man in South Africa if applied against the Coloureds. I am pleased to be able to say, however&#x2014;I am not going to mention any names&#x2014;that many members on the Government side feel to-day that a stage has been reached where many of those unnecessary and superfluous legislations which cause humiliation and frustration to the Coloureds, can be abolished and I trust I shall live to see the day in this House when many of those laws will disappear.</p>

<p>As a representative of the Coloured people I regard it as my duty to appeal to the Government to reflect on the application of apartheid. There are so many respects in which apartheid measures are unnecessarily applied. I think of the taxi apartheid in Cape Town, for instance. I shall not dwell on that. I do want to say, however, that I have never as yet supported legislation which discriminated against or humiliated those people whom I represent. I have never yet supported any apartheid measure in this House. However, if I want to be consistent and I oppose any form of discrimination in respect of those people whom I represent, I have reached the stage where I must not only oppose that discrimination which is applied by the governing political party, but discrimination in all respects. Over the last five to six years in particular I have been in very close contact with the people I represent here and I have learnt of their problems and their frustrations. When I talk about discrimination on the part of Whites I mean discrimination applied by the White political parties which represent the White voters in this House. That includes the United Party and it includes the Progressive Party, it includes every political party.</p>

<p>During the years before I became a member of this House and since then I have often had the opportunity of sitting in the gallery or here on these benches and to witness how a member of this House who was chosen to come here as a member of a certain party and on the basis of the policy of that party, revolted and walked over to the other party. What was always so tragic to me was to think that a person who had identified himself with a policy, who was elected on the strength of that policy, who sat in this House in support of that policy, revolted for some reason or another and within a day or two could salve his conscience to such an extent that he adopted a directly opposite attitude. When he adopts such a directly opposite attitude it is never done without his immediately casting recriminations and reproaches and insults at his former colleagues with whom he had sat here and with whom he had been chosen on the strength of a definite policy.</p>

<p>I had the experience in 1961 in my constituency, as a member of the United Party, to have been opposed by an official member of the United Party and I decided, in spite of that, to make myself available and to leave it to my voters to decide. I shall not go into the unsavoury history of that except to say that I have documentary proof and that I have the minute book of one of the most prominent <span class="col_957-958" refersTo="page_0493"/>Coloured men in Port Elizabeth who were present at that time at all the consultations and meetings and discussions where he took a careful note. To say the least of it, Sir, things were done in a dishonest, misleading and treacherous manner by a few people. I shall not mention the names. Two are Members of Parliament and one is a Provincial Councillor. As far as I am concerned, when I was returned in 1961, that was something of the past. My duty was to represent the Coloureds in this House and I have been doing so to the best of my ability. In a constituency which stretches for 1,000 miles not one voter has the right to say that I was not at a certain place at one or other time when I was needed there. The Minister and the departmental heads know that when I approach them in connection with a matter, whether it concerns Umzimkulu or Caledon, I had been there personally and knew what was happening there and that they could take my word for what I said. I continued doing my duty and as far as I am concerned that episode is something of the past. I retained my seat in spite of certain members of the United Party who wanted to unseat me. I find, however, that United Party organizers are besmirching and discrediting me in the eyes of my voters in my constituency, as appears from the <i>Kokstad Advertiser</i> of 30 January in which an organizer by the name of van Rooyen wrote a lot of rubbish. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Half of this provincial constituency (that is the North Cape constituency) consists of the present Parliamentary seat held by Mr. Bill Holland, who is now supporting the Nationalists.</block>

<p>I shall leave it to the people who I represent in this House to give judgment on this sort of thing on the evidence of my record as their representative and on the evidence of the attitude I have adopted on their behalf, namely, that they were a national group whose life and hopes and inspirations had become my own. That kind of accusation is made simply for the sake of political gain. All those poor organizers regard themselves as aspirant candidates for my seat and they will be out-manoeuvred just as they were out-manoeuvred at the meeting at Beaufort West held in November when a Provincial Council member was nominated. Those poor chaps will never get it; they will be outmanoeuvred.</p>

<p>Having given this explanation I leave it at that and I shall continue to represent my voters as in the past. In passing I just want to say that if allegations were made in the past that there was corruption and bribery or whatever it was under the old set-up when the Coloureds were on the Common Roll, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows that if there were signs of that in his constituency, I wiped those signs out completely, because I do not believe it promotes the interests of the people concerned. But I predict that if the sort of thing we have had recently in connection with Coloured elections continues you will have corruption and bribery, Sir, on a scale hitherto unknown in the history of South Africa.</p>

<p>When I automatically lost my membership of the United Party in 1961 I continued to represent the interests of the voters. It was no easy task for me to oppose the official candidate and to give up my membership of the party, because I turned 21 in May 1942 and I joined the United Party in March 1943. Since I became a citizen entitled to vote in this country I have never belonged to any party other than the United Party. It is no easy task for me to break old bonds, albeit only technically. My behaviour in this House has been such that, in spite of the evidence I have in connection with what has happened, I did not hurt old friends and former colleagues. I gave them no reason to think that I wanted to do them harm. Naturally, not all of them were concerned in what had happened there.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>After 1961, when I sat in this House as a Coloured Representative without any party connections I came to the conclusion that as long as I represented my Coloured fellow citizens in the country in this House, I would not belong to any political party of which they could not become members. And they cannot become members of the Nationalist Party or of the United Party. During the past years I have worked together in this House with my former colleague, Mr. Tot le Roux, and have learnt to know him to the depth of his soul. Literally and figuratively his seat is vacant in this House at this stage. I knew him before I sat with him in this House, and I knew him as a a full-blooded United Party supporter&#x2014;if I may put it that way, Sir, somebody who was a United Party organizer and a supporter of the United Party at the time when his father was a Provincial Council member and when the late Mr. Jo&#x00EB;l Krieg was Speaker of the House of Assembly. Against that background, which was much firmer than my United Party background, he was willing and able, as a representative of the Coloureds in this House, to adopt a totally objective attitude. I have reconciled myself with that. Nobody will deny that he knew the Coloured people. Both sides of the House testified to that during the motion of condolence. He was praised for that. I adopt the same attitude as the one we have adopted in the past. I shall miss him. His death has been a bitter blow to me. I was the last person, except for members of his family, who saw him alive. He was objective and exerted all his energies in the interests of his voters. As their representative he remained in close contact with them. <span class="col_959-960" refersTo="page_0494"/>I was the last person who spoke to him when he was still fully conscious and, if I may put it that way, he left me a sort of political legacy, also to the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) the following day. When that vacancy occurred towards the middle of August I decided to assist Mr. D. J. Scholtz as candidate in the election. I knew that Mr. Scholtz had formerly been a Nationalist Party member in this House when legislation was passed which I hope with all my soul I shall still see removed from the Statute Book. I knew that. I also know, for example, that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had been party to that legislation and that he had become converted and had ultimately joined the United Party. I am convinced that in his heart of hearts Mr. Scholtz has identified himself with the aims and aspirations of the Coloured people in South Africa and that he is quite honest about it. I stood nothing to gain by supporting him. I came to the conclusion that he was absolutely honest about it. I asked myself who could be of greater assistance to me in this House, and I asked myself that not simply from the point of view of the representative of the Coloureds in the Outeniqua constituency. You have the Coloureds in the Transvaal, in the Free State and in Natal who are not represented here. I regard myself as the representative of that 1,500,000 Coloured fellow citizens of mine who are citizens of this country and who have no other home. I have been reproached by old friends of the United Party and told that I should not have interfered in that election, but I am an independent, and I only did what any party member on this side or on that side of the House does in an election; whether his constituency is concerned or not, he assists if he has the time or if he is instructed to do so. I had no instructions and my motive for doing so was not self-gain; I did so because I was convinced that was the right thing to do. I asked myself, who was the best person to assist me in this House to fight this uphill struggle and to bring it home to the authorities where the rightful place of the Coloured people was in South Africa? It is of no avail my bringing it home anywhere else than here. It is only the Government that can do away with legislation which I do not want on the Statute Book. It is only the Government that can assist me to &#x201C;soft-pedal&#x201D; in the application of apartheid, as Mr. Scholtz said on 20 November 1960 while he was a member of the Nationalist Party and a Member of Parliament. I had to decide who was the best person to assist me to bring home to the authorities that feeling which I have in my heart and soul on behalf of the people whom I represent here; bring it home to the Government on whom we are dependent for everything we want to achieve. I decided that a man who identified himself with the aims, the struggles and the aspirations of the Coloureds, who was not a political enemy of the Government, would be worth more to me than a sour jingo and that was why I decided that the best person who could assist me at this stage in the history of the Coloureds would be Mr. Scholtz, because he had convinced me that he had completely identified himself with the interests of the Coloureds. I just want to quote something, Sir. The basis on which I have always represented my voters in this House is more or less set out in the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is my intention to work for the full implementation of any socio-economic upliftment plan for the Coloureds and, where necessary, to plead for its supplementation and extension. I undertake to insist most strenuously that these plans should be put into operation and completed as quickly as possible in order to afford the Coloured people the opportunity of becoming full-fledged participants in the welfare of South Africa, the land of their birth, by taking their rightful place in the labour field. In this connection I regard it as of the utmost importance that the education of the Coloureds should not in any respect be inferior to that of our White fellow citizens.</block>

<p>That is something which has never been done by any previous Government, but this Government is to-day in the process of doing it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am convinced that employment facilities should continually be expanded for the Coloureds (as, for example, on the Railways, in the Post Office, and in other Civil Services). The wages and salaries of both Coloureds and Whites should, without any differentiation, be in conformity with their ability and their labour achievements. Every person should have the right to do the work for which he has the necessary qualifications and for which he is best suited according to his ability. I regard continued consultation via the correct channels of the utmost importance and I am convinced that along that road it should become possible not to apply the Population Registration Act in so far as it operates to the detriment of the Coloured people and discriminates against them.</block>

<block name="quote">In respect of every unnecessary piece of legislation or every piece of legislation that is becoming redundant (such as that in respect of group areas) which detracts from the feeling of belonging together between White and Coloured, and which is in conflict with the concept of full-fledged citizenship. I shall in a constitutional way insist that the Government repeal or change it.</block>

<p>That is my attitude, Sir, and I just want to know from members of the Government whether what I have just read is their policy? Because this happens to be Mr. Scholtz&#x2019;s election manifesto, and I subscribe to it 100 per cent&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My definite object will be to promote and to stabilize the common loyalty of White and Coloured. It must be shown in a practical way that the nation of South Africa <span class="col_961-962" refersTo="page_0495"/>consists of 5,000,000 (the total of White and Coloured) as stated by Dr. T. E. D&#x00F6;nges in the House of Assembly during the last session.</block>

<p>Mr. Scholtz went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On this basis it is my intention to cooperate with the other Coloured Representatives as far as all matters that can promote the interests of the Coloured are concerned. I want to state it very clearly that the interests of the Coloureds and the future of their children will at all times remain my main objective and aim.</block>

<p>That is the basis on which I have represented my constituents and I think it would be a catastrophe if, at this stage in our history, the Coloured voters were to bind themselves to political organizations of which they can, in any case, not become members, and which cannot do anything for them. Their fate is in the hands of the Government. But what I resent, Sir, is when people act like this towards me; I who have done my duty towards my voters and who have adopted the attitude which I adopted in the Karoo election last year in their interests, in spite of the fact that it was stated that I had received R4,000 from Mr. Scholtz&#x2014;that is an absolute lie, I reject it with the contempt it deserves. Others, again, talk about a new motor-car I received. Even to-day I cannot pay all my debts and the motor-car I am driving is 26 years old. I think I should in all seriousness issue a warning on behalf of the people I represent that we should not at this stage do things that will endanger the developmental process to full-fledged citizenship and which is &#x201C;aided and abetted&#x201D; by this Government. Parallel development is along two roads. The Whites are far ahead and the Coloureds a long way back on their road. What is going to happen when the two run neck to neck? That is what I want. Let us run neck to neck and see what happens. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I know what the policy of the Government is and I disagree with most aspects of it, but as long as you recognize the fact that I am entitled to disagree with them, and give me the right to explain why I disagree and why my constituents cannot accept it, I shall continue to do my duty.</p>

<p>When it comes to an alternative policy in my constituency, and when attempts are made to discredit me, where I have done my duty more conscientiously than any member in this House, by people who themselves have no alternative policy for the Coloureds&#x2014;I do not hold it against the United Party that their policy is not as I have just read because they are a White party which can only come into power on the strength of White votes and they have to formulate their policy in such a way that they do not alienate the White voters&#x2014;then I say: Leave the Coloured man alone. And remember they are no longer the former Coloured &#x201C;party boys&#x201D; and the &#x201C;old guard&#x201D; of 1948. Sixteen years have gone past and a younger generation is on the Voters&#x2019; Roll, a generation which does not in the least share the views of the older people who were still prepared to choose between two evils. [Interjections.] How can I remain silent when I and my constituency are prejudiced in this way by associating me with the Nationalist Party and calling me &#x201C;a Nationalist supporter&#x201D; by people who themselves do not want to give the Coloureds what they want? Take one aspect only. The United Party say it is their policy to restore the Coloureds in the Cape Province to the Common Roll and that a Coloured man will also be able to stand for Parliament when they know that no United Party divisional executive committee will ever nominate a Coloured. But nothing is said about the Coloureds in the Transvaal. Is that not discrimination? They say that the Coloureds in the Transvaal and in the Free State have not as yet reached political maturity and that they will not be able to vote for a Member of Parliament: there they will be able to vote for a Senator. In other words, politically immature people can now vote for a politically immature Senator to represent them in the Senate and that Senator can sit there and form part of the electoral college to elect a State President. When I have dealt with this point I shall not return to it but I shall none the less tell my constituents that that is the sort of thing the United Party organizers are spreading in my constituency.</p>

<p>But I go further. During the no-confidence debate the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) made great play of the fact that the hon. the Minister of Transport had admitted that they discriminated between the Coloureds of Natal and those of the Cape Province. It is a pity that a Minister and the Government can admit such a thing to-day, but I want to know from the hon. member for South Coast whether the United Party does not discriminate against the Coloureds of the Cape and those of the Free State and the Transvaal? No, to-day they are politically too immature to vote for a Member of Parliament but the Bantu of the Transvaal and the Free State can elect eight representatives to this House. The Bantu have reached the necessary political maturity to have representatives here but not the Coloureds. Surely that is nonsense. I say that if the United Party feel that it must follow a policy that will conform with what the Whites are prepared to accept to-day, it is no concern of mine and I shall not interfere, nor am I going to argue with the Whites about it, but just leave me in peace to represent my people here on the basis on which I have done so hitherto and to do my duty towards my constituency.</p>

<p>I said something about job reservation a few moments ago. I think job reservation is a farce as far as the Coloureds are concerned and it should be done away with as soon as possible. We are looking for immigrants and the State is spending thousands of rand in that regard. It is a good way of strengthening <span class="col_963-964" refersTo="page_0496"/>the White population. But has the time not arrived for us to give the necessary training to this source of labour which we have in South Africa so that they will be able to do that work? But then I want to carry it right through. Then I say the oldest form of job reservation which every political party which has ever governed this country has maintained, must also be abolished, namely job reservation on the Railways, in the Public Service and on the mines. In other words, we have a position where job reservation has been maintained on the Railways, the mines and in the Public Service but as soon as the National Party Government came into power and they took it a little further, we said: No, now it is going too far and when we come into power we shall repeal it. I say do away with the whole lot and give the Coloured man with his labour potential which we need so desperately an opportunity of becoming a fully-fledged citizen.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) evidently enjoyed himself very much in the by-election last year, and is enjoying himself still more in the in-fighting with the United Party of which he was formerly a member. Well, I do not want to deprive him of his pleasure, and therefore I will leave him there, in the pleasant mood in which he held his speech.</p>

<p>We are now nearing the end of this Part Appropriation debate, a debate which was remarkable to me, not in the sense that the Opposition put up a very good show, but in the sense that the debate revealed that the Government had made a breakthrough which is of still greater importance than the tremendous economic prosperity we are experiencing at the moment. This breakthrough is that the Opposition now for the first time, albeit very unwillingly, must begin to admit that the Government has been following a wise economic policy all these years and that it has further succeeded in moving the Opposition to loyalty on the economic front, which is definitely no slight achievement.</p>

<p>We have become accustomed over a period of years, particularly from the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), to hearing repeatedly what catastrophes the Government&#x2019;s economic, constitutional and racial policies will cause the country. Now, for a change, we have this year experienced that hon. member having to admit how strong our economy is at present. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) even tried to claim credit for his party for some of the achievements of the Government when he referred to Sasol and said that that was really the baby of the United Party. Sir, I remember the years, not very long ago, when the ex-Minister of the Interior, who was then Minister of Economic Affairs, had to wage a bitter battle in this House in regard to the provision of the necessary capital for the further expansion of Sasol. Therefore one will perhaps not be surprised if in the near future the hon. member for Durban (Point) gets up to congratulate the Government on the wise policy it followed in turning South Africa into a Republic. All that is possible, if one has regard to what has happened in this debate. For the first time the hon. member for Constantia not only admitted that things were going very well in the economic sphere, but he went so far as to say&#x2014;and it was the most wonderful music to my ears&#x2014;that the hon. the Minister of Finance has no problems in regard to providing capital. Where are the years when we repeatedly had to hear, just after we came into power, &#x201C;Do not give them a sporting chance&#x201D;; and shortly after that we heard: &#x201C;The banks will close,&#x201D; and that within a short time we would hear the tread of the marching feet of the unemployed in the streets, and that the foreign investors had no confidence in the Government all of which was aimed at shaking confidence overseas, at a delicate period when this Government had taken over, and well aware that they had a Press which would publish those things abroad. The hon. member for Maitland yesterday blamed hon. members on this side for referring to their disloyal and un-South African actions. But can one do other than blame them for such actions over such a long period of years? I want to go as far as to say to-day that the things they tried to do in order to bring this Government to a fall by means of economic weapons, and in that way to try to take over the Government, constituted a greater danger to South Africa than the boycotts which the Afro-Asian group to-day try to apply against us. But they did not succeed, thanks to the wise policy followed by this side, and thanks to the trump card we held then, and still hold to-day, viz. our great natural resources. But the hon. member for Constantia the other day tried to belittle our economic progress by expressing doubts as to how long this prosperity would last. He says prosperity now exists, but how long will it last under this Government? Now it is interesting to see what the industrialists in the country think. The official organ of the Federated Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the <i>Manufacturer</i>, printed an article in December last year, with reference to the most important news in all the countries of the world during the past year, and it said that the greatest news in South Africa was certainly the tremendous progress we had made in the economic sphere, and particularly in the industrial sphere. Then in regard to the future, the following was said in a leading article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_965-966" refersTo="page_0497"/>And so we come to 1964. In view of the events of the 12 months just past, there is no reason for despondency, and every reason for optimism. Economists declare that the boom which we have tasted in 1963 will continue into 1964 and beyond.</block>

<p>That is what people at the head of our industrial machine think of the future as opposed to what the hon. member for Constantia thinks. The hon. member also alleged that the rate of growth has been too slow under this Government over the past 15 years, and I know that if the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) gets an opportunity to speak&#x2014;I do not know why he always waits until the end, after the Minister of Economic Affairs has spoken &#x2026;</p>

<p>I know that if the hon. member for Jeppes, who is batting twelfth, as the hon. the Minister over here says, were to have an opportunity to speak, he would also complain that the rate of growth has been too slow during the past few years, just like the hon. member for Constantia, who said that under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime that growth would have been much faster. I do not want to go into the matter further as to what the position would have been had we had a United Party Government for the past 15 years. That matter was fully dealt with by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs yesterday. But I want to mention this point. The hon. member for Constantia himself admitted that to-day we have no problems in regard to capital, and as we heard yesterday from the Minister of Economic Affairs, South Africa has now progressed to the stage where we can practically supply our own capital needs. What better proof could we have of the actual growth we have had over the past 15 years than the fact that South Africa, as a young industrial country, already at this stage of its development, has become self-supporting in regard to capital?</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite also said that this prosperity was not due to Government policy, but was due primarily to our natural resources. I am the last one to belittle the value of our natural resources. We are grateful to have them, and we believe that with the assistance of those resources, together with a sound financial policy, we can use those resources to make South Africa a really great country. But much depends on Government policy. If hon. members opposite allege that that, and not Government policy, is the only reason for our prosperity to-day I should like to quote again what an industrial leader in South Africa said. Mr. Dirk Meter, who retired last year as president of the Federated Chamber of Industries, and who certainly is not a supporter of this Government, said the following in his presidential address&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now to comment on our economic outlook or to state our trading progress over the past year, I can merely point out that the real national product doubled its increase over the year ending June 1963 from 3 per cent to 6 per cent, compared with the previous year. This spurt forward, I would like to suggest, is to a very large extent attributed to favourable conditions resulting from confident and inspiring Government policy.</block>

<p>Where could we get a better testimonial to the role this Government has played in the utilization of our natural resources to promote the prosperity of the country? Then Mr. Meter continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Demand generating fiscal measures and a favourable monetary approach, coupled with the investment projects of the State and State-influenced institutions, have contributed to the present healthy state of affairs. In this regard a special tribute must be paid to the Minister of Economic Affairs, very ably assisted by the Board of Trade, in pinpointing areas and projects available for exploitation.</block>

<p>In other words, even the industrialists appreciate and recognize the fact that the handling by this Government of our economic resources enabled us to have this phenomenal growth. I want to say that the prosperity we are experiencing is proof of the skilful handling by the Government of the financial matters of the country, the more so because this achievement came at a time when we had to work with a spade in one hand and a sword in the other. The greatest achievement of the Government is that it was able in such a difficult period to weld the people together and to instil confidence despite the attempts made to undermine it. The investor and the entrepreneur are guided by factors such as the available capital and labour and natural resources, but particularly in recent years the investor has sought safety for his investment. Even if all the capital were available, and even if there were no labour problems, and even if the natural resources were wonderful, if uncertainty existed in regard to the future of the country, as to who would govern the country and as to whether there would be a stable Government, and as to whether one&#x2019;s investment would not be devalued overnight, nobody would be prepared to invest. But the investor and the entrepreneur know that under this Government in South Africa that is not the case, because this Government is able to guarantee safety for the investor both in the economic sphere and the military sphere. It is also significant that the series of economic boycotts applied against us has failed. The <span class="col_967-968" refersTo="page_0498"/>entrepreneur and the investor realize that under the leadership of the present Prime Minister South Africa is following a policy which ensures stability and safety in the political sphere; and he knows that in the present Minister of Finance, as also in previous years under a Nationalist Government, we have a person who acts cautiously and does not gamble with the economic future of the country, and that the investor can invest in safety. They also know that the Government, under the present Minister of Economic Affairs, encourages a spirit of enterprise, and that he does everything to promote the development of South Africa as an industrial country. I am sure there were certain people who were waiting for a change of Government&#x2014;I am referring to certain businessmen&#x2014;and who thought that the United Party would come into power again, and therefore they hesitated to do what they are in fact doing to-day, but now they have come to realize, particularly in the light of the difficult circumstances prevailing in the world, that the policy of this Government ensures safety for them, and therefore they have set to work. The joint effect of all the policies adopted by this Government is that confidence has been engendered and there is a spirit of unity amongst the various population sections of the country, and that a feeling of loyalty has been fostered which now finds its expression in all these vital developments, in order to meet all the challenges in the world. I want to associate this achievement with the philosophy of the National Party, a philosophy of love for what is one&#x2019;s own and its protection to the very utmost, and in addition of not yielding to any pressure exerted to bring us to our knees. That philosophy of the National Party has placed its stamp on the policies of this Government in numerous spheres, but it also gave rise to the confidence and the progress and the real patriotism which we now see developing in this country and which will make us one of the economic strongholds in the Western world.</p>

<p>Finally, in this connection I want to pose this question: In view of the fact that we are criticized in a debate like this for our handling of the economy of the country, is it an insignificant fact, or merely a coincidence, that South Africa&#x2019;s fast economic progress is in precisely the converse ratio to the growth of the Opposition?</p>

<p>As we became an industrial country, certain changes came about. One is that the position which agriculture took in our national production gradually decreased. Now there are some hon. members opposite who also criticize this phenomenon and want to lay it at the door of the Government, and who say that it is wrong. I want to allege that it is a purely natural phenomenon for a young country like South Africa to develop into an industrial country so fast that agriculture loses its relative importance. Sir, I want to put the actual position before you. Whereas in the years 1920 to 1930 agriculture contributed about 20 per cent per annum to the net inland production, and industry only about 12 per cent, the situation has now changed so that agriculture today contributes only about 10 per cent and industry already about 22 per cent, and it is expected that in the next five to ten years industry will still expand enormously. What hon. members opposite forget when they reproach the Government for this phenomenon of the relative decrease in importance of agriculture is the fact that agriculture during the same time also tremendously increased its volume of production and the value of that production, and when hon. members make this reproach they are doing just what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) did the other day when he imputed words to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing which that hon. Minister had never used. The hon. member came along the other day with a whole number of Press cuttings to prove that the Minister had said that he was not in favour of higher prices. The Minister never said it. I have more than sufficient proof that the hon. the Minister said that higher prices alone could not prevent the depopulation of the platteland. But then the hon. member went further and argued as follows: &#x201C;If the Minister says that stable prices and increased prices for the farmer&#x2019;s products are not good for him,&#x201D; does he want to intimate that the farmers should be satisfied with lower prices? And then he argues further in this illogical manner by saying: &#x201C;Then there is only one alternative left, namely that there should be lower prices, and then that is the policy of this Government.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to encourage thrift and stimulate patriotic investment by issuing premium savings bonds.</block>

<p>Sir, in South Africa we are familiar with two classes of Government investment. There is, of course, the long-term loan, from 12 to 20 years; then we have the medium-period loans from seven to 12 years; and we have short term loans. These loans are usually available to and money is invested in them by financial groups, pension funds, trust funds and wealthy individuals. They are not intended for the ordinary, everyday small investor. But we have a second class of investment. Our second class of investment is what we call national savings investments, and we in South Africa are familiar with two of these national savings investments&#x2014;two especially. One is the Post Office savings bank and the other the issue of national savings certificates. Premium savings bonds belong to that second class of investment, an investment for the small investor. As the name implies, savings bonds are investments in loans, and as my motion indicates I am advocating investment in Government loans. Although premium savings bonds belong to this second category of investments they differ from the Post Office savings bank and the national savings certificates investments in this respect: Unlike those two investments, interest on premium savings bonds is not paid directly to individual bondholders, instead a sum of money equivalent to the total amount of interest is paid into a prize fund and that prize fund is distributed to bondholders in a prize draw.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Well, we can discuss that, if that is the hon. member&#x2019;s interpretation; it is not my interpretation. He may regard it in that light. Sir, that is an essential feature of premium savings bonds. Perhaps I can illustrate the manner of the investment by taking an example, and I do so tentatively because hon. members may have other suggestions to make or improvements to put forward or their own original schemes. I would suggest that premium bonds should be issued at the value of R2 for one bond, and that the maximum number that any citizen may hold should be 1,000, so that the maximum amount that any citizen could invest in premium bonds would be R2,000. These bonds would be repayable at par at any time. An investor could have his money back at any time he wished to make application for it. That is the first point. The second question is this: How much should we expect in a series of bonds? I give as an example a paid-up series of bonds and the prize distribution I would recommend. I would suggest that we take a paid-up series of bonds of R10,000,000&#x2014;a total of R10,000,000; that is to say, there will be 5,000,000 bonds in this R10,000,000 series. The interest on that R10,000,000 over a period of 12 months at 5 per cent would be R500,000, and my suggestion is that prize draws should take place four times per annum. If we have R500,000 interest per annum, the quarterly amount available for distribution would be one-quarter of that amount, that is to say, R125,000 at any distribution of prizes. How should these prizes be allocated? I think that is a very important question. Let me give my suggestions. As I said at the beginning I do so tentatively because there may be better suggestions. I want to have one prize of R10,000: I would have five prizes of R5,000. I would have 20 prizes of R1,000, 50 prizes of R500, 200 prizes of R100 and 500 prizes of R50, making a total for distribution of R125,000. Now, how should the names of the prize winners be made known to the public? I would say that no name should appear in any publication, but the numbers of the winning bonds should appear in a <i>Government Gazette</i>. They would, of course, appear in the newspapers because the winning numbers would be news. Then the Government would notify the winning bond holder that he has drawn this prize and ask him how the money should be paid to him. That is a simple explanation of the operation of premium bonds, which the hon. the Minister of Finance knows are used regularly as investments in modern civilized countries. A very important aspect of this premium bond award of prizes is the manner in which the draw is to be carried out. One should try to eliminate as far as possible the human element in any draw. In modern states this draw is carried out by an electronic machine. I am quoting from the one with which I am familiar, the electronic machine which is in use in Great Britain. This electronic machine draws the winning numbers and prints them. In addition to doing <span class="col_971-972" refersTo="page_0500"/>that it is necessary to check the numbers. Some of the numbers on the list may be numbers which have been repaid and are therefore not eligible or there may be numbers which have not been invested long enough. That has to be checked, and there the human element comes in. In Great Britain there is a triple check. That is the only case where the human element comes into the draw.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>In your second draw, are these numbers then excluded?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. member for that question. I was coming to that later. A bond can draw a prize every quarter, as long as it remains there. It cannot draw two prizes in the same draw but it can draw prizes every quarter as long as it remains invested. Sir, this electronic machine in Great Britain is known to the investing public by the name of Ernie which, of course, is a boy&#x2019;s name. It stands for Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment. This machine carries out the draw. I would not say that it would be impossible, but it would, of course, be cumbersome to have numbers put into a drum. I am afraid we could not do that; it would be quite impossible in the ordinary way of making a draw for us to say that we will put all these numbers into a drum. Some of them may not be eligible, but through the electronic machine the correct numbers go into the draw. But the point I want to emphasize is this: that after every draw the investor&#x2019;s capital, his principal, remains there; his savings remain there. For that reason there are many people who say &#x201C;I would like my children to make savings in that way&#x201D;. Some people have in fact done that. I am not prepared to discuss that aspect of it. But the savings remain intact. It is not like an ordinary lottery where you put in your money. You may win a prize or you may lose your money. In this case your capital, your principal, remains there.</p>

<p>Now I want to consider and anticipate possible objections to or criticisms of this scheme. There may be criticism, and there may be criticism from hon. members who have religious scruples. When hon. members have religious scruples I think we should try to meet them. Now, what possible objection can there be to this scheme? There are two which have occurred to me. They are not my objections but possibly they occur to other hon. members. The first is that we do not draw interest on individual bonds, and the second is that prizes are awarded by lot; that we draw for prizes. I should like to deal with both of those and anticipate that kind of criticism. Let us take the first one, the payment of interest. Sir, there is nothing sacrosanct about earning money as interest on a loan. If members have religious scruples they should refer to their Bible. They will know that in the Book of Exodus, in the Book of Leviticus, and again in the Prophet Nehemiah, we are told that in certain circumstances it is unlawful to draw interest, although I will admit that in the Book of Deuteronomy we are told that when lending to a stranger we may draw interest. But generally speaking we are told that it is not according to the law to draw interest. In this connection I want to quote from a very well-known authority, Alexander Cruden&#x2019;s &#x201C;Concordance of the Old and New Testaments&#x201D; and his dictionary of biblical terms. We know that interest is referred to in the Bible by its proper name&#x2014;usury. This is what the Concordance, the dictionary of biblical terms, tells us about usury: &#x201C;By usury is generally understood the gain of anything above the principal, or that which was lent, exacted only in consideration of a loan whether it be in money, corn, wares or the like. It is most commonly taken for an unlawful profit which a person makes of his money or goods.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think that one&#x2019;s scruples about having an investment where there is no interest carries any weight. There is no substance in that. I do not think that can be an objection.</p>

<p>I come now to a second possible objection, that we draw for prizes. Well, casting lots is a very common practice in all civilized countries. Hon. members who are familiar with company legislation will know that we draw for the payment of debentures. It is quite common. Those men who hold debentures which are drawn first are placed in a better position than those holding debentures which are drawn later. Secondly, if we have to think of religious scruples, hon. members must remember that the Israelites on the plains of Moab drew lots for their farms. Casting lots is an old-established historical custom and, of course, it operates the other way as well. The man who is drawn may be a loser. We all remember the case of Jonah who was the loser. But we have another case of casting lots in South Africa. Every year we have a ballot. The young man who is drawn in that ballot has to leave his work, his career, and serve his country in the fighting forces&#x2014;the Army, the Navy or the Air Force&#x2014;for about 12 months in all. But the man who is not drawn may continue in his chosen career. The man who is not drawn is the winner. He can go to university; he can carry on as an apprentice; he can carve out his career. We do that under our law and we do it regularly. Now Sir, I should like to say, that hon. members who feel that there may be something morally wrong about drawing prizes in the manner that I have indicated should bear this in mind: We should look into our hearts and say, &#x201C;If there is anything morally wrong it is a trifle compared with what we have done to the currency of South Africa and what other civilized states have done to their currencies over the last 30 years&#x201D;. We have depreciated our currency, we have robbed the pensioner and we have robbed the man who has his money invested in stock, because of this depreciation. That is a more serious thing than anything I have advocated here to-day. Sir, I <span class="col_973-974" refersTo="page_0501"/>submit that in South Africa to-day there are people who through a sense of frustration are unable to obtain the kind of investment they would like to have. I think this is the kind of investment which they would say would satisfy them. They feel that if they invest their money in the ordinary way there will be depreciation. How much? Possibly 3 per cent per annum. I know of pensioners to-day, old colleagues of mine, who paid for their pensions in golden sovereigns. They are drawing pittances to-day in small pensions on which they cannot live. I do not think we should have any moral or religious scruples in a country which tolerates that state of affairs.</p>

<p>Sir, I think this premium bond scheme is one that is suited to South Africa; it is suited to our people; and it is one which I am sure will benefit the Government. This may not be the ideal time to introduce it. Perhaps I should have said that the Government should investigate the scheme, but I think they cannot possibly go wrong if they immediately say, &#x201C;We are going to go on with the scheme&#x201D;. There are certain difficulties that the Minister&#x2019;s Department will have to consider. We shall have to consider the manner of the draw, and I should think it will take from six to nine months to put this scheme into operation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened with interest to the hon. member&#x2019;s motion and his motivation of it. I must say at the outset that I was rather struck by the fact that the hon. member not only stated his case very briefly but that he did not succeed at all in convincing us of the necessity for the Government to institute the sort of scheme which he has proposed here. I shall come back to this later on but as far as I personally am concerned the question is simply whether such a scheme is necessary at all. According to the information I have it seems to me that this is a scheme which the hon. member is really trying to import from overseas. This scheme to which he referred was introduced in Britain in the middle &#x2019;fifties when the British Government and other authorities were very concerned about the huge sums of money which were being wagered every year by the British nation. It is stated that the amount gambled away in the years 1954-5 was &#x00A3;650,000,000. A method was then sought to obtain more money for the State and it was decided to institute the so-called premium savings bonds. Well, I doubt whether our Government finds itself in such a plight at the present time, and I doubt whether our people have such a particular predilection for gambling away such fantastic sums of money. The hon. the mover has succeeded in couching his motion in very innocent terms. He talks in his motion about the encouragement of thrift and patriotic investment, and in the course of his speech he pointed out that at least the investor does not lose his capital. He might also have added, as some people argue, that capital which sometimes lies idle is used in this way. He calls this a popular method which is used in many civilized countries to-day and he points out that it is not a lottery. He suggests that we ought to have no religious or ethical objections to it. Mr. Speaker, in essence it amounts to this: The State institutes such a scheme and it is practically agreed upon that the State will not pay the interest to which the public is entitled. As the hon. member himself has said, the interest which is really earned on that money is given back to the public by way of lottery prizes. According to this scheme which he has presented here it amounts to this, that the State will in fact give back 4 per cent or 5 per cent to the public by way of lottery prizes, and then the question arises again what the value of such a scheme really is. Is it of any value; are there any benefits to be derived from it? To me it seems that there are really no benefits to be derived from it except that we will be satisfying those people who are very anxious to gamble with their money, as it were; that they will be willing on the one hand to demand no interest in return for the possibility of receiving more interest on their money by way of a lottery prize at some future date. As he stated the case here, it seems to me that such a scheme will not attract a great deal of capital except from people who are anxious to introduce the principle of gambling and who have a predilection for gambling. I have already pointed out that it seems to me that at the present time there is no real necessity for our Government to attract capital in this way.</p>

<p>I want to deal therefore with the objections that I have to the hon. member&#x2019;s motion. The first objection that I want to mention to him is based on educational grounds because I take it that he also considered his motion from an educational point of view. The authorities expect every citizen of the country to do his duty and to improve his position and to create prosperity for himself by faithful Iabour and devotion to his task and service to his country. I ask myself whether it is correct educationally, whether it is wise, whether it is a far-sighted policy for the State to start encouraging its subjects, by the introduction of the principle of lotteries into our whole system of savings, not to try in the first instance to improve their position and to make headway by working hard and living frugally, but to obtain income from a lottery? I feel that in the long run the introduction of that principle is going to harm us much more than it is going to benefit us. In the long run we may perhaps accumulate and mobilize a little money for useful purposes, but in holding out this idea to our young people with the blessing of the authorities we are harming and breaking down the essential and the main basic principle underlying the progress of our nation, a principle which should also be instilled into our youth while they are still at school. Our children are taught at school that they have to learn to work in order to make headway in life and in order <span class="col_975-976" refersTo="page_0502"/>to be able to enjoy the facilities of our society. They are taught that that is the way to earn their money. But if this scheme is introduced they will say to themselves, &#x201C;No, there is another way too and that is to buy these premium savings certificates from the State; we will then have a chance of winning a prize and earning a large amount of interest on a small sum of money&#x201D;. Here we are introducing a principle which is completely wrong educationally and which will prove to be harmful in the long run. To my mind it is no valid argument to say that this is being done in many countries to-day. There are many things which are wrong and which are being done in many countries, even in countries well disposed towards us. The fact that it is being done is no valid reason in my opinion why we should introduce it here. We have already established fine South African traditions in more than one respect. If there is one fine South African tradition that we have established it is the tradition that the State must encourage its people not only to work but also to save a considerable portion of their earnings and to invest their savings in different ways but to invest them in such a way that they will earn a good, fixed interest and thus make their contribution towards building up the country&#x2019;s reserve funds. It seems to me that the hon. member, who is also an educationist, has entirely overlooked this consideration. At first glance it may seem very insignificant but in the long run the principle which is sought to be introduced here is a harmful and wrong principle from the educational point of view and that is my objection to it.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. member what the difference is between what is proposed in the motion and the purchase of shares, where you buy shares yielding a low rate of interest but offering an opportunity of capital appreciation? The hon. member says that we must earn our money and save our money. But hundreds and thousands of people buy shares because they hope to increase their capital in that way. What is the difference?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will admit that there is a material difference. In the one case you make the payment of interest on your capital dependent upon the possibility of winning a lottery prize. In the other case the man who invests in shares is really making a patriotic investment; he believes in the future of his country; he believes in the development potential of his country; he invests in shares, not with the idea of earning interest only but with the idea of developing his country. If I had to recommend a patriotic investment to the hon. member, that is the sort of investment that I would recommend to him. In the long run it will give him a much better return than the interest which the mover of the motion is trying to offer him.</p>

<p>I also have an economic objection to this motion. We already have in this country a whole series of bodies which canalize the nation&#x2019;s savings. The hon. member has referred to the Post Office savings bank and Government loan certificates. I can also include our building societies, our commercial and trust banks. These are all bodies which take up a considerable portion of our people&#x2019;s savings and which put them to use in a wide sphere. I think these bodies are held in very high esteem by our people. It is accepted to-day by our non-White population that their money is safe when they invest it in the Post Office savings bank or when they invest it in Government loan certificates. I think our building societies and our recognized commercial banks in this country are held in very high esteem. Many people are prepared to invest their money with some of these bodies at a comparatively low rate of interest in the knowledge that their money is safe and that they will regularly receive interest on their money. Similarly there are large numbers of trust companies which play a very important role in the development of our national economy and in our whole economic structure and which are doing very good work.</p>

<p>The question which I ask myself is this: If the Government does introduce such a scheme, to what extent will the State draw funds away from those particular bodies in another direction; to what extent will the State come into unfair competition with existing building societies, trust companies and other bodies, because this lottery system will be more attractive to many people simply because there is an element of gambling attached to it. I contend that we run the risk of doing an injustice to those existing bodies which have rendered very good service over many years, which have built up a very good reputation and which have gained the confidence of the public, and that nothing useful will really be achieved by introducing such a scheme. Another question is whether the State will then also enable some of these bodies, which may feel that they are not getting enough of the savings of the public, to issue savings bonds on the same basis? In other words, will they be allowed to distribute lottery prizes instead of paying the normal interest? To my mind, Mr. Speaker, we would be introducing a wrong principle. Viewed from an economic aspect it would also be short-sighted because such a scheme would create no new avenues for our people to earn money. It is simply a clever trick to get hold of money in a popular way&#x2014;if it is going to be popular, and with some people it will no doubt be popular. I say again that in our present economic position there is no necessity for such a scheme. As far as the State is concerned it will mean the introduction of a wrong principle. It will mean State competition with existing financial institutions. We may even find that in this way the State canalizes savings which should have been used more productively in other ways. Let me put it to you this way, Mr. Speaker. If the breadwinner of a certain family is very anxious to qualify for these lottery prizes and he decides to <span class="col_977-978" refersTo="page_0503"/>invest more and more in these premium bonds referred to by the mover, it will mean that he will not be able to give his sons and daughters the training which they need to be able to fulfil their role in the national economy. Or it will mean that whereas people with initiative would otherwise have invested their money in private undertakings, they will not do so if this scheme is introduced. More and more the State would be mobilizing an unnecessary amount of capital in this way, and I say that it would be very short-sighted on our part to allow it. The result would be that there would be many people who would not be trained and equipped to make a worthwhile contribution in the long run to our national economy. In the long run therefore we would lose.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when a nation saves more than it ought to save then private initiative is smothered. Large savings do not necessarily mean prosperity and opportunities of employment for the whole population. As I have already said, our economy at the present time is not such that we need such a scheme. What we need, rather than such a scheme, is healthy private enterprise; what we need is broader, stronger leadership with the necessary technical knowledge, more skilled Iabour and a higher standard of professional skill. From an economic point of view therefore I cannot see how the hon. member&#x2019;s scheme can really make a positive contribution.</p>

<p>I should like to deal now with the religious objections to the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, objections to which he himself referred. I want to conclude by saying that we do in fact have a strong ethical objection to this motion. It will not help the hon. member to quote a few texts from the Bible and to tell us that the Israelites also drew lots for portions of the promised land which they would eventually inherit or that lots were drawn on other occasions to decide some issue or other. The position, Mr. Speaker, is that much reference is made in the Bible to the drawing of lots, but it was resorted to mostly, according to the Bible, in those cases where people looked up for guidance to the Lord, who controls our destinies, and where they lacked discernment. It was resorted to mostly where people had to be assigned particular tasks and where it was not possible for man to say, &#x201C;This man or that man will be the best&#x201D;. As far as the earnings of a nation are concerned the Bible lays down a well-tried principle. I do not propose to quote texts to the hon. member, but that basic principle is that man shall earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. In other words, if man wants to live, if man wants to make a comfortable and honourable living, he must be willing to work. That is the factor which earns money; that is the power which enables civilization to make headway; that is the Dower which man uses to make headway in life and to earn more comforts for himself. Our objection, a very serious ethical objection, to the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal to introduce the lottery principle to enable people to obtain income, is that in principle it is wrong.</p>

<p>It is no use saying that there are lotteries in many countries. Ethically it is a wrong principle. Nothing positive is created, nothing is truly earned, by winning a lottery. It amounts to economic exploitation of the community; it means that people lay their hands on money for which other people really worked and which other people really earned.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that there is one very fine aspect of the scheme and that is that it is not ordinary gambling because the capital of the investor remains safe. Let me tell the hon. member that the capital of the investor is just as safe in the Post Office savings bank; it is just as safe in the building societies; it is just as safe in our Government loan certificates. Moreover, his co-pensioners or excolleagues about whom he is so concerned, are at least assured of a fixed interest when they invest their money with those institutions. They can decide whether they want to invest in the Post Office savings bank or in Government loan certificates or with a building society. They can decide where they can get the best rate of interest and if they invest their money there they ought to be able to live reasonably.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the hon. member timed the introduction of his motion very badly. There is no urgent need for such a scheme in South Africa to-day. I personally feel that with such a scheme the Government would compete on an unfair basis with existing financial institutions. Personally I think that the hon. member, as an educationist, did not consider this matter thoroughly from the educational point of view. From the economic point of view I think his scheme is tantamount to economic exploitation and that it will make no positive contribution to our national economy. In the last instance I am convinced that we would be introducing a principle here which is wrong ethically and it would be even more wrong if the State introduced such a scheme. The Government should rather give a positive lead. We have enormous opportunities in our country; there is enough work to enable everybody who is willing to work hard to make an honourable living. We should rather encourage our people to create a better future for themselves and for the nation as a whole by loyal, hard, honourable labour. I am sorry therefore, Mr. Speaker, that I cannot support the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was most impressed by the obvious sincerity of the hon. member for Piketberg (Mr. Treurnicht) and the way in which he expressed his sentiments and views on this problem. Perhaps, Sir, if all of us lived by the high standards shown by the hon. member in his speech, much of what he said would be correct. But unfortunately we have to take things as we find them. The standard of values, the standard of ideals of the average man is probably a lot lower than that enumerated by the hon. member. Because, Sir, we have in existence already <span class="col_979-980" refersTo="page_0504"/>a number of things which must be objectionable to the hon. member for Piketberg in the light of his speech. For example, from August 1962 to July 1963 R23,516,781 went through the totes of South Africa. That is quite apart from normal backing. I am not objecting to racing, Sir; I do not want to be misunderstood. But these are things that are in existence and these are things that are happening. In terms of the values set up by the hon. member, I do not know whether we should not close down the Stock Exchange, because if ever there was a form of gambling it is the Stock Exchange. Not that I object to the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The prime question the hon. member asked was why should the Government introduce such a scheme and had it any value?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not remember it ever having been introduced in that province, Sir. The first thing we have to analyse is what is the purpose of these premium bonds. And I do not like to call them premium bonds; their proper name is premium saving bonds and it is a very important difference. Now what is the purpose of these premium saving bonds? There are two purposes. One is to produce loan revenue for the State and the second one&#x2014;and the more important one as far as I am concerned&#x2014;is to provide an incentive to the public to invest. What is the position of public investment to-day? The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has dealt with forms of investment in the broad field. But let us take the small man. What are his avenues of investment to-day? He can invest in the Post Office; he can invest in the building societies and similar institutions. Here, if I might just deviate for a moment, I think the fears of the hon. member for Piketberg (Mr. Treurnicht) are a little unfounded when he says this scheme will compete with certain established normal business organizations, because they already have to compete with such things as savings certificates and with the Post Office, etc. There is no change in principle. The small man can invest in these institutions and what does he earn by way of interest? For every rand he invests he is lucky if he earns 3c to 3&#x00BD;c per annum. That is the return he gets on his small investment. It is so infinitesimal that it has no meaning. What is really the position of institutions like the Post Office and the building societies? They are simply used as a depository for the small man&#x2019;s funds. I am not talking about the big investor who invests large amounts of money in these institutions to receive interest. I am talking about the man in the street. His basic reason for putting his money in a building society or the Post Office is simply to have somewhere to put his money. He does not use that institution as an interest-earning medium. Over a period of a year, for example, Sir, you will find that as much money comes out of the Post Office as goes into it. Because all that is happening is that the Post Office and the building societies and similar institutions are being used to run current accounts for ordinary people. In the case of a premium savings bond you have a different situation. Here you have the possibility of a substantial reward instead of 3c per rand per annum, a reward that will mean something to the investor. So he has two incentives: Firstly, to invest, and, secondly, perhaps more important, an incentive to leave his money invested. I mentioned the Post Office a minute ago, Sir, and the figures are interesting. At the end of March 1962 the balance due to depositors in the Post Office was plus/minus R134,000,000. The deposits for the following 12 months were R52,000,000, and the withdrawals over the same period amounted to R55,000,000. You thus have the situation that more money was withdrawn than was put in.</p>

<p>What about national loan certificates?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Does the small man buy national loan certificates? I do not think so. When you analyse these figures, Sir, you will find that of the original balance at the beginning of the year of R134,000,000 plus the deposits of R52,000,000, 33&#x2153; per cent of the total amount held as balances plus the amount deposited for the year was withdrawn during the year. So you see what is happening, Mr. Speaker. Money goes in and money comes out. That reminds me of one of the organizations with which I was associated. We started a savings scheme for the non-White employees. At the beginning of every month they used to put in their money; on the seventh of every month they withdrew it.</p>

<p>In England where premium saving bonds have been in existence since 1956 we are able to make some more interesting comparisons. I quote from Whitaker&#x2019;s of 1964&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Savings Business: Savings Bank Deposits were &#x00A3;529,000,000 and withdrawals were &#x00A3;402,000,000. Saving certificates issued were &#x00A3;104,000,000 and withdrawals or repayments were &#x00A3;92,000,000. Premium savings bonds: Sales were &#x00A3;53,000,000 and repayments &#x00A3;30,000,000.</block>

<p>So you have these comparative figures of investment and withdrawal: 529 to 402 for saving bank deposits; 104 to 92 on saving certificates but 53 to 30 on premium savings bonds. In other words, Sir, the premium savings bonds have a longer life of investment than any other national form of saving which is available to the small man. At the end of June 1963 the total amount invested in premium savings bonds in England was no less than R805,600,000.</p>

<p><span class="col_981-982" refersTo="page_0505"/>What are these bonds, Sir? The hon. member for Kensington has told us. But I think the cardinal principle of the bonds is as follows: Firstly, is you can never lose your money; your money is invested and it is always available to you. Secondly, it is available for return to you at any time you want it. There is no difference between a premium savings bond, as far as the investor is concerned, and any other kind of Government saving which is short term. You put it in when you like, and you take it out when you like. The only thing you hazard is the question of interest. Here is what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in England in 1956 when this matter was introduced&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is not gambling for the subscriber cannot lose. Let me put it in this way. This is an encouragement to the practice of saving and thrift by those members of the community who are not attracted by the reward of interest, but do respond to the incentive of fortune.</block>

<p>That is a fair statement. You are gambling your interest with the incentive of fortune, but to such an infinitesimal amount that it does not really matter. Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My object is to invite the people to save for interest in the Defence Bonds.</block>

<p>We have plenty of media, Sir, for people who want to save for interest, for their 3c per annum on their rand. They can invest in the Post Office. The hon. Minister of Finance will give them as many channels of investment as they like. But here is something for the little man, this is something to encourage him to invest. I was interested as well, Sir, to read what Whitaker says about premium savings bonds because you will notice that the accent is on saving. They say here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the most popular forms of saving in the United Kingdom is through premium savings bonds. These bonds are United Kingdom security, etc. etc. &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now, Sir, basically what does all this mean? The investor invests his money in a bond secured by the Government. He invests his money in the full knowledge that he will not receive interest and that he can get his capital returned at any time he desires. He knows that as long as he holds the bond he has the opportunity of a substantial reward as against a small amount of interest. If he does not get a substantial reward the amount he has hazarded by loss of interest is negligible. These bonds are usually limited to a reasonable ceiling by any individual, perhaps R1,000. I cannot remember what the hon. member for Kensington suggested as a maximum investment.</p>

<p>R2. 000.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Will that be the maximum? In England it is R1,600. It is not available for corporations, it is not available for business houses; it is there for the small man. Mr. Speaker, I think there is no doubt that it will encourage people to save, and people do not save unless there is an incentive. I know the hon. Minister of Finance will tell us that the degree of saving in this country is very high. That is true, but what we want is to encourage the smaller man to save.</p>

<p>Now let us look at it from the Government point of view. The hon. Minister of Finance has told us that there is too much money in circulation. He has taken a certain amount of that money away by over-issuing Treasury bonds and he has transmitted those funds to. England. Here is another excellent opportunity for him to do exactly the same thing, to have investment in premium savings bonds, take the pressure of money from the market, remit those funds to England or anywhere else where the hon. Minister would care to invest those funds and keep them there until such time as we need them. The hon. Minister also told us of course that very soon he may be short of money. Now if he is short of money, here he has the opportunity again of building up the state finances.</p>

<p>I find merit in the scheme from the point of view of the investor, I find merit in the scheme from the point of view of the Government. I find nothing to disturb me on moral grounds in this particular case. In fact, Mr. Sneaker, it is something which is not new to this country. We have had terminal building society deposits for many, many years. A group of smaller building societies allow you to put your money into a building society. They do not pay you any interest, but a draw is made and the lucky drawer is given an interest-free loan for a pre-determined period. If he does not want to take the interest-free loan, that loan can be auctioned, and whatever the price may be that is fetched, it goes to that investor. It is not a new principle, it has happened in this country and it is happening to-day&#x2014;the principle of a group-investment for a little special return. I hope that real consideration will be given to this matter of premium savings bonds because it is a method of investment which can be of benefit to many sections of the community.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DER BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to help the hon. member who has just sat down and I want to refresh his memory. It appears to me that he has deteriorated since he last appeared in this House. On 8 June 1958 a similar motion was moved in the Transvaal Provincial Council by Mr. Ronnie Nestadt, the Provincial Council member for Benoni. After the debate, in which it is true the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) did not participate, he elected of his own free will to have his name recorded with the names of those who voted against that motion. What is more, he was one of only three Opposition members who voted against it and if he cannot remember who those members were I should like to remind him further that <span class="col_983-984" refersTo="page_0506"/>those three names were S. Emdin, Miss McCarthy and Mr. To&#xFB03;e van de Venter, all of whom voted against the motion of Mr. Ronny Nestadt. This was less than six years ago. The hon. member may of course have changed his mind since. Either he did not know what he was voting against at the time or else he does not know what he is asking for to-day. The hon. member for Parktown, just like the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) who introduced this motion, tried to draw a comparison between the wording of this motion which is at the moment under discussion and the purchasing of shares. But there is no comparison. Any person who buys shares studies the shares he is going to buy.</p>

But apart from that fact, the buying of shares is in no way comparable with the wording of this motion that is before the House to-day. The emphasis in this motion is not on &#x201C;saving&#x201D; and the emphasis is not on &#x201C;patriotism&#x201D;. The emphasis in this motion is on gambling. Let us give the child a name.

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether he puts the names of a number of companies into a hat and then draws one at random and says that he is going to buy those shares? Or does he draw lots to find out which shares he wants to buy? Or does he study the share market and then buy the shares in which he has confidence? That is precisely my argument. He has a say in it, in the shares that he buys, and he expects to draw dividends from those shares. Those shares are not bought haphazardly. They either appreciate or they depreciate, one of the two. This principle is not at all the same as that contained in this motion. I want to refer again to the contents of the motion of the hon. member. His motion states: &#x201C;That this House requests the Government to encourage thrift and awaken patriotic investment by the issue of premium savings bonds. &#x201D; The two reasons which the hon. member advanced in support of his motion were very fine-sounding reasons. We were all impressed by them. There is something in promoting a sense of thrift and there is something in patriotism. But when these two reasons are advanced in order to hide the barb of gambling, then the two words lose their meaning, they vanish. That is why these two parts of his motion fall completely flat. They do not hold water. They have been placed there simply to hide the barb of gambling. This is my contention and the hon. member for Kensington knows that that is so. To my mind this is proof positive that he realizes that he is going to meet with opposition and that in principle his motion is wrong.</p>

<p>The hon. member is not opposed to gambling. I say that the meaning of both of these words disappears when we consider the true purpose contained in this sugar-coated pill. Mention has already been made of it, but let us for a moment analyse the question of thrift, the plea that a sense of thrift should be encouraged. There are adequate opportunities for investment if one wants to save and the State also makes these opportunities available. But the virtue of thrift lies in the fact that one does it of one&#x2019;s own accord. In this case the pill has to be slightly sugar coated. We have to be encouraged to save. It is no longer a voluntary saving. There is no compulsion upon a person to save but there is a different motive on the part of the person buying these premium savings bonds; he is driven by a different motive, another motive than simply a desire to save and that motive is to gamble. The motive is the possibility of winning some of that money. That is the whole intention of the motion and that is what it envisages&#x2014;to attract people who are driven not by an inner compulsion to save or a feeling of thrift but an urge to gamble. When we analyse the second motive that the hon. member has given us, that the investment must be patriotic because it will then be an investment with the State, well, we have the Post Office savings bank and if anyone wants to be patriotic he can prove his patriotism by making use of the opportunities that he has to invest his money with the State. He can then go to the Post Office savings bank and he can buy tax-free Government bonds. The opportunities are there and there is therefore no need at all for this motion, at least not the need that the hon. member has mentioned in the written text of his motion&#x2014;not as far as a sense of thrift or patriotism is concerned. Mr. Speaker, each year 10,000&#x2014;this year I think the figure is 16,000&#x2014;ballotees go away for their military training. The law compels them to go. It is my privilege to have a son doing his military training in one of these camps this year. But I have tried to impress upon him that he should not go simply because he has been balloted in terms of a system which we have or because he is compelled to go. I told my son that he should feel that he is going voluntarily because of his love for South Africa. I told him that he should learn <span class="col_985-986" refersTo="page_0507"/>all he can in the military sphere not in order to defend himself but to defend his homeland. This to my mind is the difference between a person who goes there unwillingly, who goes there under duress, and a person who does this sort of thing out of a feeling of patriotism. The same thing holds good in this case in connection with the investment of money in the country that we love, the Republic of South Africa. If one makes use of the facilities that we have for investment in our country, that is a patriotic action, but when one invests one&#x2019;s money in the hope of drawing one of these two large sums of money which the hon. member has mentioned&#x2014;as he sees the position (which does not of necessity have to remain that way if his motion is adopted)&#x2014;then the patriotic motive disappears from his motion and all that then remains of his motion is its primary object&#x2014;gambling. That is the only characteristic that remains.</p>

<p>I am absolutely opposed to this motion and I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister not to accept it. I am convinced that the House will not adopt a motion of this nature because we have no need of it, not now or in the future. Here I also differ from an argument that may be advanced&#x2014;that this is not the time to introduce the motion. If this motion, if gambling, is immoral, then it is immoral now and it will be immoral in the future and it will be immoral at any time.</p>

<p>The hon. member who says &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; is a member of the Afrikaans-speaking community in our country and since I am dealing with the moral grounds on which I base my objection and protest to this whole motion, I want to tell the hon. member that I also stand here as a member of a specific language group, the Afrikaans-speaking language group, and I am not trying to be negative. As I know the history and the development of the Afrikaans speaking people of our country, I can say this afternoon that the Church of the Afrikaans speaking people has had a tremendous influence upon the attitude and outlook on life of the Afrikaner in the years gone by. Hon. members can view this statement of mine in any way they want to. It makes no difference to me. But I do not hesitate for a moment in saying that in the language group and the family from which I come and in the families from which the Afrikaans-speaking people come&#x2014;and in this I do not want to exclude English-speaking people because there are many of them who think as I do&#x2014;the Church has certainly exerted its influence upon the character of the people, upon the thinking of our people and upon the outlook on life of our people. I want to ask the hon. member for Kensington, who has moved this motion, whether he thinks that it is right that the State in particular should take the lead in a gamble which in my view&#x2014;as I have tried to explain here&#x2014;is something that cannot be reconciled with the views of our people as influenced by the Church to which I belong. Does he think that it is right that the State should take the lead in instituting a State lottery or a gamble of any nature? I want to ask the hon. member, if his party were in government and if he were the Prime Minister, whether he would move a motion to the effect that the Government of the Republic of South Africa should take the lead in initiating a means of gambling in our country. I want to put this question to the hon. member because there are people with different senses of value in our country; there are various yardsticks by means of which we can gauge the worth of a nation and of an individual and of a State. I want to say this afternoon that it is not exclusively the material value which gives a nation its strength. When I look at the development pattern of our people, I say that the spiritual values and the spiritual possessions and the spiritual strength of our nation have played a very important role and have been the binding elements in the formation of our nation. The hon. member will get nowhere with this cheap story of his of asking people whether they buy lottery tickets or not. I am sure that from time to time all of us do things that we ought not to do but when we are gathered here as a House of Assembly to make the laws for the country, then I want to ask hon. members opposite whether their consciences will allow them to say that the State should initiate a gambling system in this country simply for the sake of possible financial advantages or for financial reasons? I hold the view that gambling is immoral.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I sympathize with the strong feelings expressed by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg), who evidently feels deeply about the matter, but I hope to convince him that this is not gambling. I am sure that once he sees the logic of the motion, he will appreciate that it will be a good thing. His objection really lies in the fact that he feels that the whole question of gambling is wrong. I also have sympathy with the hon. member for Piketberg (Mr. Treurnicht), who says that by the sweat of your brow must you live. For years I have sweated my brow and did not need to gamble, and I feel that he and I are also in sympathy with one another, but I hope that when I have finished he will also say that this is a good scheme. On the other hand, I do not altogether agree with the mover of the motion, the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore). There are details of the scheme which I do not like.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance to the fact that the State is a dishonest borrower. It borrows funds and is dishonest about it, because it promises to repay a certain value at the end of a certain time, and it does not return that value. The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) drew attention to this point. I am not a financier, but I understand that there is a permanent 2 per cent loss from inflation in the value of our currency right throughout the world. I do not think the Minister need worry about large institutions which can look after themselves, but this is a scheme primarily directed to the little man with small funds who tries to save some of his money and wants to invest what he has earned from the sweat of his brow. One asks whether the State makes it easy for this man to save for his old age? Well, it does not. It cheats him of 2 per cent every year, and this State has failed to realize that fact or, if it does, it has not done anything about it.</p>

<p>Now there are various schemes by which the State could help itself and treat its poor people honestly. For instance, when it raises money it could tie the loan to the cost of living, so that when the debt is repaid the capital and interest have risen with the cost of living and is adjusted every year. Another scheme it could adopt is to tie the loan to the average wage of the country. As the wages rise, so would the value of the loan rise. Another scheme that has been adopted is that when a corporation like Escom borrows money it ties its loan to the price of electricity. The man who lends his money to Escom does not lose the value of the money while Escom makes the profit. This scheme of the hon. member for Kensington is an effort, if it is modified a little, to try to protect the little man. I believe that if a scheme were introduced where bonds of R2 are issued and the capital and the interest are repayable in ten years at 230 cents, it would be possible without gambling to tempt people to go in for it and to let them profit. The scheme adopted in France is roughly that a sinking fund is created once the loan has been floated. So much is put into the sinking fund every year, but instead of investing this money or spending it the State uses each year&#x2019;s sinking fund to redeem so many of the bonds. In other words, a man whose name is drawn in the first year, instead of obtaining his 230 cents in ten years&#x2019; time will draw it in the first year or in the second year or in the third year. In <span class="col_989-990" refersTo="page_0509"/>other words, a chosen few will receive their capital and interest back a little earlier. Obviously there is no question of giving prizes. That can be included, but the prizes are incidental. What is important is that the man receives his money back earlier. His name is drawn by lot and he receives the full capital he would have received in ten years&#x2019; time, and he is at liberty if he so wishes to re-invest it. The loan must be continuous and it should always be available and be on sale at banks and post offices. It should be issued in the form of bearer certificates, with squares marked out showing each six months interest as it falls due, and it should be saleable at every bank or post office with the interest due, or if a man wishes to keep his bond he can cut off the coupons and cash them. But the main thing is that over the years a certain number of people will receive back their capital earlier, until finally the loan is wiped out in ten years&#x2019; time for everybody. In this way no element of gambling can enter into it. Sir, what is gambling? Gambling is gaming. The hon. member for Wolmaransstad will, I am sure, not regard a game as a gamble.</p>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>After listening attentively to hon. members opposite I must say that I have been able to draw only one conclusion and that is that the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has failed completely in the point that he has been trying to make. He tried to prove that this motion had very good intentions. The hon. member pointed out that the idea was to request the Government to encourage thrift and promote patriotic investment. This is probably a very good intention and none of us can have any objection to it, but I want to point out that the method he wants to follow to do this will undermine those virtues. That is why we can never support his motion. What does this motion envisage? It has in mind making money available to the State more cheaply. I must say that after reading the debate that took place in the Transvaal Provincial Council on the same matter, I think that they made out a far stronger case. They pointed out what could be done with that money and how the State could make use of it in the meantime and save a great deal in interest <span class="col_991-992" refersTo="page_0510"/>thereby, and that this was a patriotic action. They went further and pointed out that money would then be available to enable the State to initiate large charitable works and so forth. I want to say that if the mover of the motion wants to promote this object he will have to use arguments that will be more attractive to people than this intellectual approach. We are dealing here with a motion which in our view has nothing in mind but the taking of a first step in the direction of the eventual establishment of a State lottery; because the whole principle that is embodied in this motion is nothing but a form of gambling. A lottery has certain characteristics which make it easily recognizable as such. The first is that the deciding factor is always luck and that ability and aptitude are pushed into the background. It is pure luck that determines who the fortunate person will be. Furthermore, the reason why a person participates in a lottery is because he hopes that he will be the lucky one who will suddenly win a large sum of money. In other words, there is a very selfish motive. Its effect is that it always causes the money of the masses to flow in the direction of a few individuals without those persons having achieved anything, without their having been productive in some way or other. If we consider this particular suggestion in that light, we can say that it amounts to nothing less than a lottery because the same kind of thing will happen in this case. In this case only the individual is enriched. The money of the masses is obtained by the individual without his having been productive or having any achievement to show for it. If this proposal is given effect to, no matter how innocent it may appear, it will open the way to a large-scale lottery and eventually to a State lottery, because the mass of the people do not see any difference between this form of lottery and any other form of it. When one reads the debates of the Provincial Council of the Transvaal on this question one notices that the people who have studied the matter split hairs and argue amongst themselves. The one says that it is a lottery and the other says that it is not, as we have heard here to-day. How will the mass of the people be able to tell the difference? They will say that the State is promoting it and because of this fact they will participate on a large scale in gambling and lotteries.</p>

<p>Various hon. members opposite have said that they have no objection to lotteries. That is exactly where we differ from one another. We condemn this motion and can never vote for it because it promotes gambling and because we are opposed to any form of gambling. If we are asked why we are so opposed to gambling we say in the first place that no good purpose is served by a lottery. We may start rationalizing and saying that more thrift can be encouraged and so forth, but these are only excuses. These things are said in order to try to find a good excuse for the real purpose that lies behind the matter. But even though it were to serve a good purpose, the ethical rule by which we are governed is that the end never justifies the means. That is why we must condemn it, no matter how good the end may be.</p>

<p>We can point out further that no matter who may be benefited, whether it is the State or individuals, the fact remains that the victims in these cases are always greater in number than those who are benefited. The number of victims is so large that this sort of thing can never be justified. I want to tell the House why I hold this view. As far as we as legislators are concerned our one important purpose in regard to all legislation that is passed by this House must be to try to enable the people to live in such a way that they will be able to achieve the fullest measure of self-realization in any sphere. Our purpose must be to cultivate citizens possessing all those virtues of which we are so proud. The mover of the motion has thrift in mind as well as hard work, honesty, helpfulness and all those virtues that we would like to cultivate amongst our citizens. But the spirit that we want to combat and eliminate is the spirit of wastefulness, extravagance, laziness, dishonesty, selfishness, stinginess and so forth which is not to the advantage of the citizen or of the State. I want to say that once we start the type of thing mentioned in the motion we will not be able to avoid the building up of a gambling nation. I want to state that if we investigate the position in all the gambling countries where the gambling spirit holds sway, we will see that there is a very large negative correlation between the scope of the gambling spirit and the productivity of that nation. It has not yet been proved that the one is the result of the other but there is a strong feeling that this is indeed the case. People hope that they will make a large profit easily and the result is that they lose those other virtues of diligence and so forth. When I am asked whether a lottery or gambling, no matter how innocent it may appear, really has such a destructive effect, then I shall say: Let us ask the people who are qualified to pass judgment in this regard. I think of what our Churches have to say. The D. R. Church of the Cape, which is a very influential Church, adopted two resolutions at its Synod in 1949, resolutions that still stand, and this is what the Synod resolved (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Synod expresses its conviction that gambling in all its forms is a sin against our fellow-man and society, and in many cases has a detrimental and destructive effect upon the spiritual, domestic and economic life of the gambler himself. Therefore the Synod requests the Government to apply strictly the existing laws against gambling and lotteries, and, where necessary, to tighten them up.</block>

<p>If we were to adopt a motion such as this we should imagine the effect it would have on the Church. The same Synod resolved further (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_993-994" refersTo="page_0511"/>The Synod is of opinion that betting on horse or other races and competition in which luck plays the decisive role in the obtaining of a prize that is made up of the contributions (usually monetary) of the participators, form part of the essense of gambling; they create in man the dangerous passions of slothfulness, meanness and avarice; they lead to poverty and domestic strife and, in the long run, dethrone God in the life of man and replace Him with the goddess of fortune.</block>

<p>These are strongly worded resolutions adopted by the Church. But let us leave the Church out of the picture and ask what our social workers have to say in this connection&#x2014;the ones who work every day amongst those people who have become the outcasts of society. What is their experience? When we look at the court reports and we see how families are broken up and how many children are committed, we notice what a tremendous role gambling plays in the breaking-up of those families. I ask what the sociologists have to say about this matter. I want to make one small quotation from the &#x201C;Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences&#x201D;. The writer has this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The social harm resulting from excessive participation by the people in lottery play and the principal justification for penal measures against it lie in its threat to economic morals&#x2014;its tendency to accustom the masses to expect improvement in their economic situation through luck rather than through their own labour and ability or through some form of social action.</block>

<p>That is why I say that when we let the experts in these various spheres give us their opinions, the evidence of all of them is highly condemnatory of this sort of thing. That is why we reject this motion and say that anything that can lead to gambling or lotteries must eventually result in dishonesty. Adam Smith contended that no lottery existed that could really be justified on the grounds of honesty. In the British football pools it has been ascertained that the chance of winning is one in 5,000,000 but here we are saying that we will give these people the opportunity to buy those bonds. The poor man about whom so much has been said will not be able to afford more than one costing R2. But the rich man will be able to buy many more than this and he will thus have a far better chance of winning something than the poor man. That is why we say that this is not a protection for the small investor but rather gives the large investor more opportunity to make a profit. For those reasons we say that it will be an evil day for us if we accept or adopt a motion of this nature and that is why we feel that we must reject it.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down adopts the attitude that this whole motion is based on gambling. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) and those who have spoken after him have tried to make it perfectly clear that this is not a motion dealing purely with gambling. What is proposed here is not a lottery in the pure sense of the word. This is an investment where the Government gets the public to make capital available to it, and the only element that may be regarded as chance is the fact that the interest is drawn for and paid out in the form of prizes. Well, it has been pointed out that the public are spending their money on other forms of gambling at the moment. You will never be able to stop it. The hon. member referred to the abolition of dog-racing. But what has been the effect of the abolition of dog-racing? It has not diminished the amount of money that comes into the coffers of horseracing. If anything it has increased it considerably. Not only has it increased it, but we have the strange spectacle of the Cape Provincial Council sponsoring a horse-race meeting, as we saw at Milnerton last week, where we saw the Administrator of the Cape presenting a prize. Sir, is that not tacit consent to gambling? And if that is not enough, may I ask the hon. member who has just sat down what his impression is of the S. A. Broadcasting Corporation involving itself in gambling. After all, it does gamble. Do you know what the S. A. Broadcasting Corporation does? It draws lots in order to give prizes to the listeners. Is that not gambling? What about the Department of Justice? Has the Department of Justice not made itself an accomplice to gambling? And how has it done it? The Department of Justice gave its consent to the Newspaper Press Union to allow the Press of this country to publish names of the winners of lotteries in countries outside our borders. Are the public not entitled then to conclude that there is nothing terrible about this question of gambling? If the Government-sponsored Broadcasting Corporation is giving out prizes by the drawing of lots, if the Department of Justice gives its consent to the publication of the names of winners of prizes in lotteries, what is wrong then with a motion such as this? And what about the Nationalist Party? Do they not draw lots for prizes at their <i>Stryddag</i> bazaars?</p>

<p>I think it will be generally conceded, even by those members who have spoken against this motion, that public opinion to-day is strongly in favour of a scheme such as has been put forward here by the hon. member for Kensington. If hon. members who have spoken against this motion feel that they cannot support it on moral grounds, I would say to them that here they had a wonderful opportunity to save face by accepting a compromise measure such as has been suggested by the hon. member for Kensington. They would then be giving the public something that they really want. If you want to put it to <span class="col_995-996" refersTo="page_0512"/>the test, look what was happened throughout the country in places like Bredasdorp, Bloemfontein, Randfontein, Pretoria and other places which incidentally are Nationalist strongholds. The people there have formed voluntary committees and they are asking that the Government should allow them to indulge in what is a natural inclination and that is to take a chance. After all, that is man&#x2019;s natural inclination; he wants to take a chance. Why not give it to him in this form which is also a fine face-saving measure for the Government? Moreover, it is a scheme which will bring money into the coffers of the country and which can do no harm whatsoever. Sir, I think we have reached the stage where we must not always be telling members of the public what they ought to do. We must not become so sanctimonious as to believe that we are the only people who know what is right. Let the public have their point of view. We must stop telling them that they cannot swim on Sundays; we must stop telling them that they cannot read this, that or the other. Let us have enough faith in our public to allow them to do what they feel is right. Let us rather concentrate on finding out what is the cause of the high divorce rate in this country&#x2014;divorce by consent. Let us concentrate more on the circumstances which give rise to offences under the Immorality Act and to the number of cases which come before the courts from time to time. I think if we did that, then the public would appreciate our efforts much more. Let the public have their say. And, will you tell me, Sir, what is going to happen to-night in Beaufort West?</p>

<p>Sir, a very interesting trend about these debenture savings bonds in England is the fact that there they make a feature on their proposal form of the fact that application can be made for bonds in the names of children under 18 years of age, and it is a very interesting fact that a large amount of the money invested in Britain to-day in the hands of the Treasury&#x2014;the British Treasury has R800,000,000 available&#x2014;is invested by the British public in the names of their children. In other words, that is an indication that the people of Britain want to make these investments for their children. Greater space is devoted in the application form to applications in the name of a child than to applications in the name of the parents.</p>

<p>The hon. member who spoke last, says that you get no interest on money invested in such debenture savings bonds. He did not decry the fact that your capital is absolutely safe and there is no danger whatsoever of your losing your capital. The interesting thing that we must bear in mind is that under this scheme your money is guaranteed by the Treasury.</p>

All the hon. member&#x2019;s colleagues on that side are in the same position; their money is secure in the bank but they are getting no interest on the money in their current account.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>There may be justification for the institution of a system of premium savings bonds by the Government, but if any such justification exists I have never heard of it, and certainly not in the arguments advanced here to-day. I leave the moral aspect of it aside for the moment. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has tried to anticipate objections to the scheme, but what he has done is to indicate what justification exists for the State to take such action. Apart from those objections, the onus rests on him to convince us that the State should institute such a system. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat said: Give the people what they want. If we give the people what they want, I do not know whether that will always be wise. There was a time when it was very popular in a welfare state to give the public as much as possible, but later it was discovered that the welfare state to a large extent was only the first step towards a farewell state. All those splendid characteristics of independence and initiative are undermined if one simply always gives the public what it wants.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as I know this is the first time that a motion has been introduced here in which the Government has been asked to institute a system of premium savings bonds. I want to say that in essence and in principle this system of premium savings bonds in no way differs from a State lottery. Let me just <span class="col_997-998" refersTo="page_0513"/>mention a few points. In both cases the scheme is calculated to provide the State with funds, in the form of loans which the State can then use for its own purposes, or funds to be used for certain social purposes. In both cases the tickets are paid for out of people&#x2019;s incomes. It makes no difference whether a person buys a ticket out of the salary he draws at the end of the month, or whether he buys it out of his income in the form of dividends, or his income from the sale of products. It comes out of his income, and it makes no difference whether he buys that ticket with the interest on money he has invested but not received. In every case that money comes out of his income. The only difference is that in the last-mentioned case it is income which has been stopped before it reaches him. But if I go to my employer and I sign a stop order and ask him to deduct a certain amount every month and to buy tickets for me with that money, surely that is precisely the same as what is envisaged in this scheme. In the third place, in both cases it satisfies the urge to gamble which unfortunately most of us have&#x2014;the urge to get rich as quickly as possible without working for the money. I therefore say that all the objections which can be raised to a system of State lotteries can also be raised against this system. Premium savings bonds are only another form of State lottery. In essence and in principle it is the same. In common parlance, one can say that a State lottery is just as far removed from a system of premium savings bonds as Worcester is from Wor-cester, where the only difference is in the pronunciation.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of the Government that a State lottery is not in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>What is the justification advanced for it? There is no financial justification for the institution of such a system. The Government is not yet in such a predicament that it has to obtain its loan funds in this way. If it needs loan funds for the development of the country it can obtain them in the ordinary way. The argument was advanced here that this scheme offers the small man an opportunity to save. It is estimated that in the United Kingdom, if one takes all the money invested in Government loans which are ordinarily subscribed to by individuals&#x2014;not by large companies&#x2014;these premium savings bonds will constitute only about 10 per cent of the total. The amount invested in national savings certificates is &#x00A3;2,140,000,000, whereas the amount invested in premium savings bonds is only &#x00A3;395,000,000. Then there are still Defence bonds, the tax reserve certificates and national savings stamps. Hon. members will therefore see that this is not the only way in which the small man can invest his money even in England. There is therefore no financial justification for this motion on this ground.</p>

<p>In the second place, such a scheme is also unnecessary as a channel for personal savings. We have heard much here about the encouragement of thrift, and hon. members have said that it will encourage particularly the small man to save. They pointed out that our currency depreciates at the rate of approximately 2 per cent per annum; that is a world phenomenon, and this is now the reply to it. But is that so? If a person invests, say, R200 in premium savings bonds, what is his position then? When he withdraws that capital, whether it be in a year&#x2019;s time or in two years&#x2014;or in ten years&#x2019; time, that capital has also depreciated, just as it would have depreciated had he invested it at a fixed rate of interest in any other form. His capital is then less also, because in two years&#x2019; time the purchasing power of that money has decreased, and it makes no difference whether he invested it in this form or whether he invested it in a savings bank or a building society or elsewhere. Not only does the purchasing power of his money depreciate, but in addition he gets no interest on his money. He may be one of the unfortunate people, and the unfortunates are in the majority by far. In the U. K. the prizes in 1962-3 amounted to more than &#x00A3;15,000,000, and that &#x00A3;15,000,000 did not find its way into the pockets of the people from whom it came. That money which was invested by millions of people found its way into the pockets of a small minority. The great majority of the people who risked their money in it got nothing. It is therefore not a means of encouraging thrift. We in South Africa are fortunate in the sense that we have many channels in which the small man, too, may invest his savings. We have national savings certificates; we have the Post Office savings bank; we have the building societies and we have the ordinary savings banks. There are many ways in which even the small man may invest his money safely.</p>

<p>Proof of the popularity of our national savings certificates lies in the fact that the amount invested in national savings certificates increases tremendously year after year. There the small man is building up something for his children. He gets no interest on it, but at the end of five years he gets his capital back with the highest interest possible, viz. more than 5 per cent compound interest, tax free. We therefore have no lack of means. But is this now the way to encourage people to save, by dangling before their noses the root prospect of winning a prize? Is that real thrift? Thrift which has to be stimulated in that way is not thrift at all. The person who buys these premium savings bonds does not do so to save money; he does so because he hopes to win a prize. It does not encourage thrift.</p>

<p>But in the third place there is also no financial justification for the scheme, because it is not necessary to stop the outflow of capital to foreign countries. There was a time when it was a very strong argument to say that there was no other way of stopping the outflow of capital. On a former occasion when the matter was discussed here, that was one of the most important arguments advanced, <span class="col_999-1000" refersTo="page_0514"/>that we could not stop this outflow, and that the only way of keeping that money here was to institute a State lottery in South Africa. But even if the money had been able to flow out freely, a State lottery could not have stopped it. It would probably have encouraged it all the more. People would have said to themselves: &#x201C;We have only invested R2 in it; we still have more than enough money to send to Rhodesia or to Malta. &#x201D; But we see what happens now. Without a State lottery measures were applied which quite effectively control the outflow of money. At least, it certainly restricts it. Figures were mentioned here of the amounts which have already been stopped from flowing out by this measure, and which would otherwise have left the country. But have hon. members ever thought how ridiculous we would look if we were now to institute a State lottery and at the same time place an embargo on sending money out of the country to buy lottery tickets in other countries? Surely that would be a ridiculous situation. If we were to establish a State lottery here in any of its forms, whether it be a system of premium savings bonds or any other system, it would mean that we would no longer have any moral right to tell people that they could not send their money out of the country to buy lottery tickets abroad. If we introduced the system asked for here, I do not see how we would be able to intercept the money which is today being stopped from flowing out of the country.</p>

<p>Not only is there no financial justification for the institution of such a scheme, but there are also many sociological objections to it. I do not want to expatiate on that. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter) particularly pointed out, as a sociologist, how it undermines character, how it discourages the will to work, and how it cultivates a spirit of wanting to make money without any exertion at all. It is unfortunately a human weakness to want to gamble, to get something for nothing wherever possible, but that is no reason why we should increase the opportunities for gambling. I think there are already more than sufficient opportunities for gambling, as hon. members have already said. Gambling is undoubtedly the source of many social evils. I do not want to expand on that; that is self-evident. That is the experience of sociologists all over the world. We regard the matter in the same light, because in South Africa we have legislation against gambling, but if we were now to allow a State lottery, how can we make other forms of gambling illegal? That would surely stultify our whole position.</p>

<p>Certain hon. members in passing referred to horse racing. It is quite true that that is a form of gambling. We have many other forms of gambling here to-day, but fortunately that has never yet been regarded as being sufficient reason for allowing further forms of gambling. In other words, two blacks do not make a white. When the Transvaal Provincial Council legislated against dog racing, it did not allow itself to be frightened by the argument: Logically you are now being ridiculous because you allow horse racing, and why not dog racing? They adopted the standpoint that if one cannot eliminate all forms of gambling, there is still no justification for encouraging further forms of gambling. We adopted the same attitude in this House not long ago in regard to sports pools. We know what dimensions that evil has already assumed in other countries. We noticed that it gained a footing here, and this House took action against it. That is just another form of gambling, with a little more use of intelligence. We smothered it in embryo, and we did not allow ourselves to be influenced by the argument: You allow horse racing, and why will you not allow football pools? As I say, the fact that there are possibly other forms of gambling in South Africa and in other countries is still no justification for the institution of new forms of it, as is proposed here.</p>

<p>Then I just want to say that there are also objections on moral grounds. I have said that there is no financial justification for it; I have said that there are many sociological objections, and now I say that there are also moral objections.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, whether you agree or not, the institution of a State lottery in South Africa, as our population is constituted at present, will only be a new source of dissension. Why should we do it just at a stage when there are many things which encourage us to promote unity and to avoid points of difference? We cannot get away from the fact that many among the conservative section of our population, of which I am one, would be deeply aggrieved if the State were to place its stamp of approval on the sort of thing proposed here.</p>

Now I just want to say what the Government&#x2019;s standpoint is. Seeing that there is no financial justification for it, and that it is liable to have harmful social consequences, and that it will deeply hurt many religious persons, the Government feels that it is not in the interests of South Africa to institute a State lottery in any shape or form.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is the same as a State lottery. The one is just as far removed from the other was Worcester is from Wor-cester. Both have the same object; both satisfy the same instinct; both just constitute <span class="col_1001-1002" refersTo="page_0515"/>a form of gambling in the hope of getting something for nothing. In essence, the two are precisely the same. I should perhaps have said right in the beginning that where I use the term &#x201C;State lottery&#x201D;, it has reference to the premium savings bonds. I began by saying that there is no difference between them. It is just a little easier to say &#x201C;State lottery&#x201D; than to say &#x201C;premium savings bonds&#x201D;. It remains the same&#x2014;&#x201C;a rose by any other name&#x201D;. I say we would be stultifying ourselves by instituting a State lottery or a system of premium savings bonds on behalf of the State, when at the same time we have legislation prohibiting sports pools and dog-races and participation in foreign lotteries and other forms of gambling.</p>

<p>One of the far-fetched arguments was: What is the difference between buying a ticket in a lottery or buying shares on the stock exchange? I cannot give a better answer than the one given by one of my predecessors. The same arguments were used at that time. Somebody said that even marriage was a gamble. I just want to read what Mr. Hofmeyr said in 1936&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No, Sir, there are these elements of chance, but the intelligent man uses his intelligence as a counter to these elements of chance. Gambling implies the surrender of intelligence to blind chance. The institution of a lottery by the State would be a confession of weakness, financial, moral and intellectual. I hope South Africa will never condemn itself in this way.</block>

<p>That was his reply. In the case of the other forms of gambling, one at least needs a little intelligence. It is not a case of a man buying shares simply by blindly putting the point of his pencil on a list of shares and then seeing where it rests. He uses his intelligence. That is what distinguishes it from this form. Here no intelligence is required. All the intelligence comes from &#x201C;Ernie&#x201D;. &#x201C;Ernie&#x201D; is the man who works it all out. There is nothing of one&#x2019;s own intelligence in it; one hands one&#x2019;s intelligence over to &#x201C;Ernie&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I think it will be an evil day for South Africa if a Government should ever go so far as to put the stamp of approval of the State on an institution of this nature. Previous Governments of all parties have thought along the lines of this Government. It is not necessary for me to read long extracts, but I just want to read two. In 1930, at a time when there was perhaps more justification on financial grounds for it than there is to-day, when there was a measure of depression, there was also a similar motion, and this is what Mr. Havenga said then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I doubt whether a future Parliament will be prepared, when it takes into consideration the composition of our population, to consider implementing such proposals. State lotteries will not contribute to the economic development of our country and the stability of our people. It has not become necessary yet to seek refuge in this type of method, which undermines the character of the people by holding out the hope to them that they will quickly enrich themselves without having to work. I think it will be found that this is the view held by the Parliament of our country.</block>

<p>That is what Minister Havenga said in 1930, and it is still true to-day. There are certain things which do not change with the times. There are certain spiritual values and a sense of values which, even in the times in which we live, cannot completely be blunted. Although there is an agitation, and there will perhaps always be an agitation for this sort of thing&#x2014;it was already there in 1930 and perhaps even before that, and it will probably still be there in 1990&#x2014;I am glad to see that the responsible people of the country feel that this is not a demand on the part of a section of the people which should be acceded to, because it is just not in the interests of one&#x2019;s country, South Africa. To me that is the only test.</p>

<p>Then I just want to read what Minister Hofmeyr said in 1936&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am grateful that the hon. member raised the matter of a State lottery and that he thereby gives me the opportunity to state my standpoint very clearly in regard to a State lottery. Let me say immediately that I do not believe in a State lottery. I do not believe in it, for financial considerations. Anything as uncertain as a State lottery is not a suitable basis for State finances. That is not only my standpoint, but I think it was the opinion of every person who has ever been Minister of Finance in the Union of South Africa.</block>

<p>It is perhaps a good thing that at this stage the opportunity is again being offered to Parliament and to the Government to express its complete agreement with the views of former Ministers of Finance and their Governments, in this House. We have had this discussion now. I do not think this debate will be the end of the agitation. That is perhaps expecting too much, but I hope that where we have respect for those people who have no moral objections to it, they will show as much respect for those people who do have moral and other objections to an institution of this nature. Therefore, as far as the Government is concerned, we find ourselves quite unable to agree with what is proposed here.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to thank hon. members for the interest they have taken in this debate. During the few minutes at my disposal I should like to make a few remarks in conclusion. I should like to <span class="col_1003-1004" refersTo="page_0516"/>deal with the hon. Minister first. The hon. the Minister has kept on repeating himself for about 25 minutes or half an hour and the whole of his speech is fallacious; it is built on a fallacy. This is not a State lottery. All the quotations he has given us of what was said in the past, how his predecessors had condemned a State lottery, are not applicable to this debate. He has failed completely to deal with the investment aspect.</p>

<p>I want to say this: that I have never said that this investment would be a counter to the depreciation of our money. But I do say now at the conclusion of the debate that any form of saving is a counter to inflation.</p>

<li>(1) having a survey made of our available fresh water resources, both surface and subterranean;</li>

</ol>

<p>I want to say immediately that I am moving this motion to illustrate the interest which this side of the House takes in the difficult task of the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs. If I can succeed in holding the interest of the whole House and that of the public outside then I feel that I shall have succeeded in my purpose to a large extent.</p>

<p>If you look at the motion, Mr. Speaker, you will see that it consists of three parts. The first deals with the amount of water that we have; the second with the way in which we can supplement those water supplies scientifically and the third how we can protect and conserve those supplies. The whole purpose of this motion is this: Whether we can increase what we have and, if not, how we can adequately protect what we have. Our country experiences droughts from time to time. It is a country with a widely fluctuating and low rainfall. Up to the present moment the damage that these periodic droughts cause has been confined mainly to agriculture, to our crops and our livestock. I do not want to waste the time of the House by discussing the great damage that has been caused in this country by drought in the past. We are all aware of that fact. I just want to add that that damage is very great. Although efforts have been made in the past to do so I do not think it is possible to ascertain the amount of that damage. As the country develops and as our population increases, we must realize that in the future that damage is not only going to be restricted to small platteland towns and farms. That damage is already starting to assume larger proportions. As the country develops that damage will increase and spread to our larger towns and our cities. I do not think I can put it any better than it was described by the present Minister of Lands a few years ago when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As South Africa expands we shall continue to develop our available water until a position may be reached when, for physical or economic reasons, we can make no more available although our other resources&#x2014;sowing, mining and industry&#x2014;are still capable of further development.</block>

<p>I think that this is the true position, Mr. Speaker. An expert once said: No matter what your resources may be, no matter what possibilities a country may have, you are faced with this great problem that all those possibilities are bound up with your water supplies, that is, both surface and subterranean water. Future development depends upon the availability of water. Because we are developing rapidly to-day more than ever before we must realize that we have now reached the stage where that damage which in the past was suffered by farmers generally, will be felt further afield.</p>

<p>At a conference held from 1 to 25 October in Pretoria under the auspices of the C. S. I. R., the following remarks were made (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is a country with limited water resources, a low rainfall over large parts of the country and a climate which results in a particularly high degree of evaporation. As the population increases and industries grow the problem of water supplies increases. We will therefore have to learn to make the best use of every drop of water in South Africa and, as far as possible, to use it over and over again and to put an end to unnecessary pollution.</block>

<p>At this conference an expert stated that it had been estimated that over the next 60 years our population would increase to about 70,000,000. He regarded that as the maximum which this country with its present available <span class="col_1005-1006" refersTo="page_0517"/>water supplies could possibly carry. They estimated that in the course of the next 30 years Johannesburg and Pretoria would have a shortage of about 200,000,000 gallons of water per day. If that is the position, then the question arises whether it is right that the State, knowing that that will be the position in Johannesburg and Pretoria in 30 years&#x2019; time, should permit the development that is taking place in that area to continue or whether it should not gradually start applying the brake. The position is now becoming so serious that we shall have to find some solution or other. Even though we may use water over and over again, expert opinion is that we are going to reach that position. It may be said that that is 30 years hence and that we still have plenty of time. But this matter requires research, and research requires time. With the industrial development that is under way at present this problem is steadily increasing. The damage that has been limited hitherto to the platteland will be felt by our cities to an ever-increasing extent. I would like to mention what is stated in this regard in the Manufacturer. They say that you need about 240,000 gallons of water to print one ton of news reports; that you need 65,000 gallons of water to produce one ton of steel and 10 gallons of water to produce one gallon of fuel. If we continue with our industrial development we must realize what the eventual position will be. Perhaps we should make use of the Tugela whose water, so it is said, could supply six Johannesburgs and six Pretorias, or perhaps we could divert the water of the Tugela to Johannesburg. I just want to say that we must not think that we will only reach this stage in ten or 20 years&#x2019; time. We have reached it already.</p>

<p>The following telegram which came from Rustenburg was recently sent to the hon. the Minister (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Water supplies Rustenburg in extremely critical position. Apart from farmers below Bospoort Dam inhabitants and industries of the town and vicinity so seriously affected that consequences cannot be emphasized strongly enough. Prevailing critical position is such that it can scarcely become any worse. Early good rains will bring temporary relief but repetition of prevailing water shortage must at all costs be prevented in interests of town and district.</block>

<p>I quote this merely as a practical example of the position that is developing. I want to add that about 70 per cent&#x2014;according to a statement made on one occasion by the previous Minister of Water Affairs, the present Minister of Lands&#x2014;of the smaller towns in the country are dependent upon subterranean water. More than half of our small stock and about half of our large stock are dependent upon subterranean water. As this development goes ahead we must realize that more and more we will have to tap not only the running water&#x2014;which is limited in South Africa&#x2014;but the subterranean water as well. I think that the hon. the Minister will probably be able to tell us which of our rivers have a fairly constant flow of water. I do not know for how many months they flow. It is clear that the continual droughts experienced by our country also results in a very poor flow in most of our rivers. Secondly, these continual droughts means that less and less water finds its way to our subterranean dams or pans. This water has apparently collected over a long period of time but with our steadily increasing needs those water resources will become smaller and smaller and will eventually dry up altogether.</p>

<p>I am aware of what the hon. the Minister is already doing. All I am asking is that he should try on a larger scale to use various methods to strengthen those subterranean water resources. Many people think that a great deal of water runs into the sea but according to scientists it appears that we have a very weak flow of water and that only about 8 per cent of our water finds its way into our rivers.</p>

<p>If that is the position of our water supplies&#x2014;that it is critical as far as our future development is concerned, that tremendous damage has already been caused and that this damage, so it is anticipated, will increase in the future&#x2014;then we have to ask ourselves this question: How can we increase the water resources of South Africa scientifically? People have come forward in the past with suggestions in this regard. We had the Schwartz scheme which was rejected. It was investigated to some extent but it was rejected. During a previous discussion on subterranean water reference was made to the plan of Professor Taljaard, a professor in geology at the University of Stellenbosch, to divert the warm water current to the West Coast. I do not want to discuss this suggestion, Mr. Speaker, because I do not think that either the hon. the Minister or I can say that Professor Taljaard is wrong. This is a scientific matter. What I think we must do is to encourage people to discover scientific methods of supplementing our water supplies and to undertake research to discover how this problem should be approached. We are living in a scientific age. Things which ten years ago were considered to be absolutely impossible are regarded as possible to-day. If I had told somebody in the past that there was the possibility that he could some day fly to the moon he would have thought that I was mad. But if we tell someone nowadays that he cannot fly to the moon he will think we are mad. Have we not reached the stage where we have to encourage and pay people to do scientific research? I do not think that we have done this as yet; we have simply rejected all the plans which individuals have put forward in the past; we have simply said that they cannot possibly be implemented. I want to tell the House that America with its great water <span class="col_1007-1008" refersTo="page_0518"/>resources is already working on a scheme for supplementing its waters over a ten-year period. There is a certain Dr. Nace who has suggested a plan of this kind and he has in fact been commissioned to draw up such a plan. One of the plans that he suggests is that the mass of ice at the South Pole should be melted. He considers that if this can be done gradually, it will be possible to ensure that all the rivers in the world have a steady flow of water for about 830 years. I do not want to elaborate on this matter but this is a plan that has been suggested in regard to this problem&#x2014;the idea of getting people to do research. Whether they succeed or not is another matter but we will then at least have taken steps to have the necessary research done in the event of a development of this nature in the future. I think that in this regard we in South Africa have never encouraged people to do research. I think that if ever it was necessary to give encouragement in this connection it is now. We must consider this matter in a serious light and give the necessary encouragement for research and planning and investigation into the question as to whether we can supplement our water supplies scientifically and improve our climatic conditions in the future. But if there is such a likelihood or possibility, then there are a few problems which my motion mentions specifically. The first is the tremendous amount of evaporation of water that takes place. Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister in his policy motion in the Other Place last year said that we were losing about 6 feet of water per annum through evaporation only. On a previous occasion the hon. the Minister of Lands put it on a broader basis; he said that the degree of evaporation varied as a result of climatic conditions between 5 and 9 feet per annum. If only we can succeed in preventing some of that evaporation we will have achieved a great deal. Here again it is a question of research. We realize that this is a great problem; we realize that we are living in a warm climate, a dry climate; we realize that we have long periods when no rain falls, long periods of drought. We have the position in the Transvaal at the moment&#x2014;it is the rainy season there now&#x2014;that more than two months have gone by during which time hardly any rain has fallen at all. Because of this fact everything is very dry and it is extremely hot. One fully realizes that this is a very great problem, but here too it is necessary for us to make some sort of plan. I know that last year the hon. the Minister emphasized the fact that this was a tremendous problem. If we can succeed in salvaging a portion of that water that is evaporating at present we will be able to add a large amount of water to our existing supplies. But there is another matter that has recently caused us a great deal of concern. In his policy motion last year in the Other Place the hon. the Minister also referred to water pollution. I know that he has the power to prevent pollution under the new Act of 1956. Certain exemptions are given and I feel that this fact gives cause for concern. It is clear that the time has come when we have to use and re-use every drop of our water. Once the water has passed through the machinery it is usually polluted and that water must in the first place be kept away from our public streams. I know that exemptions are granted and I am really worried about the situation. I do not know to what extent these exemptions are granted, but if a certain number of exemptions are continually being granted, large quantities of our water may be completely polluted. I do not know what research has already been done in this connection. I know that the C. S. I. R. are doing research in this regard but to my mind as a layman it does not seem possible that this water can be used by factories and municipalities and other bodies and then used over and over again after it has been cooled, even perhaps without having undergone a purification process. But I do not have the necessary knowledge to be able to express an opinion in this regard. All that I want to emphasize is that this polluted water must be kept away from our public streams as far as possible. I think that we run a risk as far as the future is concerned if we allow this water to flow into our public streams, even in small quantities.</p>

<p>I realize that my motion covers a matter which presents a very great problem at the moment. A tremendous task rests on the shoulders of the hon. the Minister and his Department. A great responsibility also rests upon the municipalities and city councils but I think that it is necessary for the hon. the Minister to get people and bodies to help him to advise city councils and municipalities and encourage them to combat water pollution in all its ramifications. This is only one aspect of a very complex problem. I have tried to discuss these matters to the best of my ability. It is a pity that this motion is not in more capable hands. I urge that for the sake of the future of South Africa, for the sake of her whole population, for the sake of her future development, this great task be given priority and that it receive the earnest attention of everybody concerned. Otherwise we will find ourselves in a position where we will be bogged down and will not be able to make any further progress.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I have read the motion of the hon. member who has just sat down and I have listened with great interest to his speech, and I want to say that so far as I am concerned, I think there is not much that the hon. member has said with which we on this side of the House can quarrel. I think, however, that in some respects the hon. member has missed the point. His resolution asks for an inquiry, particularly in regard to our available fresh water resources, surface and subterranean, and an investigation into <span class="col_1009-1010" refersTo="page_0519"/>possible methods of supplementing such water supplies, and so on. We cannot quarrel with that in so far as the substance is concerned. The point I want to make is this: I do not know whether the hon. Minister will thank the hon. member for the form of his resolution, because the hon. member asks for an inquiry into these matters. That is the point, as far as we on this side of the House are concerned. Why inquire into these matters? The hon. member referred to the Act of 1956. I want to say that I was a member of the Select Committee which sat for about three years before that Act was put on the Statute Book; we were all proud to be members of that Select Committee. If the powers given to the Minister there are inadequate, then the Minister has only got to come to Parliament and in my opinion we will give him further powers. The powers are here. The hon. member&#x2019;s resolution is only wrong in my opinion not because of its substance but because of the form. He asks for an inquiry into these matters. What are the Minister&#x2019;s powers today under the Act? Let me quote under Chapter I, Section 2&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister shall have the power&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) to acquire, construct, extend, alter, maintain, repair, control and dispose of water works or such other works as he may consider necessary in the exercise of his powers or the performance of his functions under this Act;</li>

<li>(b) to sink boreholes and wells, obtain supplies of water from underground sources, conserve water so obtained and supply or deliver it &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>And then I want to come to paragraph (e)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To establish or maintain hydrologic and hydrographic stations and works and to record the observations obtained thereby, and generally to obtain and record information and statistics as to hydrographic conditions in the Union.</block>

<p>And so on. The Minister has got the power. It is no good asking for an inquiry into matters when the Minister has got all these powers. I am going to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, whilst supporting all measures taken to conserve, preserve and augment our precious subterranean and surface waters, nevertheless condemns the Government for its failure adequately to implement the provisions of the Water Act, 1956&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is the amendment, and now I come to the first point. We condemn the Government. I do not know what the difficulties of the hon. Minister are. If these things that are asked for by the hon. member who has moved this resolution and the matters which we have in mind and which the framers of that Act have in mind are to be adequately carried out, then the first thing was to give the Minister adequate staff. I do not know what his troubles are in that regard. If the Minister has not got an adequate staff, a scientific staff as well as a professional staff, he cannot adequately carry out the functions under the powers given him in this Act. I do not know how far he is haltered, limited, how far he would like to go and is unable to go because he has not got behind him the backing of the Government in his desire to place his Department in the position which it should occupy. And there I agree with the hon. member who has moved this motion: &#x201C;The position that it should occupy. &#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I recently in dealing with this question of water conservation and so forth came across a book which I am afraid hon. members cannot yet get in our Library, but it is on order. It is &#x201C;The Meaning of Wilderness to Science&#x201D;, by David Brower. It was published in New York. I want to quote from it a little this afternoon, and I want to simply say this in explanation that it is really a grouping of addresses given by leading scientists in the United States at a symposium held under the aegis of what is called there the Sierra Club, where the preservation of natural resources is the main principle upon which that club is formed. The particular authority that issued a paper that I want to quote from is Dr. L. B. Leopold, who is the chief of the Water Resources Division of the United States Biological Survey. One of the points that he makes, and I think it is a matter that we will all agree with, is that for the purpose of water conservation in its widest form and from the angle of the best that we can get from it, the Minister concerned, must have scientists of all different kinds and professions and callings. It is not merely a matter of a scientist who is dealing with hydrographic matters. You require botanists, ecologists, zoologists, so that you have a team which can carry out this work. Sir, when I say that we agree with the hon. member as to the place in which he puts this question of water supply, may I say this that here on page 39 of this work the statement is made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think you can all see the real need for further reference points, bench marks, or data that you can relate the changing world back to. If we do not get reference points, we are unable to really understand some of these long-range problems that are involved in water&#x2014;and without water, as we all know, the human race and most other forms of life would disappear.</block>

<p><span class="col_1011-1012" refersTo="page_0520"/>That is clear and succinct human life would disappear. As the hon. member has said we are limited in our supplies of water in this country. We want all that we have got, and we want to know what the position is so far as our water supplies are concerned. Mr. Speaker, I do not only want to be destructive this afternoon, I want to be constructive also, and I want to say to the hon. Minister that in dealing with a matter of this kind, notwithstanding the importance attached to it by the hon. member who has moved the motion, how far is there a public appreciation of what we are dealing with? I ask hon. members to look around and to look at the Press. Sir, we are here because of water. Without water we perish, the lot of us. We are spending millions and hundreds of millions of Rand to provide for the specific physical defence of South Africa against certain enemies. What are we doing in the way of expenditure to provide for the necessary defence of our country against internal effusion, which is just as vital to our country and our civilization? You are just as dead if you die from thirst as if you die from a shot by a bullet. Our country is more dead if you are killed from thirst than when you are killed by a bullet. You can be killed by a bullet and your country can survive, but if your country is dead, what is left?</p>

<p>I want to make this appeal to the hon. Minister&#x2014;I said I want to be constructive, although I am criticizing the Government and am criticizing them bitterly for their lack of attention to this fundamental problem: I think the hon. Minister has got to make this particular question newsworthy. He must get the Press on his side. Make it interesting. It is interesting. There are facets of this matter that should be presented to the public so that they will find the greatest interest and enjoyment in it. Let me mention an item&#x2014;I am not going to quote any more than I can help from this book, but let me give you an example of something which I believe is newsworthy, and where I believe, if the hon. Minister has got the right scientists, an article could appear in the Press which would be read with avidity by the ordinary reader, who is not going to read an ordinary article about water conservation and soil conservation. He says: &#x201C;I know all about that, but if you open a tap you still get plenty of water&#x201D;, and as far as soil conservation is concerned, one can go to the market and buy vegetables. &#x201C;What the hell do I want more than that?&#x201D; He is satisfied the sun will shine to-morrow and that is all that he is concerned with. But let me give this item. In a soil survey that they were making in the Belgian Congo two-and-a-half years ago, they came on a large area where in the soil there was no bacillus of tetanus&#x2014;the only place, I think, in the whole world. Here is this widespread germ, to call it like that, all over the world in the soil, tetanus, one of the most shocking things that we have got, and throughout the world the bacillus of tetanus is found in the soil. Goodness knows how long it can stay there dormant, but probably for centuries, and here you have a great area where it does not exist? Why? Here is a wonderful story. If they can solve the problem of the absence of the tetanus bacillus in that area, they will have found the answer to what we normally call lock-jaw. Hon. members will understand what I mean.</p>

<p>There are numbers of other facets. This is not as dry as dust. It is a subject as liquid and as fluid as water, and it can be presented in an interesting form if the hon. Minister will get the Press on his side. It can be presented by small pieces of what is really propaganda, propaganda for the preservation of our water supplies. It can be done. It only needs the people who have the know-how and who know how to do these things. Make it interesting, make it newsworthy, and the public will read it with avidity. In that regard there are people who can help the Minister. I realize, as I have said, that without staff he is knee-haltered. But all the provinces to-day have some kind of wild life preservation, game preservation organization, all the provinces. I know that in my own province the C. S. I. R. to-day are continually asking the Natal Parks Board to help them with regard to scientific investigations of various kinds which they are carrying out, including certain data in regard to water, evaporation tables, flow, etc. We are only too willing to help and I am sure every one of the provinces would be willing to help, as also some of the bigger municipalities; anybody who to-day can assist in this particular matter I am sure would be willing to assist if only the Minister would make use of those voluntary organizations which will be at his command if he will only appeal for the assistance of these various agencies. What we want is: Spread. We want to know what is happening over the whole of the country. We want to know for as long a period as possible where there are long-standing records which are of far greater value to us than records that have been held over two years. I have here, again from Dr. Leopold, a section which I found most interesting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To summarize, the ecological system&#x2014;man, land, pump, plough, trees and climate&#x2014;experiences much larger variations in ground-water levels than existed in the simpler system of land, trees and climate. How much larger and how important are these variations it is difficult to assess until the situation is flagrantly out of balance. By that time, the trend is nearly irreversible and usually continues until the limit of economic feasibility is reached.</block>

<p>Sir, this scientist, Dr. Leopold, has stated that in his opinion, although the United States, he feels, is backward itself, that the only way to deal with these matters is to establish what he calls reference points or bench marks, dealing <span class="col_1013-1014" refersTo="page_0521"/>particularly with the flow of our natural waters. There he has this to say about it (and how applicable it is to our country!)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is often stated that water tables are falling, that floods are increasing, that the soil resource is deteriorating, and that much of our irreplaceable top soil is slipping seaward. As scientists it behaves us to take some interest in these questions and, as scientists, to obtain the truest and most objective answers possible. But whether one approaches these problems as a citizen or as a scientist, he immediately faces the fact that answers to these questions must be stated relative to some standard base or datum. What are you going to compare against? Is the standard or datum itself a fluctuating one? Can we possibly agree on a reference point? If each person who tackles such a question uses a different reference for comparison, it is quite obvious that all the answers will be different.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to answer that point himself on page 38&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For long-term observation of the effect of climatic changes on runoff the United States Geological Survey is anxious to establish and maintain what we would call &#x201C;bench mark&#x201D; gauging stations, measuring stream-flow from areas which are as free as possible from future man-induced changes. Of the 7,000 gauging stations now maintained in the United States, less than a handful seem to fit the requirements. Even for those, there is no guarantee that the drainage basis will remain free of man&#x2019;s influence indefinitely.</block>

<block name="quote">The vast national programmes of hydrologic measurement are motivated by the same things that alter the landscape: Water storage, flood control, river regulation, and things like that. But virtually, none of these programmes is devoted to finding out what changes in the natural r&#x00E9;gimen these works are going to affect. Much goes into an evaluation of a benefit-cost ratio, but no effort goes into an evaluation of man as an agent of ecologic, and even of geologic, change. The most powerful tools of statistical inference cannot do what a bench mark station can do&#x2014;unravel man from nature in the records.</block>

<p>Here is the basic question that these scientists are all dealing with: How far are we as men through our influence on our environment ourselves interfering with even rainfall, let alone the ability of the soil to bring back to us the water which falls in the form of rain from the heavens and so forth. I have come across a particularly topical point which Dr. Leopold makes here on page 39&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Science is shooting for the moon. Personally, I would be content with much less. If we have learned enough to reach the moon, one would hope that we had learned enough to apply some of this great scientific energy to a few small areas in our own backyard. But we undoubtedly will reach the moon and start to alter its hydrologic environment, before we have set aside some representative land museum for hydrologic study here.</block>

<p>I think he is right. This was written about two years ago. Here is man likely to be changing the hydrologic conditions of the moon before we put our own country, let alone our own planet, in a proper state. Sir, we have heard so much from time to time about the necessity to store our water, to save it in this fashion and that fashion. Dr. Leopold drives a cart and horses right through such a large number of popular theories, right through them. There was one I read two or three times and then had a look at the discussion that took place thereafter, before I could really believe that what he had said was as set out here in its ordinary meaning. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is said by some that a large number of small reservoirs in the head waters of a drainage basin and the maintenance of forests or grassy cover would increase ground water recharge and would thus help to solve the problem of overdraft.</block>

<p>The evidence for this view, interestingly enough, is mostly inferential. The ability of a good vegetative cover to main soil tilth, and thus infiltration capacity, is very well known. But infiltration into the soil mantle is not synonymous with infiltration into an aquifer. At each level, soil capacity for moisture, that is field capacity, must be satisfied before water can move to greater depth. Nearly all vegetation draws its moisture from this source. Since, in the hydrologic cycle, an average of three-fourths of precipitated water is returned to the atmosphere by transpiration and evaporation, it can be seen that the take of the first claimant, evapo-transpiration, is large. Thus it should not be assumed a priori that there will be in any individual case a net gain of water to surface streams, or to aquifer storage, by building surface-storage reservoirs.</p>

<p>The whole way through this book you find some of our most cherished ideas knocked on the head. We see his plea for what he calls bench marks. In America they are putting these bench marks mostly in the mountains, because that is where man has interfered least with his environment. Let the Minister establish bench marks under the control of his Department. It is their job. Let them control the other scientists. We must not feel that a botanist or a geologist is out of place if he falls under the Secretary for Water Affairs. His job <span class="col_1015-1016" refersTo="page_0522"/>is to use his specialized knowledge so that the aggregate value of that knowledge can be brought to the attention of the Minister of Water Affairs. We must not feel that the Minister must have under his control only water engineers. We must realize that so many of these problems in our country are so different from those in other countries, although in America we find that, in parts of the country, they are dealing with problems which are almost identical with ours. But there is still variation. We think at present of the huge works that are being carried out, where every resource of the Minister&#x2019;s Department is being strained to get on with the work. But that is only handling the water we have at present. The other work remains to be done. What will come afterwards? What are we taking? Are we taking something which will be replenished, or are we draining our resources, and will we leave the country in a worse position? We see the progression of the desert. We still do not know for certain what is happening. One of the most highly populated countries of the world is India, and reference is made in this book to the progression of the desert there. I saw it myself when I was there a few years ago. The desert is creeping towards New Delhi at the rate of seven miles per annum and nobody knows why. Until they get down to a proper scientific investigation they will not know, nor will we in this country. It is not only a question of the vegetative cover of the soil. There are many other factors involved in it. I repeat that this is an essential job, upon which our country and its growing population depend. Our population will ultimately depend on our water supply. The water supply can limit our population. There are all sorts of experiments being made at present in regard to desalting water, it is true. Only last night over the radio I heard of the U. S. A. having a joint undertaking with Israel, and they will put some of the finest brains in the world on to the job. It is only a question of time before they find an answer, and then there will be open to us a completely new reservoir, literally, of water. But that water will have to be taken somewhere else to be used. It is in the sea, but we will have to bring it inland if we want to use it. The Government itself should see to it that the Minister and his Department are adequately staffed with scientists of all different kinds, so that specific research can be done into these problems, so that the sum total of that knowledge can be used to save our water supplies, whether it is on the surface or underneath it. We want our water supplies safeguarded, and for that reason I move my amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is significant that we are discussing water to-day, whilst large areas of country, like the Northern Transvaal, are suffering from a scarcity of water. It appears we seldom discuss water here in the House without there being a shortage of water in some part of the country. That is simply our fate, and I suppose that will in future also be the position, and therefore it is always a good thing to discuss this important asset, water, without which we would in future be unable to have any life here at all. Unless we conserve it we shall not be able to plan the country properly either.</p>

<p>I think it is a good thing that the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) moved this motion, and I want to congratulate him on having done so very efficiently. I think he showed the right perspective. The hon. member has succeeded in giving us a picture of the broad problem, as it affects our whole country.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) moved an amendment. I do not want to quarrel with the hon. member, but I tried to follow what he said without fully understanding everything. He is interested in water, and he feels the way we do about these matters, but I do not think the hon. member quite understood what the motion says. What the hon. member for Christiana did was to ask the Minister to continue to comply with certain requirements mentioned in the motion. He asked that a survey should be made of the available water resources and that scientific methods should be investigated further to conserve them, and that machinery should be established to protect these water resources. I think the hon. member for South Coast really misunderstood the motion. The hon. member for Christiana only asked that the Government should consider the advisability of investigating the matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Has the Minister then not done his duty?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Of course the Minister has an Act which enables him to do so, and he has the will to do it, but the hon. member was a little confused about the whole matter. In any case, I have very little time and I do not want to deviate from the subject.</p>

<p>I want to raise another point, namely this, that just as the hon. member for Christiana stated the physical problem of the shortage of water and the necessity for conserving and implementing it, there is another problem I want to discuss, and that is the important question as to who will eventually control the water of the Republic? Who will eventually be the actual owner of that water? Because the principles underlying our water legislation have already been changed twice in our history. The first period was that of <i>dominus fluminis</i>, or control by the State, i. e., the State is lord and master of all flood water. In terms of this principle, it is clear that the State has the right to do what it likes with water, and that it can, in its discretion, by way of a favour or a privilege, grant somebody the right to use water. That was the position for many years until approximately 1826, when this period came to an end, and changed radically, because under the influence of English law, after the British took over the Cape, a different legal principle <span class="col_1017-1018" refersTo="page_0523"/>was applied in our water legislation, namely the principle of the rights of riparian owners, the principle that the State is not the owner of the water, to distribute it in the way it deems fit, but that the right to water attaches to the land bordering on such a stream. For more than a century, the history of the distribution of water also grew together with the development of the land, and the Department of Water Affairs was nothing more than an instrument to ensure that this main principle was applied. But that is not all that our Water laws consist of. In the first place, it was based on the application of this principle by the Department, but also on an infinite number of decided cases, no two of which were precisely the same, because no two streams were precisely alike and the circumstances were not identical. The Courts gave an infinite number of interpretations to this principle, and so over a long period we eventually got the complex which we later called our water laws. The main emphasis here fell, firstly, on the rights of irrigators. The rights of irrigators enjoyed preference over the use of water for secondary and tertiary purposes. The second important principle was that the system of distribution, i. e. the principle applied when water in a stream had to be divided amongst the people living along the banks of that stream, was that everybody living along its banks would have a share in the water of that stream. If water was available, everybody had to get some of it. That was the golden rule.</p>

<p>Had our country had more water, had we had more streams and had our rainfall been higher, it would probably not have been necessary to change this principle. But as the result of a number of factors it was necessary to make an important change. In the first place it was important to take into account the protracted and continual shortage of water. The second was that the decisive role played by water in the whole of our national life as well as the role it will have to play in the future development of the country, made it essential for the State again to start thinking anew in regard to the matter, whether it was right that the principle of riparian ownership should continue to apply in this period when shortage of water exists, or whether the State should reconsider the whole matter.</p>

<p>The 1956 Act, which was actually passed as the result of an investigation made by Judge Hall, again put us back where we were more than a hundred years ago. That was the second time that the principle which is the basis of all our water legislation was radically changed. The principle which applies to-day is again the old one of <i>dominus fhiminis</i>. In other words, the State was given full rights of control over all water in the country. Now one can understand that when a country has been developing over such a long period and people have obtained vested rights, they cannot just be deprived of those rights, and that has to be kept in mind. Therefore the new Water Act has been based on two important principles. The first is that existing rights which are being exercised will be maintained and protected. The second point is the right claimed by the State in terms of the new Water Act to take control in certain water areas, in catchment areas, in dam areas, in irrigation areas, over the whole flow of the stream and to declare them to be State water-controlled areas. In other words, in all areas where there was no proper control the State could step in and take control in the public interest. That means that the State can now do as it wishes with the water. It can even take water from one area and transfer it to another. In other words, it has again reverted to the principle of taking control wherever possible. That is a very important development in these times, because water is becoming increasingly more important. But the Department of Water Affairs is also becoming more important as the result of it. And now we are on the eve of a further development in regard to our control of water, and the essence of my argument is that we now have to take one of two decisions. In regard to water control, the State can now do one of two things. It can decide in terms of the Act, to take full control of the water and its use and all planning in connection with water, which will mean that the Department of Water Affairs will have to be expanded as these needs develop; or the State can adopt the standpoint that whereas in the first place it has control of all the water in the country, it will adopt the principle of handing over control to ad hoc bodies which want to take over the distribution and control of that water. Should the Department of Water Affairs come to be regarded as a great, comprehensive Department which should also play its role in the future economic planning of the country, that will mean that the Department will have to play a very important role, perhaps even more important than in the past. It will mean its also having to act as a co-planner for the future, and it will play a much greater role in planning than it did in the past. Should the State decide to adopt the principle that it is prepared to transfer its rights to certain bodies, that would mean that the State would have less authority in future in regard to the planning of water and the economic planning of the country.</p>

<p>There are various examples of pressure being exerted on the State to take over large water projects for water areas from the State. I mention the Rand Water Board. That Board controls approximately 4,300 square miles. It controls 42 per cent of the potential of the Vaal River. In its area it has 45 per cent of the total population of the Transvaal. Many years ago it was found necessary to transfer the whole of the Vaal River complex to such an authority, and that authority, the Rand Water Board, has already become so important that the State is to-day in the position where, in regard to the planning of the Rand <span class="col_1019-1020" refersTo="page_0524"/>and its water supplies, it cannot just take action without more ado, but is really dependent on that Board. That is one example. When the Orange River Scheme was announced, pressure was immediately exerted by various people who wanted the State to step in and to transfer the whole complex to a body similar to the Tennessee Valley authority in America, which meant that if the State submitted to such pressure it would have to hand over the whole complex to such a body. There are also other examples. We have had the example of municipalities which thought that they could establish an authority to step in and to take over such a water complex.</p>

<p>The point I want to make finally is that in the past we have had examples of such bodies which want to step in and take over some of the responsibilities of the Department of Water Affairs. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity of putting us on the right road once and for all, also for the future, and to say that the Department of Water Affairs is the highest authority controlling water in S. A., and that he does not intend to decentralize his powers and to hand them over to bodies which already exist, or may exist in future, in order to carry out part of his functions; because it is imperative that the State, if it spends such huge amounts as it is already spending and still intends spending, should have control over that water. That is the point I wish to make, and I hope the Minister will reply to it so that we can have clarity for the future in regard to the control of our water.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#warren">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>I associate myself with the approach of the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel), to water affairs, and I admire his sincerity and his approach to the matter. But I would say that I think he has rather spot-lighted the deficiencies in the Department of Water Affairs, and I think he has indicated that the Minister himself has failed to carry out certain of his obligations. However, the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has dealt with the broader issue, and I propose dealing with the motion as it appears before us.</p>

<p>There must be very few rivers in the country about which the Minister&#x2019;s Department has not a fair measure of information and data. Much of that could have been carried out. Much of it was planned as long as 15 years ago, if not longer, and still nothing has been done. However, I must sympathize with the hon. the Minister in some respects, because his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, is laying claim to some of the most valuable water-sheds in the country and particularly along the Eastern coast of the Republic. He is actually buying them to-day, and he is actually destroying many of those water-sheds on which some of the largest towns in both Natal and the Cape are dependent for their water supplies. Now, what does the hon. the Minister propose doing about it? Up to the present nothing has been done. Does the Minister know that the Minister of Bantu Administration is laying claim to areas that represent some of the indigenous forest and mountain land, on which an enormous tract of country is dependent for its water supplies, and that he now intends to fill those areas up with Natives? And what does he expect from them? Surely the examples we have had can show the Minister what will happen. What are we going to do with this area now claimed by the Minister of Bantu Administration? The Minister has seen dust bowls himself, but the Minister of Bantu Administration is now establishing more dust bowls in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants scientific investigation in regard to supplementing our water supplies. I want to suggest to the Minister that he has himself to blame in many respects. The hon. member for South Coast referred to the fact that he wanted scientists and technicians and he has not got them. How can he expect to carry into effect any planning for the conservation and development of water when he has not the people to carry it out? I refer to the fact that the Minister has one of the most powerful and best organizations in the country in his extension officers, but there are extension officers sitting in many districts alone, without any technical officers or assistants of any sort. Those officers, with their soil conservation committees, can become a wonderful source of information to the Minister any time he wants information for the purpose of developing any of those districts. But how can they do that when that extension officer sits there alone? He cannot leave his office. He does no field work and he can do no observation or investigation. That state of affairs exists, and the Minister knows it. The Minister has all the machinery that he needs under the 1956 Act to do all that is asked for in this motion. I want to ask the Minister to apply his mind to the third leg of this motion, dealing with pollution. I wonder whether the Minister realizes the extent to which the waters throughout South Africa become seriously polluted as the result of dipping tanks existing on the banks of rivers or very close to water sources? Those dipping tanks contain some of the most deadly poison that we have in this country. Does he realize that these border industries that are being established have to discharge their effluent into perennial rivers on the borders, and that they are doing it in fact? I need hardly remind the Minister that one of the more recently established factories is going to discharge 5,000,000 gallons of effluent a day into the Nahoon River, and there are serious complaints about what is taking place there. Will not the Minister tackle this question of pollution in the proper way? And what about the lower riparian owners? How are they affected?</p>

<p><span class="col_1021-1022" refersTo="page_0525"/>There is another point, on the last leg of the motion, and that is that the Minister is aware of the fact that the Okavango River loses the bulk of its waters between Lake Ngami and before it gets to Makarikari. Sir, that represents a volume of water&#x2014;and I am quoting a figure which was given to me many years ago&#x2014;of 52,000,000,000 cusecs of water per day, which is an enormous quantity of water. Sir, has the Minister investigated what effect that would have on our waters in the southern reaches in the Republic? Surely if that water disappears in the sands of the desert there it is going somewhere. Is that not one of the biggest courses of our subterranean waters in the Republic of South Africa? Has the hon. the Minister investigated that particular aspect of it? We know from experience or from information that we have received that certain of those waters are discharged on to the west coast, but I think it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that that water is not all being discharged there; that it is part of the subterranean waters which are feeding the Republic of South Africa. Those are matters which I think require attention and I think the hon. the Minister could well apply his mind to them. But I am going to ask the hon. the Minister for two things now: I want to ask him to exercise his mind on this question of deprivation of those owners of land below where the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration is claiming this land in the water-sheds, in the dense forest areas, in the mountains where he will destroy sponges and springs. Those matters require attention. The second one is this question of pollution, not only by effluents from industry but by the poisons that are taken out of dipping tanks, by the waters that are thrown out and must find their way on to the streams.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to refer to a question which I have raised here before, and that is the development of those schemes where you have heavy rainfall; there it is possible to store large quantities of water at the very lowest cost in this country. I indicated to the Minister on one occasion that it would be possible to build 20 weirs in one of those rivers at a cost of R2,000 per weir, to store not less than 100,000,000 gallons of water in each of those weirs. Does the hon. the Minister realize what that would mean to that part of the country? I am sorry that the Minister was not able to go down and see what is happening down there. One of the people employing one of those weirs is producing no less than 25,000 bales of lucerne per annum, not for sale but for the maintenance of his stock. I make an urgent plea to the Minister because that section between the Fish River and the Zululand border has perennial streams that can be harnessed for the benefit of this country, and I would ask the hon. the Minister to apply his mind to that particular part of the country while he is helping other parts of the country with enormous amounts of money.</p>

<p>It is true that this is a very important subject that we are discussing here. It is a subject which should not be dragged into the political arena. What is being asked for in this motion is definitely in the interests of the country as a whole, and I think therefore that we should leave aside the political aspect and see what is in the interests of the people of South Africa. We know that water is worth more to us than gold. We know that gold is a wasting asset, but the whole of our future development in South Africa will depend on water. Let us all put our heads together therefore and co-operate and let us keep politics out of this matter. The motion of my hon. friend sitting next to me was moved in that spirit. I am sorry that a certain amount of politics has again been dragged into this debate. I am also sorry that my hon. friend over there (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), who is a very good farmer and who served with me at that time on the commission, discussed the 1956 Act here in the spirit in which he did. The Act of 1956 is probably one of the best measures ever placed on the Statute Book in South Africa. It is as a result of that Act that we have this enormous development to-day. The hon. member agreed with me that the waters which fall in South Africa must be under the control of the State so that the State can harness those waters in the best way in the interests of the country. If we had not had the 1956 Act we would not have been able to tackle the Orange River scheme to-day. Under the old Act it would not have been possible. It was Advocate Strydom who introduced that Act in 1956 with a view to the implementation of the Orange River scheme at some future date. Before the passing of the 1956 Act, as hon. members will remember, water could not be taken from one catchment area to another without passing a special Act of Parliament. I know that my hon. friend over there helped to get that Act on the Statute Book but he must not come along now with motions of no confidence right at the start of this enormous development. I am sorry that he did so and that he attacked the Government and the Department here. Sir, one is amazed when one thinks of the miracles which have been achieved by this Department since 1956, with a small staff, in order to make this huge Orange River scheme possible. Even a person like Mr. Shand, one of our great experts, says that he does not know how on earth they managed to do it. It is said that this scheme is based on statistics collected in the past, and to a certain extent that is true. But this scheme, one of the biggest schemes in the world, was drawn up by our engineers in a short space of time and I want to give them all the credit which is due to them. I also want to give credit to our Minister of Water Affairs for the wonderful work which has been done hitherto.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to pursue this matter because I want to talk about our subterranean waters. Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that our water table has dropped considerably. I recall <span class="col_1023-1024" refersTo="page_0526"/>that in 1934 I was sent by the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board to investigate the conditions in the north-west. In those days one could still get water there at a depth of 60 to 100 feet, and in those same areas to-day one has to drill 200 to 500 feet before one strikes water. This only goes to prove that we are depleting the waters which have been building up for centuries behind natural barriers. And if you go into the history of North Africa you will see that the same thing was done there, and eventually the whole country changed into a desert. If we do not utilize all the waters which fall in South Africa then parts of our country will also change into a desert. I hope the time will come when we will no longer allow any water at all to flow away into the sea. I hope that the fine waters which we get in Natal will be preserved for future generations. If those waters are preserved they will stimulate our subterranean waters. Now that we are building more dams in the hinterland we will also get a higher rainfall as a result of the evaporation which will take place there, and these dams in turn will also stimulate our subterranean waters. With modern pumping installations it will be possible to pump water out of these dams to the dry parts, thus supplementing the subterranean waters in those areas. I am thinking of areas such as the north-west, for example. I feel that some of the water which is pumped out of the Orange River should be pumped back again into the Kalahari and other areas which are very dry. After all, one cannot farm without water and the greatest asset which a stock farmer can have is water on his farm and camps on his farm to preserve his veld. Here I want to say that the Government has done extremely good work with its erosion schemes. On the Springbok Flats, e. g. where the water table was about 35 feet it has been raised by large erosion works by as much as eight or ten feet. We admit that it is very difficult to pump water into the mountainous regions, but once we have stronger waters in the valleys again it will be possible to pump up that water to the mountainous regions. As I have said, the Government has already done a great deal to combat erosion, but there are still certain parts of our country where there is a great deal of erosion taking place. There are many areas in which the people are not looking after their veld. There are thousands of farmers, however, who have in fact made use of the various schemes introduced by the Government. Just think what has been done by the Government to supplement our water supplies in the Eastern Province. A start has already been made with the building of a tunnel from the Verwoerd Dam to the Fish River, a tunnel of 51 miles which will cost about R28,000,000. With the construction of the tunnel, roads have to be built, of course; camps have to be laid out and medical services have to be provided. Let us give the Government credit therefore for the wonderful work which is being done there, and let us also give our engineers the credit which is due to them for the excellent work which they are doing there. We must not only criticize; we must also be grateful for what the Government is doing in the interests of our farmers. The Government cannot complete all these works within the space of a year or two; it can only be done over a period of years. I want to say to the Department of Irrigation that we in our part of the country are very, very satisfied. In those areas there is a future to-day for farmers who formerly had no future there. Sir, I predict that the Karoo will flourish again when this vast Orange River scheme comes into operation. Moreover, it will also put a stop to the depopulation of the platteland. Sir, we often talk about the depopulation of the platteland, but I just want to refer to the Tennessee Valley and what happened there. I had the honour of spending seven days there with the Tennessee Valley Authorities. That scheme is nothing less than a miracle, but I feel that our scheme in South Africa, the Orange River scheme, is a much bigger, more extensive scheme than even the Tennessee Valley scheme. Whereas formerly the three provinces in the Tennessee Valley were the poorest provinces in the United States, they are to-day the three richest states. But there is one thing that we must not forget. The farmer himself cannot bear all the costs connected with this scheme. He will be assisted through the power stations which are going to be erected along the Orange River&#x2014;and there will be no fewer than 20 power stations&#x2014;but we must remember that the industries which will come into being as a result of the implementation of this scheme will also make their contribution because they will also be supplied with power from these power stations.</p>

<p>Then I want to say to the Minister that we are very glad that the walls of both the Van der Kloof Dam and the Verwoerd Dam are going to be raised by 60 feet. I predict that the whole of the Eastern Province and the whole of the Northern Karoo are going to be changed into Tennessee Valleys as a result of the Orange River scheme.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very perturbed about our water table as a whole, in spite of what has already been done and is still being done to raise our water table. I feel that this is a matter that we shall have to watch very carefully and that more and more we shall have to follow the system which is being applied in Australia, where water out of their big rivers is pumped over long distances into the hinterland. I notice that a pipeline of 1,500 miles is now being laid to carry water to areas which have hitherto been lying fallow, and if that is possible in Australia then it is surely possible in this country.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say once again that I am sorry that my old friend, the hon. member for South Coast, has practically come along here with a motion of no confidence. I hope he will withdraw it.</p>

<from><span class="col_1025-1026" refersTo="page_0527"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I have no argument with the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) who introduced this motion, but I think that contrary to the opinion expressed by the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) the Minister has got off, very, very lightly up to now in this debate. I would say that the very presence of this motion on the Order Paper in the name of a senior member of the Government is an indictment of the Minister and of his failure to carry out the powers and the charges given to him with the passing of the Water Act of 1956. You see, Sir, in this motion there is not one aspect that is not provided for in the Water Act. As the hon. member for Cradock has said the Water Act is a very good Act. A select Committee sat on that Act for some three years and I believe that they put on the Statute Book a law which gave the Minister every power necessary to carry out what was intended and to do the things which his own Government asked for in that Act. The present Government wanted a Water Act which was comprehensive and they have one, Sir, but what has been done? I believe that comparatively little has been done. The hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) indicated that the hon. member for Natal South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), who I think made a very good contribution here this afternoon, did not understand the motion. I should say that if anybody did not understand the motion it was possibly the hon. member for Soutpansberg who did not speak to the motion at all, so I shall not take up any further time in trying to deal with the subject which he raised.</p>

<p>Sir, why am I critical of the Minister&#x2019;s administration? The hon. member for Cradock gets up here and starts to talk about the Orange River Scheme and all that has been done. I know just as everybody else in this House does that lots of things have been done. But may I remind the hon. member for Cradock that the Orange River scheme has come in spite of this hon. Minister, not because of him. Is the hon. member&#x2019;s memory so short that he cannot remember the speech made by this hon. Minister in the Other Place in 1959? Well, this hon. Minister belittled the man who originally thought of this Orange River scheme, Sen. Conroy. How many times has that hon. member sat in this House and listened to this hon. Minister telling the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) that he did not have a hope of getting the Orange River scheme? Now he stands up in this House and thanks the Minister for the Orange River scheme.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I did not interject when the hon. member was talking; let me have my chance now. Let me tell the hon. member that the Orange River scheme came in spite of this Minister and the decision was taken far above his head. I do not believe that basically the decision was taken to help the farmer; it was to try to stimulate the economy which his Government had jeopardized because of their policy of isolation, and they had to try to stimulate it. I believe that that is a generally accepted fact. Now, Sir, why can I say that this Minister has failed? I want to deal particularly with one aspect and that is the question of the pollution of water. A lot has been said about the preservation of water. Our amendment sets out quite clearly what our thinking is. But let me give you a few examples, Sir, and ask this hon. Minister what he has done about control of the pollution of our water? It is all very well having all these ideas for increasing the quantity of water we have, conserving what we have and using it to the best advantage. That is all very well if the water is fit to use when you have it. But this hon. Minister has taken few steps in the way of seeing to that. At one stage I thought that the hon. member for South Coast and I were the only two who needed to fight about it because it was only our oceans that were being polluted. But, Sir, if you take a trip through this wonderful country of ours and take particular note of the rivers and water supplies, I doubt if you will find many that are not polluted either by mud or clay, in many cases through ploughing too close to the river. If you go to the country towns more especially and many of the bigger ones too, you will find that there is a lack of proper sewage treatment plants. You will find that the river is used as the most convenient spot to dump everything that is unwanted by a city. You will find industries established and just pumping their effluents into the rivers, thus spoiling the water for future use. Sir, it is all very well to say that it does not matter if the water is dirty or not; you can use it for irrigation and its like. Just this last week-end I went down to Ceres. I had always thought that the people in the Cape were very lucky because their rivers appeared to be so clean and free from effluent. And what did I see there? I saw the processing house for the farmers&#x2014;fruit crops in a place like Ceres, a beautiful place like that, and I heard their complaints because their own packhouse is polluting the water, so that when they used it for irrigation the rotting fruit that is discharged with the effluent spread on their lands and attracts insects to harm their crop, insects which would not otherwise come into the area. But for these insects they would be saved very much in spraying costs and their crop would be far, far better. I am glad to see that the hon. member for Ceres is sitting here, because he probably knows more about the Water Act than the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, there is not only this particular aspect. The aspect of industrial euents has been mentioned here by the mover of this motion, <span class="col_1027-1028" refersTo="page_0528"/>and rightly so. This is a great problem and what has the hon. the Minister done about it? What happened when we went to make inquiries as to why a permit to discharge effluents into one of our rivers had been granted to a certain industry which was of a noxious type? This Minister&#x2019;s Department gave us the answer. It said, &#x201C;The Department of Commerce and Industries asked us for a permit so we gave it to them. &#x201D; They had made no investigation into the possible harm that might be done by the discharge of that effluent. Sir, one can go on and on giving examples. One of the finest ones, I think, is the fact that although this Act was promulgated in 1956 and this Minister has adequate powers for controlling pollution under this Act, in terms of Sections 21 to 26, what he had to do to make that portion of the Act work was to publish standards for the purity of e&#xFB04;uent that was redischarged into rivers and the like. And, Sir, when did he publish them? He published them some three or four days before his Vote came up in 1961. It took him six years just to lay down standards for industrial effluent. If this is the way in which this hon. Minister and his Government are going to administer this Act, which we all accept is a good act&#x2014;I have no quarrel with this Act; I think it is a very fine Act indeed&#x2014;if this is the way in which he is going to administer the control of pollution of our precious water, if he is exercising the same lack of control of our water which has induced the hon. member for Christiana to come to this House with a motion such as he has come to-day, then I believe we are in a sorry state, and I believe that a very much stronger motion than that of the hon. member for Christiana is necessary. But I realize that he has to be diplomatic. I believe that he is in an awkward position and I believe that in his heart of hearts he would far sooner vote for our amendment than he would for his own motion.</p>

<p>Sir, I have to end and I have to end on this note, that I have no confidence whatsoever in the ability of this hon. Minister to achieve the aims and the objects which are sought by the hon. member for Christiana in his motion to-day. I have seen no indications of his ability to carry out the terms of this Act, and at the moment I would say that unless some revolutionary process takes place in that particular Department, the waters of our country are going to remain in a very sorry state.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased to have the opportunity, in the few minutes at my disposal, of making my voice heard in this debate which I regard as one of the most important that we can have in this House. I want to congratulate the mover of this motion on the fine way in which and the level at which he dealt with this important matter. I want to give it my support.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself more particularly to our subterranean water and the importance and urgency of having a proper survey made of this water. I do not think that we can say today with any degree of certainty how much subterranean water we have. We only know that we do not have the large supplies of subterranean water which have already been found in other parts of the world. That being the position it is of the most vital importance for us to make an immediate study of this matter and to undertake the necessary research. Much has already been said and written about it. I have a book here, for example, in which they refer to a scientific conference that was held as far back as 1949 in Johannesburg to deal with the problem as it manifested itself at that stage throughout the whole of Africa. Because I am pressed for time. I shall not be able to quote from this book, Mr. Speaker, but in the book they tell us that even at that time it was regarded as urgently necessary to undertake a proper study of our subterranean waters.</p>

<p>The farmers in my constituency are continuously drilling for water. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department makes drilling machines available to them. They are good machines and the men operating them are well trained and they are doing excellent work. But the difficulty is that the farmers do not know where to drill for water. There are no technologists who can give them guidance. We do not have trained men for this work and that is what I want to plead for this afternoon. We must cross that bridge. The fact that we are spending millions of rand to supply our farmers with water makes it imperative for us to have those men. We must train them speedily. I want to make a most urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister to ensure that in the future our farmers will not have to fall back on the water diviner to tell them where they should drill. The farmers who drill at the spots indicated by the divining rod are only taking a chance and nothing else is available to them. We know that scientists, if we have them, can tell us where to find water. That is why I want to confine my plea to a request to the hon. the Minister to ensure, apart from everything that he has done in the past&#x2014;and it has been nothing but good&#x2014;that when he provides the farmers with drills, the necessary technicians will be available to advise the farmers where to drill with the greatest chance of success.</p>

<p>My constituency, and perhaps that of the hon. member for Kuruman (Mr. du Plessis), is probably one of the most difficult in our country as far as drilling for water is concerned. I know that the hon. the Minister has people investigating the question of the desalination of water which is a very great problem in those parts. But I also want to ask him whether we cannot go a step further and obtain a proper report from people who can give us such a report, after investigation, in connection with the possibility of using pipes to lead water to those parts where the water is so polluted that <span class="col_1029-1030" refersTo="page_0529"/>it can hardly be used for stock instead of draining off the subterranean water which is available in that area from places where it is already serving as drinking water for stock. I do not have any knowledge of this matter but I have discussed the question with scientists and they have assured me that the amount of water required to supply drinking water for stock will be a mere bagatelle in comparison with the amount of water required for irrigation. The town of Vryburg is already receiving its water from Vaalharts. Can that water not be led further to the Molopo area where that pollution takes place? It is all downhill. If the water can be taken to a certain point, it will flow further by gravitation. I am assured by scientists that the water that we will need for that area which is so poorly endowed with natural subterranean water will be a mere bagatelle in comparison with the amount of water required for irrigation purposes. This does not appear to be impossible therefore. I think it will perhaps be more practicable to take water from the Orange River to supply the needs of the waterless area of Kuruman. The water from Vaalharts has already been taken as far as Vryburg and it is just a question of taking it further. If we can save the millions of rand spent each year by the State in an effort to drill for water, it may be a very good investment to lead the water which is so essential for man and beast through to those parts where it is required. The water-tanks and subterranean water in that area will then not become exhausted from time to time with the result that new boreholes have to be drilled.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, conditions in that part of the world are such that I do not think I should take up the time of the House unnecessarily in trying to prove the seriousness of the position. I want to assure the hon. the Minister that I appreciate what he is doing, but I rise to try to make South Africa aware of the&#x2014;I could almost say&#x2014;great drama that will be enacted if we do not take note of the signs of the times and if we do not make it our business to provide for the future. We must not reach the stage where we will have to leave large areas of our country uninhabited because we will have no more water there.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon, member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) who was responsible for this motion and for the discussion this afternoon, for the way in which he put his case, constructively and in a stimulating way. I am very sorry that I cannot say the same for the contribution that we have had from the other side of the House. The amendment that was moved by a front-bencher on that side, and a prominent front-bencher there, rejects this motion because the Government, meaning the Minister and his Department, have completely failed to give effect to the powers which they have under the Water Act. The hon. member has not produced one single shred of proof to show where we have failed to give effect to those powers. He simply moved the amendment because he interpreted the wording of the motion of the hon. member for Christiana as being an attack upon the Government. Well, one can always read something and interpret it as one wants to interpret it.</p>

<p>I am very pleased that the hon. member for Christiana has introduced this motion. I do not want to get away from the motion as so many of the other speakers have done. This motion asks for certain things to be done&#x2014;that the Government should make surveys in respect, firstly, of our available surface and subterranean water resources. By his motion the hon. member for Christiana has given me the opportunity to tell the House and the country that what he is asking us to do can only mean, in my opinion, that we must continue doing what we have been doing for so many years. In regard to surveys as far as surface water is concerned, there is hardly one single important river in our country of any economic importance worth mentioning in regard to which the Department cannot draw conclusions as far as the flow of those rivers is concerned either directly by way of surveys or by way of a correlation of the information that it has. These surveys will be very nearly correct, if not completely correct.</p>

<p>This division was brought into being before I became Minister of Water Affairs. It was brought into being towards the end of the period of service &#x201C;of my predecessor, now the hon. the Minister of Lands. A few years&#x201D; ago we brought a special Division of Hydrological Research into being in the Department. When one establishes a division in a Department it does of necessity take some time before that division gets into its stride. But that does not mean to say that it has only been since that division was established that a start has been made on surveys and the collection of data in respect of the flow of our rivers and of our available water resources. There are certain rivers in our country in connection with which we have information that was collected even before the establishment of Union, information that has been collected over the years. For example, we have to-day no fewer than 88 major State water schemes&#x2014;they form probably our best survey stations because all the water that flows down is taken into consideration&#x2014;where we make regular surveys of the flow of rivers; the amount of surplus water, the average flow per annum and so forth. Besides this there are nearly 500 separate survey stations in various parts of the country and distributed throughout the country at places where we think it is necessary to have these surveys made. When one sets up these survey stations throughout the Republic, one is able by means of the information that one collects <span class="col_1031-1032" refersTo="page_0530"/>and having regard to the rainfall figures and other climatic factors and vegetation, to work out reasonably accurately the flow of the rivers in which those survey stations stand. The Department has so much information dealing with the average flow of rivers per annum that I think we will not be far out if we estimate that the total surface flow of water in the rivers of South Africa is about 18,100,000 morgen feet. Of the 18,100,000 morgen feet of water that we estimate is available in our rivers, we will&#x2014;when the large dams, the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam, the Van der Kloof Dam and the Pongola Dam are finished&#x2014;be able to conserve more than twice as much as we are storing to-day in State dams and irrigation board schemes&#x2014;about 15,000,000 morgen feet of water. We are using about 2,000,000 gallons per day and we will then have conserved about one-third of the total available quantity of water in South Africa. Besides what we are doing within the Republic we have no fewer than 16 survey stations beyond the Republic&#x2019;s borders which we maintain in our neighbouring States by means of consultation and negotiation and from which we also collect information which is of importance to South Africa and to the future of the Republic.</p>

<p>As far as our subterranean water is concerned this same division of the Department has been engaged for a number of years in determining from the hundreds of water holes that have been sunk and that exist in certain parts of the country not only the amount of water available underground but also the effect of the withdrawal of water from these boreholes, the effect of rainfall on that subterranean water and the effect of boring in dry seasons, better seasons and very poor seasons. Recently we have also been making studies of and performing experiments in regard to the manner in which we can supplement that water, the effect of certain conservation works that we have on the surface which enables us to conserve water and the effect of all of these things on our underground flow. The fact is that whether the water is surface water or subterranean water, all the water that we have originally came from above. Our water supplies in this country, limited though they may be, are undoubtedly one of the most important natural resources that we have and may perhaps be the determining factor which may eventually control development in South Africa and the size of her population.</p>

<p>I just want to say that although we are making these surveys and are aware of the flow of the rivers, we are not yet anywhere near the stage of being able to harness and use all the available water in an effective and productive way. It is true that we have made a great deal of progress, particularly when we consider the size of our population, our limited manpower and the fact that it is virtually only the State that makes any contribution worth mentioning towards the conservation of water in South Africa. We must also consider the efforts that we are making to make better use of our water and to try to keep pace with the economic development of our country in general. This is something of which we can be proud. When we consider all these things, I think that the Republic of South Africa compares favourably with other countries where comparable circumstances prevail. Besides this we must remember that the number of our taxpayers and also the number of people who have the required knowledge is extremely limited. I think that with a view to all these things we need not stand back at all for any other country in the world. In 1956 I was in the United States and amongst other things I said&#x2014;and I want to repeat it to-day&#x201D;that it could not be denied that comparing the taxpayers of the United States of America with the taxpayers in the Republic of South Africa, on a per capita basis we had spent more on water conservation in the Republic than they had in the mighty United States of America. So we have not stayed behind in doing what we have been able to do as the need has arisen and as it has become necessary for us to make the best possible use of our water resources.</p>

<p>We have been asked to use scientific methods and to have research done into the manner in which we can possibly supplement these water resources. &#x201C;Supplementation&#x201D; is perhaps not the correct word. Let me put it this way: How can we best conserve and use it both for the present and for the future? It is said that the Department of Water Affairs is the only body responsible for this work in terms of the Act; that it is the supreme authority as far as water in our country is concerned and for this reason all these matters are its responsibility. But we must not lose sight of the fact that we cannot separate water from the land and that there are other State Departments which in their turn are responsible for other activities in which water is also of great importance. I mention the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, the Department of Forestry and also the Department of Lands which has control over State land in our mountains and our catchment areas. Research is being done by the Department of Forestry in regard to the effect of afforestation on certain catchment areas. The question of fire prevention on our mountains is a function which falls under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Fire prevention, or controlled burning, if necessary for the development of agriculture, is also of the most vital importance. What effect does this have on our surface water as far as the flow of our rivers is concerned? These are all matters which require study and research. Just as we have to make a study of our subterranean water resources, so research is also necessary in connection with the factors that I have just mentioned. It takes many years before one can make deductions and say that this or that has been the effect. That is why I welcome the fact that the hon. members for Christiana and South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) have spoken so objectively. The hon. member for South Coast only acted <span class="col_1033-1034" refersTo="page_0531"/>in a negative fashion when he moved his amendment. For the rest his whole speech was constructive. I am overjoyed that they emphasize the fact that we should not cut down but that we should do a great deal more. I just want to give the House the assurance that what is being done is also being done by the other departments in the closest co-operation with the Department of Water Affairs. Not only do we exchange knowledge but we also have regular discussions in regard to our various findings; how the various departments that have to deal with our water resources, both on the surface and below ground, derive benefit from this experience and how the departments can obtain the best information jointly and correlate it and make it available to the public. I agree with the hon. member for South Coast who has said that the whole of the public in South Africa has over the past year become far more water-conscious and water conservation-conscious than was the case a number of years ago, just as the public have become more soil-conscious. I think that our nation grows older and as we all eventually realize that this is our homeland and that this is our country, not only for our generation but also for our children and their descendants and their descendants, we become necessarily more attached to our land and we give more thought to those who will make use of the land after us. As the late Dr. Malan said, it is not given to one single generation to do everything for a nation but this does not mean that the present generation should not do the things that need doing and give its attention to those things which are perhaps to form the foundation of future building work.</p>

<p>I also want to say here that this hydrological division of ours has not only led us to collect information, but also to make that information available to the public so that the public can utilize that information that we have. I think I shall convey the suggestion of the hon. member, which I appreciate, to the Department&#x2014;that we must try to impart the scientific data and the statistical information to the public in a more attractive manner so as to stimulate their interest. But we are living in a time when if something is not sensational, when it is too positive and not sufficiently negative, it appears as though our present generation and our Press are inclined to say to a large extent that it is not worth reading, that it has no news value, that it is not sufficiently interesting. Perhaps we can improve the relationship between our Department and the public Press and concentrate more upon persuading the Press to publish information in the interests of the country.</p>

<p>I may just say that as far as subterranean water is concerned we have three areas that have been declared State controlled areas. We have the Uitenhage sub-artesian area, the area at Kroondal which was recently proclaimed, the Markiana area, and thirdly, the upper Molopo area. We can proclaim that area under the Water Act because we have discovered that we have sufficient information available in regard to the subterranean water supplies in that particular area. Otherwise of course, one would make a mistake by summarily proclaiming all the subterranean water in the whole country as falling within a controlled area because one would then have to issue withdrawal permits and so forth and one would not know sufficient about it. The hon. member for South Coast asked whether the Department of Water Affairs had an adequate staff. My information is that in our country to-day we have more than 250,000 civil servants, that is, in all departments. This means that a quarter of a million out of a population of about 3,500,000 Whites are in the service of the State. There are people who ask whether we are not already overloaded as far as public servants are concerned. As far as scientists and technologists are concerned we have the necessary technical staff who are needed in certain technical departments just as is the case in the private sector. Up to the present, as far as our geological surveys are concerned, we have been more dependent upon the geological survey division of the Department of Mines, although I am sure that they have concentrated more on the geological work of the discovery and mining of and prospecting for our mineral riches below the ground than they have upon the question of our water resources. We are trying to obtain more scientists. We have succeeded, by means of an inspection carried out by the Public Service Commission into the requirements of my Department, in increasing our staff. Fortunately we have been granted a considerable number of extra posts. As far as engineers are concerned I may just say that one does need them in planning these things. Of course, as the country develops, higher salaries than the State can afford are offered to them by private companies, and because of this fact some of our best people have been taken from us. New departments have also come into being. Development work is being done in the Bantu homelands and the Department of Bantu Administration does not always have the necessary staff available. They sometimes appeal to other Departments and if posts are advertised, some of our people may accept those posts. I may just say that I have received permission from the Cabinet to send two persons abroad to recruit engineers. Not only do we want young engineers without experience but we also want people with experience whom we can use immediately. Just before I left Pretoria I had the privilege of meeting personally 45 new engineers who have already arrived in South Africa and who are now under contract with the Department of Water Affairs. I met them at our head office. I was introduced to them and welcomed them to South Africa. Things are not going so badly. We do not have sufficient staff to enable us to do everything as quickly as we want to do it but I think I can say that we do not have so few that we cannot do what we ought to do, even though it may not be done as swiftly as the public would like it to be done.</p>

<p><span class="col_1035-1036" refersTo="page_0532"/>I just want to say that in regard to the two other matters that were mentioned in the motion, one of which was evaporation, we have the hydrological research division which is giving serious attention to the elimination of losses caused by evaporation. We have already tried various methods to see whether we cannot reduce the rate of evaporation by the use of certain chemicals in our dams. This has apparently not been successful. I do not think there is a country in the world that has as yet overcome this problem.</p>

<p>As far as water pollution is concerned I must say that particularly since we amended this Act which no longer makes it necessary to lay down a union standard, but makes provision for various standards to be laid down in regard to factories where pollution takes place, we have now set up a full division within the Department which concentrates solely on the problem of water pollution. I want to give the hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) the assurance that we do issue temporary permits but that we do not do so arbitrarily because we are indifferent to the pollution that is taking place. But we are sometimes compelled to issue temporary permits in the general interest of the economy of the country and sometimes we have to extend the validity of the permits to cover those problem cases in which proof is shown that the general purification standards that we have laid down for that region or area should not be applied to a particular organization but that that organization should be given an opportunity to take steps to improve its position. In the case of one factory we simply said after long discussions that we could no longer issue a permit or extend the temporary permit. This resulted in the factory closing down. It was a factory that was of considerable economic importance. But taking everything into consideration, we felt that this was the right decision to take. Accordingly I want to give the hon. member the assurance that the Department is anxious to carry out the provisions of the 1956 Act to the best of its ability and in such a way that one will always be able to ask oneself what is in the best interest of South Africa. Nobody wants a Department, which has as much power as the Department of Water Affairs, whose activities are so comprehensive and are steadily becoming more involved, to use those powers injudiciously. We will act as judiciously as possible but we will not be so careful as to neglect to do what must be done.</p>

<p>May I ask a question before the hon. the Minister resumes his seat? Reports recently appeared in the Press of an inexhaustible source of water that was discovered near Oudtshoorn&#x2014;a subterranean lake, or so it was called. Has a geological survey been made of that lake and is the hon. the Minister prepared to make geologists available to do research in order to discover whether we do not have more subterranean lakes in our country?</p>

<p>In the few minutes left it is difficult to answer the hon. the Minister. He started off by explaining some things which had been cursorily put to him, but towards the end he did make some effort to answer the questions of the hon. members for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) and Umlazi (Mr. Lewis), whose constituencies are mostly affected by this motion. But to my mind he failed completely to appreciate that water is not only pure or purified, but water is a living structure, and that it is not so much geologists and engineers that he needs. I tremble to think that he failed to appreciate the words of the hon. member for South Coast, who pointed out the importance of the ecologists and the botanists, etc. in regard to this matter. He seemed to answer only the question of water conservation, and not of quality conservation. He failed to realize the importance of the establishment of two atomic energy stations in the country, stations which will have radioactive waste to dispose of. He has failed to appreciate the importance of oil in the destruction of water supplies and the damage it does, and he has failed to appreciate the importance of fish. He takes no notice of the life of the rivers and he does not appreciate that it is more than bricks and mortar and concrete that need to be attended to; it is the life in the water, and this is being destroyed both by sewage and by industry. It has not been found possible yet to lay down a standard for effluent. Each effluent must be studied on its own in the environment into which it will flow. It is not enough to say that there must not be more than so much organic matter, or that there must not be more than a certain degree of dust. Each effluent has to be considered by a group of scientists, as was suggested by the hon. member for South Coast, and I think that is one matter which has failed to penetrate the understanding of the hon. the Minister, namely that he has much more to do than to conserve water. He has to do more than keep it pure; he has to keep it alive, and unfortunately the scientific tests for this have not yet been fully worked out.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Finance, upon which an amendment had been moved by Mr. Waterson, adjourned on 7 February, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to give any general survey of our economic position in South Africa this afternoon. The time for that will arrive later. In any case, so much has already been said about the prosperous state in which we have found ourselves in recent years and months that it is surely unnecessary for me to say much about it. I should rather like to concentrate on the financial points raised during this debate. In passing, I just want to say that the debate itself was much more lively and more interesting than in previous years. It was also more to the point. Hon. members were able to concentrate on one or two definite points they wanted to make instead of, as so often happens in a debate of this nature, covering the whole field, and doing so very superficially. There are, of course, exceptions. I am thinking of the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), who is not here at the moment. He reminded me of a schoolboy who goes to shoot springbok with a shotgun. He tries to shoot the lot with one shot. With his political shotgun he has now tried to hit all the points of policy of the Government in one shot, but what he did was to raise his political shotgun, close his eyes and fire a random shot; then he softly muttered to himself&#x2014;that is, if he is able to mutter softly&#x2014;&#x201C;Grant that I may hit the target&#x201D;. The field he covered was infinitely wide. I wanted to say that it was as wide as the plains of South Africa, but I think it is as fitting to say it was just as broad as the hon. member&#x2019;s physical build. My hon. friend has now entered the Chamber. Fortunately hon. members like him are becoming fewer every day. I think the new rules and the experience they will gain under those rules will discourage them from trying to cover such a wide field in the time at their disposal.</p>

<p>In so far as the financial debate is concerned, there are also gratifying signs, in comparison with previous years. I am thinking particularly of the changed attitude we saw on the part of the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson)&#x2014;perhaps not on the part of the whole of the United Party, but at least on his part. He, we can say this year, has to some extent seen the light. He is now at least prepared to concede that there is something good in the South African economy. Just here and there in his speech the old Adam&#x2014;or should I say the old Jeremiah&#x2014;still showed himself, but in general he revealed a gratifying realism. I shall reply specifically to the points raised by the hon. member, firstly because they are good points which merit reply, but secondly I want to deal with them specifically because I want to rejoice, together with him, because of this political conversion to which he has been brought during this last year. Unfortunately his mantle very soon fell on willing shoulders. The role which he has now abandoned was all too readily taken up, particularly by another member of the Opposition. The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) is now the chief prophet; he is now the prima donna, or should I say the &#x201C;primus don&#x201D;, in the choir of those who always want to belittle South Africa&#x2019;s economy. I want to concede that he played his role with particular energy and assiduity. He reminded me of the advocate who made the following note for his speech: &#x201C;When you deal with this point, shout loudly; point particularly weak. &#x201D; That also applies to the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. In spite of that, we had the unfortunate phenomenon that the speech of the hon. member for Florida drew more applause than that of any other member of the Opposition, and he received more congratulations than any other member opposite. To me that is a sad phenomenon.</p>

<p>I just want to make two quotations from his speech, because they are typical of his whole speech. He said in the first place that the South African economy on the surface appeared very good, but that inherently it was very weak. That remark of his was loudly applauded by hon. members opposite. Let me just pause to deal for a moment with that remark of his that our economy is inherently weak. I want to ask that hon. member and other hon. members opposite this question: Is it possible for an economy which is inherently weak to reveal this surprising growth over the past 15 years which has been revealed by our economy, in spite of threats of boycotts and sanctions? In spite of all that, our economy is so sound that the hon. member for Constantia to-day had to admit that it was sound. Is it possible for our economy to be so inherently weak when it could so successfully overcome the shock of our leaving the Commonwealth? Can our economy be so weak when we have these great natural resources available to us, and when we take into consideration the surprising diversity in our economy? Our economy to-day is almost a source of envy in many countries of the world, but the hon. member says it is inherently weak. Can our economy be so inherently weak when we have this excellent managerial talent that we have in South Africa to-day? Is it inherently weak when we have this outstanding manpower in South Africa? To say under those circumstances, with these natural resources, and with our manpower and all the managerial talent we have, that our economy is inherently weak amounts to no less than an <span class="col_1039-1040" refersTo="page_0534"/>insult to our managerial talent and the manpower of South Africa.</p>

<p>What was his second remark? He said: &#x201C;Other countries&#x201D;the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Common Market, Canada, Australia and some American states&#x2014;are enjoying a buoyancy certainly not less than our buoyancy and rate of progress in South Africa. &#x201D; That is what the hon. member said, and I just want to analyse it for a moment. The hon. member just made this bald statement without proving it. I just want to show hon. members what the increase in the gross national production was in 1962-3 in those countries mentioned by the hon. member, whose economy according to him is just as buoyant as ours, and then I want to compare it with ours. In the U. S A. there was an increase of 5. 7 per cent in the gross national production; in Belgium 3&#x00BD; per cent&#x2014;that is one of the countries of the Common Market&#x2014;in Germany 3.2 per cent, in France 4&#x00BD; per cent, in Italy 5&#x00BD; per cent, in Holland 3&#x00BD; per cent, in Norway 4 per cent to 4&#x00BD; per cent, in Sweden 4 per cent, in Britain 2&#x00BE; per cent, in Japan 9 per cent, in Australia, in 1961-2, the previous year, 1 per cent, and in Canada (also for the previous year) 8 per cent. These figures appeared in the Economist of December 1963. They did not even dare to give the figures of growth for the South American states. The hon. member says here that our little economy is no better than that of any other country; that it is not even better than those of the South American countries.</p>

<p>I just want to give a few figures to show what price increases took place from December 1962 over a period of six to nine months. In the Argentine the price increase over nine months was 11 per cent, whereas over the same period in South Africa it was only 1. 2 per cent. In Brazil the price increase over seven months, i. e. to July, was 41 per cent. That must be much better than in our case, according to that hon. member&#x2019;s calculation! In Chile it was 28 per cent over eight months. In Uruguay it was 20 per cent over eight months. And then the hon. member comes here&#x2014;and his speech evoked the most applause from that side of the House&#x2014;and tells us that our economy is really no better than that of those other countries; that our rate of growth is no higher than that of those countries. Is the hon. member not ashamed of himself for having revealed such ignorance here? Is he not ashamed to make such unpatriotic statements here, statements which are devoid of all truth? It is not necessary for him to reveal his ignorance here. He dare not say such things. The Opposition reminds me so much of a flock of sheep. For a long time the hon. member for Constantia was infected, but when he was cured another member again contracted the disease&#x2014;just like a flock of sheep with scabies. When the one is cured the other is infected, and now it is the hon. member for Florida&#x2019;s turn to be infected.</p>

<p>I now want to proceed to deal with a few of the points raised by the hon. member for Constantia, and also other points raised by other hon. members of the Opposition. The first point made by the hon. member is this: He says, &#x201C;Yes, I admit that there is prosperity in the country, but this prosperity was delayed for 15 years. &#x201C; Let us analyse that statement. His words were: &#x201D;Why has it taken 15 years of Nationalist Government to produce a reasonable rate of growth?&#x201D; Here I have the annual increase in the gross national production from 1948. I am now going to give the House the percentage increase, year for year over the previous year, beginning with the year 1948-9. Then the gross national production was 9 per cent higher than in the previous year. Next year it was 15 per cent higher than in the previous year. In 1950-1 it was 10 per cent higher than in the previous year; in 1951-2 it was 10 per cent higher than in the previous year; in 1952-3 it was 14 per cent higher; in 1953-4 it was 8 per cent higher; the next year it was 7 per cent higher; the next year it was 9&#x00BD; per cent higher; in 1956-7 it was 6 per cent higher; in 1957-8 it was 3&#x00BD; per cent higher; in 1958-9 it was 6&#x00BD; per cent higher; the next year it was 7 per cent higher. In 1960-1 it was 4 per cent higher, and in 1961-2 it was 7 per cent higher, and for the 12 months to June 1963 it was 7&#x00BD; per cent higher than in the previous year. These are not figures I dug up from an unknown source; they are figures which the hon. member would have found if he had consulted the Quarterly Bulletin of Statistics of the Reserve Bank. It is no secret; it stands there. The hon. member says that it took all these years to show this prosperity. This prosperity has been there all these years. The position is simply that the hon. member for Constantia was not aware of it. Now his eyes have been opened, and he sees only the immediate, but still he cannot look back. Only in two years over the past 15 years was the rate of growth of our economy lower than 6 per cent. That is something of which we can be proud. There is no reason for saying that prosperity was delayed for 15 years. I think what is delayed is the political intelligence of the Opposition.</p>

<p>In the second place the hon. member discussed the reasons for the prosperity we are having this year. What did the hon. member for Florida say? He said: &#x201C;The prosperity of South Africa is not due to the policy of the Government. &#x201D; What does the hon. member for Constantia say? He was discussing various factors leading to the prosperity he now saw for the first time, and he mentioned five causes. The first he mentioned was the higher gold production. That is quite correct. We gave the mines a little encouragement during the past 15 years, but let us say that the higher gold production was not due to Government policy. The second factor he mentioned was increased State expenditure. That is the part played by the Government, in other words, Government policy. The third matter he mentioned was the P. A. Y. E. system and the tax holiday resulting from it, and the increased consumer expenditure which it made possible. He says <span class="col_1041-1042" refersTo="page_0535"/>that is one of the reasons for the prosperity we enjoy to-day. But, Sir, surely that is due to Government policy. This system of P. A. Y. E. did not just fall out of the sky. The fourth reason for the present prosperity mentioned by the hon. member is our better export markets. Yes, I give full credit to our manufacturers and producers who obtained export markets, but the hon. member should remember that the Government also definitely encouraged them by fiscal and other measures to expand their export markets. I think the Government should at least receive a large share of the credit for that. The last factor he mentioned was the greater confidence existing in South Africa. That can only be the result of Government policy. Confidence in South Africa, as he said here, is in fact the decisive factor; I accept that, but that confidence is due to the Government&#x2019;s fiscal policy, its economic policy, and particularly, I think, to the maintenance of law and order. Does the hon. member wish to intimate that there would have been greater confidence in South Africa if we had followed a policy similar to that of the other African states? The confidence in South Africa of the foreign investor is steadily increasing. Hon. members read in the Press the other day that the mighty international firm, Plessis, is now coming to South Africa and will invest more than R2,500,000 here. It wants to use South Africa as a stepping-stone for further expansion. That is the confidence foreign investors have in South Africa! They know what our policy is, but still they come here because they are not frightened away by that policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida says that the present prosperity was obtained in spite of Government policy. The hon. member for Constantia is quite correct: Three and a half of the five causes for it that he mentioned are directly attributable to Government policy. What do hon. members now think of the hon. member for Florida, who on that point is so directly contradicted by the hon. member for Constantia? There was a time when the hon. member for Constantia played the role which the hon. member for Florida played in this debate, but the hon. member for Constantia learnt from bitter experience that it was to no avail. To-day he probably still bears the scars of the various occasions on which he bumped his head against the hard facts, against the indisputable strength of our economy. The hon. member for Florida is still a comparatively young member, and I want to give him the assurance that if he continues along this course he is storing up trouble for himself. If he thinks that the people of South Africa will just put up with the sort of statements he makes here, he is very much mistaken.</p>

<p>But I think the hon. member for Constantia did not go far enough. These matters he mentioned are mostly due to Government policy, but there are quite a few things he did not even mention which also contributed greatly to the improved position in which we find ourselves to-day&#x2014;I may almost say to the glorious conditions, the prosperous conditions, which exist to-day. He made no mention of the fact that the higher expenditure incurred by the State was accompanied by lower rates of taxation. He made no mention of the fact that we collected on a percentage basis less in taxation than before, in spite of the larger amounts spent by the State. He made no mention of the tax concessions we made in the Budget only last year, in order to put more money into the pockets of the consumers and in that way to encourage consumer expenditure. He makes no mention of the decrease in personal income tax; he makes no mention of the 1 cent reduction in the tax on petrol. He makes no mention of the concessions to pensioners, which last year alone put approximately R5,000,000 in the pockets of the consumers. He makes no mention of the increased salaries in the Public Service and in the Railway Service, which also to a large extent were responsible for this surprising revival in the last six months.</p>

<p>The fourth point I want to mention is one which was not raised by the hon. member for Constantia, but it is a point which was mentioned by quite a few other members of the Opposition, namely that all sections of the population did not share in the prosperity which even the Opposition has to admit exists to-day. I am glad to say that this point was not raised by the hon. member for Constantia, but by the hon. members for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell), Maitland (Mr. Hickman) and the hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) (Mr. Oldfield), who all alleged that certain sections did not share this prosperity.</p>

<p>Just listen to what the hon. member for Pinetown says: &#x201C;What comfort is the boom to the old-age pensioner? Civil servants have no share in this boom. &#x201D; Mr. Speaker, can you imagine such ignorance? During the past two years the salaries of public servants and railway servants were increased by an amount of over R31,000,000. That process has not even been completed yet; there are still certain sections whose turn will come. What is the position of the pensioners? In the Budget last year an additional R4. 700,000 was voted for the pensioners, and in the five Budgets introduced by me an additional amount of over R18,000,000 was voted for pensioners. Then hon. members of the Opposition still say that the pensioners did not share in this prosperity. They do not even say that the pensioners had only a small share in the prosperity; no, they say that they had no share at all in it. Can one imagine a party with so little respect for the truth ever coming into power?</p>

<p>The hon. member is quite correct. The concessions made last year did not affect all pensioners. But the increases granted during the past five years affected everyone. I do not know whether the hon. member for Umbilo said it, but the hon. member for Pinetown said: &#x201C;What comfort is the boom to the old-age pensioner?&#x201D; If all of them did not share in the economic prosperity, then some of them shared in it last year. Over the last five years, however, they got an additional R18,000,000. Sir, the greatest threat to-day, the greatest danger of a one-party State in South Africa, comes from the Opposition. If we have such a weak Opposition, we are in real danger of automatically becoming a one-party State. I am surprised that those hon. members have not used that yet as an argument for getting into power! That is about the only argument they can use: Put us into power; then there will at all events be a strong Opposition.</p>

<p>I now want to come to a few specific points before dealing with the final point mentioned by the hon. member for Constantia. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) objected to the artificial measures adopted to combat the excessive liquidity in the money market. But most of those measures amount to nothing more than relaxation of the existing control measures, and many of them are in fact measures which the hon. members for Port Elizabeth (South) and Pine-town themselves advocated. There are, for example, in the first place various schemes for the purchase of South African shares abroad. That is one of the methods we adopted to drain off the liquidity to some extent. Then there are the special three-year bonds for nonresidents, and a third measure we adopted to combat the excessive liquidity was the concession we granted to the commercial banks to invest funds overseas temporarily. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) also asked that South Africans should be allowed to invest their capital abroad. Sir, we cannot afford to lift control completely. But before this is criticized, I may tell hon. members that there are very few developing countries which can afford it. If one looks at countries such as Holland or England, one finds that they do not allow the free flow of capital either. Secondly, if we relax too much in this direction we run the risk of being criticized by foreign investors whose capital cannot be withdrawn from South Africa. If we allow South African citizens to invest abroad, we run the risk of getting this criticism, as has already happened in the past. But I want to add that in the past we gave our consent to South African undertakings investing abroad, but that was in individual cases where we were completely satisfied that it was in the general national interest; that, e. g., it stimulated our export market, etc. That is why we gave the Netherlands Bank permission to take up certain shares in overseas banks, because we considered it was to be in our interest to obtain a share in one of the great banks of the Common Market. We therefore allowed it, but it is something which should be restricted to some extent for the reasons I have already given.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Pinetown and Salt River (Mr. Timoney) and Florida criticized the control over the withdrawal of foreign capital and asked that this should be suspended. I have already said that it is impracticable and dangerous to do so now, but we have already relaxed it to such an extent that to-day there is no necessity for any foreigner to complain that he has capital in this country which he cannot withdraw. At the worst he can withdraw it over a period of three years by investing in non-residents&#x2014;debentures. But I think that if we take note of the events in other parts of Africa, it is definitely not advisable completely to lift this control. There is nothing to prevent the foreign investor from selling his shares on the London market. It is true that prices there are lower than on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but they are much higher than the prices of the same shares in June 1961 when we applied this measure of control for the first time. The foreign investor therefore does not lose; he has received his dividends all these years, and now he can sell his shares at a higher price than at the time we instituted this control.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River is also one of the United Party&#x2019;s new acquisitions in the sphere of finance. He alleged that the renewal of the revolving credit of 40,000,000 dollars in America for another two years, and the new revolving credit of 40,000,000 German marks in Germany, are just examples of our lack of confidence in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, it is just because we have so much confidence, and because the outside world has confidence in South Africa, that those loans have been entered into. We have the confidence to use those loans for the great positive projects we are undertaking here. We need money from abroad; we cannot supply all our needs. We need money for the Orange River scheme and for other expansions such as at Sasol and Foscor. The hon. member for Florida also referred to these loans and stated that they meant nothing. He says that bankers will lend money even to Nigeria or to Ghana or to the Congo. That statement comes from the shining light on the financial horizon of the United Party! The hon. member says that these countries can also get loans. I wonder whether he knows the difference between economic aid and an ordinary bank loan. If you want to get some idea as to what England and America think of those countries, it is only necessary for me to give you the prices of their Government stocks on the open market. These were the prices as at 30 January: Government stocks of East Africa were quoted at &#x00A3;71&#x00BD; (you get back &#x00A3;71&#x00BD; only for the &#x00A3;100 that you invested), Northern Rhodesia at &#x00A3;73, Tanganyika &#x00A3;74, Kenya &#x00A3;621, Nyasaland &#x00A3;66 and South African &#x00A3;96&#x00BD;. But the hon. member over there says that there is no difference! These are the London prices. <span class="col_1045-1046" refersTo="page_0537"/>The New York prices are as follows: South Africa 99&#x00BD; Rhodesia 83&#x2014;those which mature in 1968 are 97&#x00BD; and the Congo, which the hon. member specifically mentioned, 39.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) and the hon. member for Springs referred to the question of the marginal mines and the communities served by those mines. I do not want to go into details but I just want to correct a few of the gross inaccuracies in the statement of the hon. member for Springs. The hon. member for Springs spoke of the 12 marginal mines which were allegedly paying R17,000,000 in taxation. Mr. Speaker, that is simply not correct. If those mines are paying taxation then they are not marginal mines. Even E. R. P. M., that large, powerful company, does not pay taxation. Its profit last year was more than R3,000,000. Does the hon. member not know that mines first have to make a profit of 6 per cent before they become taxable? He also referred to the 130,000 persons per annum who, according to Dr. Viljoen, as he says, will have to be provided with employment as a result of the closing of the marginal mines. That is the impression which he gave the House, and he quoted Dr. Viljoen. But what did Dr. Viljoen say? That is not what he said. Dr. Viljoen mentioned this figure of 130,000 as the number of persons who, as a result of the growth of the whole population, will have to be provided with employment annually. You see, Mr. Speaker, one simply despairs. Here I have to reply to a debate and the greater part of my reply consists of corrections of blatantly inaccurate statements made by members of the Opposition.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I just want to say to the hon. member that this whole matter which he raised here is one which is receiving the serious attention of the Government. We are dealing with people who know what they are talking about, and the cause which we all want to serve is not served by reckless statements of the kind made in this House by the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) and Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) referred to another matter of importance. Apart from national roads the whole question of roads falls under the provinces, and I cannot say much, as the hon. member for Kimberley (North) has asked me to do, about an entirely new approach to the construction of roads. As far as the remarks of the hon. member for Vryburg are concerned I just want to point out that local authorities as well as roads fall under the provincial administrations. The Schumann Commission is at present investigating the financial relationship between the Central Government and the provincial governments. If they fix a formula for a particular province, then it covers all roads in that province. How the province divides that money amongst the divisional councils is its own affair. The point is that we as a Central Government cannot give special treatment to a particular province because it has something extra in the shape of divisional councils. It may be a means of saving; that is all very well, but if it is not a means of saving, then it does not entitle that province to a higher quota than the quota which we allocate to it. I just want to say that this whole question of divisional councils has been specially referred to the Borgenhagen Commission. They are dealing with the relationship between the Central Government, the provinces and the local authorities. I have asked them to give special attention to the question of divisional councils.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the last point made by the hon. member for Constantia. He asked an important question&#x2014;and I agree with him that it is important&#x2014;and that is whether we shall be able to maintain this prosperity in the future. The reply to that is a definite and unambiguous &#x201C;yes&#x201D; provided three requirements are complied with. The first requirement is that growth will not be encouraged at the expense of stability. That is the first requirement. During the past year the Government has had to give a little petrol to the economy but the time has come for it to take its foot off the accelerator. The time has also come perhaps for the Government to see whether all the brakes which it can apply if the speed of the vehicle becomes excessive, are in order. That is what the Government can do at this stage. I have said before that there is a possibility that we shall have to try to reduce the capital expenditure incurred by the State. It is not always possible, however, to delay the construction of public works. Some have already been started; some are very important and cannot be held over. We know that there is a housing emergency. We cannot stop the building programme entirely. But we shall have to see. The provincial administrations and the local authorities will all have to see whether they cannot cut down their capital programmes so that the private sector can be given a chance. The time for the Government itself to tackle capital works as much as possible in order to meet any shortfall which there may be after the private sector has done its share, is when there is a recession, and that is what we have done in the past. I know that the provincial administrations and the local authorities will help in this respect. Local authorities in particular sometimes have very ambitious plans. I want to make an appeal to them not to call a halt to the implementation of these plans but to implement them over a longer period; to convert their five-year plan into an eight-year plan perhaps. I also want to say that in the future the Treasury will exercise stricter control over municipal capital programmes than it has done in the past. This is also in the interests of the municipalities themselves.</p>

<p>Does that also apply to the Orange River scheme?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>That is one of the schemes which, as I have said, it is difficult to stop entirely or cut down to any great extent at this juncture. There are certain works which, as I have said, have already been commenced. But there are many other works in connection with which we shall have to see what the position is. I have not investigated the position yet but we shall have to see what we can do to stretch out to some extent the period over which these works are implemented.</p>

<p>The second requirement for the maintenance of our present prosperity is the exercise of self-control by all sections of the community, not only by the Government. If one wants to avoid trouble then the duty to exercise self-control does not rest upon the shoulders of the Government only. I want every sector of the population to exercise self-control in respect of prices, wages, rental and profits. If a proper degree of self-control is exercised it will never be necessary for us to apply the brakes. That is the second requirement therefore.</p>

<p>The third requirement speaks for itself. We can only retain the prosperity which we have been enjoying, particularly in the last few years, if this Government remains in power. Sir, before I develop this argument I should like to outline the background for a moment. The strongest economy in the world, as you know, Mr. Speaker, is never strong in all sectors at any given time; there is always the danger of a bottleneck in one sector or another; there is always some weak sector which has to be strengthened. That is a fact that we simply have to face, and if that were not so then we would no longer be in this world. This particular prosperity that we are enjoying at present creates its own problems. Our danger to-day lies in our prosperity. A Minister of Finance always has to keep a watchful eye over the general interests of the country. He must look for growth but he must also look for stability. At this stage in particular he should try to steer a course which will reconcile the greatest possible growth with the greatest possible stability. That is the course which he has to steer.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that as yet there is no general shortage of skilled labour; there is still no material over-activity in the building industry; there is no inflation yet. But it would be unwise to close one&#x2019;s eyes to the possibility that these bottlenecks may develop. But it would be equally unwise and irresponsible to exaggerate these difficulties, to exaggerate these possibilities and in that way to create a sort of inflation psychosis that would be just as dangerous as it would be to ignore these things. A country, a nation, can very easily talk itself into an inflationary state, and that is the risk that we are running here. As far as I am concerned I do not want to be a party to either of these follies. In other words, I do not want to exaggerate the symptoms, the danger signs, but on the other hand I do not want to ignore them entirely either, for I would then be acting irresponsibly.</p>

<p>This Government has demonstrated in the past&#x2014;I think hon. members will agree with me&#x2014;that it knows how to take effective and, if necessary, stringent action to remove the weak spots or the bottlenecks which occur from time to time in some sector or other of the economy. I have in mind, for example, the balance of payments crisis which we had in 1961. At that time we had to adopt very stringent measures and to-day we are reaping the fruits of those measures. In the recent report of the Monetary Fund&#x2019;s mission which visited this country they praise South Africa for the courageous step which we took in 1961. There we have one example. In 1961 and in the first half of 1962 we had unemployment figures which revealed a disturbing position. We overcame that difficulty. Look at the figures to-day. We had a very sluggish consumption of consumer goods. I complained about it last year and also the previous year, and I made provision for certain stimuli. That was repeated last year, and if you look at the latest report of the Reserve Bank you will see that there has been an amazing upsurge. I also have in mind the low investment tendency which we have also tried to stimulate in the last two Budgets. Then I also have in mind the problem of excessive liquidity which proved very troublesome. The Government overcame all these difficulties and problems. They were overcome because the Government knew how to take effective steps and, where it was necessary to do so, how to take stringent steps. Mr. Speaker, I really shudder to think what would have become of South Africa&#x2019;s economy if hon. members on the other side had been in power in 1961 when we had that balance of payments crisis. [Interjections.] They say, of course, that they would never have had a balance of payments crisis but they would have had very much worse problems on their hands. When I listen to speeches such as those of the hon. member for Florida I can only say &#x201C;heaven help South Africa if that party should ever have control over the finances of this country&#x201D;. My reply to the hon. member for Constantia therefore is that unless the world is hit by some international catastrophe and provided we comply with the first and second requirements and, lastly, provided we see to it that the National Party remains in power, we are in a fairly safe position for the years which lie ahead. During the past 15 years the National Party has maintained a stable rate of growth which has been accomplished by a large degree of stability. It succeeded, particularly after the establishment of the Republic, which was a serious blow to our economy, in building up confidence both internally and externally, in spite of the actions of the Opposition. To-day South Africa is one of the best <span class="col_1049-1050" refersTo="page_0539"/>investment countries in the world. Not only does she attract capital but she also attracts immigrants on a large scale. She maintains law and order, which is perhaps the most important factor, in a way that few other countries do. Hon. members need only look at their daily newspapers. Sir, I have shown that most of the causes of our prosperity, which were mentioned by the hon. member for Constantia, stem entirely from Government policy. That is why the National Party must remain in power if we are to have continued prosperity!</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The principal Act, although it was passed by Parliament in 1946, was only put into operation with effect from 12 March 1955 and this is the first occasion on which amendments to the principal Act have been proposed.</p>

<p>Hon. members have doubtless had the opportunity of reading the explanatory memorandum which has been laid on the Table and it will be clear to them that the amendments are either consequential upon South Africa becoming a Republic or are administrative by nature and designed to bring about more effective administration of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Hon. members will be aware that the Warsaw Convention which dates from 1929 is, with one exception, the aviation convention which has received the widest support. The exception mentioned is the International Convention on Civil Aviation (Chicago, 1944). The Warsaw Convention deals with documents of carriage, the liability of the air carrier, combined carriage and related matters. Changing conditions in aviation made necessary a review of the provisions of the convention and this review, which took place over a number of years, culminated in the adoption in 1955 of the Hague Protocol. This protocol contains a number of amendments of the convention. Very briefly let me just mention the most important amendments. The liability of the air carrier in respect of a passenger is doubled from 125,000 francs (approximately R5,874) to 250,000 francs (approximately R11,748). The provision relating to the unlimited liability of the air carrier in the case of his willful misconduct is replaced by a provision according to which the air carrier&#x2019;s liability will be unlimited only if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the air carrier, his servants or <span class="col_1051-1052" refersTo="page_0540"/>agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.</p>

<p>The documents of carriage have been simplified by reducing the amount of the particulars required in the passenger ticket, the baggage check and the air waybill.</p>

<p>Present indications are that the Hague Protocol will in due course probably be as widely supported as the Warsaw Convention.</p>

<p>When my Department came to examine the principal Act in the light of the provisions of the Hague Protocol, it was found that subsection (1) of Section 5 provided only for ratification, by proclamation in the Gazette, of an amendment to the Warsaw Convention. In international usage the term &#x201C;ratification&#x201D; presupposes that the State ratifying is a signatory to the instrument concerned&#x2014;in this case the Hague Protocol which came into operation on 1 August 1963.</p>

<p>South Africa did not sign the Hague Protocol and as the principal Act stands it cannot adopt the Hague Protocol. The only way out is to amend sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the principal Act so that South Africa can adhere to or accede to any amendment of the Warsaw Convention and that is what is now being proposed. That also is by far the most important reason for this amending Bill.</p>

<p>Let me be quite clear on this point. This amending Bill does not, as far as South Africa is concerned, accept the provisions of the Hague Protocol. Its adoption will only clear the ground for such acceptance and if acceptance is finally decided on, the necessary amendments can be effected by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>I hope that hon. member will agree with me that this measure is not in the least contentious and that its passage is necessary.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The principal Act came into operation on 1 March 1950 and we are now, for the first time, proposing to amend it.</p>

<p>Hon. members have probably already had an opportunity to read the Explanatory Memorandum which has already been tabled and so I hope that it will not be necessary for me to give any further details in regard to the provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p>A large number of the amendments have been necessitated by the change in our form of government and this is the first opportunity we have had to make the necessary changes.</p>

<p>The other amendments are aimed at making the application of the principal Act more effective. As a necessary result it is hoped that the amendments will also be promotive of safe aviation. We have already had about 15 years&#x2019; experience of the administration of the principal Act and from this experience it has become clear that the proposed amendments are necessary.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself more particularly to Clause 5 of the Bill. I am sure that there will be no objection to the powers of the National Transport Commission being extended as proposed in this clause.</p>

<p>Both paragraphs (a) and (b) of the clause contain amendments which are aimed at empowering the commission to take action against the holder of an air carrier&#x2019;s licence who has been guilty of committing any act which is prejudicial to the national security of the Republic.</p>

<p>Paragraph (c) of the clause makes it possible for the commission to take action in the case of a licensee who does not make use of his air carrier&#x2019;s licence. A licence of this nature which is not made use of hampers the development of aviation. As things are to-day, a licensee who does not actively make use of his licence may nevertheless in terms of Section 10 of the principal Act lodge objection with the commission to the granting of a new air carrier&#x2019;s licence if such new licence partly or completely covers the field for which the first-mentioned licence has been granted. I repeat that this state of affairs is not promotive of the development of aviation.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d) of the clause is complementary to paragraphs (a) and (b) in the sense that all have the same aim. As matters stand today a licensee who has a controlling interest in a company elsewhere which is guilty of committing an act which is prejudicial to the national security of the Republic, can simply claim that another corporate body was responsible for that particular action. This is an extremely technical excuse which will now no longer stand.</p>

<p>As far as paragraph (e) is concerned I just want to say that the transfer of an air carrier&#x2019;s licence is subject to approval by the commission. Even though the commission may refuse an application for the transfer of a licence of this nature the particular persons who have not been successful in their application may still get control of the licence concerned where the licensee is a company simply by gaining a controlling interest in that <span class="col_1053-1054" refersTo="page_0541"/>company. The intention of the law can be bypassed in this way. But if the amendment is adopted, this evasion will no longer be possible. It must be noticed that the licence concerned is not withdrawn; it is suspended until such time as the approval of the commission for the obtaining of a controlling interest has been obtained.</p>

<p>It is emphasized, and I think that this is important, that the commission in the exercising of the powers which will now be vested in it in terms of the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) will still have to act in accordance with the procedure laid down in sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the principal Act. In terms of these provisions the commission is compelled to give a licence-holder a reasonable period of prior notice of its proposed course of action and the reasons for such action. The commission then has, before making a decision, to give the licensee an opportunity to advance reasons, either in writing or by appearing before the commission in person or through the medium of a representative, why the proposed course of action should not be resorted to.</p>

<p>I hope that hon. members will agree with me that the amendments that we have in mind, as embodied in this amending Bill, are necessary.</p>

<p>In so far as this Bill contains provisions translating into the statute the consequences of our becoming a Republic and in so far as it contains measures for the greater safety of air services and the more efficient administration of the original Act, it is assured of our full support.</p>

<p>But the hon. Minister must have suspected that we on this side of the House have difficulty with Clause 5. That is why he spent so much time on it. While we appreciate that he has tried to meet our difficulties in advance, I regret to tell him that we are not happy yet. We look upon Clause 5, Sir, as part of general Government policy to build higher fences around South Africa, higher fences to symbolize the isolation and the loneliness of South Africa here on the southernmost corner of Africa. I do not want to go into the merits of the case, but it is a fact: We are in difficulties as a multi-racial state at the southern tip of Africa, and obviously one of the things that the hon. Minister wants to combat here is the use of air services to transport people who have incurred the displeasure of the State out of the borders of South Africa or across the territory of South Africa. If the hon. Minister wants those powers, I think the Government should be entitled to have them. If people break the law there should be machinery to find them and to punish them.</p>

<p>But our difficulty is that the National Transport Commission should be given the power to act against people, to take drastic action against people, without those persons having been convicted before a court of law of any crime or misdemeanor, without their having the right to appeal to a court of law on the facts as found by the commission. You will notice, Sir, it is very clearly stated in this clause that if in the opinion of the Transport Commission people have committed an act against the security of the Republic, the commission can cancel the licence. That means, according to our law, that the right of appeal to the courts becomes very severely restricted. A person who has his licence cancelled in these circumstances can go to court, according to previous court decisions, only to claim that the commission acted <i>ultra vires</i>, which is most unlikely, or to claim that the act is contrary to statute, which is most unlikely, or to claim that they failed to observe the principles of natural justice in that for example they did not allow the other side to be heard. Or, Sir, that there was a failure by the commission to take a decision required of it by law, or that the commission did not apply its mind to the matter before it, and finally that the commission acted fraudulently or in bad faith, or corruptly. Now, Sir, there have been attempts in our practice of justice to take to court decisions by statutory bodies on matters of fact, where the law provides that the opinion of the body concerned is what matters. Cases have been taken to court and it has been found impossible in practice to establish either <i>mala fides</i>, or that the body concerned did not apply its mind to the issues before it. This means that in fact and in practice there is no effective appeal in such a case to the courts, and if the commission makes a mistake adjuding the facts, then the person concerned has lost his rights finally. And because we feel it is wrong in principle that where a statutory body is given judicial functions there should be no appeal on the facts, we want the hon. Minister to know that we will move amendments to Clause 5 in the Committee Stage to clarify this position. We want to admit, Sir, that sub-section (2) of this section does give very important safeguards. Certain acts have to be shown to be persistent or repeated and other safeguards are included in sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Act, but even here there is something which is not quite clear. It is not quite clear according to the wording of this sub-section (2) whether the safeguards apply to acts of commission as well as acts of omission. In the relevant Section 17 (1), it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission &#x2026; may think fit, or vary or add to the conditions thereof, if the holder has contravened or has failed to comply with &#x2026;</block>

<p>It provides there for contraventions which are acts of commission and for omissions, but towards the end of sub-section (2) you will read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and no licence shall be cancelled or suspended on the ground of failure to comply with a condition unless it appears to the commission that the failure has been repeated, or persistent or has been deliberate and serious.</block>

<p><span class="col_1055-1056" refersTo="page_0542"/>That is a very important safeguard, but the wording leaves some doubt. It says &#x201C;failure to comply with a condition&#x201D; which seems to indicate that it does not deal with contraventions, and the amendment here dealing with the matter speaks of &#x201C;acts contrary to the safety of the Republic&#x201D;, and therefore acts of commission. Now there is some doubt in the minds of the lawyers as to whether that is covered, and it is to clear that misunderstanding among other things that we will come with amendments in the Committee Stage. I would ask the hon. Minister not to close his mind at this stage to arguments that the Opposition will bring to him in the Committee Stage. We do not want to anticipate discussions in the Committee Stage, but we give notice of how we feel about it and of certain difficulties we have. I hope the Minister will not close his mind, but will keep an open mind and if, as I believe will happen, the Opposition makes out a case in the Committee Stage, the hon. Minister will be ready to accept our amendments.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has thought fit to brand a measure that deals with the security of South Africa as a measure by means of which, as he has put it, we are helping to isolate ourselves further. It is far from the truth when the hon. member says that we are increasing South Africa&#x2019;s isolation.</p>

<p>This measure is very obviously intended to be complementary to the measure that was passed by this House last year and which dealt with the protection of South Africa&#x2019;s air space. It dealt with the entering and the departure from South Africa of certain aircraft and with air traffic across South Africa from one point to another without touching down somewhere in the Republic. We have had the experience that misuse has been made of South Africa&#x2019;s air space in order to commit certain unfriendly acts against South Africa, and it is most essential that this complementary measure should be passed in order to put an end to the acts that have been committed and may be committed in the future. The hon. member for Yeoville will, I am sure, agree with me that this measure can only be effective and that the whole plan can only be effective if the measure is adopted in this form. We are dealing with aviation, but hon. members opposite raise objections in regard to the finer technical points of law. The hon. member objects primarily to the question of the non-compliance with provisions in connection with actions that are punishable. We are dealing with the technical problems of aviation where non-compliance with certain measures may hold greater dangers and have more unpleasant results than the commission of some particular act. Non-compliance with a number of the administrative provisions in the Aviation Act can have far more serious results than if the position were reversed.</p>

<p>It is apparent that my knowledge of aviation and the hon. member&#x2019;s knowledge of aviation do not tally and I want to admit immediately that his knowledge of that subject may quite possibly be superior to mine. But it is quite clear to me that we are dealing here with a measure&#x2014;and particularly Clause 5 of the Bill&#x2014;that is simply aimed at giving effect to a principle that has already been accepted by this House. We are merely taking it a step further. I feel that it is necessary for this measure to be placed on the Statute Book in this form so that we can put a stop to any unpleasantness that may prejudice our relationships with our neighbouring States.</p>

<p>May I make use of this occasion to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the measure that was passed last year. I have had some doubts in regard to its application. That is why I also want to thank the hon. the Minister of Defence in his absence for the manner in which his Air Force has been able to implement the provision of that Act which was placed on the Statute Book last year&#x2014;the provisions of the particular section that are now being further extended by Clause 5 of this Bill. We in South Africa have to defend many miles of border and a great deal of air space and it is necessary that our control over these matters be extended so that we shall have more control over any irregularities that may take place&#x2014;over the unfriendly actions that may be committed by the misuse of our air space. I am quite content to see this measure as being complementary to the other measure which has already been proved to be enforceable. I would like to see this measure placed on the Statute Book without any changes whatsoever.</p>

<p>I think there is nobody on this side of the House who disagrees at all with the view of the hon. member who has just spoken in regard to the safety, either of flying or the safety of South Africa as such. What we are interested in is to ensure that any measure which this House passes is a measure which not only achieves its objective, but is a measure which at the same times does not do unnecessary harm to innocent people. The hon. member referred to sub-section (2) of Section 17, which was raised by the hon. member for Yeoville. This states clearly that the commission shall not exercise any of its powers under sub-section (1) unless &#x2026; (and here follow various conditions), and the last proviso is: &#x2026; &#x201C;or suspended upon the ground of failure to comply with the conditions&#x201D;. There is no reference whatsoever in that clause to a contravention or to a contravention being repeated, deliberate or serious. In other words, in terms of the existing legislation a contravention is treated differently to an act of non-compliance. Therefore a purely innocent contravention&#x2014;it <span class="col_1057-1058" refersTo="page_0543"/>could be a minor contravention or it could be a serious contravention, but unless it is either repeated, persistent, deliberate or serious, in the case of non-compliance, it is not a matter for the loss of a licence. But in the case of a contravention it does not have to be repeated, it does not have to be persistent, it does not have to be deliberate or serious&#x2014;therefore any contravention whatsoever by any employee of a company can lead to the loss of a licence, whereas in the case of non-compliance there is protection against that being accidental or not serious. That is an aspect that concerns us in this matter: You may have a company flying a number of planes and if any one of its employees at any place or time commits a contravention of any Act relating to flying, that company can now lose its licence.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sub-section (b) of Clause 5 of the Bill says &#x201C;by the insertion in paragraph (a) for the words following the word &#x2018;law&#x2019; of the words &#x2018;relating to aviation; or&#x201A; &#x201D;. Now under the existing legislation a person had to commit an offence in relation to safety. The offence had to be related to safety provisions. This amendment proposes in sub-section (b) that that limitation should be removed. It means that any offence whatsoever, however trivial, of whatever nature it may be, provided it is an offence against any law relating to aviation, is ground for the cancellation of a licence. That seems to be going very far indeed. This has nothing to do with the security of the State, this has nothing to do with anything that can make the hairs curl on the back of your neck, this is purely a matter of straightforward flying regulations, and here the Minister is tightening it to the extent that any minor offence committed by any employee of an airline can cause that airline to lose its licence. The hon. Minister knows that there has been division of opinion on this matter, division of opinion in the Civil Aviation Advisory Committee and strong representations have been made by the Commercial Aviation Association. These are people who know what they are doing. They are not people trying to sabotage South Africa. They are not people who are trying to do harm to the country. They are people representing commercial aviation in South Africa, and their interest is to have a law which will be fair. As the hon. Minister will be aware they have no objection to restrictions on the question of un-South African activities, activities against the State. All that is sought is that any chance of the unfair removal of a licence should be eliminated. I cannot see why it should be that the Minister not only has to introduce this provision&#x2014;provisions which nobody would argue about as a matter of fact&#x2014;but has to open the matter so wide by bringing in the question of &#x201C;the opinion of the commission&#x201D;. In terms of the existing legislation a person or company may lose his licence on the basis of fact; there must be a fact; there must be an act, an omission, something which can be proven before a person can lose a licence, or a company can lose a licence. But in the wording of the new amendment that reliance on fact to reach a decision is replaced by a matter of opinion. So I ask the hon. Minister to reconsider, and if possible to co-operate in eliminating doubts about this measure in the Committee Stage&#x2014;to reconsider the extension to any offence by any employee against any law instead of the existing provision of safety regulations, and to consider the question of opinion being the basis for a decision. As was asked by the hon. member for Yeoville, we would like the hon. Minister to consider the question of providing suitable safeguards where the appeal which is allowed is purely a technical appeal and of very little practical value to any person wishing to make use of it. Subject to those three points, no one can object to this measure in any shape or form, and I do hope that the hon. Minister will make it possible to have a fully agreed measure on a matter where there should be no need for any argument or disagreement.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as hon. members know, the Land Bank Board concluded an insurance agreement with a company a number of years ago in terms of which the bank&#x2019;s debtors were insured for the amount that they owed. This agreement has already benefited many widows or heirs in that the deceased debtor&#x2019;s bond has been wiped out under this coverage. Because the Land Bank is so intimately concerned with the insurance scheme and is obliged in terms of the agreement with the company to find a substitute for the present insurers, the bank was given the power under the Land Bank Amendment Act, 1959, to undertake this insurance function itself if the bank was not able to find a suitable substitute if that became necessary. I emphasized the fact at the time that the Land Bank Board was not looking for an opportunity to do insurance work itself and that it would only undertake this function if no other suitable arrangements could be made. Even then the specific approval of the Minister of Finance first had to be obtained before the board itself could undertake anything of this nature.</p>

<p>This legislation now makes provision for an alternative method by means of which the board, if the need arises, can itself undertake this insurance function. It amounts to this that the board, if such an eventuality arises, will not necessarily have to play the role of insurer itself&#x2014;as the Act provides at present&#x2014;but that it will be able to gain control of the scheme by taking over the shares in the existing insurance company. It is further provided that the board may in such a case conclude such agreements with the company as may be necessary for the proper fulfilment by the company of its obligations. The Act already provides that the Insurance Act shall not apply to the bank when it undertakes the insurance function itself and that provision is therefore now being extended so that it will also apply to a company in which the bank has obtained a controlling interest.</p>

<p>As I have already said, this provision merely seeks to provide an alternative method by means of which the insurance scheme can be undertaken by the bank and, as is the case at present, the Minister of Finance has to give his prior approval in this regard.</p>

<p>The remaining two proposed amendments are simply measures which are necessary to <span class="col_1061-1062" refersTo="page_0545"/>make the existing functions of the bank more effective in specific circumstances. As hon. members know, the Land Bank is the most important supplier of credit to agricultural cooperative societies in the Republic on both a long- and short-term basis. It sometimes happens that a co-operative society obtains a loan from the Bank to redeem an existing mortgage in favour of somebody else. As the provisions of the Land Bank Act now read that bond has to be cancelled and a new bond registered in favour of the bank, notwithstanding the fact that the Deeds Act does make provision for a more simple method of take-over by the registration of a cession of a bond where the mortgagee wants to transfer the debt to somebody else.</p>

<p>The intention of this amendment is therefore to rectify this shortcoming so that the Land Bank can accept the cession of a bond by a co-operative society as security for debt which has already been authorized by members and which the mortgagee would like to transfer into the name of the Land Bank.</p>

<p>The Land Bank has been set up to provide co-operative societies with credit adjusted to their particular requirements and at a reasonable rate of interest.</p>

<p>There can therefore hardly be any objection if a mortgagee prefers to cede his bond to the Land Bank and if a transaction of this nature can be effected without incurring the considerable expense connected with the taking up and authorization of a new loan and a new bond, which can only be done by holding a special members&#x2019; meeting, or, in the case of our larger co-operative societies, a series of member&#x2019; meetings.</p>

<p>Apart from the expense involved, the valuable time of our farmers is taken up in attending these special members&#x2019; meetings.</p>

<p>The third amendment also deals with cooperative societies and similar bodies. In terms of an existing provision in the Land Bank Act the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing is authorized to guarantee loans which the bank may grant with his consent to a co-operative society or control board, but the Act does not at present give him this power in respect of advances which may be given to statutory agricultural bodies. That is one shortcoming in the relevant provision which we are now rectifying. A second shortcoming in the present provisions of the Act is in connection with guarantees which the board of the Land Bank may provide for the fullfilment of a contract which a co-operative society or control board may conclude in regard to the supply of products, payment for grainbags and other farming requisites and the repayment of loans or other lawful business. Under certain circumstances the board may find it necessary to provide a guarantee of this nature, but at the same time the prevailing circumstances may be such that the board may find it necessary to approach the Minister for a Government guarantee to the Bank in respect of security thus furnished by the board.</p>

<p>Circumstances of this kind may arise in the registration of new organizations or in states of emergency when it may be necessary in the interests of the Republic to continue to operate certain specific businesses notwithstanding the fact that there may be some doubt as to their credit-worthiness or financial prospects.</p>

<p>In terms of the proposed amendment therefore the further power is being given to the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing to guarantee such security furnished by the Board of the Land Bank to the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill is acceptable in principle to this side of the House and will have its support. We accept the assurance of the Minister that it is largely designed to improve the administration of the bank&#x2019;s affairs. In so far as the bank&#x2019;s powers are being increased to carry on with the business of insurance, we also accept his assurance that this new power to acquire control of one or other private company which carries on insurance business will be exercised only in exceptional circumstances That is how I understood the Minister to put it, and we therefore accept that this power will be used solely in the interests of the farming community and to safeguard the commitments of the Land Bank itself in the event of any such private company finding itself in difficulties in circumstances beyond its control. We accept the assurances of the hon. the Minister that the other changes in the Bill are either consequential or are intended to bring the law into line with necessary or desirable practice, and therefore it will not be opposed.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to move the Contingent Notice of Motion standing in my name and which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Committee of the Whole House on the Plant Breeders&#x2019; Rights Bill have leave to consider the advisability of extending its provisions to include plants which have their origin outside the Republic.</block>

<p>As the Bill stands, plant breeders&#x2019; rights will be allowed only in cases where plants have originated inside the Republic. If this Contingent Notice is accepted then plants which originated outside the Republic will also be the subject of plant breeders&#x2019; rights. I want to stress that the intention is to give protection only to those outside countries that give us reciprocal rights. If one looks at the amendment to Clause 6 standing in the name of the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), one sees that it includes this proviso: <span class="col_1063-1064" refersTo="page_0546"/>&#x201C;Provided that in: the case of a plant which has its origin in a country other than the Republic, no such right may be granted unless such other country grants similar rights whether by way of patents, plant breeders&#x2019; rights or otherwise, to citizens of the Republic. &#x201D; It would obviously therefore only be granted to those countries which play the game by us and allow us those reciprocal rights.</p>

<p>There are two important reasons which I hope will persuade the hon. the Minister to accept this motion. In the first place, we believe that South Africa should have the benefit of the very latest plant developments coming from whatever quarter of the world. If it is true to say that in the second-reading debate on this Bill the consensus of opinion was that if the measure goes through as it stands a large number of overseas discoveries and varieties will somehow not find their way to us, or not find their way into South Africa quickly. I think the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) felt that while that was a disadvantage it would have the advantage that there would be no danger of diseases being imported. I stress that, to show that the implication of what he said was that we should indeed keep out certain new varieties due to the danger of sickness. I feel that we should not keep out a good variety because of that danger, but rather take steps to ensure that there is a sufficient period of quarantine. If We think, as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) said during the second reading, that the vine, the oak and so much else that has come to do perhaps better in South Africa than in its native country, have come from overseas, one should be very careful, I suggest, not to exclude things which will be a great addition to our plants and seeds, etc. I think it is the consensus of opinion that certain varieties will be excluded. I am aware that the hope of the Department is that somehow these plants will find their way into South Africa. I wish one could believe that that is likely to be so, but I am quite convinced that it will be on a much lesser scale.</p>

<p>I think the Department has spoken of the harmonious relations it has with Departments of Agriculture of other countries, and it has expressed the belief that it will have passed on to it from other agricultural departments information about new breeds, etc. But here I think the fear is legitimate, that, if overseas countries which lead in these fields, countries like the U. S. A., France, the United Kingdom and Germany, who have all entered into international agreements about plant breeders&#x2019; methods, realize that we are going our own way in these matters, the doors of those agricultural departments will not swing open to us so easily in future. When one mentions those countries, it must be remembered that we have in the past adhered firmly to the international arrangements we have accepted; but I am dealing with the question of losing possible new varieties. I think it is the hope of the Department, too, that we shall be able somehow to come by these plants overseas and import them here, so that they will not be lost to us. But there again, if the legitimate method of buying plant breeders&#x2019; rights and exploiting them here is not followed, just as a patent is bought and used, I do not believe that the various agencies such as nurseries and farmers&#x2019; associations and others will be available and on the lookout for possible discoveries in this field. Where the normal trade channels are left unimpeded, it is in the interests of nurserymen to be on the lookout for new varieties and to buy the rights and to bring the plant here and exploit it.</p>

<p>I am aware that there is the feeling that where one has to obtain the plant, which is under patent or subject to plant breeders&#x2019; rights, it can put up the cost of that particular plant or seed. But we must never lose sight of the fact that these patent rights do not last for an indefinite time. Like all patents, they lapse after a certain number of years, and then it is free for all. In that period of years, it is true, the discoverer gets the benefit of his inventiveness. I do not think that where we in South Africa have always been prepared to concede patents to inventors in the industrial field, we should take a different view in regard to plants. I know that it is argued that to discover a new breed of peach, for example, is quite a different thing from discovering a new machine or a new process. Admittedly the one is more of a natural phenomenon, whilst the other falls in the field of science, but they both require inventiveness, and I would be the last person to minimize the inventiveness and skill of a nurseryman or farmer who discovered a new type of wheat, which is perhaps rust-resistant. It is still a very valuable discovery by a skilful man So we should not embark upon a course which denies a man his just reward. Therefore, in advancing this first reason why we should accept this motion, I repeat that there is a real danger that we, who are a growing agricultural country, will be left a little behind in the race for new varieties of all kinds. I appreciate that the Department has every intention of trying to keep abreast, but its resources must necessarily be limited. It has specific objects in mind, and I submit it can never cover the whole field of inventions in other countries.</p>

<p>As to the second reason for adopting the motion, I think that to put it at its lowest, it seems likely that we shall be acting in breach of international agreements to which we have adhered for a very long time. In the evidence submitted to the select committee fears were expressed by witnesses that any such breach by us would have far-reaching consequences, not only in respect of plants but possibly in respect of patents generally. The view that we would be acting in breach of international agreements was expressed in a careful memorandum by the Institute of Patent Agents. Whatever criticism one may voice against them as being people who are not acquainted <span class="col_1065-1066" refersTo="page_0547"/>with agricultural matters, one must hand it to them that they are experts in this very specialized field of law. And I suggest that the opinion they express on the interpretation of international agreements is entitled to the highest respect.</p>

<p>I am aware that the select committee was given the benefit of the opinion of the Government&#x2019;s learned law advisers on this question; it is to be found in the appendix to the report of the select committee. But I do think that without an excessive knowledge of law one can have grave doubts as to whether that opinion is correct. It is urged in this opinion that Article 2 of the Convention does not apply to plant breeder&#x2019; rights as proposed in the Bill. It is said in particular that even in the light of the wide terms of Article 1 (3) of the Convention, it is probable that the word &#x201C;patents&#x201D; in Article 1 (2) does not include plant patents, but only patents for something invented or manufactured such as agricultural tools or implements. If one looks at the provisions of the Paris Convention of 1883, which has been amended down the years, most recently at Lisbon in 1958, one cannot but feel convinced that the signatories had in mind covering things like plant breeders&#x2019; rights. It is true that the word &#x201C;patent&#x201D; is used, but it is perfectly clear that in 1883 they did not know specifically of plant breeders&#x2019; rights, and they were thinking there of a right of the nature of a patent, and were using it in a broad sense. Listen, for example, to the language of Article 1. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The countries to which the present Convention applies constitute themselves into a union for the protection of industrial property.</block>

<p>Now the law advisers say, in short, that plant breeders&#x2019; rights are not industrial property. But now let us read on. Article 1 (2) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The protection of industrial property is concerned with patents, utility models, industrial designs, trade marks, service marks, trade names and indications of source or appellations of origin and the repression of unfair competition.</block>

<p>Remember that&#x2014;&#x201C;unfair competition&#x201D;. And now we get the definition of &#x201C;industrial property&#x201D; in Article 1 (3)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Industrial property shall be understood in the broadest sense and shall apply not only to industry and commerce proper but likewise to agricultural and extracted industries and to all manufactured or natural products&#x2014;for example, wine, grain, tobacco leaf, fruit, cattle, minerals and mineral waters, beer, flowers and plants.</block>

<p>And then in Article 1 (4) we find this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The term &#x201C;patents&#x201D; &#x2026; I suggest that the word is put in inverted commas to indicate that the word is used as a general word to cover rights of this kind, including plant breeders&#x2019; rights which happened to gain their particular name much later than the date of this Paris Convention in 1883. It says&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">The term &#x201C;patent&#x201D; shall include the various kinds of industrial patents recognized by the laws of the countries of the Union such as patents of importation, patents of improvements, patents and certificates of additions, etc.</block>

<p>As I say, Sir, giving due weight and respect to the learned opinion of the law advisers who themselves only say that they think it is probable that the word &#x201C;patents&#x201D; in Article 1 (2) did not include plant patents, one has against their opinion the opinion of the Institute of Patent Agents; and one can judge for oneself on the language of the Convention. Doing all that I suggest that we as guardians of the interests of South Africa must have the gravest doubts that these plant breeders&#x2019; rights do fall within the terms of the Paris Convention, and if they do fall within the terms of the Paris Convention and we do legislate in regard to them in the way that we are legislating here, we shall clearly be acting in violation of an international obligation assumed by us willingly some years ago. I am certain that that is not the wish of the Department. Surely therefore where one has any doubt one should not act in that way. If this particular notice of motion is accepted it will retain all the advantages of this measure, which was supported by this side of the House, and it will also ensure that we do not infringe our international obligations.</p>

<p>As an additional reason in support of this motion I would like to say this: Several persons who gave evidence before the select committee said that we South Africans would be the losers in the long run if we put this measure through in this form. In particular there was a leading rose breeder who said that overseas plant breeders entitled to get plant breeders&#x2019; rights will, of course, patent their rights and make a certain profit from the sale of those rights to our nurserymen who in turn will sell to the farmers. He said that that would mean that a certain amount of foreign exchange would go out of the country. But he said that if we South Africans hit upon a successful plant&#x2014;using that term in the widest sense&#x2014;we can make a fantastic profit in the big markets of the world, like America, and thus earn foreign exchange for this country.</p>

<p>One is reminded in this connection of the position of some of our sportsmen. We have been lucky enough to see a man like Mr. Gary Player compete in all the tournaments of the world and particularly in America where he annually earns the very highest purses through being allowed to compete in the Professional Golfers&#x2019; Associations&#x2019; competitions. <span class="col_1067-1068" refersTo="page_0548"/>If we here in South Africa were to close our doors to overseas golfers I have little doubt that they would react by preventing our players from playing overseas. That is, I think, a fair analogy of the position that we have here. We are in truth putting the oversea plant breeder at a big disadvantage. There is a real danger that he will bring pressure to bear on his Government to see that we are cut out of their profitable markets, and that is something that we should do with very great reluctance.</p>

<p>I should like to assure hon. members that the accepted position amongst leading Western countries is to allow this reciprocity. May I quote the statement which appears in paragraph 107 of the Report of the Committee on Transactions in Seeds which was presented to the British Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The generally accepted principle in the field of patents, copyright, and other forms of protection for original work, is that each country treats foreigners in the same way, as its own nationals.</block>

<p>Then I quote paragraph 108&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In principle, we favour the grant of national treatment to foreign plant breeders, subject to the grant of reciprocal rights to United Kingdom breeders in foreign countries.</block>

<p>That is exactly the position that this contingent notice of motion will make possible. Of course, we insist that we will give those rights only to countries which give us reciprocal rights. Paragraph 108 goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our view, the interchange between countries of suitable improved varieties is of mutual advantage and should be facilitated. Many varieties are well adapted to environmental conditions found beyond the borders of the country in which they were first bred. We believe it is in the national interest, and equally in the interest of United Kingdom breeders, that any right the latter may enjoy in their own country should also be obtainable in the wider sphere which would be opened to them by an international agreement.</block>

<p>For those reasons I sincerely hope, although this is admittedly a matter within a small compass, that the hon. the Minister will reflect very seriously on it and see his way clear to make this improvement in the Bill possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) who has just sat down has certainly not made out a case in support of his request that the House should accept this instruction. It is perfectly clear to me that the hon. member as a lawyer probably made an excellent speech on the legal aspect, but evidently he knows very, very little about the botanical aspects of this matter. The hon. member has made a speech here based on the Paris Convention in an attempt to show that the opinion of the law advisers of the Department of Justice is wrong. I do not want to follow him there because I am not a lawyer, but I want to say at once that as far as the botanical aspect is concerned he is completely wide of the mark and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will not accept this instruction because we as farmers and as plant breeders see a danger in this instruction, and I would appeal to the hon. the Minister therefore not to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s plea. The hon. member says that South Africa will have the benefit of the best plant material in the world if we extend the same rights to plant breeders outside the Republic as we do to plant breeders in the Republic. We have those rights in any case; we have those facilities in any case because long before a plant is patented there is an exchange of information between the agricultural faculties of other countries and our own faculties with a view to getting the best plant material. Thus, for example, our research workers at oversea agricultural faculties have made available plant material even before it has been made available here in South Africa to the nurserymen and the farmers. There is such an exchange of information between the agricultural faculties of various countries, and this instruction is really unnecessary to promote that exchange of information. The hon. member has once again simply revealed the immature thinking of the Opposition. We have always been tied hand and foot to foreign countries, and because we ourselves have not reached maturity yet, according to the Opposition, they expect us to remain tied to the apron strings of those countries! The hon. member has referred again to the speech made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) the other day in which he said that we had imported the vine and wanted to know what our position would have been today without these imports. Mr. Speaker, I can recall the days when we imported all our industrial products because we simply did not have our own industries to supply those products. I can recall the days when we were still importing particular groups of people. To this day there is still a certain Church in South Africa which still imports its Church leaders from countries abroad because they believe that our own people are not good enough. But we have made great progress. To-day we have our own industries producing products which we formerly imported, and the same applies to our plants. We have made so much headway that we are breeding plants to-day to suit the particular climatic requirements and the climatic conditions not only of the whole of the Republic but to suit the climatic conditions of particular parts of the Republic. It is true that we are still making use of imported plant material but we are doing so with great circumspection and mainly for the purpose of getting breeding material for further breeding projects. The hon. member now says <span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0549"/>that we should rather import those new varieties and then guard against the importation of diseases. That is much easier said than done, as I tried to indicate very clearly in the course of my second-reading speech. It may appear to be a simple matter for our Plant Control and Quarantine Division to control those diseases &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member wants us to accept this instruction because he argues that if we do not do so we will fall behind in the race for new varieties. It is perfectly clear, as I have already indicated, that we are breeding those varieties ourselves with the assistance of the material that we are getting from institutions abroad. It is perfectly clear to me therefore that in asking for this instruction the hon. member is simply acting in the interests of patent agents, of lawyers and of those few rose-breeders who hope that the time will come when they will breed a fantastic rose which will bring them wealth overnight. They dream about the big fish that they are going to find at the end of their line, but I am afraid that the one which they are going to catch is not going to be as big as the one caught by the hon. the Prime Minister! They dream about the large rose which they are going to breed and which is going to make them extremely wealthy overnight. I am afraid that their dreams will never come true, because recently America confiscated a rose which a South African breeder had exported to America, because America is also afraid of importing diseases. All countries of the world are guarding more and more against the importation of disease-carrying varieties. I am afraid therefore that the dreams of these few rose-breeders will not come true either. In any case we cannot run the risk, for the sake of doubtful wealth which may accrue to a few people, of further contaminating the whole country with diseases, and I sincerely hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will not accept this instruction.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) when he urges the Minister not to accept this motion moved by the hon. member for Pine-lands (Mr. Thompson). The hon. member for Paarl evidently feels that we need not have reciprocal rights with overseas countries. Sir, I would like to quote from the evidence given before the select committee by the President of the S. A. Institute of Patent Agents. This is what he says at page 65&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In practice it has been found that the vast majority of plants which have been patented (91 per cent) derived from abroad. Furthermore, 87 per cent of the patented plants are roses. From this it is deduced that the plant patents law is not to the advantage of the country.</block>

<block name="quote"><i>Comments</i>: (a) In the case of industrial patents it is also true that the vast majority of inventions (66 per cent) derive from abroad. This has never been advanced as a reason for abolishing the patents system.</block>

<p>Sir, in supporting this motion put forward by the hon. member for Pinelands, I wish to say that one of the major points of difference on the select committee&#x2014;and I am speaking as a member of the select committee&#x2014;was whether there should be reciprocity or not with countries which have plant patent rights. It was felt by some members that the Bill should have been extended to cover all plants, those originating both inside and outside South Africa. I know that the Government law advisers are in favour of the Bill as it stands, but may I draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that there is a considerable body of authoritative opinion which thinks otherwise. It is felt very strongly by this body of opinion that there are very valid objections to the limitation of plant breeders&#x2019; rights to local plants only, which limitation does not include oversea plants. It is felt also that this may initiate in overseas countries official and unofficial discrimination against South African breeders, which I am sure is not what the hon. the Minister wants. It is felt by these informed bodies of opinion that foreign breeders may actively prevent new plant varieties reaching South Africa, which would delay or prevent the cultivation of very valuable varieties. It is strongly felt that laws of this kind should be designed to secure innovation in cultured plants and not necessarily only to reward plant breeders. Only innovation over as broad a field as possible leads to maximum lasting improvement in results from cultivation. Both the public at large and the agricultural community can only benefit from plant varieties that withstand the test of time, and the percentage doing so is very small. Therefore the hon. the Minister and his Department, I feel sure, would wish to encourage foreign-varieties of plants into South Africa to assist&#x2019; through experiment&#x2014;the chances of lasting improvements to our own plants. We feel therefore that the principle of providing protection to foreign plants, where reciprocity exists or is negotiated by the State President, is essential to the success of this Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to outline what I consider to be a practical case. Supposing someone outside South Africa invents a new variety of maize, a variety with a higher resistance against disease, a variety producing a bigger yield and a variety having more resistance to drought. The persons or organization who develop this variety may have spent years of <span class="col_1071-1072" refersTo="page_0550"/>time and considerable sums of money on the development of this new strain, and may have applied knowledge and experience gained as the result of years of study and training. Surely it would then be in South Africa&#x2019;s national interest to introduce the improved strain of maize into our country and to cultivate it on a large scale within the shortest possible time, to obtain the maximum and most immediate benefit for South Africa. But the foreign breeder of this new maize strain is also looking for the maximum return for his ingenuity and work and investment, and he is hardly likely to come to South Africa with his new maize strain where the results of his efforts could be pirated by unscrupulous parties because it is unprotected by plant breeders&#x2019; rights as Clause 6 now stands. We can understand that the Minister is trying through this Bill to encourage local plant breeders, but surely it cannot be the Minister&#x2019;s intention to penalize local farmers who will be cut off from plants abroad.</p>

<p>Finally, in conclusive proof that what we are asking for in this motion is essential, the new British Plant Breeders Bill, initiated through the British Commission on Plant Breeders Rights, was passed by the House of Lords on 19 December 1963; it has not yet come before the House of Commons. This British legislation is open to all comers. Reciprocity only applies in connection with the determination of priority where different people (one of whom at least is a foreigner) have bred the same plant variety. It is also believed that the projected plant breeder&#x2019;s legislation in Germany and France will be open to all comers.</p>

<p>Sir, in view of all these points, we as members of the select committee feel that certain adjustments to this clause as now framed are necessary. I support the hon. member for Pinelands in moving for this instruction and asking that the House accept this amendment to Clause 6. We accept that this amendment goes beyond the principle of the Bill as incorporated in the Title, but we hope that the Minister will be reasonable and permit this motion to go through in order to improve the chances of success of this Plant Breeders&#x2019; Bill.</p>

<speech by="#knobel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened attentively to the argument of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) who has just sat down. She mentions the interesting example of a farmer who will allegedly not be able to buy a certain type of maize seed unless the motion of the hon. member for Pine-lands (Mr. Thompson) is accepted. That only goes to show how little the hon. member knows about plants. Unfortunately for her she quoted maize as an example. I can only tell her that what the maize farmers are planting to-day is a hybrid maize. The seed of the hybrid maize can only be used once, and then one has to start all over again.</p>

<p>As far as the motion of the hon. member for Pinelands is concerned I want to support the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) wholeheartedly and make a plea to the Minister not to make this concession for which the hon. member for Pinelands asks. We must not lose sight of the fact that the object of this measure is to protect the plant breeders of South Africa and to give them encouragement here in our own country. The risk of importing disease-carrying plants is so great that I feel that we should not throw open our doors at this stage. The hon. member for Pinelands has tried to suggest that we will be violating the Patents Act if we pass this Bill and if we forbid other countries to register their plants here. But the select committee went into this matter very thoroughly. We took evidence from experts, <i>inter alia</i> from the Assistant Chief of the Horticultural Research Institute, a person who knows all about these things, and I should like to read out his evidence to the House to show that the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Pinelands are without substance. He says, amongst other things, that the patenting of plants is the exception rather than the rule in the world. Then he goes on to say (para. 43)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In reality there are very few countries where plant patents do exist. Amongst these countries are America, South Africa and, to a certain degree, France. In France only roses and carnations are patented.</block>

<p>I want to point out that this Bill provides that a breeder may register all plants in South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The position is however, that any country which is a member of the Paris Convention for Industrial Patents and itself has no provision for patenting may in fact take out patents in another country. If we are going to repeal the relevant provisions in our Patents Act&#x2014;which is contemplated in this Bill&#x2014;we shall therefore not be violating any international agreements. All that we are doing is to take plant patents out of the Patents Act and to put them where they belong, namely under plant breeders&#x2019; rights. The fact that we are repealing plant patents, therefore, does not mean that a rose grower will henceforth no longer be able to patent roses in other countries. As a matter of fact, such patenting is already taking place at present. At this stage I wish to point out that we have been severely attacked by the Institute of Patent Agents on the ground that we would then be unable to repeal plant patents without violating an international agreement by so doing. Furthermore, the Institute adopted the attitude that if you provide protection for an industrial patent, you have to do so for a plant patent as well. A rose which has been bred by means of mutation, for example, is therefore treated on the same basis by the Institute as a new machine which is invented. In December 1961 France, Germany (i. e. West Germany), Holland, Belgium and Italy drew up a new <span class="col_1073-1074" refersTo="page_0551"/>Paris Convention for the protection of plant breeders&#x2019; rights. Through the agency of the Swiss Embassy we were invited to join this new Convention. We replied that we did not see our way clear to do so. The main reason for this is that the provisions relating to plant patents in the Patents Act are to be repealed and that this Bill has not yet been passed by Parliament. It may well be asked why we do not join this new Convention for the protection of plant breeders&#x2019; rights and then operate on a reciprocal basis with other countries. The reason why we do not want to conclude such reciprocal relationships is very clearly set out in this Bill.</block>

<p>And so this expert goes on. As far as I am concerned I want to say that I do not feel at this stage that the Minister should make this concession. Let us first put our own house in order. Let us see what becomes of the new Convention. There will be time enough in the future to revise the Act.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) who was a member of the Select Committee, is apparently dissatisfied with our attitude that any plant should be allowed to be imported into South Africa; in other words, that the object of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pine-lands (Mr. Thompson) is to place our own plantbreeders industry in danger. The hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) advanced the same argument. The hon. member for Paarl says he sees a danger in this instruction but he adds that we still have the right, in any case, to import the best. He sees a danger in the instruction, Sir, but at the same time the hon. member says that what we envisage the breeders would do, the Department of Agriculture could in any case do by way of exchange with other countries. If hon. members opposite see a danger in this instruction what about the exchange which is done by the Department? Are they not also busy creating a danger for the plant breeders? Why should it be left in their hands only? I agree that the Department of Agriculture, with all the facilities at their disposal, such as the quarantine measures, that they can apply, for example, can see to it that any foreign diseases that enter the country in plants are not spread in South Africa. But I believe the private plant breeders will apply similar precautionary measures. In other words, if they keep a plant under quarantine conditions so that any disease that plant may suffer from is not spread in this country, the private plant breeders can do exactly the same. I cannot see, therefore, how that can be a danger.</p>

<p>If this instruction is not accepted a greater danger faces the farmer, the breeder and the grower of South Africa, namely, that it will not be within their power, or rather that stumbling blocks will be placed in their way, to benefit from the experience breeders in other countries have already gained. I admit that the possibility exists that diseases may be brought into the country. But plant and animal diseases can be imported in so many other ways. That does not prevent us, however, from saying that it is to our benefit to import that in respect of which the world outside has already gained experience, so that we can place that at the disposal of the South African farmer. If we want to give the breeders of South Africa an opportunity of making still further progress&#x2014;we all admit that legislation is necessary for that&#x2014;why do we not amend this Bill in such a way that the foreign breeder will also be included when it comes to the application of this legislation. I cannot understand hon. members opposite at all. We on this side appreciate their patriotism. We feel the same way about it, but exclusiveness, to lock yourself out, has never yet benefited anybody. You benefit if you are also prepared to learn from the experience of the person beyond your own borders. We shall have this additional benefit that we shall not only be assisting our own breeders but we shall also be placing that additional knowledge and experience at his disposal. I feel, therefore, that this legislation will be a danger unless we accept the instruction as moved.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I trust the House and the Minister will not accept this instruction. The House must clearly understand that this matter was very thoroughly considered by the select committee. There was no difference of opinion in the select committee in respect of the general principle of the Bill but the great difference of opinion in the select committee was in respect of this aspect. In other words, this aspect was very seriously considered by the whole committee. The difference of opinion between the two sides of this House has its origin in the select committee.</p>

<p>Up to the present people have been allowed to import freely but this legislation does not prohibit the importation of plants under certain conditions. It only excludes certain rights of local breeders, rights from which certain benefits may be derived, as far as imported plants are concerned. We shall be able to continue to import as in the past. You are not excluding overseas plants, therefore, except that you confer certain preferential rights, rights which entail benefits, on your local breeders. Hitherto the testing of plants has been done exclusively by the Department. In the circumstances you want to encourage the local breeders and in order to encourage them you have to give them this special preference. Broadly speaking the difference between the Opposition and this side of the House is whether or not we should give our local breeders any priority as against outsiders. It does not exclude anything whatsoever, although in the case of plants that enter the country you must be careful because in the first instance they normally cannot adopt themselves to this country and certain precautionary steps have to be taken to prevent <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0552"/>their importation. Even if you were to change it you would still have to retain those precautionary measures. The minute you allow an overseas plant to be registered, the fact that it has been registered, has a certain propaganda value when it comes to selling that plant. That is the second reason why we cannot allow it; that gives the imported plant a certain amount of propaganda value. I am sorry that we have to differ from the Opposition in principle on this matter, but we on this side of the House cannot in any way allow this instruction to be given to the committee.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister. I would ask him to discard a large number of the arguments advanced from his side of the House. In the first place, Sir, the question of the importation of plants and the dangers they hold for our South African soil, is a matter to be dealt with by means of the appropriate quarantine measures and has nothing to do with the question whether there will be reciprocal rights of registering or patenting plants as between ourselves and other countries. The issue which is before this Chamber is not at this moment the advisability of including a particular provision, which is not before this House, but an appropriate provision in terms of the instruction. The question which is before the House at the moment is whether we on this side of the House, we who believe that there is an overwhelming case for including another provision in this Bill, a provision which we believe will fully respect our international obligations and which will mean an improvement to us, will have an opportunity of putting that case before this House in the hope that we will be able to convince hon. members on the other side that that provision should be included. That, Sir, as you know, cannot be done unless this House agrees to accept the instruction. I do submit that in a matter of this sort, a matter which has been a matter of contention in many countries, i. e. the question of the rights of plant breeders, and in view of the fact that there are many countries which have either plant-breeders&#x2019; rights or allow patents or provide for reciprocity with other countries, the question is simply whether it is right that this Chamber should have the opportunity of hearing the arguments in favour of the inclusion of such a provision or not. If the hon. the Minister will give us the opportunity of stating our case we believe we shall be able to convince him and hon. members opposite as to the merit of our case. I cannot deal with the merits; you, Sir, will not permit me to do so. I do say, Sir, that I am utterly convinced that if we had the opportunity we shall be able to convince hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) raised the question of our infecting our soil, but that is not at issue, Sir. That is a matter which can be controlled in terms of other legislation. At the present time, as other hon. members have said, there is the opportunity of importing plants from overseas. I have absolute confidence in our Department of Agriculture, which runs the quarantine arrangements in this country, to see to it that adequate precautions are taken. That danger exists whether or not this instruction is agreed to and a provision which complies with it is included in the Bill.</p>

<p>I know there was a difference of opinion in the select committee in regard to this matter. But again, Sir, they did not go to the root of the question, namely, whether there should be reciprocity in this matter and whether this Bill should contain such a provision. It went very largely in the minds of members, I believe, over certain evidence by a certain nurseryman who more or less had a phobia about a certain article of commerce. I do not wish to pursue that, however, I just wish to say that I believe the select committee, with great respect&#x2014;I have already said that we on this side appreciate the very full opportunity that we were given to examine all aspects of this Bill&#x2014;made a mistake: we believe it is in the interests of this country that a further provision be included. That being the case I do suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should not silence the Opposition by refusing to agree to an instruction. We cannot argue the merits of the case here. If the hon. the Minister agrees to this motion being passed we believe we shall be able to convince him and this House that the appropriate provision should be included in this measure. It will bring us into line with other countries. It will provide for reciprocity, and in these days we want reciprocity with other countries. But I do not want to pursue that, Sir. I submit that what is at stake is whether this Minister proposes to silence the Opposition by refusing to agree to this House having the opportunity of considering a provision which we regard as being of very great importance.</p>

<p>In the first instance I do not agree at all with the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). He says that if I were to express myself against this motion I would be muzzling the Opposition and preventing them from arguing on the merits of something on which we differ. Five members of the Opposition have taken part in the debate and advanced reasons why the House should accept the motion. I make bold to say that the reasons advanced by the mover of this motion were not emphasized by any other Opposition member who has taken part in the debate. If this motion were accepted and we took the Committee Stage those reasons, and those reasons alone, would be further emphasized. It would give the hon. member for Germiston (District) an opportunity of coming forward with that amendment of his because there is not much to be said for it.</p>

<p>I want to give my reasons why I do not agree with the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) and other speakers on the <span class="col_1077-1078" refersTo="page_0553"/>Opposition. During the second reading we were asked what the object of this Bill was&#x2014;what the underlying motive was. Briefly the motive is to give a certain amount of protection, certain rights and an encouragement to the plant breeders of South Africa. By implication the hon. member for Pinelands says that by not extending this to plant breeders outside the Republic we are really forfeiting a right which South Africa has had in the past, namely, to obtain the best plants from overseas, plants that were patented there and which could be patented here. What right has the hon. member for Pinelands to say that? Is that the position? Surely that is incorrect. Since 1960, when our Patents Act was amended, only decorative plants could be patented in the Republic of South Africa. Other plants which served a useful purpose, whether they were cultivated vegetatively or not, could not be patented in this country. Can any member opposite give me an example of any plant, whether it enjoys patent rights in its country of origin or not, that we wanted to bring to South Africa and which could not be imported? There is not a single example. There is not a single example in the three-four year period. It will, of course, be said that it may happen, Mr. Speaker, but the sun may fall down; the moon may not rise; the Opposition may even come into power at some time or other. So &#x201C;may&#x201D; is an extremely broad term. I cannot blame hon. members if they live in that hope, perhaps the hope maketh not ashamed at all times. Let me give another example. Prior to 1952, when we did not have any patent rights, when we had no patent rights in South Africa in the sense that plants could be patented, one of our most beautiful and best adapted roses was imported without patent rights. It was a rose which had been patented in its country of origin; I think of the rose Peace. We should not make the mistake of thinking that if a plant, either of decorative or industrial value, had been bred in another country, either vegetatively or from seed, and we import it into this country we are actually losing by not importing it. The hon. member for Pinelands advanced the argument that the British Government had even appointed a commission and that they had now submitted a report on the same subject and that the British Government was now considering legislation. He wanted to know why we could not follow their example because they recommended in that report that foreign countries should not be excluded from the patent rights or plant breeders&#x2019; rights in Britain. There may be a good reason for that, a reason which may perhaps not exist in South Africa. Do you know, Sir, that 91 per cent of all grain varieties grown in Great Britain was bred in countries in Europe. The breeders of Britain only bred 9 per cent. I am not mentioning this to cast a reflection on the breeders of Great Britain but to emphasize this point, namely, that conditions in the northern hemisphere of the world, that is Great Britain and the rest of Europe, are so similar in many respects that there is a little danger of a good new plant which has proved its usefulness, its productivity and its yield in its country of origin, will not be equally productive, etc., in a neighbouring country. We have many examples of plants, even plants cultivated from seed or vegetatively, that were imported into South Africa but did not thrive here. I think of decorative plants in particular. Beautiful new varieties of roses have been imported into this country but they could not hold their own against roses that were bred in South Africa and that were not patented here.</p>

<p>Then we have the example of certain hybrid maize strains that we received from America. We as a department have never had any trouble in importing them here and testing them. They have patent rights in America but they have never as yet said that we should first patent a particular strain here before they will let us have it. We have not had any difficulty with that in the past. We tested those strains here and found that they simply could not adapt themselves to South African conditions. Therefore, just as they were a great improvement in America they put up an equally poor show in the Republic of South Africa due to totally changed conditions.</p>

<p>I have given the example of our canning peaches. I have in mind the Kakamas peach and others. There are certain regions in America where they go in for fruit-farming, regions which are very similar to South Africa. They wished to grow that peach on a large scale. They asked us for it and we willingly let them have it. However, the same variety which thrives so well here and which can hold its own against any canning peach in the world to-day, proved itself not to be so adaptable to conditions in America as to constitute an asset to that country; and even less so in European countries. Consequently our attitude is this that, say for example, a country turns nasty for one or other reason and says: &#x201C;Well, it is patented in my country and because you do not make provision for plant breeders&#x2019; rights in respect of foreign breeders, we are not going to let the Republic have it&#x201D; that is no proof that we shall be suffering such a great loss. Experience has taught us that that problem does not arise. This legislation makes it possible for a foreign breeder to bring that plant to South Africa and to cultivate it here and to obtain plant breeders&#x2019; rights if he so wishes. It even makes it possible for him even to send the mother strains from which the plant has been bred to a plant breeder in South Africa, by way of an agreement with which we shall not interfere and to obtain plant breeders&#x2019; rights in South Africa in respect of the new cross-bred plants. That same plant can be cultivated here, either by himself in co-operation with a South African breeder, or by a South African breeder alone. In that case there is nothing to prevent the granting of plant breeders&#x2019; rights.</p>

<p><span class="col_1079-1080" refersTo="page_0554"/>I just want to say this: I find it peculiar that such great play is made of the argument that we shall lose. Had you listened to the main reasons advanced by the Opposition, Sir, you would have been entitled to accept that all other countries in the world had reciprocal plant breeders&#x2019; rights. Up to to-day England has not got it. Can anybody give me an example of anything England has wanted to import from countries where they have patent rights and which she has been unable to import? All countries in the world do not have it. I did not find that it was only those countries with patent rights or plant breeders&#x2019; rights to protect their own breeders, which had the best fruit and the best seed producing or the best decorative plants in the world. No, that is not the position.</p>

<p>I am not prepared to say that the plant breeders in England are less progressive than the plant breeders of America, for example. I can advance an argument against reciprocal plant breeders&#x2019; rights in a young country which I think proves my point. Because the plant breeders in South Africa stood to gain so little, practically nothing, and because there was so little protection for them, they more or less did not consider it worth their while to breed. This request that we have now reached a stage where we should protect our plant breeders and give them an opportunity of deriving some benefit from the work they put into such breeding which, as the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) has said, is a long and expensive process, (and if the plant has been cultivated here we know it will adapt itself to our climatic conditions) stems from a desire to have some incentive to take part in the development of our country, particularly in the development of the agricultural industry. Hitherto in South Africa it has really only been the Department of Agricultural Technical Services that has undertaken the cultivation of useful plants and which has really shown results that have been of great economic value to our country. They devote much time and attention to, and a great amount of money is spent on the cultivation of new and improved varieties and to make those new varieties available to the farmers. Their value does not lie, in the first place, in the fact that they are so different, but in their adaptability to the conditions we have in this country. For that reason the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) is right when she argues that much time and money is devoted to it, but the hon. member is wrong in the further conclusions she draws. My argument is precisely this, that plant breeders overseas have received many thousands of rand from us over the past years for plants that were patented here before they had proved themselves to be really useful and adaptable to South African conditions. It is therefore not only those people who receive royalties and who have the right to import plants from breeders overseas and to sell them for a certain period, but this legislation also protects those who think that because a plant is so beautiful and wonderful overseas that it has even been patented and registered there, against buying that plant before it has proved itself to be adaptable. A nation does not exist for the sake of a law, but laws are made for the sake of orderliness and in the interests of a nation. Let us pass this Bill as it stands, and if time and experience should teach us, which I hope will not be the case, that our country is losing in one way of another as a result of the rights that have been conferred, while those rights are not extended to overseas breeders, then I and my Department shall be the first to amend this legislation in the interests of South Africa. It will not be the first Act that will be changed to suit circumstances after the necessary experience has been gained, circumstances that could not have been foreseen. In the interests of the country the legislation will then be changed. For the reasons mentioned I regret that I cannot accept the motion.</p>

<p>On Clause 3,</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>I beg to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 60, after &#x201C;department&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;who has legal qualifications&#x201D;; and in line 4, page 5, to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;shall&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Whilst plant breeders&#x2019; rights are being established, one of the main pivots of this Bill is Clause 3 which deals with the designation of the registrar and other officers. The clause says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister shall designate an officer in the service of the Department as registrar, who shall exercise the power and carry out the functions assigned to the registrar by this Act.</block>

<p>These two amendments I am proposing are submitted because I feel that the whole effect of this new Plant Breeders&#x2019; Act depends upon the way in which it is going to work in practice. I know that the Minister&#x2019;s Department has scientific experts who are fully capable of dealing with all agricultural matters, but the Minister himself will agree that employees in the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, who include plant and agricultural experts, are possibly not lawyers or versed in dealing with patent law. I feel that it is a matter of very great importance that the registrar who will exercise the powers and carry out the functions designated to him by this whole Act must be a scientist or agriculturalist from the Minister&#x2019;s Department with some legal qualifications because that is required for the purpose of registration. The registrar will have to come to very important decisions and he will have to make decisions on possibly contentious plant breeders&#x2019; claims. This used to fall under the Registrar of Patents under the Patent Act of 1952. Now the Registrar of Plant Breeders&#x2019; Rights will have to pass judgment on applications by plant breeders and his decisions have to do justice to those citizens and to the plant breeders themselves. This clause is also tied up with Clause 22 which provides for a board of appeal, and the presiding officer of that three-man board of appeal shall be &#x201C;appointed by the Minister on account of his knowledge of law&#x201D;. I submit that the inclusion of those words &#x201C;appointed by the Minister on account of his knowledge of the law&#x201D; is an admission by the Minister and his Department that legal qualifications are necessary, but under this Bill they will only be available on appeal. Therefore I ask the hon. Minister to consider this very seriously and to agree that the officer in the service of his Department who administers this Bill shall have some legal qualifications. I feel sure that amongst the top personnel in the Department of Agricultural Technical Services there must be material available with those qualifications from whom to draw the incumbent of this new post of Registrar of Plant Breeders&#x2019; Rights.</p>

<p>In support of what I am asking in this amendment, I wish to refer to what the Registrar of Patents himself said in the evidence he gave to the select committee. On page 97 he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Department of Agricultural Technical Services could obtain a good registrar who has some legal knowledge, he would be able to do the work very much better than we could.</block>

<p>I would therefore ask the hon. Minister seriously to consider this amendment. Section 4 in the Patents Act itself (the Act of 1952) lays down the qualifications required for the Commissioner of Patents, and there it says that he shall be a retired Judge or an advocate of ten years standing. Thus there is a concrete admission that the Commissioner for Industrial Patents shall have high legal qualifications. Surely it is equally important that the Registrar of Plant Breeders&#x2019; Rights should have at least legal qualifications. Otherwise the Court of Appeal, as laid down in Clause 22, is going to be burdened with costly case after case brought by plant breeders because of difficulties in decisions that could arise with a registrar if he has no legal knowledge himself. Therefore I feel that it will be both a saving in time and expense for the Minister and his Department if it is laid down in this clause that the Registrar should have legal qualifications.</p>

<p>Regarding the second amendment, as the clause reads it says that the registrar may consult. &#x201C;The registrar may, in the exercise of his powers and the carrying out of his functions, consult anyone, who, in his opinion, possesses a special or expert knowledge of a plant in respect of which application for plant breeders&#x2019; rights has been made or any matter, <span class="col_1083-1084" refersTo="page_0556"/>including any legal question, which he is required to decide. &#x201D; It is considered an improvement and a safeguard to the general public and to the plant breeders themselves, whom we wish to protect by this Bill and this clause, that the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; should be changed to &#x201C;shall&#x201D;, so that the registrar shall consult. The word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; is obligatory whereas the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; is merely permissive, and perhaps the registrar would not consult on all occasions. We feel that the clause could be improved by the changing of this word, so that the registrar, while he is encouraged to consult as it now reads, will be obliged to consult. This is particularly necessary because this is a new Bill which aims at protecting the plant breeders.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>They say the easiest way out is not to argue with the fair sex because you never make much progress. I rather agree with them, if I can, instead of going against them but in this specific instance I really feel, as much as I would have liked to, that I cannot accommodate the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss). The reason being that I do not think we can really compare industrial patents with plant breeders&#x2019; rights. In the one case the registrar will definitely be much more concerned with the juridical aspect of the matter than in the other. When dealing with the soil and with nature, and you have to appoint a responsible officer, you will naturally appoint somebody who is highly qualified, with thorough technical knowledge, but I definitely think that when making such an appointment the emphasis should be placed not on his juridical qualifications and background but on his botanical background, his knowledge of plants. When should he register or decide to register? In the first place he must decide to register if he is convinced that it is a plant which, in terms of the provisions of the Act, falls into a category which is registerable. And in order to do that he has to have a knowledge of plants, etc. If he feels he should obtain legal advice he is free to consult the departmental legal adviser, because we have a full-time legal adviser in our Department. If he still wishes to approach the state legal advisers he is at liberty to do so. He can consult them at any time before he decides to register or not to register. I do not think the registration of plants will be a daily occurrence because the plant breeders know that they will only be able to register a plant if it conforms with the requirements of the law. Say, for instance he refuses to register then you can appeal, and when you appear before the Board of Appeal, provision has been made for somebody with legal knowledge to be present and to act as chairman of that board. Secondly, we give the person who has applied or who has lodged an objection the opportunity of getting an advocate, or an attorney to state his case. I think we have to a large extent complied with what the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) wants. Because the positive cases where registration does indeed take place does not come into the picture at all. The hon. member is really worried about the possibility that justice will not be meted out to that person who has been refused registration. The Board of Appeal has a legally trained person as chairman. I might just mention that in the draft Bill which is before the British Parliament they talk about a &#x201C;controller&#x201D; where we talk about a &#x201C;registrar&#x201D;. They will perform the same functions but as far as I can ascertain their legislation does not lay down that when a controller is appointed he should be somebody with legal knowledge, because just like us, they feel that he should, in the first place, have expert knowledge of the botanical aspects on which he will have to judge rather than of the legal aspects. I do not think, therefore, that this amendment of the hon. member will improve the Bill. We need not anticipate any difficulty in the application of this measure if the registrar is not somebody with expert legal knowledge. If there is somebody in the Department with both qualifications, we shall obviously give preference to the person who has legal knowledge as well, but I cannot at the moment think of such a person, because the scientists usually steer clear of the law and concentrate more on other directions of specialized study and training.</p>

<p>It is not of course possible to move an amendment to this clause because that would require an instruction, but I would like to ask the hon.

I do not wish to go into any detail, but I believe that we do now appear to be reaching the stage where apparently most countries are going to have some form of plant breeders&#x2019; rights and not patent rights. That seems to be the trend throughout the world. If that is so, it would be a very good thing if there were reciprocity between the countries, and I do hope that the hon. Minister will bear that in mind and that if a move to that effect is taken, as I believe it will be taken, that South Africa will play her part in trying to work out something sensible in the interest of all the countries.</p>

<p>I would then, if I may, like to indicate that the line I take will have the effect that a person who may feel aggrieved by the action of the registrar in refusing an application for the registration of plant breeders&#x2019; rights, will have the right to test the position in the Supreme Court. As matters stand, such an aggrieved person will have the right to appeal only to the board referred to in Clause 22, a board which is something very different and, I suggest, less adequate than the Supreme Court. In the first place we are dealing here with rights which may be of considerable economic value. It is a right which hitherto has been granted in the case of ornamental plants under the Patents Act, and it is a right, I suggest, which should enjoy the same degree of care in its administration as it has in terms of the Patents Act. Under that Act one has the right to go to the Supreme Court if one is aggrieved at the decision of the Registrar of Patents. The clause standing in my name is drafted <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to introduce the right of appeal to the courts that a person has under the Patents Act. It has been suggested by the hon. the Minister in reply to the motion I moved that there is an appreciable difference between a plant and an industrial patent. But I suggest that as far as disputes are concerned there is no valid reason why recourse to the courts should be denied. It remains a valuable economic right in connection with a technical subject, such as a plant is, and it can be of great importance to the injured person.</p>

<p>In addition, as things have stood under the Patents Act, where ornamental plants could be patented, an aggrieved person could go to the courts. There is no reason to follow the procedure of bringing all matters connected with plants under plant breeders&#x2019; rights and to remove recourse to the courts. It has been suggested that cost is an important factor. That will be a matter which any appellant will consider very carefully; but so often these matters are of considerable financial importance and merit recourse to the courts. If it is said that the courts have no knowledge of plant matters, my reply is that that applies equally in the case of patents of involved machinery and chemicals. They have no knowledge of those matters independently of the proceedings before the court. Those proceedings provide for expert evidence being placed before the Judges, who have the benefit of that evidence, and in addition they are assisted by an expert assessor, if necessary. Identical procedures can be followed in regard to plants. Expert evidence can be led and an assessor who is an expert in agricultural matters can sit in the case.</p>

<p>I am aware that in Clause 22 the chairman of the board is to be appointed for his knowledge of law. Well, that is something, but it is not so much a knowledge of law which is vital in these matters; it is the judicial approach, the sifting of facts, which with years of experience becomes the peculiar attribute and skill of the judicial officer, whether he be a Judge or a magistrate. That is not something which is acquired by a person who simply has a legal degree. In addition, a person versed in the practice of the courts develops a knowledge which enables him to attach the appropriate weight to any evidence that is placed before him.</p>

<p>Therefore it is no surprise that where the Patents Act deals with a comparable officer, the Registrar of Patents, it requires that that officer should not merely have a knowledge of law, but that he in fact be an advocate of at least ten years&#x2019; standing or a retired Judge. It may be that there are others who through their practice or their experience on the Bench acquire that knowledge, but I emphasize that it is that quality one should look for, rather than a mere knowledge of the law.</p>

<p>These matters in regard to plants will doubtless concern mainly the farming community, and it cannot be overstressed that they, above all, are a section of the community which has <span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0558"/>implicit faith in the courts, and lays its difficulties with great confidence at the foot of a Judge. There is no reason why that should be denied to a person who feels aggrieved under this Bill. Indeed, I suggest that one is minimizing the importance of plant breeders&#x2019; rights if one suggests that appeals be dealt with by some inferior appeal board.</p>

<p>So I seriously ask the hon. the Minister to incorporate this amendment, which cannot but ensure that the whole matter of plant breeders&#x2019; rights is well administered, and that a good body of precedents and decisions grows up in relation to plant breeders, such as has occurred in the case of patents. The appeal to the courts is a well-tested procedure, and I suggest that there is no adequate reason for departing from that custom of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. the Minister has not replied to the hon. member, I take it that I must assume that he is not prepared to agree to the deletion of this clause and the substitution of the amendment on the Order Paper. Will the Minister tell us what his attitude is?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>My attitude is that while the Chairman of Committees has told the hon. member that he cannot move his amendment, why should I reply to him? For that reason I sat down. If he had come forward with an amendment that was in order, I would have advanced my reasons for not accepting it.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Be that as it may, it is quite clear that the point has been put to the hon. the Minister that for technical reasons it will be better if the appeal in this case goes to the Supreme Court rather than to the board constituted in terms of the Bill. I wonder whether the Minister, who apparently believes that it should stand as it is, would give us his reasons for believing that an appeal in such matters, which may involve these difficult questions, should go to the board and not to the Supreme Court? Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to indicate whether, if that is his view, he would be prepared to accept an amendment to this clause, in line 73, to omit the words &#x201C;if any, and such decision shall be final and binding on the appellant and the other party&#x201D;, and to substitute for those words a provision which allows of an appeal from the decision of the board to the Supreme Court. All we are seeking is to get the best possible piece of legislation on the Statute Book. Personally, I do not believe in appeals like this, which may involve large sums of money, going to a board. I think it is far better for it to go to the courts, but no doubt the Minister&#x2019;s Department has good reasons for suggesting the establishment of such a board, but I hope the Minister will tell us that he agrees with what I have said, that it would be advisable that the decision of that board should be subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>I would certainly not have agreed to Clause 22 as printed had I not been convinced that it would work well in practice. We have, for example, other boards of appeal in the agricultural field. So far we have not experienced any difficulty when they have had to test bulls in proclaimed cattle improvement areas. Boards consisting of people with specific knowledge of that particular breed. I also have in mind the Deciduous Fruit Board which operates daily at our ports passing or rejecting consignments of fruit for export where large amounts of money are also at stake. That too is done by a board and not by a person with legal knowledge. My attitude in this matter is not to make it more difficult for people to appeal against a decision with which they are not satisfied, but to make it easier for them to do so, but also to constitute the board in such a way that they will have faith in the legal correctness of the judgment. That is why we talk about a person with legal knowledge. I shall certainly not appoint a young person who has just obtained his degree and who has had no experience. In addition there is a departmental official who will certainly not be concerned with any personal interests. He will be appointed because of his technological knowledge. I think the board will function well. My appeal to hon. members opposite is this: Let us give this legislation a chance. Then I shall do what the hon. member for Germiston (District) has asked me to do, namely, not to close my eyes to the defects in the Act, but to come back to this House if there are defects, and put them right.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister whether he is prepared to give further consideration to this point and if he should decide that it is desirable that there should be a right of appeal to the courts, whether he would move an amendment in the Other Place? I am not asking that the board be abolished but that it should be possible to take the decision of the board on appeal to a court of law.</p>

<p>I do not want to bind myself, because I am afraid that by doing that I shall in advance nullify the work of this Board of Appeal. Because when people are dissatisfied they will want to appeal. I notice that they have something similar in the proposed legislation which is considered by the British Parliament. The hon. member for Pinelands has referred to it. It is stated there that the person should have had seven years&#x2019; legal experience, but they also lay down that the decision of the board shall be binding without the right of a further appeal. I do not know whether they have had insight into our law, or vice versa, but perhaps they are thinking just as clearly as we are on this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The object of moving the amendment to this clause is to leave the position in regard to plants as set out in the Patents Act, unchanged. The effect would be to avoid discrimination against the foreign breeder, and thereby we would run no risk of infringing the terms of the Paris Convention. I do not wish to recapitulate the arguments I advanced in regard to the notice of instruction, because they all apply here. Those arguments have been rejected by the House. Therefore I suggest that the clause be negatived. We do so in order to be consistent in our actions.</p>
