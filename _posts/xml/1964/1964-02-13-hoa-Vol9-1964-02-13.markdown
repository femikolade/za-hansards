<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this side of the House will support the third reading, because we agree with the principle as stated at the second reading and as reiterated at various stages in the Committee Stage that any threat to the security or the safety of South Africa <span class="col_1285-1286" refersTo="page_0657"/>must be countered. We have expressed our strong objection to measures included in this Bill, measures which we believe go far beyond the scope which we believe to be necessary. It is the old story of taking a sledge-hammer to kill a gnat, but unfortunately the wrong sort of gnat. If it had been aimed in the right direction we would have been more enthusiastic in our support. But despite our objection to those provisions, we will not oppose the Bill. [Interjections.] My hon. friend says we do so because it may damage this party, but he ought to know that we have never been wanting in loyalty to South Africa.</p>

<p>The Minister gave an undertaking in the Committee Stage&#x2014;and I remind him of it&#x2014;that if it is found that this amendment does in fact make all the offences mentioned in Section 17 of the Act punishable &#x201C;in the opinion of the commission&#x201D; he will introduce a further amendment to correct this. I think there is considerable doubt on that point and we will remind the Minister in due course of his undertaking that this Bill only makes the commission of an offence prejudicial to the safety of South Africa a matter to be determined in the opinion of the commission, but on all other matters the holder of a licence can defend himself on the basis of fact and not of opinion. Therefore, retaining our reservations against Clause 5, we support the Bill.</p>

<p>I have inquired into the matter and I was again advised that this particular matter, namely the opinion of the commission, refers only to matters prejudicial to the State. If it is found that it goes further than that, I can assure the hon. member that I will amend the Bill at the very first opportunity. I appreciate the support given to the Bill by the Opposition. I can also give them this assurance that if it does happen that it is considered that the commission has acted unjustly to a licensee, I will see that the matter is immediately rectified if it is brought to my attention.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>On Clause 8,</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister, when this matter was discussed last night, did not exactly make the position any clearer than it is now. This is the clause which provides that if a person leaves this country&#x2014;and I am particularly referring to South African born nationals&#x2014;with an exit permit endorsed that he is leaving permanently, he becomes <i>ipso facto</i> a prohibited immigrant. The hon. the Minister when he introduced this Bill said that the effect of this clause was that such a person would lose his citizenship and that was all there was to it, and when we argued the matter in the course of the debate and we pointed out to the hon. the Minister that the effect that this would have on such persons would be to make them stateless and to affect those obligations which we had assumed under public international law, the hon. the Minister agreed and said that these persons had to be received back into the public because we were a party to the International Convention of The Hague. Why is the hon. the Minister making them prohibited immigrants? If it is his purpose, as he has stated that they should lose their citizenship when they say &#x201C;I am leaving the Republic for good,&#x201D; then why does he not say so? Why does he make them prohibited immigrants? Because if he makes them prohibited immigrants then surely they have to be treated as prohibited immigrants are treated, that is to say, they have to be sent out of the country as soon as possible; they have to be detained in detention barracks and then removed as soon as possible. The hon. the Minister knows and he has accepted that he cannot remove them because they are Union-born nationals, so what is the object of this clause? Clearly it is not just to deprive them of citizenship because if it was the hon. the Minister could have said so clearly. He has not said so and the matter still remains very obtuse. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister can tell us now what he has in mind, what he wants to do, so that we do not have to argue this matter backwards and forwards without having any explanation at all from him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>I think the time has arrived that we had some clarity on where the Opposition stands in this connection. It is high time that we had clarity on that. This clause deals with people who cannot get a passport. They are so bad that they cannot get one. They are saboteurs; they are people who besmirch us overseas; they are enemies of South Africa.</p>

<from><span class="col_1287-1288" refersTo="page_0658"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, they are of necessity. If he is not, then he can get a passport. I want to put this question to hon. members opposite: Supposing we were dealing with such a person who could not get a passport because he was a subversive element; he cannot get a passport because the Minister and his Department regard him as an enemy of South Africa. They know that the minute he places his feet beyond the borders of this country he besmirches South Africa; he gives evidence against South Africa at UNO; he attends the Addis Ababa conference, he joins the so-called military army which wants to attack South Africa. The only way that person can leave the country is to apply for a permit to leave the country permanently. In other words, as the Minister has said, he shakes the dust of South Africa off his feet. He resigns from South Africa. When you resign from the United Party you have no right to claim the protection of that party; you let it go; you have finished with it. This man also resigns from South Africa. He says: &#x201C;I do not want to have anything further to do with you; I no longer want to be a South African citizen; I do not recognize you; I want to settle permanently abroad; I am an enemy of yours. [Interjections.] Let us first solve this question before I answer the hon. member&#x2019;s question. Is the hon. member in favour of such a person being deprived of his citizenship? Let the hon. member get up and reply.</p>

<p>Where is that stated in the clause?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Why should a person leave this country with a permanent exit permit if he can get a passport. If a person wants to leave the country on business, for example, or say for instance an engineer wants to undertake work in Canada and wants to go and live there permanently, all he has to do is to apply for a permit &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<p>May I reply now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>No, then I lose my turn. Such a person then applies for a passport. He goes to Canada and if he wishes to remain there permanently he applies for Canadian citizenship and the moment he acquires Canadian citizenship he loses his South African citizenship. There is nothing in the Bill which prevents a person from leaving the country permanently in good faith if he wants to go and work elsewhere. But there are people whom the Minister does not want to allow to leave the country and who <span class="col_1289-1290" refersTo="page_0659"/>are those people? The people whom he does not want to allow to leave the country are those people who want to go and harm us overseas; people who betray their country there. That is why the Minister does not want to give them a passport. But there are some of them, people like Bunting, for example, who say they want to leave the country permanently. They have to convince the Secretary of the Interior that they wish to leave the country permanently. They then make application, as Sobukwe did. I want to put this question to the hon. members for Durban (North) and Florida (Mr. Miller): When that type of person applies for permission to leave the country permanently, are those hon. members in favour of his retaining his South African citizenship?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Sir. Do those hon. members want people like Bunting and Sobukwe to retain their South African citizenship or do they not want it? That is the crucial question. I quite agree with the hon. member that if those people were born here we should accept them back if they are deported; but then they are not South African citizens and we can deal with them. Mr. Chairman, those hon. members do not have the courage to say whether they are willing to deprive those people of their South African citizenship. That is the point; that is the whole point. It has nothing to do with those people who leave South Africa in good faith to go and settle in another country, because the procedure they have to follow is very clear. As I have said, they simply apply for a passport and the passport is issued to them if they are decent people and they then follow the normal procedure; they assume the citizenship of another country and lose their South African citizenship; if they wish to return to South Africa they follow the normal procedure. They apply for a visa; they apply for a temporary permit and they apply for naturalization. As far as I understand the law they can become naturalized within a year because they were South African citizens previously. But we are not dealing with those people under this Bill. Here we are dealing with people who cannot get a passport and the only people who cannot get a passport are those who are enemies of this country, people like Bunting and Hodges &#x2026;</p>

<p>What about schoolboys who have been refused passports?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member talks about schoolboys. Did they apply for permission to leave the country permanently? They were refused passports because the Minister had good reasons to refuse to issue them with passports. [Interjections.] Hon. members can make as much noise as they like. I say that if those people wish to leave the country permanently they are at liberty to do so, but then they have to convince the Minister that they want to shake the dust of South Africa off their feet. My question to those hon. members is this: When a person says he wishes to shake the dust of South Africa off his feet should he retain his South African citizenship, yes or no? What does the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) say? [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) has given his explanation, but it is an over-simplification. He tells us that any man who makes application in this manner, saying that he wishes to leave the country permanently, and has been refused a passport, is necessarily a saboteur, who will go to UNO, who will be a traitor to South Africa, who will demonstrate in Trafalgar Square and who will be an enemy of the country. Sir, I want to say that that is one category but I should like to give him another category. The hon. member for Vereeniging asked last night in the second-reading debate whether we could give him one case that fell out of this class, and I should now like to give him one case. Hon. members will remember that there was at one time a University College of Fort Hare. When the University College of Fort Hare was dissolved and when in its place there was established a tribal college, there were three classes of members on the staff&#x2014;those who were accepted and who were willing to be accepted as permanent members of the staff of the new college; those on the other hand who were rejected by the Minister of Bantu Education because they were unsuitable as members of the staff, but there was a third class. There was a class of men who were university lecturers and professors who did not wish to take office as lecturers and professors in what they regarded as an inferior institution. One of these is a gentleman I know, an African lecturer. Instead of accepting a post of that kind he wished to proceed overseas and pursue his studies for a doctorate in physics. He is a physicist, and if there is a class of man that we want in South Africa it is physicists. What was he to do? Could he proceed to a university in South Africa? No. We have separate universities in South Africa. The people are divided on racial lines. He could not go to Witwatersrand or Cape Town or Natal or <span class="col_1291-1292" refersTo="page_0660"/>Rhodes. What was he to do? He was anxious to proceed overseas to a British university which has a special reputation for physical research. He applied for a passport and his application was refused. What was he to do? He was prepared in order to pursue his studies, to make this declaration; he made it and he is now overseas. Is he a saboteur? Is he a traitor to South Africa? The hon. member for Vereeniging quoted a class of South Africans in respect of whom we agree with him, but there are other people as well. It depends purely and simply on what the Minister will say. It depends on what the Minister says, not on what Parliament says. The decision lies absolutely in the hands of the Minister, and for that reason we have raised this objection to Clause 8, as the hon. member for Durban (North) has done. I hope the hon. the Minister will make the concession for which we are asking.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has quoted the example of the lecturer who was anxious to continue his studies overseas. But if his sole motive was to go and continue his studies overseas I am convinced the Minister would not have refused him a passport. The hon. member knows that what he is saying here is not correct. That person wanted to go overseas in order to besmirch the policy of the Government. He refused to co-operate with this Government. The hon. member himself said that this lecturer had regarded this college or university as &#x201C;an inferior institution&#x201D;. Hon. members opposite regard all these Bantu colleges as tribal colleges and as inferior institutions. We, on the other hand, regard these colleges as the right place where Natives should receive their education. I am convinced that the motive of this person was not to continue with his studies; it was his specific object to besmirch the Government of the day in the countries overseas. We are not prepared to issue such a person with a passport so that he can go overseas and besmirch our country there. Why does the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) not get up and reply to the question put by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) then we shall know where we stand. You want a reply from the Minister to-day but you are not prepared to give us an honest reply. No, you are too scared to answer.</p>

Mr. Chairman, the time has arrived for hon. members of the Opposition to show their loyalty to the Republic of South Africa. We are tired of their wanting to protect the saboteurs.

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not share the touching faith of the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout). I have had many occasions over the past few years when I have asked for reasons for the refusal of passports to persons who wished to leave South Africa for perfectly legitimate reasons in order to pursue their studies overseas, persons who have come with references from the most irrefutable sources, persons who have had first-class academic records and who have applied for passports and who have had those passports refused by the hon. the Minister of the Interior without any reason at all being given for the refusal. [Interjections.] If there were these obvious reasons which hon. members now say are apparent to them, perhaps they would explain to this committee why it is that on no single occasion does the Minister of the Interior give any reason for his refusal. Sir, that is as far as academic fields are concerned. I can quote one specific instance of a brilliant young journalist from this country who wrote articles, some of which might have criticized the Government, an African journalist, it so happens, who had a brilliant academic record, who wrote brilliantly for newspapers in the country and who had his articles published abroad as well and was offered one of America&#x2019;s top journalistic awards, the Nieman Fellowship which is held at Harvard University. This man was not able to get a passport, and since he did not wish to pass up the opportunity of enjoying the fruits of his scholarship he applied for and obtained an exit permit. As I understand it, this Bill is retrospective. Now this man who got this exit permit at that time did so knowing that should he come back to South Africa he would of course, face imprisonment.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member would occasionally look at legislation before he accepts it, then maybe measures would not <span class="col_1293-1294" refersTo="page_0661"/>go through this House so simply. If he will look at his Statutes, he will see that if a person who has taken an exit permit comes back to this country, he will go to prison, if he is found guilty of that offence, without the option of a fine, for a period of not less than three months and not exceeding two years. That is the existing law and that is now being changed. But such a person was prepared nevertheless to take an exit permit, knowing that if he came back he would serve a compulsory term of imprisonment. Now he cannot come back at all because he is declared a prohibited immigrant in terms of the amendment which is now being introduced. I think this is a completely arbitrary and high-handed way of dealing with citizens in South Africa who because of the narrow-mindedness of this Government are unable to go overseas and take advantage of the opportunities offered at higher schools of learning and then come back in order to resume their citizenship. Sir, that is only one aspect. I am now going to cut out the frills and get down to tin-tacks. The real issue at stake here which, of course, largely hinges on political persons &#x2026;</p>

<p>I think if Sobukwe has applied for an exit permit, as the hon. the Minister tells us he has&#x2014;and I gather that the result of this amendment is the reason why all this is being held up, and if he is given an exit permit then it should be under conditions clearly understood, and if he wishes to resume his citizenship he should be entitled to do so because he has committed no crime since his detention. Under the normal concepts of justice, when a person has served his term of imprisonment for a crime which he committed, that person goes free until he commits a crime again. That has not happened in the case of Sobukwe; he has committed no crime since his term expired. Sir, I was against <span class="col_1295-1296" refersTo="page_0662"/>this section in the General Law Amendment Act which allowed the imprisonment, without trial, of people for life who have served their sentences. I am against this clause for the same basic sort of reason.

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) is very dissatisfied because the Government refuses to give the reasons why a passport is refused. That being the case I take it that the hon. member has already been dissatisfied about this for many years because no Government in this country has ever yet given the reasons for refusing to issue anybody with a passport. In that regard the action of this Government does not deviate one iota from that of any previous Government and I can also assure the hon. member that it is not the intention of this Government to deviate from it in future.</p>

<p>The question of the issue of a passport is a question that has to be treated on its merits. Every application for a passport is treated on its merits. If a passport is refused it is refused not simply because the applicant is opposed to the Government&#x2019;s policy. I wish to emphasize this that an application for a passport is not refused simply because the applicant is opposed to Government policy. There are other reasons as well why passports are refused. Very often financial considerations come into play. Passports are refused because of considerations other than purely political considerations. To expect the Government to give reasons why a passport has been refused is, I think, a very rash request. I wonder whether the hon. the Opposition has ever thought what the consequences could be to the person concerned if the Government were to give the reasons why a passport had been refused to him. If it is a case where a passport was refused because of financial considerations, I think the hon. Opposition will realize what tremendous harm could be done to such a person if the reason for the refusal were to be made known to the world.</p>

<p>I was particularly struck by the argument that those people who had left the country on permanent exit permits might become stateless. As far as I am concerned it gives me a very interesting insight into the thoughts of the United Party as to the class of person for whom they are actually pleading and about whom they are actually concerned. Who is the class of person who will return stateless to South Africa? If somebody to whom a passport has been refused for sound reasons&#x2014;not only for political reasons, but for sound reasons&#x2014;convinces the Secretary for the Interior that he wishes to leave the country for good, a permanent exit permit is issued to him. When that exit permit is issued to him and he leaves the Republic of South Africa he automatically loses his South African citizenship the moment he leaves. That person now arrives overseas and he causes such a lot of trouble there that that country sends him back. That, Sir, is the type of person for whom the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) and hon. members of the United Party plead. They are pleading for the person who cannot even find a home in the big wide world; the person with whom the big wide world does not want to be saddled and want to send them back. That is the type of person for whom the United Party is pleading to-day, Sir. When that person returns, that person with whom the big wide world does not want anything to do, then South Africa has to take him back in terms of The Hague Convention. It is not necessary to make provision for that in this Bill because we are subscribers to The Hague Convention; that is why we have to carry out its terms. When that person arrives in South Africa he is subject to the penalties which were laid down in the law in 1955 and even prior to that, namely, he is subject to a penalty which varies between three months to two years without the option of a fine. That has been the law since 1955. When he is thrown back to South Africa the position is that he can apply for a permit to live here temporarily. If he wants to go beyond that he can apply for a permit to reside here permanently. After that he may apply for naturalization and that is granted in terms of Section 10 (8) of the Citizenship Act. In that way such a person can again find a home. I want to draw the attention of the House to the class of person for whom the United Party is pleading. With this plea of theirs they are trying to wreck the arrangement which is made here for well-ordered citizenship, something of which every nation ought to be proud.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister spoke about the person who has gone to any of the Western countries. He takes it for granted he went to a Western country and that he becomes a communist or something like that; he stirs up trouble there and that country deports him. But what about the South African who has gone to, say, Kenya or Ghana and because he stands up for South Africa or the White man and is deported from there? Now we will not accept him back here. The hon. Minister says we are trying to protect a certain type of person, such as a saboteur who has left the country for good. But could that person not be a South African who has gone to one of those countries which are hostile to us; and realizing how hostile they are and realizing how wrong he was about his attitude towards his country wants to return to the country of his birth? What about him? The hon. the Deputy Minister says we are protecting the man who goes to a Western country from which he is deported because of his bad behaviour. He takes it for granted that he behaved badly there because he was a communist or something like that and is <span class="col_1297-1298" refersTo="page_0663"/>deported from that Western country. But he might be just the reverse. He might be kicked out of one of the Black states because he stands up for the rights of South Africa or the White man generally. Does that justify the hon. the Minister to treat him like a prohibited immigrant? It might well be that once he sees such a Black state in operation that he was wrong about South Africa and now wants to return.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am quite sure that the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) has not read the Bill properly, otherwise he would not have had that problem. Anybody who goes to Kenya or Ghana, for example, normally applies for a passport. It is issued to him and he goes there. And when he wishes to return he applies there in the normal way for permission to come here. We issue him with a visa, he returns and lives here as he did previously. Surely that was stated very clearly by the Minister when he introduced the legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I really got to my feet to say something about a wrong impression created by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) and to a lesser extent by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore). They created the impression that the Government refused passports to its political opponents and then compelled those people to leave the country. That was how they put it. The Leader of the Progressive Party in South Africa, Dr. Jan Steytler, went overseas recently. He is a political opponent of this Government if there is anybody who can be described as a political opponent of the Government. Did we refuse to issue him with a passport? No, we allowed him to go overseas and to do what he wanted to do and he is back in South Africa to-day. We did not refuse to issue him with a passport. There are other people whom we can quote as examples. There is Albert Luthuli. When the Nobel prize was awarded to him did we refuse to issue him with one? I shall give other examples. There is Stanley Uys. He was issued with a passport and he went overseas, and what did he do there? In Ghana he disavowed his allegiance to South Africa in favour of Nkrumah. We gave Sow-den a passport and he went to America where he attended UNO and accused the South African Minister of Foreign Affairs from the gallery of telling an untruth and appealed to the people not to listen to him. My question to the hon. member for Houghton and Kensington is this: Should we issue passports to people to go and do what Stanley Uys did in Ghana? Must we do that? Is such behaviour worthy of South Africa? Do hon. members regard that as normal political opposition? Do they regard that as political opposition to the Government of South Africa? I should like the hon. member for Houghton to reply to that question, because they say we are forcing the political opponents of this Government to leave the country permanently. I have given a few examples and there are many more that I can give.</p>

<p>I should be pleased if they would stop once and for all creating the impression in the outside world, as the hon. member for Houghton has done, that we want a one-party State; that we want to do away with all opposition. Having this one example in mind I should like her to tell us how she comes to that conclusion and also what she thinks of the actions of those people who leave the country and do what they have done.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Both the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) are wrong in their approach to this particular clause. If the hon. member for Vereeniging remembers the debate last night, Sir, he will know that the main issue here was the question of placing difficulties in the way of these people returning. In doing that we were speaking with the backing of that side of the House as well. I do not know whether this hon. Deputy Minister is in difficulty because he is trying, on the one hand, to satisfy the political demands of certain members on his side of the House and, on the other hand, trying to satisfy the Minister of Immigration. Obviously hon. members did not listen last night so I shall again have to read what the hon. the Minister of Immigration said last year. The hon. the Deputy Minister will remember that I quoted the Minister of Immigration. I said there was obviously a difference of opinion and that that was becoming more marked. This was what the hon. the Minister of Immigration said&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is the point at issue, Sir. We have also made it quite clear to the hon. the Deputy Minister that we are not voting against this clause. All we are asking the hon. the Deputy Minister is, with the power which the Minister of the Interior has to meet these cases, and as he said last night, each case will be treated on its merits, to give these people the utmost consideration if they wish to return to South Africa. [Interjections.] We are not starting an argument with the hon. member for Vereeniging, Sir, about whether we are supporting <span class="col_1299-1300" refersTo="page_0664"/>Sobukwe or anybody else. That is not the issue at all. The whole issue, based on the statement by the hon. the Minister of Immigration, is that we and he believe that the need for immigrants in this country is so great that these people should be encouraged to come back. That is the position. We do not want any obstruction put in their way should they wish to come back. Because we believe, like the Minister of Immigration, that they will make good citizens, that they will be better South Africans when they return and not worse. I think that crystallizes the issue.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken has been under a totally wrong impression ever since last night. He argues as though those people who left South Africa and emigrated to Australia, for instance, went there on a permit. He argues as if that is the position but that is by far not the position. He must understand that once and for all. It was explained to him last night and I want to explain it to him once again. Those people went to Australia, or wherever it might have been, on a passport. The people we are discussing here are those who left on a permit, such as Bloomberg, for example, who left the country and said he did not want to return. They are really the saboteurs, the people who, for some personal reason or other leave the country and do not want to return; those people who want to leave the country for political reasons. Those are really the political saboteurs. Those are the people whom the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) want to protect. The Opposition cannot get away from the question posed by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) by saying, as the previous speaker did, that they are people who left the country on a permit to go and live elsewhere also and who now want to return. The people under discussion are those who left because they were political saboteurs. They will now be dealt with in terms of this clause.</p>

<p>I want to return to what the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has said. He talks as though the only effect of this clause will be that a person must be redeported if he is a prohibited immigrant. Does the hon. member not know that many other consequences can flow from the fact that you are a prohibited immigrant; you do not of necessity have to be re-deported. The hon. member for Durban (North) argues that because you cannot again deport him, because you have to accept him back, this entire clause is valueless. That is an incorrect statement. If you are a prohibited immigrant many other consequences can flow from that. Action can be taken against you, you may be sent to gaol; you are a criminal. Or you can take steps right from the beginning to arrange your affairs in South Africa. You can again apply and say: &#x201C;I am a prohibited immigrant but for this reason I want to have my position in South Africa regulated&#x201D;. The person to whom the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) has referred, the person who has gone to Ghana and who wishes to return, is somebody who can immediately come and say: &#x201C;I want my position regulated.&#x201D; He can do so in terms of the law as it stands at the moment. It is not necessary for him to be redeported or even to go to gaol. I hope the position is now clear.</p>

Nobody on this side of the House is pleading for any one at all in respect of this clause. This is not our approach to this clause. We were party to a part of the Citizenship Act by which a man can renounce his South African citizenship if he wishes to. We are not disturbed about the person who leaves South Africa permanently and says he does not want to come back losing his citizenship. That is not what disturbs us at all. The point that was raised last night, the point that was raised this afternoon, the point that has not been answered either last night or this afternoon is this. First of all, we know the Government can refuse to issue a passport to a citizen. We know this is a universal truth in all the Western countries of the world. We know the Government can refuse a passport. What is a passport? A passport is merely an identifying document which entitles the holder to certain facilities which his Government provides in the countries in which he travels. That is all it is. The purport of this clause is not whether or not the man should have a passport. This refers to the man who leaves the country with an endorsed exit permit &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>As I have said, we do not mind a man losing his citizenship in those circumstances. That is quite understandable; that is reasonable. But why does the hon. the Deputy Minister make him a prohibited person? Is it necessary to make him a prohibited person? Why is that necessary? If he does come back, either because he is deported here or because he wants to come back or because he becomes destitute in some other country, when he arrives here he arrives with the status, not of a South African born national, but with the status of a prohibited immigrant. And a prohibited immigrant, as far as I am aware, when he arrives here has to be put into custody. I know they are going to be charged with leaving the Republic without a valid document because when they return they are deemed to have done so. We know all that; that is nearly ten years old. What we are concerned about is this: Why is the hon. the Deputy Minister changing the law now? Why does he not say they will lose their citizenship? That was the question which we put last night; that was the question put this afternoon; that is the question I now put again, and that is all that we raise in this matter. What is the hon.

<p>It is interesting to note that all the hullabaloo we have had from the United Party has now actually dwindled down to this one limited question: What is the position of the prohibited person? Mr. Chairman, I am somewhat surprised at the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) who is a legally trained person and who should know this like most people know the alphabet, namely, that: If you do not have this provision in the regulations governing residence, regulations in connection with entering and leaving a country, the necessity to have a passport falls away entirely. If you were to delete this question of prohibited persons from the legislation the necessity to have a passport in this country or in any other country falls away, because in that case any person can freely enter and leave a country. There will be no limitation; no penalties will attach to him; there will be no way in which the State can clamp down on him. The only way in which it can be done is to describe him specifically as a prohibited person. That is the logical consequence of abusing a passport. If this were to be deleted we might just as well do away with the entire system of passports.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The percentage that went on a permanent exist permit will be negligible. The majority of those people, therefore, who went to Ghana or wherever it might have been, on a passport are free to return to South Africa any day; they will not be subject to any penalties; there is no limitation on them; there is no difficulty. It is really not necessary for the hon. member to be worried about them therefore. Just as little is it necessary for hon. members to be worried about those South Africans who have emigrated to Australia or New Zealand, who have regretted it after a year or so and want to return. The majority of those people, as a matter of fact I think practically most of them, went there on ordinary passports and permits to leave <span class="col_1303-1304" refersTo="page_0666"/>the country, not on permanent exit permits. They went on ordinary passports which enable them to return, just as the immigrants in this country do in respect of the countries from which they have come. The Dutch immigrants, to give on example, who are in possession of a Dutch passport, return there year in and year out; they visit their families there, they return and they work here until such time as they eventually acquire South African citizenship. That is also the case in respect of these South Africans who are in Australia or New Zealand at the moment. They are not affected by this provision in the least. I, therefore think, Mr. Chairman, that the opposition which has been raised so far is really groundless.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I intend to register my opposition to this clause. I voted against the 1955 Act which tightened up considerably the regulations as far as passports were concerned and I certainly would have voted against the second reading of this Bill had I been here yesterday. But I should like to register my disapproval at least to this particular clause for reasons I have already given. I really got up to correct one or two incorrect statements made by the very voluble member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). He kept on referring to Mr. Bloomberg as one of the persons who left this country as he thought, I gathered, on an exit permit and therefore should not be allowed to return and if he did return would be declared a prohibited immigrant and so on. But he is quite wrong, as he often is, in the information he gives to this House. He would need to amend this amendment considerably to prevent Mr. Bloomberg from returning to this country since Mr. Bloomberg, in fact, left on a valid passport. I want to go a little further, Sir. I think the hon. member referred in passing to Mr. Bloomberg as one of the saboteurs. To the best of my knowledge the only real grudge that the Government has against Mr. Bloomberg is that he helped to expose the whole Broederbond business. I wanted to correct that incorrect statement about Mr. Bloomberg, who is a reputable journalist and who left on a valid passport and therefore, I say, had no connection with saboteurs, etc.</p>

<p>The other point I wanted to make is that one of the hon. members opposite asked me whether I would agree that certain persons should go oversea sand &#x201C;beswadder&#x201D; South Africa&#x2019;s name abroad, and he mentioned a few specific cases. Obviously I cannot take responsibility for individuals who leave this country. I would say that as a general rule a South African person should be entitled to a passport as he would be in any other country of the world. Passports in other countries are certainly not refused on the grounds on which people are refused passports in South Africa.</p>

<p>I know because of the practice followed. People get passports in other countries certainly not as a matter of right but as a privilege. That is the same in this country here.

<p>I want to say further that people who go overseas, as opponents of the Government, like Dr. Steytler for instance, do far more good to South Africa than Government spokesmen who go overseas, and who perhaps should be stopped from going if the Government wants to stop the damage done to South Africa. Such persons who go overseas and demonstrate to the outside world that there are people, other than people who go in for unconstitutional means of fighting the Government&#x2014;that there are other people who are strongly opposed to the Government and deplore the Government&#x2019;s policy of racial discrimination, do great good for South Africa and nobody could have done better for this country than a person like Dr. Steytler.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I would ask the hon. member for Houghton to give us a word other than &#x201C;reputable&#x201D; to describe a respected lady like herself, seeing that she has now finally degraded that word in the English language by linking it to the fugitive journalist Bloomberg.</p>

<p>But to come to the United Party, I think that party should do some soul-searching. One listened with surprise to their arguments against this clause. The hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) advances the argument against this clause that if an immigrant leaves South Africa permanently with the intention of settling in another country, that will hinder his return, whilst our Minister of Immigration said that that is not our intention. I think the hon. member for Umlazi inferred from the careful avoidance of his statement by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) that he had the cat by the tail, or really did not even have a tail in his hand, viz. that the category of persons to whom he refers leaves the country in the ordinary way with a passport. Then the hon. member for Durban (North) quickly ran away from the argument of the hon. member for Umlazi and said: No, but we misunderstand their argument; their argument is actually that in terms of other legal provisions it is clearly correct that anyone who commits an act which is in conflict with his South African citizenship loses that citizenship. Therefore those who leave merely with an exit permit, thereby indicating that they want to abandon their South African citizenship, will lose it. And what the hon. member now wants to know is why this clause now goes still further, and in addition declares such a man to be a prohibited immigrant. Then the hon. member kicked this argument about a little, and <span class="col_1305-1306" refersTo="page_0667"/>possibly he looked into the eyes of his hon. Whip who now sits so suspiciously near to him, and then he rectified his argument and said: Actually the argument is not that this man now loses his South African citizenship and that an additional penalty is now being added, but the fault with this clause is really this: Why does the Minister not provide expressly in the clause that the person who leaves South Africa with a final exit permit loses his South African citizenship? If the hon. the Minister would only say in his explanation, or write it into the Bill, that someone who leaves with such a permit loses his South African citizenship, they would be satisfied. Sir, there are now three United Party angels who are trying to dance on the point of a needle. They do not have any real objection. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), an intelligent man, has advanced the only argument which may perhaps save the United Party from their predicament. He said: Here and there we find that some of these people who leave South Africa do so permanently, as in the case of a Coloured who wants to further his education abroad, who in fact is not a political enemy and who will be more heavily punished by the effect of this clause than he considers to be reasonable. But that is the closest that party could get to an argument.</p>

<p>Why did those hon. members try to raise an argument against this clause? As the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) has said, the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) finds this provision as bitter as gall, and the members of the United Party find it as bitter as aloes that this Government is effecting measures whereby enemies of South Africa who have shaken the dust of this country from their feet will not be able to re-enter the country when they want to do so except in an illegal manner, and who on their reentry will be dealt with as illegal entrants.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to ask this: Can any patriot say that any man who of his own free will says, &#x201C;I leave this evil land and I never want to return to it&#x201D;, should be allowed to freely re-enter it? Can anyone ever grant such a person who has deserted the country the right to return to it without being guilty of a lack of patriotism? No, nobody can advocate that, and that is why the Whip of the United Party has been circulating amongst the speakers on his side in order to silence them and to minimize the harm done as far as possible.</p>

<p>The Opposition must not think that they will so easily avoid this issue by remaining silent. I have the deepest sympathy for the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). He has had to keep them quiet. Even he could no longer bear to see them acting so stupidly.</p>

<p>But I want to return to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). She delivered an impassioned plea here for Sobukwe. She said that if Sobukwe left the country, he should be allowed to return. But according to the information that appeared in the newspaper, Sobukwe wrote to the Minister of Justice and said that he and his wife and children wanted to leave this country permanently and never wanted to return.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about Sobukwe. I want to know from the hon. member what her attitude is. I understand that Sobukwe is an extremely intelligent man, a man with a strong personality. He gave the Minister his word of honour and said: I want to leave South Africa with my wife and children and I will never return again. Now the hon. member says that he should be given the opportunity to return. I want to know this from the hon. member for Houghton. I hope that she has the courage to answer this question: We have the evidence from Sobukwe that he never wants to return. Did Sobukwe give the hon. member any other information? Where does she get that information from? Did Sobukwe give her other information?</p>

<p>Then why is the hon. member making such a fuss? In case he does return! And he will return in order to continue his acts of sabotage, his incitement, his agitation and his efforts to bring about the fall of this Government by force. I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton whether she believes Sobukwe when he says that he wants to leave permanently? Does she think that saboteurs who say they want to leave the country permanently will never want to return? No, they will leave in order to escape punishment here. If they want to leave and really do want to leave permanently, let them do so because then they can do nobody any harm. But they want to attend the sabotage schools at Addis Ababa, the sabotage schools in Egypt and the sabotage schools behind the Iron Curtain. They want to return to this country and the hon. member wants to allow them to go unpunished. She takes it upon herself to say that Sobukwe is not speaking the truth. He is committing perjury when he says that he never wants to return to the country again. She is the witness who tells us that Sobukwe will return. Sir, this proves precisely how necessary this clause is. Sobukwe will want to return again but we will not allow him to and if he does return to this country he will be imprisoned again. But that is the attitude adopted by the hon. member. Where <span class="col_1307-1308" refersTo="page_0668"/>is the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) now? I have something to say to him but he is not here. Let me then put the question to the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw): The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), a respected member of the Opposition, has mentioned the case of a lecturer at Fort Hare who has left the country permanently; he has said that he wanted to leave the country permanently and that he never wants to return. Nobody asked him to do so. He said this on his own initiative because he no longer liked South Africa. He no longer liked us. He wanted nothing to do with South Africa; that was why he said that he wanted to leave permanently. We did not ask him to do so. He said that he wanted to do so. My question to the hon. member for Durban (Point) is this: Does he think that such a man should retain his South African citizenship? I want to put a very easy question to the hon. member: Is he going to vote against this clause? No reply. The hon. member for Houghton said that she was going to vote against this clause because it was unjust. I want to make a prediction. The hon. member for Durban (Point), all 300 lbs. of him, is going to vote for this clause; he is going to put all his weight behind this clause, literally and figuratively. This clause is going to break the sound barrier with his weight behind it. I see that the hon. member for Durban (North) has returned. He wanted to answer a question that I put to him but it appeared that this would be in conflict with the rules of the House. The hon. member for Durban (North) then had the opportunity for ten minutes to reply to my question but he still did not reply to it. I want to ask him whether he is going to answer my question now or whether his Whip will prevent his doing so? I am going to ask the question again and I am going to ask it in pursuance of what the hon. member for Kensington has said. The question is this: Does the hon. member for Durban (North) think that the Bantu lecturer at Fort Hare who decided to do a thesis at Oxford or some other place and who refused ever to return to South Africa should retain his South African citizenship?</p>

<p>The hon. member now wants to stand and reply to me and rob me of my turn to speak, but I am not so easily robbed of my turn to speak. Let him answer this easy question: Is he going to vote for this clause? We are going to vote just now and I am sure that he has known for a long time what he is going to do. If he is going to vote for the clause I would like to know why all this fuss is being made. I want to say something else. They decided originally to vote against this clause because they had not read it properly. Most of them, like the hon. member for Durban (North), wanted to vote against this clause because they were thinking along precisely the same lines as the hon. member for Houghton was thinking. But when the matter was discussed and they realized what they were going to vote against and what they were going to let themselves in for, they held a council of war under the leadership of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). He said: &#x201C;In heaven&#x2019;s name, keep our people quiet; we are not going to vote against the clause&#x201D;. They realized that they were going to fall into a trap. This is the most pitiful, the most tragic thing that I have ever experienced. It is no wonder that the only pleasure in life left to that party is to vent their spleen upon an innocent gentleman like the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell).</p>

We also do not want enemies of the country to be allowed to return, but the names mentioned to-day of Dr. Steytler, Bloomberg, Stanley Uys&#x2014;They are not enemies of the country, and this Bill is not designed to keep them out.

<p>On Clause 9,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 9 and 10 and in line 16, respectively to omit &#x201C;April 1963&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;July 1964&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The object of this amendment is to deal with those people who became aliens with the passing of the Commonwealth Relations Act in 1962. We have been over this position and the debates have been recorded in Hansard. We discussed it with the hon. Minister of the Interior during last session, and I think the position is understood by all. The purpose of this clause as set out here is to put beyond doubt what the position of these people is. I concede that it does that, it puts beyond all doubt where they stand now. But we would like to put this particular point: This clause will take further rights away from them without any warning. When these people were given time, when they became aliens, to register their intention to reside permanently in the Republic, they did not all take advantage of that opportunity. I believe in many cases they were confused about the issue. But here is a case where retrospectively to April last year, another right is being taken away from these people and that is the period of qualification for citizenship which they have already accumulated to their credit. Because as from the passing of this clause, those people will have to qualify anew for South African citizenship, irrespective of the fact that they might have had four years residence during the last eight years, or in many cases considerably more. In his speech last year, the hon. Minister of the Interior said that he wanted to make concessions to these people and that he wanted to meet them. He has done that to a certain extent by extending the period and legalizing that in this Bill&#x2014;to 1 April 1963. But we believe that that is not quite enough, because we are of the opinion that these people should have a warning that if they do not now do it, they will lose their qualifying period as well. They have had no notice of that and this is the first notice they have had. We believe that it will not do any harm at all to extend that period to 30 June, or in other words, before 1 July of this year. That will give those who really intend to register, the opportunity as from now to 30 June, to take warning that the closing down is coming and they have adequate time to register between now and 1 July this year. I believe that is a concession the hon. Minister can make without causing any upsets. It does give those people who live in this country and who have a stake here and for whom the Minister of Immigration does not have to find employment, a further chance to become citizens. They are all working here, and they have got into our way of life, and that makes them good citizens. I believe if the Minister would accept this amendment he would not only be making a gesture to those people, but he would gain many useful South Africans.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment. In this clause a very great concession is being made to these 2,000 dilatory people. It is not true to say that they were not given sufficient warning. They were told in this House by the hon. the Minister that the closing date would originally be 31 December. That was transmitted over the radio and published in the Press and it was known to everybody who was interested and wanted to take notice. Therefore it is not correct to say that they did not know.</p>

<p>In regard to the difference of opinion, I may say that representations were made to the Minister last year by the hon. members for Umlazi and Durban (North). They held a certain view, but the law advisers did not agree with them, and as the result of the standpoint adopted by the law advisers they have now amended this clause to make it clear that it would be extended to 1 April. We have the greatest sympathy with those British subjects in the country who hope to become citizens in the future. That is why last night, in reply to the plea of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City), I stated that the cases of British subjects who find themselves in peculiar circumstances and apply for naturalization after the expiry of this period will be consideres sympathetically and on their merits. It is really a great concession and I hope they will make use of it. But I want to repeat the appeal I made yesterday that the British subjects in this country who do not now fall under this clause and who cannot become South African citizens in this way should now register for permanent residence, so that we will not again have to hear in a year or two in this House that those people were not warned and that they had no knowledge of it. Let this appeal of mine please serve now to spread the information that if they do not fall within this extended concession and do not become South African citizens as from this day, they should at least take the next step, which is a pre-requisite for naturalization and citizenship, namely to register themselves for permanent residence. I want to express the hope that hon. members opposite will also convey this to their voters so that we will not again be reproached in a year or two.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that in terms of this clause we have made a great concession, and however much sympathy we have for British subjects I just want to emphasize <span class="col_1313-1314" refersTo="page_0671"/>that citizenship of South Africa, like that of any other self-respecting country, is not a cheap article. We do not intend forcing our citizenship on to people and to be continually amending our legislation and extending the period so as to include new groups again, just because we want to force our citizenship on to people. Our citizenship should be regarded as something desirable. The United Party, which also boasts that they are South Africans, should now strengthen the hands of the Government in this respect by having a high regard for our citizenship, and by supporting a concession like this and appealing to their people to take the necessary steps I have indicated.</p>

It seems very obvious to me that the law was not as stated in that circular, but something else. It is for that reason that the Deputy Minister cannot come along now and say that we are asking for more notice and more time for these people. We are not asking for a warning in respect of the same thing that we asked for before. The Deputy Minister must remember what happened in 1962 when this provision first came up, and when the House divided and we walked over and voted with the Government on the principle that Commonwealth citizens who had had adequate warning and did not avail themselves of the opportunity to register and become citizens, had had sufficient opportunity. Our attitude has not changed at all, but our attitude in respect of these people is the same as it was in respect of those people, and it is this. We are about to change their rights and to provide that they will lose something which they have credited to them, i.e. the number of years, up to a maximum of four out of the last eight years, which will count towards their citizenship. The Deputy Minister must appreciate that there is a difference between what happened last year and what is happening now, because quite clearly they were entitled to become citizens and to be registered for permanent residence one year afterwards, provided they had four years out of the previous eight. But now, without any warning at all, they are told that from the time this Bill is passed they will not have any credit for the time they were here lawfully as Commonwealth citizens. They are being told that as from April 1963, and even before that, their period of residence counts for nothing at all. Can the Deputy Minister honestly tell the House that there are no people who, if they knew this was the law, would not have applied by April 1963?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>But the Minister does not know how many people there are who, had they known that they would have to start all over again and wait another five years, would not have registered by 1 April. No one can say that, but I must assume that there are such people, and I think that the Minister should know why we supported this thing at the time. It was for the simple reason that our status had changed and that these people should be given sympathetic treatment, and that they had sufficient time, more than six months, in which to make up their minds. Now this is what we are complaining about to-day, that the Minister is not giving them a chance to make up their minds in the light of the new position that exists in terms of this clause. I think that if the Minister really wants to be helpful and sympathetic, he owes it to South Africa and to the efforts of the Minister of Immigration to give these people some sympathetic treatment, and to give them a chance. If they do not take up the opportunity, our attitude is that they have had warning and it is just too bad. That was our attitude in 1962 also. But what is the urgency about this? Surely the Minister will agree that citizens who have lived in South Africa for ten years are more desirable than strangers, because they know our way of life. But can the Deputy Minister tell us what the Minister meant last year when this issue was raised under his Vote and the Minister said he wanted to get a complete picture in order &#x201C;to be able to make as many concessions as possible to these people&#x201D;? I think that means exactly what it says&#x2014;to make concessions to these people. And what is this clause doing? It certainly does not make concessions. It is making it as difficult as possible for them. It is turning them out into the street and saying that they are just to be treated like any other foreigners. But that is not the undertaking the Minister gave last year. This is going back on the word of the Minister, and I hope the Deputy Minister will reconsider his attitude in that light.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) is doing the hon. Deputy Minister a great injustice. <span class="col_1315-1316" refersTo="page_0672"/>Last year attention was drawn to the fact that there were about 2,000 tardy people who did not make application at the prescribed time. They will all be covered by this date that is now being inserted here. That undertaking was given in respect of those 2,000 people, but what do hon. members now want? They want the door to be opened more widely so that people who were not among those 2,000, people who have not yet even made application, should now be given the opportunity to do so. In other words, the number will be far larger than 2,000. There may be 6,000 people or more who will be considered if the Opposition&#x2019;s amendment is adopted, and that is the point. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister gave an undertaking last year but his undertaking was not that he would give unrestricted assistance to everyone. I realize that these people are good people who will be a great asset to the country, but I also realize that the United Party have very guilty consciences to-day because they deterred large numbers of people from making use of that opportunity during the time when we were in the process of becoming a Republic. Hon. members are now delivering these strong pleas for these people because they want to salve their consciences. This may perhaps teach them a lesson not to act in this way in the future. I want to ask hon. members to be reasonable. Those people will not lose their right to make application for naturalization along the normal channels. It appears to me that hon. members are interpreting this to mean that these people will now have to wait for a further four to five years before they can make application. I do not read the clause in that way. I read it to mean that if they have already been in the country for four or five years they will be able to apply for naturalization in the usual way.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will tell us that he agrees with the interpretation given to this clause by the hon. member for Heilbron. If that is the interpretation, I again suggest that there is a lack of clarity in this clause, which justifies amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I think there is perhaps a misconception here. These people can apply after a year. In that respect the hon. member for Heilbron is correct, but they do not then have a right to become naturalized. That is the case to which I have already referred. The Citizenship Act provides that persons may apply after a year and then the Minister, if special circumstances exist, may approve of naturalization after a year. But that is not a right which can be claimed. In other words, the persons who do not fall within the category referred to in this clause must normally wait five years before they can be naturalized. They can start applying for naturalization after 4&#x00BD; years, but as I said a moment ago and also last night, those people who have to wait five years must first make arrangements for permanent residence, because their naturalization can only be considered as from that time. If the British subjects who have not yet made arrangements for permanent residence do so now, and there are some of them who after a year feel that there are special circumstances applying in their case which put them in a position to receive consideration under Section 10 (8), they can apply for naturalization, and if their special circumstances are such that the Minister is satisfied, he can grant naturalization after a year. I hope it is now clear.</p>

<p>I would like to reply to the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. Mitchell). He is evidently under the impression that last year, when the Minister spoke about an investigation, he thought in terms of all the remaining non-registered British subjects in the country. That was not the case. I think we should be clear about this intention the Government has. The intention never was that all British subjects could automatically acquire citizenship. The final date was set at 31 December 1962. The Government intended that to be the final date, but doubts arose, as was communicated to the Government by the hon. member and the hon. member for Umlazi. They interpreted it as meaning that they should be granted an even longer period. It affected particularly those 2,000 dilatory people who made their declarations after 31 December 1962 and up to 31 March 1963. The Government&#x2019;s intention never was that those people could automatically acquire permanent residence. But because doubt existed the Government felt that it would remove the doubt and make a concession by now changing the law so that these people could have up to 1 April 1963 to apply. That is a concession which was made because doubt existed, but the original intention never was for it to be for that period, but up to 31 December. I hope that this concession will now be accepted, because it goes further than was originally intended. It covers these 2,000 people, but it definitely does not cover those people who want to apply after that. They must do it in the way I have just explained.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>We have the case of these 2,000 people. The difficulty is that this clause has been interpreted in two ways, as the Minister has admitted, and clearly the Minister&#x2019;s own Department at first interpreted it in the way which we considered to be the correct one. That is apparently now being changed and this clause will make it difficult for these persons to obtain naturalization. But I do not want to go into the technicalities of the thing. I want to make a plea to the Minister. We are seeking to get all the immigrants we can from all over the world. There is a group of persons who may have to wait a longer period for citizenship, which may be the full five-year period, but in very special circumstances it may be shorter, and in my view an injustice is done to these persons by this amendment, because the Minister admits there is a lack of clarity in the law, and when <span class="col_1317-1318" refersTo="page_0673"/>you clear up a lack of clarity you should at least do it on the basis which is most favourable to the persons concerned.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister said it was capable of two interpretations, but I am not arguing on the law. I am making a plea to the Minister. Here we are doing everything we can to build up our White population. The Government is spending hundreds of thousands of rands to get new immigrants. Among the persons who, as the result of this clause, will not be able to get citizenship are a limited number of cases who may perhaps convince the Minister that there are special circumstances, but in the majority of cases it will take the full five years. We have persons who have been in this country for many years and many of them could already have applied for citizenship had they wished to do so. But the test is this. They have been here and if they have convictions naturally they will not be naturalized. The granting of naturalization is in the Minister&#x2019;s hands. He controls the situation, and in those circumstances I submit that as the law was capable of two interpretations and his own Department made a mistake, he can forgive these persons for having made a mistake and allow them to make application. If the Minister is not prepared to do it here, my plea is that he should undertake to reconsider this clause entirely with a view to making it possible for the persons covered by this clause, if they apply within a limited period from now, to be granted citizenship, because most of them are people who have already shown that they are worthy citizens.</p>

<p>It is very clear that any immigrant entering the country has now to wait five years before he can become a citizen but the period of 2&#x00BD; years has already elapsed in the case of these people who will be ruled out in terms of the provisions of this clause because they did not apply. If they apply after two years, they will be in the same boat as immigrants who may be entering the country.

<p>Those people are people who are already well known. It is very clear that they are good people. If they were not good people, the Minister would have refused their applications. But if they are people who have proved over the years that they have been in this country that they are worthy of becoming citizens of the Republic, it is within the Minister&#x2019;s power to approve of their being given that citizenship.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I said that this clause dealt with the 2,000 tardy people and allowed them to apply. Let us imagine that these particular people were not tardy. There is apparently a difference of opinion amongst hon. members of the Opposition. They say that those people who did not publish that notice will now have to wait for another five years. Well, I do not read these provisions in that way. I want to tell you how the Act reads. Section 10 of Act No. 44 of 1949 states that the Minister may on application in the prescribed form and subject to the provisions of Section 29, grant a certificate of naturalization as a South African citizen to any alien who satisfies the Minister&#x2014;and then the requirements are set out in the office of the Minister, not less than one year and not more than six years before the date of his application&#x2014;that such person is not a minor; secondly, that he has filed a written declaration of his intention to apply for a certificate of naturalization. It is this certificate that we are discussing now. But then the Act goes further and provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he has been lawfully admitted to the Union for permanent residence therein.</block>

<p>There is no question about this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he is ordinarily resident in the Union and that he has been so resident for a continuous period of not less than one year immediately preceding the date of his application, and that he has, in addition, been resident in the Union for a further period of not less than five years during the seven years immediately preceding the date of his application.</block>

<p>I do not interpret the provisions of this clause to mean the suspension of this section and an amendment of the Act in respect of those persons and that they should be told: &#x201C;You will have to stay in the country for a further <span class="col_1319-1320" refersTo="page_0674"/>five years from the date of this notice before you can apply.&#x201D; I really think that if hon. members consider the section in that light they will find the solution to their problem.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to reply to the arguments that have been raised here. In the first place I briefly want to discuss the question of immigrants and citizenship. I hope that the position will not become confused. The Opposition have now raised the argument that on the one hand the Minister of Immigration wants immigrants to come to this country and on the other hand the Department of the Interior places so many restrictions upon immigrants that we frighten them away. Mr. Chairman, these are not conflicting ideas. We want immigrants but if immigrants come to this country they must at least know what the requirements for citizenship are. Those requirements are laid down in our Citizenship Act. That is why I said in my introductory speech that the clarification contained in this measure was necessary for the information of our immigrants so that they would know what was required of them. That is why I cannot see how this measure can in any way deter immigrants. When a person emigrates to any country at all, he does at least know what the requirements for citizenship are and he complies with them. Mr. Chairman, these 2,000 tardy people are actually the people who have been borne in mind and I hope that it will now be clear for once and for all that this is the group that is to a large extent being assisted by this concession. It was for the sake of that group that the concession was considered by the Minister. To say now that insufficient warning has been given to these people, is not correct. All the arguments raised by hon. members of the Opposition strengthen my conviction that their consciences are troubling them to a large extent in regard to this matter. In the years gone by the Opposition started such a fear-mongering campaign that it deterred these British subjects from applying for citizenship. They predicted the most ominous things that would befall us if we became a Republic. That was the propaganda of the Opposition. I hope therefore that the Opposition will also stop making all this fuss because this sort of thing does have a political sting. I want now to quote to hon. member the particular section in our Citizenship Act that refers to persons who can apply after a year. Section 10 (8) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, in such cases as he thinks fit, grant an application for a certificate of naturalization notwithstanding the fact that the applicant, if he had previously been a South African citizen or a Union national, or if, in the opinion of the Minister, there are particular circumstances present in his case, has not been resident in the Union for the additional period of not less than four years during the eight years immediately preceding the date of his application as required by paragraph (d) of subsection (1).</block>

<p>It actually means that such person may perhaps have been in the country over a period of eight years; he may have left the country for a while, but if the period during which he has moved back and forth amounts <i>in toto </i>to eight years, then the Act lays down the four-year period of residence as a requirement. On these grounds such person may, after a year&#x2019;s ordinary residence, apply for naturalization and in certain circumstances, the Minister may allow him to be naturalized after that year. I hope that the position is clear now. This is the attitude of the Government and the Government has never been in any doubt in this regard.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>In the first instance this clause embodies amendments to Section 8 of Act 19 of 1959 but these amendments are purely consequential. The expression &#x201C;State President&#x201D; is substituted for the expression &#x201C;Governor-General&#x201D; and the word &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; is substituted for the word &#x201C;Union&#x201D;. But there is also an additional provision and this is certainly most welcome. Pretoria is the seat of the University of South Africa and the City Council of Pretoria has already on various occasions in the past contributed to the University of South Africa although these contributions have not been regular annual contributions. But since 1962 Pretoria has been contributing a regular amount of R4,000 per annum and that is why I welcome the fact that the City Council of Pretoria will now have two members on the council of the University of South Africa. This also brings the principal Act into conformity with the statutes of other universities&#x2014;that city councils can obtain representation on university councils. In the second place I am also pleased that donors are also being given recognition and that donors will now also be given representation on the council of the University of South Africa.

<p>No, it is not in the Bill; we find it in our common sense.</p>

<p>I began last night, at the very friendly request of the hon. member for Zululand, to quote from this Bill, which is worded very clearly. Let me say that because hon. members have complained in the past that Bills have not been worded as clearly as they should have been, so clearly that every layman could understand them, I am very pleased that this Bill has been drafted in particularly simple and straightforward language. That is why it is not necessary for me to explain the provisions of this Bill to hon. members in great detail. With characteristic perception the hon. member for Zululand realized that if he asked me to quote the Bill every hon. member would understand its provisions. A fixed amount was laid down in regard to pensions for Judges in the 1959 Act, to which I shall refer hon. members just now, and we are now departing from that principle. We are no longer laying down a fixed amount; the pension will now be in proportion to the period of service of the Judge concerned. Hon. members will realize that this is not only a departure from principle but that it is indeed a departure which is certainly welcome and which it is hoped will be welcomed by hon. members of this House for the reasons that I mentioned last night. Sub-section (2) of the proposed new Section 3 inserted by Clause 1 of the Judges&#x2019; Salaries and Pensions Amendment Bill, 1964, provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Such pension shall be paid monthly at the rate of 20 per cent per annum of the annual salary attaching at the time of such person&#x2019;s retirement or removal from office, as the case may be, to the office then held by him in a permanent capacity and, in respect of every full year (if any) by which his period of continuous service referred to in subsection (1) exceeds five years, a further 3 per cent per annum of that salary: Provided that the annual amount of such pension shall not exceed an amount equal to 50 per cent of the said salary.</block>

<p>When previously a Judge retired&#x2014;it made no difference how long he had served as a Judge and it made no difference what the circumstances were&#x2014;he received a fixed pension determined according to the Act, but now a Judge may eventually receive a pension which will after 15 years&#x2019; service amount to half of his salary. Does the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) understand me when I explain it in this way? Well, then that is good.</p>

<p>Do you suggest that if the hon. member for Boland understands it we will all understand it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>No, I simply mean that the hon. member for Boland is my barometer; if he understands it then I take it that the hon. member for Kensington half understands it. It therefore amounts to the fact, as I have said, that after 15 years a Judge can be paid half his salary in the form of a pension. Hon. members must of course realize that Judges can only retire at the age of 65. They can also continue until they reach the age of 70 and it is actually an unwritten rule that Judges should remain in their posts until they reach the age of 70 if their health allows them to do so. It is encouraging to note how these old gentlemen are still doing their duty by the State and by our administration of justice at this advanced age.</p>

<p>Hon. members may now ask me what we are doing in regard to Judges who have already retired while we are now making ample provision&#x2014;and I emphasize the word &#x201C;ample&#x201D;&#x2014;for Judges who may retire in the future. Let me say quite clearly that I have a great deal of sympathy for Judges who have already retired. If it were possible for me to do so and if it were possible for the Government to do so, I should like very much to treat Judges who have already retired in the same way as Judges who will retire in the future. The fact that we have not done so here is certainly not because we are not in sympathy with them but it is because there are, very understandably, complications that will arise in regard to other public service pensioners if we make an exception in this case. Hon. members must realize that it is impossible to deal with Judges who have retired in the past in the same way as with Judges who will retire in the future. But I did feel&#x2014;and I think hon. members will share this feeling with me&#x2014;that we should do something in respect of the old gentlemen who retired at the age of 70, who are still alive and who are receiving smaller pensions. That is why hon. members will see that provision is being made in this Bill for an increase in the pensions of those Judges who retired at the age of 70. Their pensions are now being increased by an amount of R500. In brief, Mr. Speaker, these are the main principles in the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member has asked me about the widows. I explained this point last night but I shall do so with pleasure again for the sake of the hon. member who apparently was not here last night. As I said last night, the fact remains <span class="col_1325-1326" refersTo="page_0677"/>that this is a contributory pension scheme. Judges, just like Members of Parliament, contribute a certain amount each month in order to ensure a pension for their widows.

<p>We have had to deal with the cases of some of these widows. I do not know exactly how many are still living. Of course, they are free to petition the Select Committee on Pensions as they have done in the past. I know of some of them who have done so, and indeed, who have been granted pensions by the Select Committee. Hon. members will remember that pensions for the widows of Judges were first introduced in 1959 by the National Government which was then, just as it is now, in Government in South Africa.</p>

<p>These then in brief are the provisions of this Bill. The other clauses of this Bill have merely been inserted to convert pounds into rands and cents and I take it that hon. members will have no objection to them. I move.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on these benches welcome this piece of legislation. In fact, we have asked in the past that Judges&#x2019; pensions should be reconsidered. We welcome the increase which takes place as also the other provisions of this Bill. We are proud of our judiciary in this country. We believe it is right that additional provision should be made for various reasons. Firstly, the Judges have earned it; secondly, they stand in very high esteem and in no circumstances should they have any financial difficulties after their retirement. Of course, in very many cases, Judges&#x2014;and I believe it applies to far the bigger proportion of them&#x2014;have been persons who, in private practice, would have been able to make very adequate provision for their families. To my certain personal knowledge very many of those who have adorned our Bench were persons whose rate of income, at the time that they took their seats on the Bench, was anything up to five times and more the amount that they received when the honour of a judgeship was given to them. They did not hesitate, Sir. They have played a very big part in upholding the traditions of our judiciary of which we are all very proud. We therefore welcome the additional provision which is made here. We believe that it is right. We are very glad that the hon. the Minister will go into the question of the widows. It would appear that it is reasonable, but if additional provision is to be made there then there should be additional contributions. I sincerely hope that finality can be reached at a very early stage and that it may still be possible for legislation of that sort to be put before this House this year.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to associate myself with what the hon. member who has just sat down has said. Our legal system in South Africa is, probably one of the most outstanding, together with that of England, in the whole world. We have always had problems. Advocates who have had successful practices have experienced problems in joining the Bench in that they have suffered financial losses. The position has changed considerably. The difficulty as far as a Judge is concerned is that he may not be a director of a company. Mr. Justice Broome in his new book &#x201C;Not the Whole Truth&#x201D; states that a Judge may not resign to accept another appointment; he even says that after a Judge has retired he ought not to take up any other appointment; that he ought not even to enter politics. That is why it is an encouraging sign that these new scales have been introduced as far as Judges are concerned.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members on both sides of the House for the support which they have given to this Bill. I can make no promises to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) but can only say that as soon as finality has been reached in regard to this matter&#x2014;and that does not depend upon me&#x2014;if this House is not sitting, I shall take the matter further if the investigation shows that that is what should be done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) mentioned a point in passing which I wholeheartedly endorse. I should really appreciate it, as Minister of Justice&#x2014;and I think that the whole country and our administration of justice will appreciate it&#x2014;if retired Judges would pay attention to the words of Mr. ex-Justice Broome and not become involved in contentious matters&#x2014;let us call them that&#x2014;and not be guilty of contentious action, as is necessarily the case in politics. We are only human, Mr. Speaker. I can very well imagine&#x2014;this is only one obvious argument&#x2014;if a litigant loses a case before a certain Judge and the Judge then retires and immediately enters politics that that litigant may quite easily say: &#x201C;Yes, I lost because my politics differed from his&#x201D;. It is so unnecessary for our Bench to be placed in that position. Because better provision is now being made I also sincerely hope, together with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North), that we will not have a repetition of this sort of thing in the future. I thank hon. members for the support that they have given me in this connection.</p>

<p>Tenth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Tear-gas Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is truly a Bill which may move hon. members to tears because it is a Bill which deals with tear-gas. It is a Bill that has already been passed by the hon. Senate and which has already received the support of the members of that body. It is now being introduced into this House so that hon. members may also give their approval to it. The reason why we have to approach Parliament in connection with this matter is that it may sound strange even though it is a fact, that no legislation has ever been introduced in the past to control the manufacture and possession of tear-gas. I think hon. members will agree with me that not only as a result of the times in which we are living but also taking things generally, it is absolutely necessary that we should have control over the manufacture and possession of tear-gas. Mr. Speaker, it is a dangerous weapon and all dangerous weapons must of course be placed under control. By means of this Bill therefore we want to be able to control the manufacture and possession of tear-gas.</p>

<p>If hon. members look at the Bill they will see that it is provided in Clause 2 that nobody may manufacture in or import into the Republic any article that is used to release tear-gas or is intended for that purpose. He may only do so in terms of a permit which may be issued to him in terms of this clause. A factory was erected a short while ago to manufacture tear-gas in South Africa. Large-scale advertising was also done in connection with the sale of tear-gas. That tear-gas that is manufactured in that way is sold to members of the public in certain containers but it is the considered opinion of experts in this sphere that the ownership, or rather, the use of that tear-gas, holds far more danger for the user thereof than it does for the person against whom it is being used. Hon. members who have a knowledge of this matter&#x2014;I am convinced that the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) has a knowledge of this matter&#x2014;will agree with me that this is indeed the case. That is why it is not necessary for me to motivate this point any further for hon. members.</p>

<p>Clause 2 makes further provision whereby the manufacture or the import of the gas can only be done by way of permit. That permit can be withdrawn in terms of Clause 2 (2) if certain things take place; firstly, if the conditions under which that permit has been issued have not been complied with; secondly, if the person commits an offence in terms of this Bill and, thirdly, if and when it is in the public interest to withdraw such permit.</p>

<p>The other important clause in this Bill deals with persons who are permitted to have tear-gas in their possession. In the first instance of course there is the individual who is issued with a permit in this regard and in the second instance the class of persons published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> as being a class of persons who may possess tear-gas. Of course, the police form part of this class of persons as do members of the prisons department. I can also think of certain public bodies that may be classified as forming part of this class of persons.</p>

<p>The Bill also makes provision for inspection by the police and by a magistrate. Inspection similar to that laid down in the Arms and Ammunition Act, is provided for in this Bill. Clause 5 of the Bill sets out the offences and the penalties that may be imposed in that connection and Clause 6 of the Bill determines the scope of the Bill&#x2014;that it applies not only to the Republic but also to South West Africa.</p>

<p>The question that was put to me in the other place and that I want to answer here in advance is whether the passing of this Bill will not invalidate the licences that people have to possess gas pistols. My reply is, no; they will not be affected by it at all because that has nothing to do with this Bill. Gas pistols are, I think, covered by Section 25 of the Arms and Ammunition Act. A gas pistol has in terms of that Act been declared a dangerous weapon and a person owning a gas pistol to-day owns it in terms of the permit that he has received. So no matter what interpretation we give to this legislation, such person has not only obtained that pistol in a legal manner, but what is more, he holds a legal permit to have a gas pistol in his possession. I went into this point very carefully with the law advisers and they assured me that there was no doubt at all that persons owning gas pistols would after the passing of this Bill be able to retain those pistols and that nothing at all would be done to affect their possession of such pistols.</p>

<p>I told hon. members in passing that a factory had been erected for the manufacture of tear-gas. At a very early stage I warned the persons concerned in this industry that I was going to introduce legislation in this connection. I had long discussions with the people concerned. It is very pleasant for me to be able to tell this House that those persons are in complete agreement with the provisions of this Bill and that they are satisfied with its provisions.</p>

<p>These, Mr. Speaker, are the principles contained in this Bill which I now place before this House for its approval.</p>

<p>Sir, this is also a Bill which we welcome from this side of the House. It seems necessary that there should be control. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister is correct in regard to the gas pistol. The Arms and Ammunition Act is controlled by the <span class="col_1329-1330" refersTo="page_0679"/>Department of Justice and the Minister of Justice, I understand. It is just a question of the wording here, Sir, because it refers to the holding of a permit issued by the Minister. I think it is somewhat doubtful. It may be worthwhile checking it again. I take it that we have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that if that opinion turns out not to be correct at least no action will be taken by his Department.</p>

I can give him the assurance that these provisions will not at all affect a person who is in possession of a gas pistol, even though it might appear that the interpretation being given to this clause is not the correct one. If the interpretation is not correct I will make the necessary amendment but I can assure the hon. member that there is not the slightest danger that gas pistols will be covered by the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<block name="quote">That the House do now adjourn.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>I object, Sir, for the reason of the Order Paper as we find it to-day. I call to mind that recently, and particularly under the new rules, we decided to advance the first night-sitting day from the 6th to the 11th day in order to give the Government an opportunity of building up the Order Paper. Difficulty had been experienced and we returned to the old rule to allow the Order Paper to be built up. That does not appear to be sufficient, Sir. What we have been doing since Parliament commenced has been to adjourn early on various days so that there will be business for the subsequent days and to eke out the business from day to day.</p>

<p>This has the effect, in the first place, that when Bills are published we have to deal with them relatively quickly. Because of the meagre amount of business on the Order Paper, the business that is there has to be proceeded with at once. It does not give a fair opportunity to the Opposition to consider the measures that are coming before them. The Government are in the happy position of having considered the legislation, it having been before their Cabinet and having been with the department, with the result that they, or at least some of them, know a great deal about the legislation which comes forward. They are not placed in the position in which we are placed. They have the Minister in charge introducing a particular Bill. The Opposition is placed at a distinct disadvantage when Bills come forward rapidly and they have to deal with them immediately. That has been the case in the last few days. I do not complain about it in the sense that there have been many controversial Bills. It is true that there have not been many. I want to be quite fair in the opposition that I am making to this adjournment. There have only been a limited number of controversial measures so far in the Session.</p>

<p>The result of this&#x2014;and this has already been the case in regard to some of the measures we have passed during this Session, the publication of a measure and its passage through the various stages in quick succession&#x2014;is that the public outside are almost unaware of what legislation is going through in this House. There is no opportunity for outside interests to make their views known, and there is not the opportunity for members who are interested to consult outside interests. That was very marked in regard to one of the measures that we have passed. We managed by urgent messages and otherwise to get opinions and the views of large outside interests; the workers&#x2019;, commercial and industrial opinions we required. I think it is wrong that it should take place. If we are going to follow a proper parliamentary democracy then the legislation put through this Parliament should be passed in the full glare of public opinion. I think that is essential to the system that we practise in this country.</p>

<p>This is not a problem that belongs entirely to this Government. Other governments have had the same problem. But the observation I make this afternoon is that it is getting worse instead of better. And the Government promised to rectify this problem. The Prime Minister, on a previous occasion when this was raised, took very particular notice of it and said that the matter would be gone into and that it would be seen whether something could not be done. There may be various things that you may do. You may decide to start the Session later in the year and have Bills ready. I do not know whether that would make any difference. I know on earlier occasions when that has been done, when the session started later, the problem was still there in the earlier part of the session. It seems to me that the only remedy is that legislation should be published earlier, certainly sufficient legislation to keep us going should be ready and available. I do not want to be misunderstood in any way in what I have <span class="col_1331-1332" refersTo="page_0680"/>said. It does not detract from the very good relations that exist as far as the running of the mechanics of the House between the Whips of the two sides are concerned. That relationship has been excellent and when we have made representations in regard to Bills they have been met.</p>

I think this problem should have some consideration given to it. I know the Leader of the House has been concerned. I do not know what we are going to do next week, for instance. There is very little on the Order Paper to occupy the House next week. After all we are here to legislate and to get on with the business.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>I did not hear what the hon. member said at the beginning of his speech; I was unfortunately not here. But I think I know what he said and it is probably what he said last year. Quite apart from the fact that he probably said it last year, I must admit that there is a large amount of truth in what the hon. member has said. The hon. member knows just as well as I do the difficulties which any Government has with legislation at the beginning of the session. He has not only been Opposition Chief Whip, he has also been Government Chief Whip and he knows the difficulties.</p>

<p>Last year we had discussions in which he also took part, not only across the floor of the House, but at our weekly Whips&#x2019; meetings, meetings at which we tried to get round this difficulty of having legislation prepared earlier so that there will be sufficient legislation available to bring before Parliament in the first weeks of the Session, which are also the most difficult. At some previous alteration of the parliamentary rules, the majority, against the advice of the hon. Chief Whip of the Opposition and myself, who I think, knew more about the procedure of Parliament than the other members of that committee, voted that Parliament should start sitting in the evenings after the seventh day instead of the eleventh day. It was found to be completely impracticable. Parliament always reminds me rather of one of our very good mail trains: It starts very slowly and when it once gets into full speed, it is very difficult to stop it. But we discussed this matter and certain steps were taken. I can even mention that the Cabinet dealt with all legislation which had to come before Parliament this Session a month earlier than we had done in the past and a month earlier than hon. members on the other side did when they were in the Government, to try and get round this difficulty. Well, Sir, it seems obvious that if you start a month earlier to consider your legislation, you will have more ready. But it does not always work that way, because when legislation is agreed to by Cabinet, the different officials get hold of it and if they have so long to think about it, they start suggesting alterations, and to a certain extent you defeat the whole object of having that legislation ready a month earlier. I grant that this is an unfortunate state of affairs. But another reason that I can mention I think is to the credit of Parliament, but we did not foresee that possibility last year, and that is the new rules under which we are working. They have had quite a lot to do with it and we have been caught unawares. Because with the new rules not only are the speeches shorter, but the discussions are also shorter because the shorter speeches have created almost a feeling of urgency amongst all members that we must get on with the work. The prevailing spirit is to get on with the work and the result is that we find ourselves in this position. The number of Bills is not small. There are 19 Orders on the Order Paper and we have already dealt with various stages of 10 or 15 of these Bills. During this Session we have already dealt with 25 to 30 Bills, but this sense of urgency to get them through which has been engendered I think by the new spirit which has been created by our new rules is also a factor which plays a very important part.</p>

<p>I have already discussed this matter with the Chief Whip on the other side and we have already thought of various steps which can be taken, not this year unfortunately, but next year, to ease the position. But this is the position we find ourselves in at present, and I am afraid at the present time it is rather inevitable. We hope, however, that we will be able to discuss this matter in the recess and see that in future we will give Parliament in its present feeling of urgency and its desire to get legislation passed, ample work to satisfy its demands.</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether there has been an increase in the number of fatal motor car accidents on national roads during the past five years; if so, what has been the annual increase;</li>

<li>(2) how many people lost their lives as a result of motor car accidents in 1962 and 1963, respectively; and</li>

<li>(3) what action has the Department taken or does it contemplate (a) to reduce road accidents and (b) to investigate and analyse the causes of road accidents in South Africa.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#weiss">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) and (2) This information is obtainable from the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs.</li>

<li>(3)

<ol>

<li>(a) In 1955 a Committee was appointed to inquire into all aspects of road safety. Following that Committee&#x2019;s Report (UG No. 74/1958) legislation was introduced which was <span class="col_1337-1338" refersTo="page_0683"/>passed by Parliament as Act No. 1 of 1960 providing for the abolition of the National Road Safety Organization of South Africa and the establishment of the South African Road Safety Council. The latter Council was established on 1 April 1960 with the object of promoting and encouraging road safety in the Republic in all its aspects. The Council under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Transport has done and is continuing to do everything in its power to stem the tide of road accidents. In August 1963 on the recommendation of the Council a National Road Safety Congress was convened in Johannesburg at which the various governmental authorities (on the central, provincial and local level) and other interests concerned with different aspects of road safety were represented. The congress reviewed the progress that had been made in the attack on the road accident problem and approved the Council&#x2019;s comprehensive action programme for the promotion of road safety. Steps are being taken to implement the programme of action as far as possible. The Department and the National Transport Commission are contributing by way of the freeway policy for national and special roads, limited access road construction programmes with grade separation structures (traffic interchanges) at intersections, rigid access and ribbon development control and elimination of level road/rail crossings on such roads.</li>

<li>(b) None by the Department of Transport as such. The South African Police investigate road accidents and submit report forms from which the Bureau of Statistics makes an analysis of the probable factors contributing towards such accidents. Apart from this the South African Road Safety Council at the beginning of 1963 established a special division for the planning and co-ordination of road safety research. Through this division the Council encourages and stimulates research by various interested organizations including the National Institute for Road Research, the National Institute for Personnel Research, Educational Institutions and Industrial Psychological services, into, <i>inter alia,</i> the causes of road accidents and preventive measures. In addition the Road Safety Council has a special task group comprising representatives of the Department of Justice, the South African Police, the National Institute for Road Research and the Institute of Traffic Officers of South Africa as well as an insurance assessor which is going into the question of effecting improvements to the present methods of investigating road accidents.</li>

<p>Whether his Department has, during the past five years, stopped work in any factories because the health of the workers was threatened; and, if so, in (a) what types of factory and (b) how many of each type.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_labour" to="#radford">

<from>The MINISTER OF LABOUR:</from>

<block name="quote">My Department has no legal powers to stop work summarily. Unsatisfactory health conditions lead to the serving of requirements in terms of the Factories, Machinery and Building Work Act, 1941, as amended. Failure to comply with such requirements within a specified period could result in the cancellation of certificates of registration or legal proceedings.</block>

<block name="quote">During 1963, 13,712 health requirements were served on occupiers of factories and 161 certificates of registration were cancelled. It is regretted that further details are not readily available.</block>

<li>(2) and (3) No; the cars were tested in service on various sections between September 1957, and May 1958, when they were withdrawn from service as the tests proved that these cars were not popular with the travelling public. It was then considered that modification of the cars would make them more suitable if worked as counter-cars with lounge-cars attached, but the modification of the counter-car and the conversion of the cafeteria-car into a counter-car could not be undertaken for some time owing to shortage of staff and other more important work. The original counter-car was on hire to the Rhodesia Railways from December 1962 to December 1963, and the cafeteria-car was converted into a counter-car and tested with a lounge-car attached between November 1962, and February 1963, during which period the tests proved that this type of car is still not popular with the travelling public as a replacement for single dining-cars. The possibility of making use of these counter-cars on sections over which no dining-car facilities are provided at present is being examined.</li>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now reached the third reading of this Bill. There has been a great deal of discussion on it during its passage through this House. We have made ourselves quite clear on those items we have considered important. We are not so sure that the hon. the Deputy Minister, who has piloted this Bill, has done the same. I do not intend to recap what has gone in the second reading and the Committee stage&#x2014;we have discussed that quite thoroughly. But I do want to come to the point which we consider to be the main one in the Bill, and which is probably the purpose why it has been brought before this House, and that is the amendment contained in Clause 9. I do not want to recap the whole history of this clause. But the hon. the Deputy Minister knows that it is here as a result of some query, which he admitted yesterday, that two interpretations could be put on the Bill which was brought before the House last year.</p>

<p>We cannot see any need for the undue haste with which people are being deprived of the right to qualify for citizenship of South Africa. We expressed our disapproval of this by putting an amendment on the Order Paper. Our amendment sought to alter this clause to the extent that it would give these people a further period in which to apply for South African citizenship without loss of any of the qualifying period which they had accumulated to their credit. From expressions of the hon. the Minister of Immigration in this House he has shown his keenness and his willingness to back in principle what we were actually asking for in our amendment to this clause. We feel very strongly about this, Sir, and we feel that the number of people constitutes a large percentage of the existing White population of our country. The hon. the Deputy Minister was prepared to accept when I put forward that that number was probably between 65,000 and 100,000 people. He was apparently willing to accept that that was in fact so. I think that figure is probably as good a guess as anybody has been able to make. We are very much against taking away the right of that great number of people who have a stake in our country, who have shown their ability to live with us, to help us, who have become an integral part of our economy, who have tried to help us to solve our problems. I believe those are the finest immigrants you can get; they are the finest new citizens you can get. And the hon. the Minister of Immigration, I believe, agrees with us, because he has said, even in the case of those people who not only failed to take on South African citizenship whilst they were living here, but left the Republic to go to other places and now want to come back again, he would assist them just as he was assisting ordinary immigrants, to the tune of R155 per person. I quoted from Hansard when I made that point. It is recorded in Hansard. I agree with the hon. the Minister of Immigration.</p>

<p>Sir, our point is quite clear. We have stated our case on this particular clause. We believe that there is not all the haste which the hon. the Deputy Minister has made out that there is. He has shown no cause why this Bill must go through as it stands in regard to the time factor and without giving these people a further opportunity. He has not denied that he is in fact taking away, almost retrospectively, the qualifying period which these people have accumulated. It is a right which they possess at the present moment and with a stroke of the pen, and without any prior warning, it is the intention, with the promulgation of this clause, to take away that right from these people. Sir, we are not prepared to agree to that. Going on the statements of the hon. the Minister of the Interior in this House last year&#x2014;which are also recorded in Hansard and which have also been quoted in the course of this debate&#x2014;it was the intention, we understood, that when this amending Bill came before this House, those people would be assisted. He said so. He has now left it to the Deputy Minister to conduct this Bill through the House. Because, I believe, had he come here he would have been faced with the accusation that he had gone back on his promise to those people. I believe that it is quite clear that that is the position.</p>

<p>In those circumstances, and because the Deputy Minister has not been prepared to meet us in any way in our reasonable request to try to make these useful people citizens of our country when we are looking for new citizens, we are going to vote against the third reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I have no intention to argue the merits of this case. I think this is a time when the hon. the Minister of the Interior could make a gesture, a generous gesture. I do not wish to argue whether he was justified in extending the time only from 1 January last <span class="col_1361-1362" refersTo="page_0695"/>year to 1 April last year. I know hon. members opposite can argue that he was justified. I am not discussing now the question of whether or not he was justified. I am discussing a gesture, the question of mercy. As the hon. the Minister knows&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<p>The quality of mercy is not strained,<br/>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br/>Upon the place beneath; it is twice blessed;<br/>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes;<br/>&#x2019;Tis mightiest in the mightiest.</p>

<p>And the mightiest in this case is the Minister. The Minister has the power when we come to Another Place to make that gesture. That is what we are asking him. We are all agreed on both sides of the House that we should like these people to become citizens of South Africa with us. We have had an appeal from the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell) that these new citizens should, in the words of the great Sir Winston Churchill, go forward with us&#x2014;&#x201C;let us go forward together&#x201D;. And that is what these men are anxious to do. They are anxious to go forward with us as South African citizens. I appeal to the hon. the Minister, while there is yet time in the Other Place, to make that gesture, to extend the period. Why not? What are we losing? We are losing nothing by extending the period. We are getting men who might have become citizens a year ago had they had all the information necessary. I should like to say in conclusion that there is no criticism of the Department. I think everybody in this House who has had any dealings with the Department will speak of their great efficiency and, what is more important perhaps, the extent of their courtesy. It is not a question of administration; it is a question of a gesture being made to citizens who could come with us in this Republic.</p>

<p>Sir, I will not keep the House long. I am certainly not going to attempt to follow the gyrations of the official Opposition on this Bill. As far as I can see they voted for the second reading, put up a fierce fight against Clause 8 in the Committee Stage, then voted for that particular clause, and now we find that they are going to vote against the third reading because the time extension in Clause 9 affecting a certain group of citizens does not satisfy them. In my opinion those people are unlikely to register even if the time were extended since they have made up their minds on this score. However, to me that is not the important principle in this Bill. The important principle is contained in Clause 8.&#x2026;</p>

<p>I am not interested in the calling of names, Sir. I simply have a straight direct line which is the easiest to follow, as far as I am concerned, and that is to follow the principle of a Bill all the way through, wherever possible. And here it is quite clearly possible. The principle here is to take further arbitrary powers; it is another piece of retrospective legislation against which I always vote in principle, Sir, and I base my opposition to this Bill on the major clause in this Bill, which is Clause 8 as far as I am concerned. I voted against it in the Committee Stage and, of course, I shall register my opposition to this Bill, for that reason, in the third reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>There are three statements that I want to correct in regard to the last three speeches that have been made. The first was that made by the hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) when he mentioned a figure of between 65,000 and 100,000 British subjects who might still be in this country. He suggested that I agreed with his figure. I do not agree with that figure. There is no figure available to indicate the number of British subjects in this country and to suggest any estimated figure will merely give people the wrong idea; it achieves absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>The second matter that I want to rectify is in connection with the allegation that the Minister promised a greater concession than that embodied in this Bill. That is also untrue. What Minister de Klerk indicated he would investigate was the question of the 2,000 tardy people, the 2,000 who neglected to register before 31 December. He undertook to assist them and that is what is embodied in this legislation. That is why I deprecate the fact that the concession that is contained in this measure has been dealt with in this way by the Opposition. One would have expected appreciation in the right spirit to be shown of a great concession of this nature and that it would not have been used as a target for all kinds of attacks upon the Government and its attitude towards the British subject in the country.</p>

<p>As far as this matter is concerned, Mr. Speaker, I think that we have given an indication of the greatest measure of goodwill and helpfulness on our part as far as the British subjects are concerned. It was we who gave them seven months in which to register. After we became a Republic they had seven months in which to register for citizenship. That is a long time. That was the period in which every person who wanted to register in the country could do so. That was made known by means of ministerial statements and also through the medium of other publications. Nobody can contend to-day that he was not aware of the fact that he had seven months&#x2019; time&#x2014;to 31 December 1962&#x2014;in which to apply for registration. When it appeared that in spite of this very clear statement there were still 2,000 people who applied after 31 December but before 31 March, Minister de Klerk said that as the legislation stood he could not include them. When mention is made now of a difference of opinion and another interpretation then I want to say that that other interpretation <span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_0696"/>is the United Party&#x2019;s interpretation of this matter and not the Government&#x2019;s.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I shall touch on that when I cover the next point.</p>

<p>*Apart from these two concessions we made, during the discussion of this measure and in pursuance too of what the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell) said, I stated most emphatically that further concessions would be made to British subjects who had not registered before 31 March. I said that in terms of Section 10 (8) of the Citizenship Act, the Minister could, if he deemed fit, shorten the period of naturalization from five to one year in cases where people had been resident in the country for an unbroken period of eight years prior to that stage. Is this not a concession? Is it not a concession when we say that in terms of Section 10 (8) of the Citizenship Act we will consider the cases of people who do not even fall into these two categories that are being given the concessions? Is this not regarded as a concession? Is it not even appreciated? Must this also be used now to try and harm South Africa and our goodwill towards British subjects in this country? I do not think that this is the way to promote goodwill on the part of people whose protector one pretends to be.</p>

<p>We are establishing order by means of this Bill. Not only are we bringing order, but we are also bringing clarity. Immigrants are being informed of the requirements and provisions for citizenship. After all these concessions we now have a clear pattern. I think that the immigrants coming to this country will no longer be in doubt in regard to their position. The British subjects who are in this country, no matter for how long they may have been here, will now also have clarity in this regard. They know the opportunities that they have had; they know that they have not used those opportunities and if they want to blame somebody they can continue to blame the Opposition in this country for the way in which they stirred up the people in connection with the question of our becoming a Republic. They predicted what would happen if we became a Republic and that was what deterred those British subjects from registering. If the Opposition want to point an accusing finger they can point at themselves in this connection. They are the people who are responsible for the fact that these people did not take the necessary steps to become registered. It is not our intention to allow those people to suffer to-day as a result of their being incited by the United Party. That is why we are prepared to consider the cases of these British subjects who did not make use of those two particular concessions, if they submit their cases to us, so that they need not be bound by the five-year period but can be naturalized after a year. We are making this concession and we hope that people will make use of it.</p>

<p>But we have assisted them. Has the hon. member not been able to follow the discussion we have had and the measure that is before us? I have just referred to the concession of seven months; I then referred to the concession of postponing it for a further three months. The third concession was to consider those special cases. Is this then not sufficient? Is this then not an indication that we do not want those people to suffer as a result of the stupidity of the Opposition? Mr. Speaker, we are bringing order and clarity by means of this measure, the clarity that any country must have in its citizenship legislation. At the same time we are also ensuring that South African citizenship will not become a cheap article.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a commission to investigate ways and means which may be utilized by the Government for positively encouraging and furthering the establishment of private pension funds for all workers.</block>

<p>In recent years people throughout the country have been insisting upon the establishment of a national pension scheme. There are various trade unions in the country which are doing their best in this regard and we know that over the past few years the Opposition have moved a motion almost every year to the effect that a scheme of this nature should be instituted. As far as the present Government is concerned it has continued for good reasons to oppose the introduction of a national pension scheme. It has continued to reject the idea that we should introduce a national pension scheme. As I have said, there have been good reasons for this. Over the past few years the Government has on various occasions sent officials abroad to investigate the various schemes in operation in various countries and those officials have reported that most of the Governments which have national pension schemes are very sorry that they ever started such schemes. I do not have much information at my disposal in connection with these schemes, but I want to analyse the scheme that is in operation in Britain to-day to show the House why people say that these schemes do not come up to expectations. If we look at the British scheme we see that up to 1961 the British scheme paid a weekly pension of R5 per week to a single person and an additional R3 to a married person; in other words, a married couple received R8 per week in 1961. This meant that in 1961 a married couple in Britain only received R36 per month. If we compare this amount with the R49 which a married couple receives in South Africa without having contributed a cent, it throws some light on the results of the British scheme in 1961. I want to make it clear that both the State and the employer and employee contribute to the British scheme. In South Africa, where our pension amounts to R49 as against R36 under the British scheme, everything is paid out of taxation. There is no contribution by the pensioner.</p>

<p>The scheme was so inadequate for the British people that in 1961 they started what they called the &#x201C;graduated scheme&#x201D;. This was started in 1961. Under this scheme employers and employees contribute on a rising scale according to their wages. That new scheme has now been in operation for three years but even that does not appear to be the solution to the problems of the British people because writers like Pilch and Wood in their &#x201C;Pension Schemes&#x201D; point out that under this new contributory scheme it will take 20 years before a pensioner will receive even an additional R2 per week added to his basic pension under this &#x201C;graduated scheme&#x201D; of rising contributions. In other words, a single person who received R5 a week in 1961 will receive R7 a week in 1981 under the contributory scheme and a married contributor who received R8 a week in 1961 will receive only R12 a week in 1981. This means that under the British scheme a married couple will only receive in 1980 what we are already paying our pensioners under our present system to-day. The British system has also resulted in such a serious position that almost a quarter of the pensioners in Britain still have to be given further State assistance to enable them to live. I think hon. members will agree with me that if these are the results then there is not much to be said for it. But there is another reason why the British contributory scheme is not a solution to our problem and that is that, under that scheme, the <span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_0698"/>contributions of the State as well as those of employers and employees are not paid into a fund but are used to pay current pension benefits. In other words, no fund at all is being built up from which pensions will be paid in the future and the money to pay for future pensions will have to come from future generations. In other words, this is merely another form of taxation which is imposed upon the British people. Future generations will themselves have to find the money to pay those pensions, even under this new scheme, because no fund is being built up and the contributions are all being used to pay current pensions.</p>

<p>There is another very important objection to a State pension scheme and that is that a scheme of this nature always becomes a political football in democratic countries. Thus, for example, the British scheme has become a political football between the parties. You will remember that in 1957, before the general election in 1958, the British Labour Party came forward with a Utopian scheme in which they promised the British people that if they were put into power they would establish a pension scheme which would ensure that upon retirement every man would receive half of his salary by way of pension. The Conservative Party had to make a counter-offer and that counter-offer was this &#x201C;graduated scheme&#x201D; which they started in 1961 and which has produced the results that I have indicated.</p>

<p>There is another objection which is of particular importance to our country, although it also holds good for other countries, and that is that the administration expenses connected with these schemes are extremely high. It is only natural that administration expenses will be far higher in our country which is a multiracial country, and that there will be far more difficulties in connection with this scheme than is the case even in England and in other countries. But it is only natural, too, that the Whites will have to bear a fairly heavy burden if the whole population is to be covered by a national pension scheme of this nature, particularly as the lower-paid non-White worker will have to be provided with an adequate pension.</p>

<p>I want to mention a last objection and that is that a State pension scheme undermines the morale of the people. It makes the people more and more dependent upon the State. It undermines not only the sense of independence of the people but it also takes away the individual&#x2019;s sense of responsibility to make provision for his old age. These are some of the good reasons why the present Government has refused to accept the idea of a national pension scheme.</p>

<p>But even though we are opposed to a national pension scheme or a national contributory pension scheme, we do have a problem in South Africa that we <i>must</i> overcome. Over the course of years people throughout the country have been warning against the increasing expenditure on social pensions. Successive Ministers of Finance have also drawn attention to this fact. I want to point out to the House how expenditure in connection with our old-age pensions and our war veterans&#x2019; pensions has risen over the past five or ten years&#x2014;I want to deal only with pensions for Whites. In the financial year 1946-7 the expenditure on these two pensions amounted to R9,900,000. In last year&#x2019;s Estimates, in the 1963-4 financial year, the amount in respect of these two pensions rose to R35,500,000. In other words, the amount rose by 58 per cent over this period of 16 or 17 years. And people continue to insist that higher pensions be paid. The House still has to discuss a motion in this connection this afternoon. I might point out that under the present provisions of the means test only 43 per cent of White men of 65 years and older and of White women of 60 years and older are entitled to pensions under our scheme. In other words, under our present means test, only 43 per cent of White men over 65 years and White women over 60 years receive a pension, and even this entails an expenditure of R35,500,000 per annum.</p>

<p>We are in the fortunate position that our people are living longer to-day; life expectancy is far higher to-day than it was 30 or 40 years ago. If we take the number of Whites of 65 years and older as a percentage of the White population, we find that from 1911 to 1960 the percentage increased from 2.4 per cent to 6.7 per cent. In other words, people of 65 years and older to-day already form 6.7 per cent of our White population. Besides this, we find that our families are becoming smaller. Fortunately, over the past few years an improvement has been noticeable in this regard but the number of White children of 15 years and younger has fallen over the past 40 years from 38.5 per cent of the White population to 34.4 per cent. The result of these two facts&#x2014;the larger percentage of our population living longer and the decreasing percentage of our children&#x2014;is that our total working population continues to show a falling tendency. It also means that the percentage of the population which has to contribute the money to pay pensions to our older people is steadily becoming smaller in proportion to our population. The burden continues to be placed upon a section of our population that is steadily decreasing in numbers. That is why I say that the time has come for us to give our attention to these problems. Procrastination or anything of that nature can only lead to an aggravation of the problem and a delay in finding a solution to this problem. If we do not want to establish a State pension scheme we must find another solution. As far as I can see there is only one other solution and that is to encourage the establishment of private pension funds so that we can reach the stage as soon as possible where every working member of the population will be covered by such a scheme.</p>

<p>The Government has taken important steps in this connection to encourage the establishment of private pension funds and I want to pay tribute to the Government in this regard. Over the past 16 years important steps have <span class="col_1369-1370" refersTo="page_0699"/>been taken. For example, in 1956 an Act was passed to exercise control over pension funds. This was a very important step to encourage the establishment of private pension funds. In the first place it led to the registration of the funds and placed the funds under sound control so that care could be taken to see that they remained financially sound, that there was no wastage and that their members received the benefit of the funds. Furthermore, on various occasions tax concessions have been made to taxpayers in respect of their contributions to pension funds. We have received further concessions over the past two years in the case of persons who are self-employed to encourage them also to belong to a pension fund, and generous concessions have been made to them as far as tax liability is concerned. That is why I say that the steps which the Government has taken have already had a very salutary effect. In just these two years, 1961 and 1962, the number of private pension funds increased by 322 while the number of members covered by those funds increased by 129,000 in those two years. At the end of 1962 we already had 3,832 registered pension funds to which 846,500 members belonged. If to this number of funds we add the Government funds and the provincial employees&#x2019; funds covering a further 250,000 employees, then we already have more than 1,000,000 people covered by existing funds. Therefore a very large section of our working population is already covered by private funds and we are grateful for the fact that we have progressed so far. That is why I am convinced that we have now reached the stage when we must consider further steps. That is why my motion contains a recommendation that the Government should appoint a commission of inquiry to consider ways and means of taking this matter further. I have a few ideas to put forward in this connection.</p>

<p>The first suggestion that I want to make today is one that I have borrowed from the system of industrial pensions which is in operation in Holland. This system was started in Holland in 1951. In terms of this system a pension fund is brought into being in one industry after another in consultation with employers and employees. One industry after another is approached and to-day a large proportion of the working population in Holland is already covered by these funds. The funds are registered at their insurance chambers and they then become compulsory in terms of the law. That is why my first suggestion, Mr. Speaker, is that a statutory board should be brought into being to make annual surveys of those groups of the working population not yet covered by a pension scheme. Then the method of negotiation used in Holland should be followed in order to establish further pension funds for groups or categories of employees. It is only natural that a board of this nature will constantly have to be on the alert because in any developing industrial country there will always be new groups and new industries coming into being that will not be covered by the old pension schemes and for which provision will have to be made. But in in my opinion two other things must also be done. The one is that we must ensure that during their working years people are not able to lay their hands on the accumulated benefits which they have built up in pension funds. In other words, if they resign from their work, their benefits must be frozen. The latest report of the Registrar of Pension Funds indicates the extent to which the aims of pension funds are being frustrated by people who lay their hands on their pension benefits before their retirement age. In 1961, for example, the lump sum payments paid by our domestic pension funds were made up as follows: On retirement or death, R11,177,000; as a result of other circumstances&#x2014;prior to retirement or death&#x2014;an amount of R12,940,000. In other words, before they retired or before they died, people drew more than 50 per cent of their pension benefits in cash. In this way the aims of the pension fund are frustrated. In 1962 the position improved slightly. An amount of R13,770,000 was paid out on retirement or death and an amount of R12,636,000 under other circumstances. Sir, this process almost completely frustrates the purpose for which pension funds are brought into being and if we allow this process to continue we will never reach the stage where the whole of our working population will be drawing pension benefits for the rest of their lives. That is why my motion also provides that the commission should consider a few other matters. One is that provision must be made for the transfer-ability of accumulated benefits from one pension fund to another. Where a man resigns from one employer where there is a pension fund in existence and goes to another employer where no fund exists, some way must be found to protect that man&#x2019;s benefits and to freeze them until such time as he retires or dies. I realize that this is a fairly drastic proposal but over the past 10 or 15 years many people in South Africa had advocated this course of action, people who have written in commercial and industrial periodicals and so forth. Speeches have also been made at annual general meetings of the Association of Pension Funds emphasizing this question of transferability and the necessity for this to be done. This is not merely my own idea therefore; it is an idea which is being propagated more and more to-day. I might point out that in their book, Pilch and Wood state that there are various countries where this process of transferability has already been put into operation by means of legislation but I have not been able to obtain much information in this regard. I can only refer again to the &#x201C;graduated scheme&#x201D; in Britain to which I referred just now. There we find that benefits are frozen to a certain extent and that the principle of transferability is recognized. Under that scheme there is a process which they call &#x201C;contracting out&#x201D;. One can contract out of a private pension fund. Instead of contributing <span class="col_1371-1372" refersTo="page_0700"/>to a State pension fund one can buy one&#x2019;s benefits from a private pension fund. When an employee ceases to belong to that private pension fund there are three things that can happen as far as his pension contributions are concerned. Firstly, they can be frozen; secondly, he can purchase benefits in another private pension fund; or thirdly, he has to purchase benefits in the State pension fund. In other words, his pension contributions are either frozen or else they are transferred from one pension fund to another or to the State pension fund. I want to quote to the House what is stated in the annual report of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance for 1962 in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under the provisions of the 1929 Act the Minister is responsible for ensuring that, on the termination of an employee&#x2019;s contracted-out employment, pension rights at least equivalent to the maximum graduated national insurance pension which could have been earned during the period of contracted-out employment are preserved for him.</block>

<p>In other words, he cannot lay his hands on it. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Terminations occur when an employee retires or leaves his contracted-out employment before retirement age or when an employee ceases to be covered by a certificate of non-participation because the certificate has been surrendered, cancelled or varied. Liability falls on the employer by whom the employee has been contracted out. The employer may discharge his liability for preservation of pension rights by arranging for the necessary rights to be assured through the pension scheme of which the employee has been a member or by arranging for similar rights to be secured in the pension scheme of another employer if the employee has transferred to another contracted-out employment. If preservation of rights is not effected in one or other of these ways the employer must make a payment in lieu of contributions to the National Insurance Fund to secure maximum rights in the graduated scheme for the employee. Employers deal direct with the Ministry&#x2019;s Non-Participating Employment Group.</block>

<block name="quote">During the year ended 31 December 1962 a total of 433,566 termination notices was received. Pension benefits were preserved in 92,283 cases and &#x201C;payments in lieu&#x201D; amounting to a little over &#x00A3;3,750,000 were collected.</block>

<p>In other words, under this system of the British Government 92,283 people were prevented from laying their hands on their money on resigning from their work and in the case of the so-called &#x201C;payments in lieu&#x201D; more than &#x00A3;3,750,000 was collected.</p>

<p>Here we have an example of two things. We have reached the stage where we must try to put a stop to this wastage of pension contributions in the country. I do not have very much information in regard to other countries, although Wood says that there are countries in which pension rights are transferable and where funds are also frozen. I was not able to obtain much information in this regard. The limited information that I have is that these benefits are frozen in certain European countries and in at least one country, Belgium, the system of transferability of pension funds is in operation. That is why I feel that a commission of inquiry should also investigate these two points to see what can be done to make provision for our population in this way and to avoid the wastage of pension contributions.</p>

<p>I want to point out that these pension funds will also be a great national asset. The building up of these funds not only helps to provide a feeling of independence and self-respect on the part of our people but it is an important form of saving. I just want to point out that private pension funds to-day already have R670,000,000 to their credit&#x2014;money that has been saved&#x2014;and that the amount which is added to these funds annually is about R58,000,000 per annum. This is a tremendous national saving and results in the formation of a great deal of capital. It is even a means that we can use to combat inflationary tendencies. That is why I say that we have reached the stage where we must take the logical steps to follow up the legislation of 1956. But because this is such a new field, I feel that we must discover the easiest way in which to do it at this stage. We should not force it upon the people immediately but put it into operation gradually so that we can build up our funds to provide cover for our people. My own conviction is that we cannot procrastinate any longer in this connection. It takes a number of years to build up a pension fund to the stage when all its members are effectively provided for. That is why I ask the Government to appoint a commission of inquiry to see what can be done in this connection.</p>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) has given us a speech full of information from his point of view in regard to an investigation into the pensions position. I think we are in agreement that there should be a commission to inquire into this matter. But from there onwards he has rightly anticipated that our viewpoints differ. He was at pains to try to destroy in advance the arguments that may be put up for a national contributory pension scheme, well knowing that it is the policy of this side of the House. Sir, it still remains our policy. We believe that it is the right thing to do, and even under a commission appointed to inquire into the advisability of a national contributory scheme most of the problems he has mentioned would come up for consideration. They are problems which are germane to such a commission of inquiry which considers the whole matter. I hope he will not look completely with a jaundiced eye on the fact that I am going to move an amendment&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1373-1374" refersTo="page_0701"/>To omit all the words after &#x201C;advisability of&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;instituting a national contributory pension scheme.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I think it is more comprehensive than the manner in which he wishes to deal with this matter. I said this was party policy, but I do not know whether the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestions entirely meet the problem, as I shall try to demonstrate later. Obviously this is not a new problem. Time and time again it has been before this House. Away back in 1944 there was the well-known Select Committee No. 10 which dealt with this matter under its social security proposals. The Economic Planning Council has considered it. It was before this House by way of motion in 1957 and 1962. I mention this because it has become, on both sides of the House, a hardy annual. All hon. members want something done about this problem and they desire a commission to be appointed. I think it is high time that the Minister should appoint such a commission, seeing that there is that desire, to have the position fully examined, not only from the point of view of his own followers, but also the alternatives that exist, so that it can come forward with facts and figures on the matter. Many of the figures available and the thoughts expressed in the report of the select committee I referred to are becoming out-dated. It is over 20 years ago since we had any authentic documents on this question. I do not think it is any use just turning down the proposition that we should examine the question of the advisability of a national contributory pension scheme. That will not get us any further, because we argue about it and quote figures, whereas we want someone to go into it from the expert point of view. There is a great deal of evidence which can be obtained not only from overseas but in this country. I agree with the hon. member that the question of the expansion of pension funds has developed considerably in this country over the last few years. There has been tremendous growth, which is to the good of the country. We do not object to pension funds being created as they are being created, particularly under the agreements negotiated in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act. When a negotiation takes place it usually includes the establishment of a pension fund, if one does not already exist. So there we are at one. We all desire to have this done, and to have something better than exists to-day, but we differ in our approach, and surely when we differ in our approach that is a matter for a wide commission to investigate, to see what can be done for the best. We believe that a national contributory pension scheme is the answer. Figures have been given in earlier debates in this House, as I have said, showing that the initial contribution might be R276,000,000, with an annual contribution of R12,000,000, but of course those figures are quoted to frighten people off and to scare them into thinking that such a scheme is quite impossible. But I do not believe it is impossible. I believe these figures should be gone into carefully, and also the variations of schemes. It is assumed that everyone will be contributing when we have a national contributory pension scheme, but the hon. member referred to schemes overseas where you can contract out. I believe that is one of the matters which a commission should investigate, as to what extent the present schemes can be absorbed into a national contributory scheme, and to what extent, if they meet a certain standard, they are exempted and can contract out of the scheme. After all, the desire is that people should get a pension which is adequate for their old age.</p>

<p>There are many objections which can be advanced. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) advanced them all in anticipation. He has obviously looked back into all the Hansards where this matter was discussed. There was the question of cost and of having an adequate register. That now disappears, because the Government has established it. There is the question of higher taxation, which he mentioned, and of higher administrative costs. I regret that he referred to the fact that this has become a political football, but even if it does become a political football I think we can kick a goal by advocating a national contributory pension scheme. But that is not being discussed in that spirit to-day. This concerns the welfare of people, a problem which is one of the most serious problems in this country, as to how people can have adequate means when they reach old age. There are many arguments used against it, such as that it destroys individuality, as was said on a previous occasion, and that it does not include the non-Whites, as I think the hon. member said. For the life of me, I do not see why, after such a scheme is investigated, it cannot include non-Whites.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I never said that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry if I misunderstood the hon. member. The question of non-Whites is an important matter. We said on the last occasion that we would start with the White population and gradually, as it got going, bring in the other sections of the community. As I have said, it is a real problem. We see from the figures given in the report of the Registrar of Pension Funds that it gives a most encouraging picture in regard to those pension funds established in terms of industrial agreements. Where the number of funds was 18 in 1961, it had risen to 26 in 1962. The number of members at the end of the year was 120,667 and the next year it was 171,502, a marked increase in the number of funds established in one year. That is most encouraging, but what is disappointing, and what is the problem, is that if you take this figure and compare it with the number of people economically employed in these trades, and you see how many they are as compared with the number of persons covered by the present pension funds, there is a terrific gap which shows that only a small percentage is covered. I admit that the figures are not entirely accurate. You <span class="col_1375-1376" refersTo="page_0702"/>cannot get the exact information as to which trades are covered; you can only take them from the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics. If out of that you take the figure of those economically employed in these trades covered by agreements and who have pension funds, you get in 1960 a total number employed of 5,696,000. So taking this latter figure you find that only 3 per cent are covered. That is the only figure one can get and I am prepared to say it is not entirely accurate, but it gives an indication of how few people are covered by pension funds. If you take the Whites only, you get a figure of something like 16 to 17 per cent, which is a woefully low figure. I believe that even if the figure rose to 25 or 30 per cent it is still woefully low when you consider what the problem is of people who have to provide for their old age. I have said that I believe that thousands are excluded from the existing pension funds to-day. Good work is being done by increasing these funds and extending them, but our object should be to resolve the lack of adequate pensions to provide for old age. That is a major problem. The citizen to-day exhausts himself in his earlier years with the obligations he has to meet in educating his family against the rising cost of living, and he finds it very difficult, and I believe he will always find it difficult unless there is a measure of compulsion, to put aside something for a rainy day. I believe that is inherent in human nature, but we should do something about it. It should be gone into, particularly as we find to-day that people of 45 have difficulty in obtaining employment. I understand steps are being taken to find employment for these people, but it is a problem. How much more difficult it is for the person who reaches 60 to find employment. I believe that our attitude in this country is wrong to the extent that we are inclined to discard the capacity of a person long before we should do so. I believe it is doubly necessary in this country not to do so, because of the shortage of experienced people here. We are crying out that there is a shortage of manpower, but we cast aside a lot of these people simply because they have reached a certain age. I believe this inquiry should be held so that it covers all these problems of cost, of coverage, of age, and to what extent the various races can be included, contracting out, in other words the exemption of existing schemes, and what standards should be attained. Various schemes should be examined. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) referred to the weakness of certain schemes in Britain. That may be so, but let us examine schemes from elsewhere. We have had the <i>ex parte</i> statement that officials who examined the various schemes are against a scheme of contributory pensions on a national basis, but let us have their evidence before a full commission and see what the position really is. I believe that is what we should do. I believe the problem is with us whether we have good or bad times. Very often you get this problem stressed in bad times, but the question of a pension is a matter for a long view. It comes at the latter part of an individual&#x2019;s life. They do not want a pension to be stressed in bad or in good times, they want it settled for all time, so that they know where they are.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the present position which has always concerned me is the fact that many persons who are eligible for the old age pension do not apply for it. I personally know dozens. I expect there are hundreds, or even more. The Department may have some sort of estimate, but what perturbs me is this. These people do not apply because, rightly or wrongly, they look upon it as charity. They do not realize that when they were taxpayers during the earlier periods of their lives they were contributing towards these pensions, and they look upon it as charity. I think that is one of the matters which the Minister should try to impress on people who are eligible for pensions to-day, that that is not the case at all. The individual, particularly in this country, tends to be independent and proud, and there are many who become resentful because of their position, yet do not want to apply for a pension. I make this point because if there were a national contributory scheme we would get away from this problem altogether. Everybody would be placed on the same basis, and because they contributed they could get a pension as a right. The establishment of a national contributory scheme&#x2014;and I do not want to trespass too far on this because there is a subsequent motion on the Order Paper which deals with the position as it exists to-day and asks for certain alleviation, but certainly if you establish such a scheme it would largely do away with the means test. It would not penalize the thrifty, as they are penalized under present conditions. There is something which I have not yet been able to answer when the person involved asks me: Why because I have saved enough to have a house and a roof over my head, and my husband dies, and I am left with this asset, cannot I get the old age pension, when taxes almost reduce the income from it to nil? Sir, what is the answer? When these people have made a great contribution during their lifetime and they have brought up their families and have been good citizens and have lived decent lives, why should they find themselves in that position? I mention it because I believe the system I am advocating will do away with those difficulties.</p>

<p>I have said that this question should not be considered out of hand. It should not be just dismissed lightly because the Government feels that another course should be adopted and we have a contrary opinion. At least they should face up to it and send the matter to a commission to be fully investigated. We believe that if this proposition of a national contributory scheme were accepted, every citizen in the country would be able to hold his head high because when he becomes due for pension he would be able to say: I contributed to it; I played a part in building up this fund. That <span class="col_1377-1378" refersTo="page_0703"/>would be a much happier position than the one we have to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to start by conveying my congratulations to the two previous speakers on the very thorough way in which they have dealt with this matter and the views which they have expressed here. The motion itself is more specifically within my jurisdiction; the amendment, however, is not specifically within my jurisdiction, but all I want to say about it at this stage is that this is a matter of Government policy. We have been discussing these matters for many years, and it does not seem to me to be the correct procedure to refer a matter of policy to a commission of inquiry.</p>

<p>This whole question of the aged is, of course, a matter which is very near and dear to every right-thinking Government, and under the general policy that we have followed we have contributed as much as we can, as far as the means at our disposal have permitted us to do so, to alleviate the lot of our aged, without undermining their spirit of independence. I just want to tell hon. members that out of last year&#x2019;s Budget of R852,000,000 no less than 41.7 per cent was devoted to social services of various kinds and that a very considerable portion of this money was devoted to the aged. We feel that the right policy for the State to follow is to supplement the private schemes where the private schemes cannot effectively cover the population. That is our policy and I do not think it is necessary for us to have our policy investigated by a commission.</p>

<p>I just want to add that I fully agree with the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) that we should make more use of the labour of people who have reached the retirement age. I think we should give much more serious attention than we have done hitherto to this aspect of making provision for a degree of self-care; we should rather create decent opportunities of employment so that people will be in a better position to take care of themselves. But the point is that we should not entirely ignore the principle of self-care by saying that we are going to introduce a State contributory scheme.</p>

<p>I come now to the motion of the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. v. d. Walt). Unfortunately I could not be here from the beginning because I had to be in the Other Place. But I listened with interest to all the points which he made towards the end of his speech and to the recommendations made by him. As I have said, that is our whole policy, and we shall do everything in our power therefore to encourage private pension funds. That is our policy and it is a policy which we have already implemented with a large degree of success. We know that there are certain bottlenecks in the implementation of that policy. One bottleneck is the question of transferability of pension rights when an employee goes from one employer to another. That is certainly a very important bottleneck. The other bottleneck which we also mentioned is that frequently when a person retires he receives a large cash sum which he perhaps spends unwisely, and then in the end he finds himself without a pension. These are the two bottlenecks which we should try to remove. The hon. member wants to know whether we are prepared to consider the appointment of a commission of inquiry. I think the hon. member has made out a case for an inquiry by the State, particularly with reference to these two bottlenecks, but that inquiry need not necessarily be undertaken by a commission. These private pension funds themselves have a very great interest in the expansion and growth of their own funds, and we can assume therefore that this movement itself will do everything in its power to extend its activities and to remove any bottlenecks which may arise. I think that to a certain extent therefore we should leave it to them to do something in this connection. But on the other hand I do feel that it will be very useful if the State itself can also investigate these two bottlenecks in particular, to see what practical difficulties there are. I am prepared to accept the motion in this sense that the Government will cause an inquiry to be instituted, not necessarily by way of a commission but perhaps by way of a committee. Commissions are very often appointed where the work can be done just as well by a committee particularly when one is faced with a specific problem and one wants to ascertain how the problem is tackled in other countries. A committee can ascertain that just as well as any commission could.</p>

<p>The hon. member has already mentioned certain figures here, but I just want to refer again to the amazing expansion and growth of private pension funds in this country. From 1958 to 1962 the membership of private pension funds increased by an average of 110 per cent per annum, and the total assets increased from R384,000,000 to R670,000,000, in other words, the assets increased by an average of almost 20 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>What is the total membership to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The figure which I have here is 831,995, but that does not include the foreign pension funds which operate in the Republic and the membership of which is about 140,000; it does not include persons who received lump-sum payments upon retirement, nor does it include members of Government pension funds, of whom there are about 300,000&#x2014;public servants, railway officials, teachers, etc. As I have said, the assets have increased by almost 20 per cent per annum. When we compare this figure with the increase in the assets of building societies and insurance funds, which are both growing rapidly, we find that pension funds have grown twice as rapidly as the funds of building societies and insurance companies which have increased by an average <span class="col_1379-1380" refersTo="page_0704"/>of approximately 10 per cent per annum only. If one accepts that in 1960 there were 1,146,000 economically active Whites and that of the total membership of existing pension funds, namely 1,146,000, there are still 600,000 or 700,000 Whites after eliminating duplications of membership in the case of private funds, then we find that the position to-day is that seven out of every 11 economically active Whites already belong to some pension fund or other. There is still room for further expansion. Then there is still the large group of professional and self-employed persons and those who prefer to receive a lump-sum payment upon retirement. I just want to say that there is also this very gratifying sign that more and more pension funds are being established amongst the non-Whites. In 1961-2 no fewer than 52 exclusively non-White pension funds were registered. Here we have another sphere in which there is considerable room for expansion. As I have already said, we would like to reach the stage where the whole field of economically active persons is covered so that they can lead a decent life when they retire, and then we should like, by way of a State fund, to cover those who are not covered by one of the existing schemes. That, briefly, is our policy. The State has already done a great deal to encourage the establishment of private pension funds. The hon. member has already pointed out that we passed the Pensions Act of 1956 so that we could exercise a certain amount of supervision over these funds, give them a lead and make sure that their funds were not invested in obviously unsafe ventures. We have also made very important tax concessions. The entire income of the fund, by the way of contributions from members and employers and from investments, after the deduction of administration costs, is entirely at the disposal of the members for pension purposes and for other additional benefits. Furthermore, we give an employer who is a member of a pension fund the right to deduct from his taxable income contributions made by him up to R600 per annum. Normally when a member ceases to work after having reached the pensionable age, he can commute as much as one-third of his pension without any liability for tax. That is another fiscal concession that we are making. Although a lump sum from a pension fund is taxable it is taxed at the average scale applicable to the taxable income of the person concerned as calculated before the inclusion of the lump sum. This again is a very important fiscal concession. Then again an employer can also deduct from his taxable income the normal contributions which he makes to a pension fund on behalf of his employees, and this is a very large sum. Self-employed persons, that is to say, persons who do not draw salaries, may deduct up to R1,200 per annum from their taxable income in respect of contributions made to an annuity fund. This is all being done to encourage the establishment of private funds. This second concession which I have mentioned, i.e. to the employee and to the self-employed person, is costing the State approximately R1&#x00BD; million per annum. Last year&#x2019;s increases alone cost about R300,000 per annum. As I have already said, amazing progress is being made in this sphere; the vast field which is lying open is rapidly being covered. The establishment of pension funds is being encouraged by way of income-tax relief which is given from time to time. We brought about two very important increases in tax relief only last year. We feel that that is the correct way. But now we come to the second big problem and that is the question of transferability of pension rights. The Pension Funds Association is continually studying the position with a view to removing difficulties where they can be removed. As I have said, a case can be made out for an inquiry to determine whether we cannot give these funds some measure of assistance and a certain amount of guidance. That is the one big problem. The other is the question of casual workers and others with no fixed income. This is a very difficult problem which cannot be overcome very easily. These people cannot join private pension funds and we simply have to accept the fact that eventually they will have to be covered under a general State scheme.</p>

<p>I think my hon. colleague will deal with the amendment which has been moved here. I am pleased to be able to say that the Government will cause this matter to be investigated but I am not prepared to bind the Government as to the form of the inquiry.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure that all members of this House are pleased to hear that the hon. the Minister of Finance intends taking some action in regard to the various shortcoming in private pension schemes. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) has pointed out what some of these shortcomings are and suggested that a commission of inquiry be instituted. The Minister has promised that he will investigate these various matters. Sir, it is interesting to note that all four reports of the Registrar of Pension Funds which have been submitted to the House, all urge the Government to take some action, to introduce legislation, to rectify a number of these shortcomings. One very serious defect in the present set-up is that persons resign so as to be able to enjoy the immediate benefits of funds which they have contributed to pension funds. We have seen in recent times that younger employees in particular resign in order to be able to lay their hands on their pension contributions and then they proceed to squander the money. Another problem is that a person who moves from one post to another, from one firm to another, finds that he cannot transfer the amount standing to his credit in one pension fund to another pension fund. I want to make it quite clear that we on this side of the House are not opposed to an extension of private pension funds. Indeed I believe it is in line with our policy that people should be able to make contributions to a pension fund during their <span class="col_1381-1382" refersTo="page_0705"/>working years so that they will have an adequate pension in the twilight of their lives. I think that principle, that one should be able to make contributions to a pension fund and then have the right to claim a pension which is adequate to meet one&#x2019;s needs in old age, is one which is endorsed by members on both sides of this House. I believe, however, that the mere extension of private pension schemes does not go far enough. I believe that we must devise a scheme which is more comprehensive and which can cover all sections of the community. There are certain persons such as the casual worker and the self-employed worker who in many instances do not make provision for their old age. It is human nature perhaps but the fact remains that many people fail to make provision for their old age. Whether they should be compelled to do so is a matter of policy.</p>

<p>Sir, there are other matters which the hon. member for Pretoria (West) mentioned this morning in moving his motion and which items call for some comment. First of all, the hon. member started his speech by pointing out the failings of the present system in the United Kingdom. Perhaps the hon. member was correct in pointing out those various failings, but I think we must look far beyond just this one system in Great Britain; we must also look at some of the more successful systems such as the system in New Zealand. In New Zealand they have a form of social security which is far more comprehensive than a system of contributory pension schemes which we advocate from this side of the House. It is interesting to see that in 1959, after the scheme in New Zealand had been in operation for 20 years, the Prime Minister, Mr. Walter Nash, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This successful scheme has long been a model adopted in many countries overseas. We are entitled to claim that the rapid development of the New Zealand economy over the last 20 years is in no small measure due to the social security scheme inaugurated 20 years ago. We are indeed proud of it.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not intend to take up the time of the House in giving details of the scheme as it exists in New Zealand, but I would like to point out to the hon. member for Pretoria (West) that there are many schemes in many lands which we can study and then adopt the best features of those schemes in this country. After all, I remember that when the P.A.Y.E. system of tax collection was discussed, a study was also made by our select committee of the scheme in existence in Great Britain. It was found that that scheme also had many drawbacks but that it had certain advantages too. Some of those advantages were recommended for adoption by the select committee and were incorporated in our Act. This shows that we can learn from other countries and devise a scheme which will be beneficial to all persons living in this country. I think we should definitely consider the question of adopting the good features of those schemes.</p>

<p>Last year during the recess the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions toured overseas and I understand that he studied various schemes in various parts of Europe, and I do hope that the time is not to distant when this House will have the benefit of hearing from the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions what he learned in the course of his tour and whether there is any possibility of adapting any of the overseas schemes to meet the requirements of our population.</p>

<p>Another point that was made by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) in regard to the introduction of a contributory pension scheme was the question of the cost of administration, I would like to point out to the hon. member that the cost of administering our present system, of which the means test forms part, is very high indeed. It is a very costly system. We have heard from the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions that his Department handles an average of 3,000 letters a day. We know that there are something like 200,000 files in that Department and that those files are constantly studied and that the various cases are constantly subject to review. When there is a change in the financial circumstances of a pensioner, his file has to be taken out and his case reviewed by the Department. This often necessitates the recovery of certain over-payments which might have been made and the re-adjustment of pensions. I think nobody can deny that our present system is a very costly system.</p>

<p>As far as a scheme for South Africa is concerned, we have on numerous occasions in this House put forward what we regard as the best scheme. I do not intend to go into the details of that scheme again this morning, but I think the time is opportune to put forward what we believe to be the main principles to be observed if such a scheme is introduced. It has been mentioned by the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) that what we have in mind is a scheme which will provide comprehensive cover for everybody. I think that is a very important principle. It will mean that when people reach a prescribed age they will have the right to claim a pension, which should be an adequate pension, from a private pension fund or from the State. To-day, under the present system many people are precluded from receiving a pension because of the stringent application of the means test. Another factor which we must bear in mind is that private pension funds are invariably limited to persons under the age of 45 years. This is, of course, a serious drawback for older persons seeking employment. An employer who has his own pension fund, of which membership is compulsory, is unable to give employment to persons over 45 years of age. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) has mentioned the question of the initiative of the worker. Here we find that a person is willing to work and capable of performing the work but he is precluded <span class="col_1383-1384" refersTo="page_0706"/>from employment because he is over the age of 45 years and cannot therefore become a member of a pension fund, where membership is compulsory. Then again, while we are discussing the question of iniative, I have found a number of instances where persons capable of improving their position by selling their talents at a higher rate of pay to another employer, have been loath to accept lucrative offers because of fear of losing their pension benefits. They forego the opportunity to improve their position because the new employer is unable to offer them the security of a pension. The fact that an employer has a pension scheme to offer his employees, can therefore even have a stifling effect on the initiative of individuals.</p>

<p>Sir, the introduction of a comprehensive scheme in South Africa in terms of which all persons will enjoy the benefit of an adequate pension upon retirement, has sometimes been described by hon. members opposite as a socialistic proposal. I think we must realize that in this year of 1964 numerous steps are taken and numerous schemes are instituted which 20 or 25 years ago would have been described as socialistic. However, I think under present-day circumstances many of these steps are not socialistic but realistic, because we must realize that people look for security, and one of the cornerstones of social security is security in old age. That is why we want a scheme to be introduced in South Africa which will provide adequate security in old age. Under our present system many of the older people can only look forward to a lowering of their standard of living and a period of anxiety in their old age if they have not made sufficient provision during their working years. I do not have the time this morning to go into the details of a contributory pension scheme under which everybody will be able to claim an adequate pension as of right when he retires, but I would like to give a brief outline of what we regard as a practical scheme and one which is well worthy of consideration. I do not intend to dwell on the importance of a scheme which will guarantee everybody an adequate pension because I know that there is a motion on the Order Paper dealing with that subject, but I believe that under a contributory pension scheme it would be possible to pay all pensioners a pension of R40 per month. How would that R40 per month be made up? Twenty-five rand would be payable from Revenue Fund and that amount would be supplemented by R15 per month from a contributory pension fund. In other words, 37&#x00BD; per cent would come from the contributory pension fund and 62&#x00BD; per cent from State Revenue. I believe that such a fund has existed in Sweden where the cost of pensions is borne partly by the State and is met partly out of a contributory scheme. I believe that a pension of R40 per month would at least mean that people can look forward to a degree of security in their old-age. I think one of our main criticisms of the present system is the operation of the means test. Members are entitled to ask whether the means test would be abolished with the introduction of a contributory pension scheme. Sir, our main criticism of the means test is that persons who have been thrifty during their working years are discriminated against when they come to apply for a pension. The Government encourages people to save money and to be thrifty, and that is why people feel that an injustice is being done to them when, having saved during their working years, they find that when they apply for a pension that they are discriminated against and precluded from receiving a social pension. The means test can only be abolished if we introduce a contributory pension scheme. It would not be practical or realistic to advocate the complete abolition of the means test without the introduction of a contributory pension scheme. There are many people who are still able to remain in employment after reaching 60 years of age and it is only right therefore that a modified means test should be applied to them. We believe, however, that in the case of all persons over 70 years of age the means test could be abolished with the introduction of a contributory pension scheme. This scheme would therefore mean the abolition of the means test in the case of all persons over 70 years of age. As far as men are concerned, they would qualify for the pension after 65 years of age and between 65 and 70 they would be subject to a modified means test. As far as women are concerned they would qualify at the present age of 60 and they would be subject to a means test between 60 and 70. Hon. members may ask what numbers would be involved if a contributory pension scheme was introduced. It would mean that all those over 70 would qualify, and according to the 1960 census the number of White persons over 70 years is 127,300. The number of people who would be subject to a modified means test would be 129,268. These figures will give hon. members some indication of the expense which such a scheme would involve. The question of the financing of such a system is, of course, of the utmost importance. The hon. member for Von Brandis has already referred to the fact that a select committee on Social Security sat in 1944. A period of some 20 years has elapsed since then and there have been vast changes in our economic situation and in the ratio of the different population groups, and I think the time has come when we should give further consideration to the introduction of some system of social security which will provide adequately for those persons requiring assistance in their old-age. A previous time when this matter was discussed here the former member for Sunnyside (Mr. Pocock) worked out what such a scheme would cost the individual in the way of contributions. Mr. Pocock found that in the case of persons under 20 years of age it would be necessary for them to contribute 30 cents per week. The contributions were to be on a sliding scale, with a maximum contribution of R1 per week at the age of 30 years. Sir, as I have said, our population ratio <span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_0707"/>has changed and various other matters also have to be taken into consideration. I believe that the financial implications of such a scheme should be determined by an actuary, but I believe that what I have outlined here this morning forms the basis of a scheme which should be fully inquired into to see whether it can be applied in practice in South Africa. At the same time we have the distinct advantage of being able to take into consideration the experience gained in other countries which have similar schemes or schemes on a contributory basis. I believe that it is not beyond the ingenuity of us here in South Africa to devise a practical scheme which will bring about the desired effect of providing security in old-age which is the corner-stone of any social security scheme. I believe that our present form and system in South Africa is a modified form of social security. I think it is inadequate at the present time. On both sides of the House members are concerned about the increasing problem of caring for the aged. We know that because of the advances in medical science the ratio of those people in the older age groups continues to increase and will continue to do so. We have to find some formula, some system, whereby those people can be provided with security in their old age. I believe that as a part of such a social security scheme one of our main considerations should be to see that those people are adequately provided for in their old age in such a scheme.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>If there is one matter which should certainly not become a political football it is this question of the care of our aged. That is why I would welcome a calm discussion on this matter this morning. In this motion the Minister is really being asked for an inquiry with a view to positively encouraging and promoting the establishment of private pension funds for all workers. We appreciate that there are difficulties at present and that they must be eliminated, but I shall come back to this later on. In my humble opinion, however, the real request contained in this motion to encourage the establishment of these funds has not been replied to fully by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is certainly the wish of every person to have a feeling of security and freedom from financial worries when he retires and is no longer able to work. To my mind the crux of this matter is that every person should be enabled, while he is in the prime of his life and while he is in employment to put away money into a fund or a scheme which will be strong enough to give him and his dependants a reasonable income on which they can live during the period of his retirement. That knowledge gives that person a feeling of security, a feeling of independence and a feeling of pride and self-respect. In actuarial terms this same proposition can be put in this way that during his working years the worker should accumulate or save or rather invest a certain amount of capital, the interest on which will be so high that when he retires it will be sufficient to see him through until the day he dies. I feel that there are various ways in which this can be done. The first method is that of self-provision, that is to say, where the person of his own free will, through insurance policies or pension fund schemes which insurance companies offer, invests a monthly sum which will be sufficient to meet his needs when he is no longer able to work. Unfortunately this can only be done by certain individuals; the vast masses are not able to do so.</p>

<p>The second way to do this is by making available pensions as the State is doing at present, by way of pension schemes which are in operation at the moment. I want to say at once that this motion is in no way a reflection upon the State that it has neglected its people, etc. I have a few interesting figures here which I want to mention. From 1948 up to the present time the amount paid to individuals by the State in the form of pensions has increased by 120 per cent while, according to statistics, the cost of living has risen by approximately 48 per cent to 50 per cent. In other words, our pensioners, as far as real income is concerned, are much better off than they were in 1948. The figures for White pensioners are very interesting: In 1947-8 there were 97,323 pensioners and in that year they received R11,061,000 from the State; in 1962-3 there were 135,882 pensioners and they received approximately R42,000,000 from the State. In other words, these figures show that humanly speaking the State, to the best of its ability, has done its duty within the framework of existing policy.</p>

<p>The third possible method of making provision for old age is a contributory national pension scheme such as that proposed by the United Party. I want to say at once that on purely moral grounds I do not feel happy and this side of the House does not feel happy about this proposal. Even though it is a contributory pension scheme&#x2014;the contributions have been tentatively mentioned here by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) and I want to congratulate him on his well-reasoned speech&#x2014;the fact nevertheless remains that the recipient will feel in his old age that he is dependent upon the State and the State alone for his living. It really means that when he reaches the age of retirement he finds himself in this situation that he cannot say to himself with a feeling of pride and self-respect, &#x201C;I have fully taken care of myself&#x201D;, because he will constantly have the feeling that the State is taking care of him, that he has to go cap in hand and collect a small amount from the State; that like so many others his status has now been reduced from that of an individual to that of a member of the broad masses and that like all other people he now has to go and accept &#x201C;alms&#x201D;. On those grounds I do not agree with that scheme.</p>

<p>There are other objections too which have already been set out very clearly by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der <span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_0708"/>Walt) who, as we know, has been championing this cause for many years&#x2014;objections such as the costs of administration, etc. I have a few figures here which I have extracted from a White Paper which was laid on the Table in the British House of Commons a year or two ago. To my mind these figures speak volumes. In 1957, according to that White Paper, the British Government had to increase the contribution from the Treasury to the national contributory pension scheme from R60,000,000 to R248,000,000. This was over and above the amounts contributed by the contributors. In spite of this it was worked out actuarially that the anticipated deficits would be as follows: It was estimated that in the year 1961-2, in spite of this contribution of R248,000,000 by the Treasury, there would be a deficit of R288,000,000; that in the year 1971-2 there would be a deficit of R632,000,000 and in the year 1981-2 a deficit of R856,000,000. Mr. Speaker, this places a tremendous burden on the State. I say that when the State makes such a large contribution it automatically has this effect that the recipient of that pension feels that he is receiving alms, that he is receiving charity; that this is not something to which he himself contributed. As I have said, it undermines his personal morale.</p>

<p>A report was also tabled in the British House of Commons in which it was very strongly recommended that private pension funds should be encouraged. That is the fourth method that I want to mention by which this whole problem can be solved, namely, the establishment of private pension funds. Private pension funds are very strongly recommended also in Britain. This report which was tabled in the British House of Commons under the heading &#x201C;Provision for Old Age: Potential Development of National Insurance Schemes&#x201D; says, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government are convinced that changes in the field of National Insurance should be so framed as not to prevent a vigorous development of independent provision for old age whether through occupational schemes or otherwise. Here the Government have in mind not only the rights of members of existing schemes but also the future possibilities of development in this field. Moreover, such schemes constitute an important channel for the nation&#x2019;s savings and so provides a most valuable source of funds for investment. For these reasons the Government attach the greatest importance to continued development of occupational pension schemes.</block>

<p>In other words, even in Britain where there is a national pension scheme private schemes are still being encouraged and it is continually pointed out that these schemes should not be undermined by this national scheme or adversely affected by competition.</p>

<p>These private pension funds which are not State-aided&#x2014;I am referring now to funds which can be regarded as a possible source of investment and which can be used productively&#x2014;have an annual growth in America of between &#x0024;2,000,000,000 and &#x0024;3,000,000,000. It goes without saying that we are dealing here with a matter which, apart from the moral aspect, also involves purely financial implications. Existing funds, however, present a number of problems. Without repeating unnecessarily I just want to mention again some of the aspects which I have already mentioned. I think one of the biggest problems facing private pension funds at the moment is the question of transferability from one fund to another. Where a person is employed by one employer and then goes to another employer he is faced with the problem that he either has to draw his pension contributions in a lump sum and then put that money to some use&#x2014;if he can resist the temptation to spend it&#x2014;or he has to switch over to a new fund and start afresh again, with the result that his ultimate pension benefits are considerably lower.</p>

<p>Of course, a fair degree of transferability has already been brought about by the State and also by private initiative. When officials are transferred or when they switch over from one Government Department to another, their pension is transferable. In the Pensions Select Committee we often have to deal with the problem of people who are transferred from one Department to another. Let me first say this: Pension rights can only be transferred where the transfer from one Department to another meets with the approval of both Departments. Where, however, a person decides of his own free choice to go from one Department to another and the authorities or the departmental heads are not prepared to approve of it, this question of pension rights, unfortunately, is used as a sort of penal measure to penalize that person, because in that event his pension cannot be transferred. The break in service is regarded as a termination of employment, and that is when we get all these petitions before the select committee for a condonation of the break in service. It is used as a means therefore to prevent people from going from one Department to another. I understand the problem of the Public Service Commission and I understand the problem of the State as such, and that is that they cannot continually have workers switching from one Department to another. But is it right, Mr. Speaker, to use the pension fund as such, and the benefits which flow from it, as a brake to prevent these people from switching from one Department to another? After all, in the long run that Department still loses the man&#x2019;s services. If he cannot be transferred with the approval of the Department then he resigns from one Department and joins the other, and then we in the select committee have to decide whether or not to condone the break in service.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was suspended I was outlining the problems of existing funds. The first problem is that of transferability. The second point that I want to emphasize very strongly is the fact that we are really creating a problem for people who fall in the age group of 45 years and over. In the city councils we often find that a person wants to switch over from the private sector to the municipal services. When he applies for the post, whether it be that of traffic inspector or any other post, the stumbling block is usually the fact that he is obliged to join the municipal pension fund, and he cannot join the fund if he is over 45 years of age. That means that that man is automatically disqualified for the post for the simple technical reason that membership of the pension fund is the stumbling block. This problem would be solved if there was transferability of pension rights from the private sector to those schemes.</p>

<p>I have just a few minutes left and I should like to conclude by putting it this way: If in the long run we want to take good care of our people in their old age and we had to choose between a national pension scheme, as proposed by the United Party, and the establishment of private schemes to which everybody would make his contribution, it is perfectly clear to me that we must choose the latter. In recent years, since 1956, since the Pension Funds Act came into operation, there has been a very fine growth in the number of private pension funds. Let me just compare the 1958 figures with those of 1962: In 1958 there were 2,771 such funds which covered 542,214 workers and which had more or less R384,000,000 at their disposal. In 1962 we had 3,834 such funds which covered 846,584 workers and which had R670,000,000 at their disposal. This does not include the Railway Pension Fund, the Public Service Pension Fund, the pension funds of the Provincial Administrations, etc., etc., which are worth a further R700,000,000 to R750,000,000 and in which a total of about R14,000,000 is invested.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a national pension scheme, as I have already said, will mean that people will lose their self-respect. It will also mean that we will be taking the first step towards a welfare state, and that is certainly one of the forms of granting assistance that we do not want in South Africa. The South African nation has always been too proud to rely entirely on the Government and on the State alone. Some countries of the world&#x2014;I do not want to mention names&#x2014;have already developed into a welfare state to such an extent that people are born at the expense of the State by way of some subsidy or other; people go to school at the expense of the State; the children are fed in school at the expense of the State; if their appendix has to be taken out it is done at the expense of the State; if they have to get a set of dentures it is done at the expense of the State; when they eventually die they are buried at the expense of the State; they have really become nothing but creatures of the State, dependent upon charity and welfare services from the cradle to the grave. The South African nation, Mr. Speaker, wants to take care of itself and that is why we will never accept that system. We shall strive, by extending these funds&#x2014;and that is the idea underlying this motion&#x2014;to give cover and protection to everybody by means of private funds so that in 20 to 25 years&#x2019; time we shall no longer need pensions because the whole of our population will then be covered by funds to which they themselves have made their full contribution, a contribution which will ensure security for them in their old age.</p>

<p>I want to break a lance this afternoon on behalf of the Coloured employee who has found employment with a local authority, in the first instance; in commerce and industry, and in the second place; those who fall outside those categories. Over a period of years I have had some experience of dealing with the consolidation of pension funds. I have found that the Coloured man and also the Bantu man&#x2014;I intend to deal with the Coloured people to-day&#x2014;finds it difficult to gain admission to a private pension fund. One of the reasons, Sir, is that because of the low rates of pay that they get they cannot afford it, and because they are not members of trade unions, which really decide whether or not pension funds should be established, they cannot join. They find themselves in the position after giving many years of their lives in service to their employer or to a local authority, that at the end of their time they are put off, on account of illness or on account of their inability to work. They must then either seek other employment or depend on the kindness of the Government to provide them with an old-age or disability pension.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat said that one must be careful that the individual does not lose his self-respect. That is one of the reasons why we, on these benches, advocate and propagate the theory that a contributory pension fund is the correct method of ensuring security for one&#x2019;s old age.</p>

<p>That I accept, because as far as the Coloured people are concerned they will be unable to make any contributions of consequence for a considerable number of years and before they will be able to enjoy a pension commensurate with their requirements and their needs, the same as their White fellow-workers. I therefore want to appeal to the hon. the Minister, that he gives consideration to the proposition put forward by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) that in establishing pension funds, where Coloureds are involved, it would be an act of grace and <span class="col_1391-1392" refersTo="page_0710"/>of kindness on the part of the Government to see to it, that the pension fund was financially stable at the beginning. We have had the experience of pension funds starting with small contributions and being unable to pay benefits for many years. In view of the fact that Government spokesmen have made statements to the effect that they wish to uplift the Coloured people, I think the time is long overdue that some practical application might be made of that policy. I believe, when one considers the enormous amount of money spent on Defence&#x2014;with which I agree&#x2014;that money could be found to see that pension funds, which are unable to take care of the Coloured people because of low actuarial valuations, could be put on a financial footing which would be sound and acceptable to everybody.</p>

<p>I would like to say to the professional interjector on my left that nobody disputes the need and necessity for adequate defence. Speaking on behalf of the Coloured community, my contention is that a happy and contented Coloured community is the best defence we can have. We accept that the money spent of defence and other measures is necessary and essential, but in dealing with this question of pensions, I put it to the Minister that he can make a name for himself if he will give serious attention and consideration to insisting that employers&#x2019; organizations and trade unions take cognizance of the fact that there are many thousands of Coloured people employed in industry and commerce as well as by local authorities who should form part and parcel of all pension funds. That cannot be questioned. I can speak from personal experience and say, that Coloured people seeking admission to pension funds, whether in industry or in respect of local authorities, have great difficulty in getting admitted. Finally, I want to say that I do not believe that any person employed in industry should be excluded on the grounds that his term of work or his contract or his employment might be regarded as of a temporary nature. I can speak with experience and say this. There are many Coloured men and women who have given years of faithful service to their employers in all fields of activity, and yet find that when they come to the age that they can do no more, they are cast aside. Men like myself, representing as we do, Coloured people must go and do our little best, which we do willingly, if not always satisfactorily. These people receive a pension totally inadequate for their needs and requirements. I make a sincere appeal to the hon. Minister to give serious consideration to the proposition as propounded by the hon. member for Umbilo that a contributory pension fund, a fund to which, I think the Government should contribute in respect of the lower income groups, could be established with advantage to the country and for the good of all.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Like the hon. the Minister of Finance, I have listened with great interest to this debate and also with particular appreciation. The general trend of the debate was, as I already said years ago, that, the problem of the granting of allowances and increasing them and adapting them was a matter which would always face us. Since 1954 I have been saying that this is not a matter which will remain static; it is a matter which has to be adapted to the circumstances from time to time, as well as to the position of the country. Therefore I am glad when we have a discussion of this nature and standpoints are adopted on both sides of the House which we can consider and then see how in the course of time adaptations can be made in the light of the circumstances prevailing in the country. I may just say that the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) raised a matter here with which I am in full agreement. It is impossible for me to give a complete review of the investigations I made in various European countries. I told the people there at several places that we could learn from various countries and that they could learn from us, because it is a fact that the systems in the various countries differ in essence. The hon. member for Von Brandis said he thought that a matter which should receive our attention was whether older people should not work longer. I want to tell him, and I found this in several countries, that the proposition is accepted (and I agree with it) that all old people are not equally old. The hon. member for Von Brandis and I, for example, are more or less the same age, but he looks much older than I do, or I look much older than he does, and his potential is much less than mine, or mine is much less than his. That is a fact. There are people who attain a reasonably good age and who are still able to carry on further. That is one of the matters we must continually bear in mind, and we shall have to ascertain what we can do in that regard.</p>

<p>I just want to mention one other matter. I cannot go into details, but I will take the opportunity at a more convenient time to give the House a full exposition of all aspects of that investigation, so that the matter may then be discussed thoroughly. But I just want to mention one other matter, and that is the possibility of a delayed pension. The position of these people can be improved. Now the hon. member for Von Brandis and also the hon. member for Umbilo said right throughout their speeches, &#x201C;We want to institute a national contributory scheme which should be adequate&#x201D;, and the whole matter just revolves around the word &#x201C;adequate&#x201D; When is it adequate, and when is it not? Let me say that I did not find a single country in the whole of Europe where people, whatever their system, said that their national contributory scheme was adequate. I found no country in Europe where it was said that it covered everything and that it gave people a pension sufficient to live on. The hon. member for <span class="col_1393-1394" refersTo="page_0711"/>Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) said that he envisaged a scheme which, as he said, should be as follows: &#x201C;We must not be socialistic, but we must be realistic&#x201D;, and what he advocated was &#x201C;to devise a practical scheme in this sense, that it is a modified form of social security&#x201D;, But that is not a matter we can dispose of here in one afternoon.</p>

<p>When is it &#x201C;modified&#x201D; and when is it not? And how long will it remain modified? How long will it take before pressure is again exerted to have it changed? Because there are continual changes in all the schemes in all the European countries. In spite of the national contributory pension funds, they are continually making one change after another. I found that in England. They are now considering amendments. I found in every country that they were considering new legislation. I found in every country that no scheme was considered adequate. They are supplemented by numerous supplementary schemes. Time does not allow me to go into details. The hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. van der Walt) gave quite a few details this morning in regard to the position in Britain, but everywhere one goes one finds a multiplicity of supplementary schemes, State-supported supplementary schemes, some with a means test. There are numerous other organizations, private welfare organizations, which act in a supplementary capacity. As hon. members know, in Britain there is the National Assistance Board, which is a supplementary scheme financed by the State, and then one also has the County Council, which is a municipal scheme and which is also supplementary. Moreover, one has there the system of the extension of certain facilities for the aged, included in the New Town System which they are laying out on the outskirts of London, consisting of about ten new townships which are being established there, and these new towns are under the control of ten different development corporations, and these development corporations are practically welfare organizations in the sense in which we have then, but they receive State support; they cannot develop without State support. I mention these matters simply to indicate that however much we choose to argue about the matter, every country has its problems in regard to the systems it has at present, whether they are contributory or non-contributory.</p>

<p>From time to time investigations have been made in regard to this matter. As the hon. member for Umbilo also said, in 1944 the previous Government instituted an investigation and the finding was that in view of the nature and the circumstances of our population, and the position we have here, a system such as they have in Britain will not work here. From time to time thereafter people were sent abroad to investigate the position in European countries and to see whether they could find something there which would be practicable here. I remember an hon. member once saying in this House: &#x201C;The acid test for any scheme or legislation is two-fold. The first test is, is it just, and the second is will it work?&#x201D; That is a test. One cannot just experiment without knowing whether it will work or not. I am saying here to-day what I have been saying in this House all these years: When we are dealing with a matter of this sort, with pension schemes, we are dealing with very delicate matters affecting our population. The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) strenuously pleaded for the group he represents. Each hon. member who gets up here will plead for certain things, but we are dealing with the human element and these are delicate matters. When one deals with the human element one cannot just take a decision without ensuring the practicability of such a scheme.</p>

<p>Investigations were not made only in 1944. Thereafter missions were sent abroad two or three times. The hon. member for Umbilo said that we have the brains in South Africa to work out a scheme. Well, we sent some of our best brains abroad to discover what they could find in other countries in this regard and to report to us as to whether we could make a change in the system we have at present. Those officials went there from time to time and each time, on returning recommended that we adhere to the system we have. I do not want to say much about that system. The hon. the Minister of Finance has given the reply that we want to stick to this system. It is Government policy to adhere to the system we have. The Opposition says that their policy is just the opposite. They want to link up with the social security system, that system of having a contributory pension scheme. They are very careful to avoid saying whether it should be compulsory or not. Is one to have a compulsory contributory pension scheme, so that the contributions are made compulsory by an Act of Parliament, or should it not be compulsory? Should it be voluntary? They just pass the baby over to us and say we must christen it. But it is necessary to have clarity in regard to this matter when we discuss it.</p>

<p>In all my investigations I did not come across a single model scheme. That is very obvious, because the schemes differed from one another, and changes are continually being made, just as in our case. Therefore one cannot say that any one of those countries has a model scheme. These schemes differ from country to country. They differ in regard to their popularity. How popular is such a scheme in a certain country with its particular population? They differ in regard to the contributions, in regard to the benefits and in regard to the economic implications. The nature and the structure of the scheme depend on the customs and circumstances of each country, on the general philosophy of life and the economy of that country, and the various schemes differ radically from one another. Not one of these countries could tell me that they <span class="col_1395-1396" refersTo="page_0712"/>had a contributory scheme which covered everything. I was looking for a model scheme. I had 74 appointments in six weeks. I had interviews at ministerial level and at departmental level and not one of these countries could show me a contributory pension scheme which was really successful in the sense that it covered everything. In other words, these schemes have to be altered from time to time, and these supplementary services have to be provided. The complaints one hears there are that the benefits are insufficient. On the other hand, it is admitted that increasing the benefits must lead to serious economic repercussions. There is a continual spiral which starts with a demand for increased benefits by the beneficiary, but on the other hand there is also a constant dispute as to who should give those increased benefits? Usually there are three contributions, which differ in the various countries. There is the contribution of the employee, that of the employer, and the contribution by the State. But that differs in the various countries. As soon as a demand is made for increased benefits, the question immediately arises as to who is to pay for it. If the people say they cannot manage because they get too little, from whom must the increased benefits come? Will the employee as a contributor be prepared to contribute more, or will he expect it to come from the employer (who in his turn will say that it will lead to an increase in the cost of living)? That is the perpetual vicious circle, and it is a spiral which always goes up and up. Most contributions come, as I have said, from three sources, and almost everywhere I have found that people are faced with this problem and that measures are being considered to try to solve these problems.</p>

<p>I just want to give the House a few comparative figures. We would all like the benefits to be sufficient, or as nearly sufficient as possible. But the basic principle to which we have adhered all these years is that the State cannot be expected to pay everything. I have repeatedly stated in this House that it would be a sorry day for South Africa were the State to assume full responsibility for all the aged. I said it was necessary for South Africa that society should also bear some responsibility, as well as church bodies which are interested in their people. If one expects the State to bear full responsibility as far as the child and the parent are concerned, that will be a sorry day for South Africa.</p>

<p>My time is limited, but I just want to give a few figures. I have here a comparative table of a few of the benefits paid to the aged by way of contributory and non-contributory schemes in various countries. I want to state first as the basis the position in South Africa. In the Republic of South Africa (I am referring to Whites now) the amount for an unmarried person per month is from R13.50 up to R27; the joint amount where the wife is also dependent on the man&#x2019;s pension, is from R27 to R54 a month. Now I want to compare a number of countries and I shall mention whether they have contributory schemes or non-contributory schemes. In Britain, with a contributory scheme, the flat rate system, the amount for an unmarried person is from R15 to R33. It is therefore a little higher than in our case. For a married person in England it is from R24 to R53. There we are again better off. In Ireland there is a contributory scheme, and there it is from R13.70 to R17 for an unmarried person, and from R25.15 to R29.70 for a married person. There our people are quite a lot better off. But now we have this peculiar phenomenon that there are countries in Europe which have been faced with this problem for many years and they still have a contributory scheme as well as a non-contributory scheme. If these people have both schemes, are they not able to ascertain which one is the best? So in Ireland there is also a non-contributory scheme of R10.60 for an unmarried person and R12.70 for a married person. The contributory scheme&#x2019;s figure is a little higher, but the man has contributed. If he has contributed nothing, his pension is just a little less. Now it is for him to decide whether it will pay him to contribute or not. I refer to the double-barrelled scheme in France. The contributory pension scheme there depends on the wage and the contribution; it varies. For unmarried persons the non-contributory scheme pays out R9 a month. In Belgium, with a non-contributory scheme, it is about R18 per month for unmarried people, and R29 for married people, as compared with our R13 and R27. Holland, with a contributory scheme, has a maximum amount, if contributions have been paid from 15 to 65 years, of R19 for unmarried and R32 for married people. Now I again compare the first one I mentioned with the last one. When he has contributed from his 15th to his 65th year, and he gets lost somewhere along the road, then his pension is lost, but if he has contributed from his 15th to his 65th year it is R19 per month for unmarried people and R32 per month for married people, compared with our R13 and R27. But in that case it includes his contributions from his 15th to his 65th year.</p>

<p>I mention these things to show how complicated the position is. I want to mention one more case. In Britain, where the ordinary person pays R1.06 a week by way of national insurance, one finds that in spite of the fact that this scheme has been in operation for 16 years, there are still 20 per cent of those receiving the old-age pension who receive a supplementary pension. Twenty per cent is a high percentage. Supposing we just introduce a scheme like that, and after having done so we discover that 20 per cent of the people still have to receive additional assistance! Then it will be said that the scheme is a failure, that it does not cover everything.</p>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties in regard to contributory schemes is that they are all accompanied by economic and financial problems. Take this practical case: Sixteen years ago a man paid in R1 a month, and as the <span class="col_1397-1398" refersTo="page_0713"/>value of money fluctuates, he continues to contribute. Now he expects benefits in proportion to that R1. To-day his R1 is worth only 50 cents. Are you now going to pay him double the amount under such a scheme? I obtained a mass of literature, literally bags full. In every country I visited I asked the people concerned to send me details, to send me brochures and the legislation they have there. It constitutes a mass of literature. I had to call on the services of a special section of my Department to study that literature together with me in order to determine the full implications of all those things. One can probably learn much from it, but one has to study the full implications. In 1958 the following percentage of persons who received benefits under the National Insurance Scheme in Britain also received additional assistance. It is given as retirement pensions and sick benefits and widows&#x2019; benefits and unemployment benefits. But what was the position in 1958? Of the people who retired, 20 per cent had to receive additional assistance&#x2014;20.4 per cent; of those who received sick benefits 11.6 per cent had to receive additional assistance, and 11 per cent of the widows had to receive assistance, and of those who drew unemployment benefits 19.1 per cent had to be given additional assistance. I just want to mention that I received this publication in which one of the British Members of Parliament dealing with this matter, Mr. Hall, made a very thorough study. He wrote a book, &#x201C;The Social Services of Modern England&#x201D;, in which he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The problem of providing adequate retirement pensions without imposing too great a burden on the insurance fund is proving the most obstinate of all our social security problems of the day.</block>

<p>That is the finding of people who have investigated the matter. I do not want to take up more time. I will come back to these matters on other occasions. I think it is essential for us to discuss these matters frankly. That is why I appreciate the spirit in which this discussion has taken place. As hon. members know, the doors of my Department and of my office have always been open to anyone wishing to suggest improvements. I think hon. members on both sides of the House will agree that over the years I have not been obstinate in regard to these matters. I try to the best of my ability, and in as far as the capacity of the country allows, to do as much as I possibly can to improve the existing position.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I hope the hon. the Minister will forgive me if I do not deal with his speech in detail. I appreciate that he has gone overseas and has come back rather more puzzled than he was when he left. He has realized, I hope, that the problem is not easy to solve, or one which will probably never be solved finally. But I hope he has also opened his mind. It is true that he opens his doors and that the doors of his Department are always open to us, and we are grateful for that, but I hope his mind is also open and that he has realized that this is not a problem of social welfare and pensions but a dynamic problem of life, a problem of providing for what will happen to the man when he can no longer work. Even more, it is a problem of deciding at what stage of his life shall it be decided that he is no longer able to work? And can it be decided that when he is unable to do a full day&#x2019;s work will he not be allowed to do half a day&#x2019;s work? The way the Department has faced this problem is that you count up the birthdays and you come to the point where the man may receive a pension. I feel that if we are to have a departmental inquiry, as was suggested by the hon. the Minister of Finance, it will be a waste of time because we have to get a new outlook. The picture to be seen is: How are the people living; what has happened that within some 20 years an increasing number of old people are living among us, and what has happened to change the Afrikaner outlook of looking after their old people? Why has it happened? These are not problems for the Department of Social Welfare, but problems which should be solved by the best brains we can find in the country. We should not just look for pensions for old people, but we should provide for their old age, and we should decide at what point old age arises. Those are the things we want to see. Of course the Minister could not find a solution in England or in any other country. No country has found the solution, because it is an ever-recurring problem and it is ever-increasing. Life is changing, taxes are changing and also the cost of living, and there is inflation. All these things must be met by his Department, which must make provision for the care of a person who can no longer work. So what is the Department of Labour doing to help him? Is it providing sufficient work for the older people? In the State of New York it is a punishable offence for an employer to retire a man purely on the ground that his birthdays count up to a certain number, but here we go on retiring people by counting their birthdays and it is suggested that when they have a few more birthdays the means test should be relaxed. There should be no means test at all. It is not necessary to have it. You must put something in its place. When a man is no longer able to work and cannot provide for himself, he should have a right to a pension. In any civilized community it would be a right. We, as a civilized community, cannot allow our old people to live in abject poverty. They should not have to come with their hands open and beg for a pension. It should be a right. As a civilized community we should say to them: We will see that you are provided for; just show us what you have. It is a right, and not a privilege.</p>

<p>No, it will not be a means test. All that is necessary is that the person should make a return of some sort which can be used by the Department of Internal Revenue, and any who require assistance should be passed on to this Minister&#x2019;s Department. There is nothing disgraceful in sending in a return to the Department of Inland Revenue. If you make a return which shows your income, that Department should be able to assess whether you are entitled to assistance. Perhaps that needs a little elaboration, but I have not the time. I only hope that the Minister will talk to the Minister of Finance and appoint a commission consisting of members of his Department and of Labour and Inland Revenue and also the best social workers in the country and the best professors of sociology at our universities and see what can be done for this group who are past working, and at the same time see what can be done to persuade the younger workers to defer some of their wages and draw them at a later date as a pension, or not as a pension but as something to which they have contributed.</p>

<p><b>RELIEF TO SOCIAL PENSIONERS</b></p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>We have heard various suggestions to-day as to how our problem of caring for the aged may be solved. Those suggestions have all been long-term suggestions, solutions which will only grant benefits some time in the distant future. I believe that the plight of social pensioners to-day is one which requires the urgent attention of the Government to bring about an alleviation of their circumstances. I believe their present plight is due to three main factors: Firstly, the inadequacy of the pensions, the restrictions of the means test which debar a number of people from obtaining pensions and in many instances reduces the amount of pensions to which they are entitled, and thirdly, the inadequacy of accommodation which is within the means of those persons who are unable to afford the increased cost of accommodation to-day. For that reason I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House urges the Government to consider the advisability of taking steps to alleviate the present position of social pensioners by, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) reviewing the rate of pensions;</li>

<li>(b) relaxing the means test; and</li>

<li>(c) providing adequate accommodation.</li>

</ol>

<p>In dealing with the present plight of the pensioner and taking into account the fact that these pensioners have to live on very small pensions indeed, I am sure that the majority of hon. members will agree that the present pension of R24.50 a month paid to the White pensioners can hardly be considered sufficient on which to maintain a decent standard of life. There are small numbers who receive a special allowance of R2.50, and who therefore receive R27 a month, and I will deal with that later. The present pension, it is true, has been increased over the years by this Government, I am sure that all pensioners are grateful every time an increase is made in pensions, but the fact remains that the present pensions are hopelessly inadequate. When we consider that South Africa at present is going through a period of economic prosperity which in its trail is bringing a degree of inflation we must then realize that those persons living on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, do not derive any benefit whatever from such a boom. Indeed, it has an adverse effect on their everyday living. In view of the increased costs, it means that these persons have no alternative but to reduce their standard of living. The increases which have been given have in my opinion lagged behind when compared with the purchasing power of the money placed in their pockets. The continual reduction in that purchasing power has tended to make the position of our social pensioners even more difficult. I mention the question of people with a fixed income, and although it is not mentioned in this motion I think we should also take cognizance of the fact that there are other pensioners like Railway pensioners, police pensioners and others who retired many years ago and who did not derive any benefit from the consolidation of cost of living with basic wages, or from any of the amendments of the Act concerning their pensions. They, too, are having a hard struggle to maintain their standard of living. Here, too, the means test is of no benefit to them. If they receive an increased temporary allowance or bonus it means that their pension is then adjusted, and it is accordingly reduced, so they do not derive any benefit from the increased temporary allowances but merely continue to draw the same pension as in the past.</p>

<p>The question of the adequacy of our pensions is one which is of vital concern to the 126,000 who receive such pensions from the Government. I hope that these persons will be assisted in the forthcoming Budget by receiving some relief from their present position. I hope that the Minister will use his influence to bring about relief in the form of increased pensions. I believe that in times of prosperity our thoughts should also turn to those less fortunate citizens who are suffering financial hardship, namely the poor, the aged and the disabled, particularly when we consider that the aged have toiled hard and long in building up this young country. These persons have perhaps given their labour for 40 years and they have paid direct and indirect taxation as well as contributing towards the general building up of the country, and they should deserve <span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_0715"/>better compensation than the present rate of pension.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the Government had granted increases over the years, and I am quite sure that hon. members opposite will quote those increases during the debate. As I said earlier, those increases are appreciated, but when we take into account the decrease in the purchasing power of our money it is only essential that such increases should be made. The present increased cost of the necessities of life, particularly food and shelter and clothing, make it necessary that these people should receive further assistance from the Government. While dealing with the inadequacy of the pensions, I have only mentioned the pensions for the Whites, a maximum amount of R24.50 or R27 with the allowance, but we must also realize that that amount has a direct bearing on the welfare of the pensioners in the other racial groups. A ratio is applied whereby the Coloured receives half of the White man&#x2019;s pension, the Asiatic five-twelfths and the Bantu two-twelfths. That makes us realize that any increase in White pensions will also help the others. The Bantu only receive a maximum pension of R3.52&#x00BD; a month, so you can see, Sir, that although I am pleading the case of the White pensioner, it will also assist the non-Whites. I do not wish to dwell on the principle involved in regard to the ratio of the pensions paid to the various groups, but I think the time has perhaps arrived for the Government to reconsider the position. After all, the cost of food and clothing is just as high for the non-Whites as for the Whites, although naturally they do not maintain the same standard of living.</p>

<p>The plight of certain pensioners who are struggling to exist on the present amount paid to them has brought to light assistance from the private sector, and from philanthropic bodies. Particularly in the Durban area one of the local newspapers carries out a campaign to highlight the difficulties experienced by pensioners, and it is pleasing to note that the people have responded to such an extent that considerable sums of money have been raised and that they have proceeded to establish further homes for the aged in that area. I know that is in line with the thoughts of the hon. the Minister. His view, which I share, is that our welfare matters can be based on the coordination of the State, welfare organizations and the churches. However, I feel that if greater assistance is given to our welfare organizations by way of subsidies, there might be even a greater response from the private sector. At the same time it is often impossible for the welfare organizations to achieve their main object due to financial restrictions, and they are often ignorant of the fact that there are people living in such dire straits.</p>

<p>The other aspect I wish to discuss is in regard to the special allowance. Last session the Pension Laws Amendment Act was passed. Amongst other things, this Act makes provision for a special allowance of R2.50 per month in respect of certain social pensioners who qualify for it in terms of the definition defining the special allowance and imposing certain restrictions. In reply to a question earlier this month, the Minister informed the House that of the 126,469 pensioners, i.e. old age, war veterans and disability pensions and those for blind persons, 42,457 were receiving the special allowances of R2.50. The object of this allowance, we were informed, was to cater for the needy amongst the needy. This has entailed a tremendous amount of administrative work by the Department, and I must say that a large number of pensioners are very disappointed because they did not qualify for that allowance. Many of them consider themselves to be in needy circumstances, and many of them, perhaps under a misapprehension, considered that they should have received this R2.50 a month. However, the provisions laid down in the Act last year stated that no social pensioner shall receive the extra R2.50 a month if he receives more than R5 a month from any other source and in the opinion of the commissioner his financial circumstances do not justify the payment of the extra R2.50. The Minister was good enough, in reply to a question earlier this month, to give the reasons why certain persons did not qualify for that amount. One is that they exceeded the R5 a month, which is understandable. The other is that they are inmates of old-age homes, and this has caused a good deal of confusion amongst the aged. Naturally, going through the 120,000 odd files the Department had to base its application of the means test for the special allowance, which really is a means test within a means test, on often obsolete information. So we had the position where persons living in old-age homes received this allowance, but others received nothing at all. I understand that those living in old-age homes have now had the special allowance withdrawn and it has been held that no person shall qualify for such an allowance if he is resident in an old-age home. The other point that disqualified them from receiving this allowance was that they were receiving grants towards their maintenance from charitable sources, and the last point is that they possessed certain assets. From the information I was supplied with, I understand that those assets were classified as being the amount of R10. Now, Sir, you can realize that there is a large number of social pensioners who have put aside a small sum of money towards some urgent necessity which might arise in future, such as travelling to see a sick relative in another part of the Republic. Others have put aside money to pay for their funeral expenses. I hope that the Minister has come to a decision in regard to a suggestion I made to him last year that he should consider this matter in regard to the assets and allow those persons who have up to R200 also to qualify for the special allowance. I understand the Minister has considered the matter and I hope <span class="col_1403-1404" refersTo="page_0716"/>he will be able to give us some further information in that regard to-day.</p>

<p>Now I believe that this extra allowance of R2.50 should have been treated as a general increase in social pensions. It has involved a tremendous amount of administrative work, and I believe there are many cases of people who can be classified as being needy amongst the needy, and who should receive due consideration. The cost of living has increased over the past two years, but 75 per cent of these pensioners did not receive any increase because they did not qualify for this special allowance.</p>

<p>The other leg of this motion deals with the question of the means test. If we look at the history of the means test we find that as far back as 1944 it was advocated that the means test should gradually be abolished. The select committee on Social Security stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In pursuing the objective of encouraging the individual to provide for himself, the Social Security Committee drew attention to the fact that the more rigid the means test according to which the pension is determined, the less, obviously, is the inducement to save and to continue earning.</block>

<p>We also know that in the same year, 1944, some 20 years ago, the S.A. National Conference for the Post-War Planning of Social Welfare Work also recommended a gradual abolition of the means test for all old age pensions. So it has been a source of concern for many years. When we look at the present means test, I believe the time has arrived for the Government to consider raising the amount of free income allowed, and also to reconsider the amount of free assets permitted in the case of married persons of R2,400 and of R1,200 in the case of unmarried person. The greatest drawback in regard to the application of the means test is the discrimination against those persons who have managed to acquire a certain amount of capital and those who have invested their money in a property and have taken up to thirty years to pay it off and then find that when the time comes for them to apply for the old age pension the unencumbered value of the property is taken into account and can disqualify them for the old age pension. Most municipalities have revalued properties in recent years, which means that those now applying for pensions are at a disadvantage as compared with those who applied a few years ago before revaluation took place. I know of cases of persons living in almost indentical houses where the one has qualified for a pension and the other has not, due to the fact that a revaluation took place between the time the first person applied and the time the second one applied. I think that serious consideration must be given to increasing the amount allowed as free assets. Similarly, persons now have to invest more money in endowment policies and other insurance so as to cater for their old age, and they find that the limit on the amount of free assets is disadvantageous to them, and it discourages them from increasing their insurance. A modification of the means test naturally requires thorough investigation. I know that the hon. the Minister made a statement on this subject in the House last year and subsequently all members received a memorandum setting out the present method of applying the means test. Certain concessions were made. Some of them were very valuable concessions. I refer, e.g., to the dispossession of assets, which is beneficial to the applicant for a pension, and also the question of the recovery of overpayments, which is now dealt with more leniently and more sympathetically than in the past. But I believe that the present limits imposed by the means test require urgent overhaul and attention. The amount of free income which is permitted is R180 per annum. Thereafter R12 per annum is deducted from the basic pension for every R12 in excess of R180. That means that once a single person reaches an income of R312 per annum, he is not entitled to receive any pension whatsoever. I know that wherever the level is set there will always be borderline cases. I believe, however, that this level is too low and that it should be raised. I would like to illustrate the point I am making by quoting a recent case where a 63-year-old widow in part-time employment as a housekeeper in a hotel was receiving a wage of R283,32 per annum, which is R23.61 per month. As she was 63 years of age she applied for a pension and received a basic old-age pension of R2 per month plus the additional R7 per month plus the bonus of R5.50 per month, making a total of R14.50 per month. Together with her income of R23.61 she was getting R38.11 per month. This person is a self-supporting widow living in a small room on her own. She lives a simple life, without any luxuries, and she managed to make ends meet on R38 per month. Then in terms of an Industrial Council determination her salary was increased by 51c per week. She was then paid R6.06 per week in terms of this determination, in other words, R26.26 per month. The moment this happened she lost her old-age pension of R14.50 per month. This meant that she now received only R26.26 per month. She has therefore suffered an overall loss of R11.85 per month in her income due to the fact that her salary as a part-time worker was increased by 51c per week. If she had not received this increase in wages she would still be receiving R38.11 per month. I think this illustrates the difficulty that is experienced by the person who receives a small increase in wages and then loses R11.85. This matter was taken up with the Department and unfortunately the reply was one which I expected because the departmental people have no alternative but to end their letter by saying, as they so often have to do as a result of the application of the means test, &#x201C;Your representations have been carefully and sympathetically <span class="col_1405-1406" refersTo="page_0717"/>considered, but as it is not possible to waive or modify the provision of the old-age Pensions Act, the Department is, to its regret, not in a position to be of assistance in this matter.&#x201D; I do not blame the Department in any way. The officials of the Department are sympathetic, dedicated men who do a great service for the social pensioner, but they are completely hamstrung by certain provisions of the Pensions Act. I believe that it is of vital importance that the means test should be modified. Those people who just fail to qualify for a pension are experiencing great difficulties. Here we have a case where a woman is prepared to do part-time work, and then she suddenly finds that because she has been given a slight increase in her wages she loses her social pension. That sort of thing certainly does not encourage people over the age of 60 years to work. If anything it encourages them to sit back and to say, &#x201C;Well if I do not work I can collect my full pension from the State.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The other aspect of the motion before the House is the question of providing adequate accommodation for the aged. I know that the Minister in reply to a question earlier this Session stated that the erection of a further 30 subsidized homes had been approved. I realize that a great deal has been done in this regard and I appreciate that, but I feel that with the present accommodation position as it is the Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister of Housing and with our local authorities to try to ascertain what the shortage of accommodation is, particularly in the case of aged persons. With the upsurge in the building industry, it has become common practice to demolish old buildings and put up large new buildings. As the result of the demolition of that old building, numbers of old-age pensioners are invariably thrown onto the street, people who have been managing to survive on their pensions in an old room in an old building at a small rental. They are then faced with the problem of finding alternative accommodation which is within their means. As far as homes for the aged are concerned, a tremendous burden has been placed on the shoulders of these old people. I know that homes in my constituency have long waiting lists of persons who wish to be accommodated in those homes. Sir, this matter has been aggravated by the boom conditions which exist in South Africa to-day, particularly in the building industry, because the building that goes up in the place of an old building is a new modern building in which the rentals are far beyond the means of these social pensioners. I do believe that a survey should be carried out by the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions together with his colleague, the Minister of Housing, together with local authorities, because this is an aspect which particularly affects social pensioners living in the urban areas. I have mentioned earlier that in some local authority areas the matter has been highlighted by members of the Press, and this has awakened the sense of responsibility of the public to provide more adequate accommodation for these people. I do hope that the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions will realize that this is a very real problem facing these people. Many of them have nowhere to go; the homes for the aged are full, and their accommodation problem is becoming more and more acute. It has become more and more acute particularly in the last six months. Sir, I do not want to weary the House by quoting the many cases where social pensioners have experienced great hardship. I am sure that almost every member of this House has been inundated, particularly during the past year, with requests for assistance from social pensioners. I believe that one of the main causes of their present plight is that they are not receiving attention which enables them to maintain a higher standard of living. In some instances they are not receiving the full pension because of the limit imposed by the means test, and thirdly they are faced with the difficulty of finding accommodation because the older buildings are fast disappearing in a number of our cities. Sir, I hope to get support for this motion from hon. members opposite and from the Minister himself who, I know, is deeply conscious of the fact that he is responsible for the welfare of this ever-growing number of aged persons who have to look to the State for assistance and who in many instances have nowhere to look for assistance except to the State. I hope that that support and assistance will be forthcoming.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I listened with interest, and even with a certain amount of pleasure to the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). I say &#x201C;with a certain amount of pleasure&#x201D; because he gave the impression&#x2014;and I think rightly so&#x2014;that he was not only interested in but even concerned about the welfare of the less privileged, the less fortunate members of our society. We know him as a person who is always advocating the cause of the poor man, and to-day he has again asked for concessions, for relief, for those persons who are in difficulty. Can anyone quarrel with him when he asks for concessions for pensioners? I think that we all agree with him. We cannot oppose the principle of this matter because we would all like to see the burden of our less-privileged people alleviated. We would all very much like to see that those people who in their time made their contribution towards the prosperity of this wonderful land of ours are able in their old age to live as happily and as free of care as possible. All of us would like to grant increased pensions and concessions to those people. But the hon. member is in a fortunate position in that he <span class="col_1407-1408" refersTo="page_0718"/>can continue to ask for more&#x2014;I think he can ask for the moon&#x2014;because he realizes that the responsibility does not rest upon him to find the means to meet these increasing expenses. We can all ask for more but we must remember that whatever we ask for must be practicable. We must ensure that the ideals that we set for ourselves are practicable. Our world is such that ideals usually have to remain subordinate to what is practicable. That is why we must be practical and ask ourselves what we consider to be a suitable pension that will satisfy people. Somebody says: &#x201C;Enough to live on.&#x201D; In this regard too we would also differ, because what amount is really adequate? One cannot define it. I had an old friend who used to say, &#x201C;enough is just a little more than you have&#x201D;, and there is a great deal of truth in that because as one&#x2019;s income increases, one&#x2019;s desires and one&#x2019;s needs also increase. The more we have the more we find we need. We therefore have to adopt a certain attitude in regard to this matter, and as I see the position the pensions which are being paid to-day to needy persons are not at all intended to meet all their requirements. These pensions are merely supplementary; they are simply intended as a contribution to alleviate the problems of pensioners. We are not a welfare state, nor would we like to be one. It is because we hold this view, because we believe that the State, the Church and society have to work together in this matter that we also believe that it is not only money that people need. We have all often noticed that what they pray for is a little interest, a little friendship, a little love from their fellow-man. It is not sufficient for us as their fellow-men simply to put our hands into our pocket or to sign an inanimate cheque and then to imagine that the matter ends there. It is a fact that we ourselves are enriched by showing friendship and love towards our fellowman and I believe that I am correct in saying that this privilege must never be withheld from other members of our society because here too it is &#x201C;more blessed to give than to receive&#x201D;. When we start asking for more concessions, we must remember that the money does not come from an interest-bearing fund but that it comes from ordinary revenue. It is therefore absolutely essential that very strict and careful control be exercised because we usually find that the number of pensioners and the pensions themselves have a tendency to snowball. I want to add that we must also be particularly careful to ensure that the question of pensions never become a political football here in this country. It is very easy for one party to try to bid higher than the other, but the final result must be to plunge the Government of the day into heavy financial commitments, no matter which Government may be in power. We must remember that once a pension has been granted, it is not easy to reduce it again; indeed, it is almost impossible. I want to emphasize the fact here that in discussing our present pensions, we must remember that these pensions are not the only financial assistance given to pensioners. They do not form the only benefit; pensioners also receive other benefits. I want to mention specifically medical services and the privileges that pensioners receive within as well as outside old-age homes and institutions and by way of services which are amply subsidized by the Government.</p>

<p>In making these few general remarks I want to point out that we are being asked here to reconsider the scale of pensions. That is precisely what the Government is doing. I must emphasize this fact. That is precisely what the Government is doing. Commission after commission and committee after committee have been appointed and almost without exception these scales have been increased practically every year and the pensioner has benefited accordingly. In 1947, for example, the maximum pension payable was R120 per annum and this amount has been regularly reviewed until to-day the maximum pension amounts to R324, an increase of 170 per cent. I think it is of importance to mention this fact because the hon. member for Umbilo says that the increase in pensions has not kept pace with the rise in the cost of living. Of course, his allegation in this regard is wrong. The increase in pensions has far exceeded the increase in the cost of living. Since 1948 the cost of living has risen by 68.2 per cent while there has been an increase of 170 per cent in pensions. The total amount paid out in pensions in 1947 was R6,570,000 while more than R40,000,000 was paid out last year&#x2014;six times as much. We must also remember when we consider this increase in the total sum that it does not represent only the proportionate increase in the number of pensioners. On the contrary, as we heard just now, there are about 126,000 pensioners in the country today. In 1947 this number stood at 60,000. There are to-day twice as many pensioners as there were in 1947 but six times as much is being paid out in pensions. Pensions have been increased by R3,500,000 to R5,000,000 per annum almost every year. I would like to mention a few figures in this connection. In 1952-3 pensions were increased by R4,500,000; in 1953-4, by R4,450,000; in 1955-6 by R3,800,000; in 1956-7 there was an increase of R5,400,000 and in 1962-3 an increase of R3,550,000. But these are not the only benefits which the pensioners have received; other concessions have also been made to them over the course of years. We find that as far back as 1953 the following concession was made, that when a person reaches the age of 70 years and is still employed, the amount that he receives from his employer is not taken into consideration in determining his pension. The age limit for minor children was raised from 16 years to 18 years if the children are full-time students. Then again we used to have various scales on which pensions were paid. There was one scale for the city-dweller, one for the town-dweller and one for the people who lived in the rural areas. That <span class="col_1409-1410" refersTo="page_0719"/>has gradually been abolished until to-day we have only one scale. This has greatly benefited the platteland pensioner. Moreover, pensions are now paid from the first day of the month in which application is made to the first day of the month following the date on which the pensioner is no longer entitled to a pension.</p>

<p>A problem that has always given us a great deal of trouble is the question of overpayments and in this respect a very great concession has been made. It is only in those cases where the office has made a mistake or where there has been a case of deliberate dishonesty that repayment is demanded, but this is not made retrospective for a period longer than three years. The attendance allowance has also been increased from R36 to R48 per annum. And so I could go on. Think of the improvement that has been brought about in connection with married couples where the one spouse dies and the surviving spouse continues to live in the same house. The pension of the surviving spouse now remains unaltered. Even though the valuation of that house is increased by the city council, it does not affect the pension of the surviving spouse. Then there is also the special bonus to which the hon. member for Umbilo referred. I do not deny that this may perhaps cause practical problems, but it nevertheless remains a fact that it was introduced with very good intentions. The whole idea was to assist the poorest people&#x2014;those people, particularly in the cities, who have to spend their lives in small rooms. The intention therefore was very good. The hon. member asked for larger subsidies. Here too we notice that the subsidies have been increased from time to time. The subsidy for sickly people in old-age homes has been increased from R8 to R10 per month; the subsidy on furniture has been increased from R30 to R60. All these things indicate very clearly that the Government does review the scales regularly from time to time.</p>

<p>I do not have much to say in regard to the other leg of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion&#x2014;the question of the means test&#x2014;but I just want to point out that any concession, no matter how small it may be, always result in an increased number of pensioners. It is impossible to determine to what extent these numbers will increase and that is why it is also virtually impossible to determine in advance what additional expenditure will be involved. In this way the expenditure increases from year to year. If the means test is abolished altogether it is estimated that it will cost the State about R80,000,000. Last year the hon. member for Umbilo adopted a sensible approach to this matter. He said very clearly in his speech then that he realized that it was impossible to do away with the means test. I refer to Col. 4749 (Afrikaans text).</p>

<p>Another aspect of the abolition of the means test is that we will be giving more and more relief to the more well-do-do person instead of the very poor person and that is why I say that it cannot be done lightly. As far as the provision of housing is concerned, I want to repeat what I said just now. All of us would very much like to see every old person living in an ideal and pleasant home in a nice locality. Everyone would like to see that, but Rome was not built in a day. I contend that the Government has also done its duty in this respect. In 1947 we only had 25 subsidized old-age homes but this Government increased that number. In 1961 there were 84 and at the moment there are 99 subsidized homes with a further 30 under construction. In mentioning these matters here it is not my intention to pat the National Government on the back but here we have a clear indication that we do appreciate the seriousness of the position; that the Government is very much aware of the problem and that the Government is not neglecting its duty. It is very clear that the Government is most sympathetically disposed towards the less-privileged people in this country and that this Government is still the best friend of our old people. I am convinced that the National Government will continue along these lines and do everything in its power, as it has done in the past, to ensure that the burden of the less-privileged people is lightened. What is more, we know too that pensioners are aware of the concessions that this Government is continually making and we know that they appreciate those concessions and that they are grateful for them.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>We are dealing with a group of people who one would imagine from what we have heard, are helpless and unable to help themselves. There are approximately 250,000 people over 60 years of age in our population. In the case of our White people we have 126,000 who are getting pensions. Actually 250,000 are eligible to apply. Of the 126,000 who are getting a pension I do not think more than 2 or 3 per cent can come out on the money which they are receiving from the Government by way of pension. Pious platitudes and promises and sympathy towards them is not going to fill their tummies. They want something more from us than just an investigation. [Quorum.] As I was saying, Sir, we have 126,000 pensioners of whom only a very small proportion can come out on the money that they receive from the Government. This proportion only manage to come out because of the subsidies they receive from their families. What are we going to do about this? The first thing is that the Government must obviously help. I would immediately suggest that the hon. the Minister increases the pension by R2, at least. It will cost the Government approximately R3,000,000, if my calculation is correct. I think it will be money well spent. The extra R2 per month is going to help them tremendously.</p>

<p><span class="col_1411-1412" refersTo="page_0720"/>There are other difficulties that these people have had to meet during the last year; not in the last five years, but in the last year. Firstly, we have heard about the housing problem and I want to elaborate on that. From the latest figures I have received I find that approximately 40,000 immigrants will come into the country. Those 40,000 immigrants will have to be housed in 9,000 houses or flats and those will have to be found for them. It means that a great deal of demolishing will have to take place. From what I have seen vacant land is very rarely used to erect flats or to erect houses except under very large housing schemes. Demolishing takes place, and it takes place in those areas where rents are lowest and where income is low. It means that there is going to be an evacuation of a large number of pensioners from these low-rental sites. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) has already referred to that. There is going to be a period between eviction and housing for these people, a period during which they will find it almost impossible to find alternative accommodation. Where are they going to stay? I think it is quite disgraceful for a country such as ours, where we boast day after day about our economy, that some of our pensioners should seek accommodation in back-rooms; back-rooms which were previously used by non-European servants who have been evacuated because of the Group Areas Act. In many houses, to-day, back-rooms which were previously occupied by non-Whites are being used to-day by White people?</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I would not make a statement such as that if it was not a fact. Not only are they going into those rooms but they are using garages as well. If people want to close their eyes to the sort of thing that is happening it behaves them to open their eyes and make sure that they help those unfortunate old people. I would like to ask the Minister to take steps immediately to see that as many as possible of these old people are housed properly. This housing must not be slap-dash. I would say that prefabricated houses must be erected as soon as possible to house these people temporarily and planning must be done as I asked for last year in the Budget debate. I think the ideal place for pensioners to live would be in a village for elderly people. It must be realized that because a person is 65 he is not helpless and that he would still like to do a certain amount of work. I think that work could be undertaken in a model village for elderly persons. I am not referring to them as the old-aged, because it makes them appear to be helpless. They are elderly people who cannot find employment in the open market. Many of them are still very skilled at their work. I would like these people to be given an opportunity to go on working because it is a great punishment for them to remain idle. They want to work. In a model village they will be able to work. It is not necessary for them always to go to the same type of work that they did previously, especially, if they previously did heavy manual work. But in a village, as I see it, they could work in groups to produce their own wants to a great extent.</p>

<p>The cost of living has been attacked here time and again. We have said that with the rising costs it is impossible for the pensioner to meet the costs that he has to incur for his immediate needs. I would suggest that in this village the shops are run by the local authority where these people can buy their groceries, meat, milk, etc. at cost. That would help them a great deal if this could take place and it could so easily take place. Because social welfare was taken away from some of the local authorities, local authorities such as Johannesburg for instance, the mobile vans where the poor people could buy groceries, milk, fish and meat at very, very low prices have disappeared. We must now offer these people something in its place. To a great extent the benefit of those mobile vans has been lost to the pensioner. I say that system must be re-introduced. It is impossible for the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare to undertake this work himself for all areas. He must delegate the work to the local authority, especially if the local authority is one which is willing to undertake this type of work. We are dealing today with people who want to continue to live; they want to live and they want to be useful citizens. It is up to the Minister and his department to see that opportunities are given to these people to see the rest of their days out in comfort and in a useful manner.</p>

<p>Let us go to some of the other difficulties that have arisen here. Because of the gradual increase in the cost of living we find that less and less of the almost essentials are not being purchased by the old-age pensioner or by the social pensioner. What does that person do with his time if he is unable to work? It is almost impossible for him to buy a newspaper every day. We have asked again and again for free radio licences for these people, so that they could have the use of the radio. We find that they are unable to get help from libraries because we do not have sufficient mobile libraries to visit the various areas to help those people to get books. We find that they are unable to attend any form of entertainment except if it is one of special occurrence; some local authority will devote an afternoon or a night to the entertainment of a group of people&#x2014;that group may be 60 or 70. And it only happens in odd areas that such entertainment is given to these people. So a sense of deterioration is besetting that group who are getting pensions. They are deteriorating because they are not kept busy. We must find ways and means for them to become active as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="col_1413-1414" refersTo="page_0721"/>The hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) told us earlier on to-day about the shortage of manpower in our country. I have asked that a register should be kept of old-age pensioners who could be called upon for part-time work. I enumerated last year the type of work that old-age pensioners, male and female, could undertake to do. What has been done about it? It was a reasonable suggestion. For instance the Government paid out, I do not know how many thousands of pounds, during the last enrolment for the voters roll. How many old-age pensioners were called upon to undertake that work? Did the Minister have a register of these people? Did he ask them to come along and help in that work? I do not think so. There was an opportunity for these people to earn something. I expressly stated then that any earnings that those people made should not be deducted from their pensions. A number of them said: &#x201C;Yes, we do not mind going to work; we shall only be too happy to do so but what is going to happen to our pensions if we take this temporary work; will it not be deducted from our pensions; will we not find ourselves in greater difficulty at the end of two months than we were previously?&#x201D; These things were not explained to the people. I think the time has come, Sir, that we have got to do these things for those people and show them that there are ways and means of earning a little bit extra that will not affect their pensions I could go on; I could tell this House of dozens and dozens of difficulties that arise as far as these pensioners are concerned but it will not help us to solve the problem. I must appeal to the Minister now to consider forthwith the raising immediately of the present pensions that he is giving to the social pensioners. I ask for a rise of R2 per month. It is going to help these people tremendously. It is only going to cost the State about R3,000,000 per annum. Surely it is a very small amount to ask for for these people and it would be a boon to them. Let us hear from the Minister whether he is prepared to do it. I am sure that the Treasury would not object. They have been boasting, as I said earlier on, about the large amount of money in their coffers. Give some of that money to the poor people.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) has rather exaggerated and I feel that it is my duty to correct him. I represent a constituency in which there are many less-privileged people but I have not found one single family in my whole constituency living in servants&#x2019; quarters. This story is told in this House and then sent overseas for foreign consumption. The story is exaggerated and people are told that this Government treats its old people very badly. I do not want to say that there is an unlimited number of houses available. There is a tremendous shortage of housing. But there is not such a shortage that it is necessary for people to live in backyards.</p>

<p>The point that I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister is that accommodation must be provided for our old people on a large scale. There are very few State institutions to which these people can go. There are certain institutions which have been set up by private enterprise but I think it is time the State took the initiative and ensured that accommodation was made available for the aged. Some hon. members have been advocating the abolition of the means test for years. It is obvious that we cannot do that. The fact remains that if that were done, we would find ourselves in the same position in which the Provincial Administration of Transvaal found itself when it made provision for free hospital services. Wealthy people made us of those hospital services while the people who needed them could not be given a bed. But we must have some relaxation of the means test. Let us take the example of a man or a woman, jointly or separately owning property. The property may perhaps not be worth more than R3,000 and yet, that person is discriminated against. I have written proof that such a person has been told that in view of the fact that he owns such a property he cannot be considered for the special allowance of R3 which is payable today. That is unfair, Mr. Speaker. Although these people have a roof over their heads they have to pay rates they have to make their monthly repayments to the building society; they have to pay for water and electricity. The result is that they are worse off than those persons who do not own property. This does not encourage old people to acquire their own property. I do not think that houses ought to be considered when applying the means test, but if this is necessary then the means test ought to be fixed at a very high figure&#x2014;higher than it is at the moment. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to ensure that in the future we do not grant an increase to the aged on the basis on which it was done last year. It only causes a great deal of trouble. These people simply cannot understand why one section receives it and the other section does not. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to find ways and means either by way of legislation or by making provision in the Estimates to enable those people who are not paid the special allowance at the moment to receive it. This is most necessary. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to discuss the matter with the hon. the Minister of Finance because it is of the utmost importance. I want to emphasize what I said at the outset that the State is not doing all it can as far as housing is concerned. The State should build more old-age homes; it should provide more places where these people can live together as a family. I differ here from the hon. member for Rosettenville. He asks that old people should be employed to do work in connection with the voters&#x2019; rolls. Mr. Speaker, I do not think that is fair. These people did their duty during their working years under far more difficult circumstances than we young people sitting here to-day.</p>

<p>Sir, I was very pleased to hear the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. P. J. Coetzee) largely supporting our motion. I am in this position now, Sir, coming in at the end of the debate, that I have to try to avoid repetition. So I want to deal with some of the wider aspects and implications of our resolution. I suppose every hon. member in this House knows of a case of hardship under the various pension schemes, and although the case I have in mind only falls indirectly under our resolution, I feel that it can nonetheless be dealt with under our resolution. I am thinking of the case of civil pensioners, particularly magistrates and magistrates&#x2019; widows. I know of several instances of magistrates&#x2019; widows who to-day are having to try to live on incomes which are little, if anything, above old-age pensions. The husbands of those widows, during their lifetime, contributed largely towards their pension schemes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#field">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FIELD</person>:</from>

<p>As far as this aspect concerns social pensions it also concerns old-age pensions. During their lifetime those people worked for salaries when the currency was on a very much lower basis and to-day they have to try to come out on their pensions when the currency value has gone down. All these people, social pensioners and civil pensioners, contributed their share towards the building up of the country in their days. To-day we are enjoying the benefits of large-scale public works which were carried out during their time. Those schemes were carried out when wages were low, when costs were low. The Government is therefore enjoying the benefit, and the country is enjoying the benefit, of all those public works to-day. That is why I feel that there is an obligation on the Government to see that these people are not as heavily penalized as they are to-day through the currency having depreciated about which no one but the Government can do anything. One can to some extent hold the Government responsible but obviously not entirely. I think that on account of that fact that I have enumerated there is a reasonable responsibility on the Government to see to it that these people are in some way provided for better than they are to-day.</p>

<p>Another typical instance I know of is that of a woman whose husband died recently. She applied for the increased pension under last year&#x2019;s amendment and was told to put in her application. After the form had gone in the local official told her that she could not get that benefit while she had assets of over R30. The form came back stating that her assets were too high. She had actually R80 in the Post Office so she could not get the benefit. She paid her husband&#x2019;s funeral expenses which brought the amount down to R15 and she tried again. The reply came back that she still could not get any benefits unless she had less than R10 in the Post Office. Now I ask you, Sir, what incentive does the Government leave to anyone to save anything at all? That is the basis that I want to dwell on this afternoon, the basis of the necessity for incentives to people to save and the obvious fact that the means test is doing away with the incentive to save. One Department tries to encourage people to save but the Social Welfare Department is, by the means test, simply discouraging people from saving.</p>

<p>On a recent visit I paid overseas in England I discussed the question of saving with quite a number of working people. The reply I got was: What is the use of our saving; it will only come off our pensions when we are old; let us rather enjoy our money while we have it and spend it. I find to-day that that same spirit is getting abroad amongst our own people, particularly the young people. And who is to blame? Surely we cannot blame them for adopting that attitude when the Government tells them: If you save money you will not get the old-age pension. Can one blame the old people for encouraging the young people to run around on scooters and <span class="col_1417-1418" refersTo="page_0723"/>motor bikes and not save anything when they themselves have been penalized because of the money they saved in their young days? I want to make a special plea that this question of the encouragement of thrift should be looked into more closely as far as the question of housing is concerned. I was pleased to hear that the hon. member for Langlaagte supported me in this.</p>

<p>I feel that so far as housing is concerned, housing for the old people to live in should be placed in an entirely different category. We need houses for many reasons in South Africa and the houses which those older people built in their young days so that they would have a place to live in when they got old, save the Government from building houses for them to-day.</p>

<p>I want to draw attention to a statement made by the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) last year in the discussion on the Social Welfare Vote. I quote from Hansard, Vol. 7., Col. 5994. What the hon. member said on that occasion entirely bears out, I think, what I am saying this afternoon. This was what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should like to read to the hon. member what has been said in <i>Isvestia,</i> the communist Government newspaper in Russia, in regard to old people: &#x201C;The realization of Communism absolutely demands fighting against own homes of the masses which foster a bourgeois mentality. Communist people must be covered by communist work to a maximum degree. This will only be possible if they live in large housing estates and blocks of flats.&#x201D;</block>

<block name="quote">This point of view expressed by a communist controlled newspaper underlies our whole difficulty. In contrast with the idea of large blocks of flats and the creation of a proletariat of old people, I wish to say that I believe in one family per house. It should be our aspiration in South Africa to enable every family to have its own property. Private property is a social institution which is a guarantee against the creation of various evils which in the course of time are off-loaded on our Department of Social Welfare.</block>

<p>I am quoting from a speech by an hon. member on that side of the House. He went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say that a family established on a private property, in a house, however small that house may be, is a guarantee against evils we have to cope with to-day arising from the congregation of families in blocks of flats.</block>

<p>I want to say that every family, every man and woman who own their own home, are a bulwark against Communism. Those who have their own homes have a stake in the country and I feel that we should do everything possible to achieve that as many people as possible own their own homes. The hon. Minister earlier to-day asked for suggestions and I want to make what I consider to be a practical suggestion in this respect: That so far as housing is concerned, when taking into account the value of a house, of a size that would be sufficient (I do not want to mention figures, they can be worked out) to house an elderly couple in comfortable circumstances&#x2014;when taking the value of that house into account for means test purposes, that house should either be not taken into account or say at 25 per cent of the official valuation. I feel that is a simple and practical way to encourage thrift, encouraging people to own their own homes, and relieving the Department of Social Welfare of the necessity to build more homes for the aged. Encourage the people to build homes for themselves when they are young. I feel that this is also the best way to encourage thrift. Because young people are in the mood when they first get married to think about owning their own home. They are home-proud. At that stage they very often will go in for a scheme, with the assistance of building societies, to become the owners of their own home. But many are discouraged from doing so simply on account of the means test which we have in the country today. When those young people start to own their own home and have to pay off on it, they are obliged to maintain their payments, and in doing so they start at an early age, a young age, the habit of thrift, and that habit of thrift will carry them right through their lives once they have made a start. The habit of thrift is of the utmost importance to the country, important from the social point of view, important from the economic point of view, because the basis of the economy of the country is the savings of the people, and I feel that by this practical suggestion which I put forward to-day, we can do a great deal in that direction. I feel it is of far-reaching importance, not only to the individual but to social welfare as well that this means test should be modified as we are suggesting in our resolution, but particularly I want to emphasize that it should be modified in so far as the valuation of house properties is concerned when arriving at the amount under the means test.</p>

<p>Just look at the Opposition benches! There are 7 or 8 members of the Opposition taking an interest in the motion that has been moved by one of their own members. It shows that the United Party have no true interest in the motion. We had no quorum this afternoon to continue the debate. That is the amount of support that they give to the motion.</p>

<p>But irrespective of whether United Party members are interested in this motion or not, I am particularly interested in it and I agree with the hon. member for Umbilo that where we can we must do more for our old people. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) has already replied to his speech and has pointed out that each year the Government has made more and more concessions to old-age pensioners and that where it has been possible the Government has assisted them. But every individual is expected, if possible, to make provision for himself in his old age, either by means of investment, by means of insurance policies or by joining a pension scheme. The Government encourages this sort of thing. For many years now the Government has been allowing rebate for tax purposes upon insurance premiums and in the past few years the Government has also allowed a rebate for contributions to pension funds. By this means the Government is trying to encourage the people to be independent in their old age. But unfortunately, the majority of our pensioners to-day have not been able to take out insurance policies or become members of a pension scheme and these are the people for whom we have to care to-day. The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) and the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. P. J. Coetzee) referred to the housing shortage in the country. They said that people have to live in garages and hovels and so forth, but it is not only the pensioners who are poorly accommodated in many cases. We often find this in the cities where industrialization is taking place to-day and both the young and the old are affected by the shortage of housing. But I want to point out that every year the Government makes millions of rand available to the local authorities to build houses in order to alleviate the housing shortage. And it is up to every local authority in the country to ensure that it applies to the National Housing Commission for funds to build houses in order to alleviate this shortage. But this motion does not deal with a general housing shortage. The motion of the hon. member for Umbilo refers specifically to the shortage of housing for the aged but I do not want the outside world to gain the impression that the Government is giving insufficient attention to the question of the housing of our aged. I want this afternoon to confine myself chiefly to showing what the Government has done over the past 50 years to accommodate our old people and to take care of them, particularly those who are mentally or physically infirm. We must realize that where old people are mentally or physically infirm, special care must be provided for them. If such a person needs a permanent attendant at his home, the Government give him an additional allowance of R48 per annum in respect of the attendant who stays with him; but if we take the old-age homes we find that they have been established chiefly by welfare organizations or religious societies in the various towns and cities. The welfare organizations can obtain capital for the erection of these homes from the National Housing Commission in the form of what is virtually an interest-free loan. In order to encourage people further to erect old-age homes the Government has increased the subsidies from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions to such an extent that it is easier for them to erect those old age homes and to furnish them and to take care of those old people. The subsidy that was paid previously for the purchase of furniture was increased from R30 per inmate to R90 per inmate and the means test that was fixed for subsidy purposes was increased from R28.50 to R40 per month. The <i>per capita</i> subsidy in respect of infirm persons was also increased from R8 to R10 per month. This was done in an effort to get the various welfare organizations to erect more old-age homes, particularly for the infirm. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient old-age homes throughout the Republic. In Natal and the Cape Province particularly we do not as yet have adequate accommodation available for old people and at the moment they are still being cared for mainly in hospitals. In such cases the Government pays R2.50 per day in respect of an old and infirm person who is treated in hospital. An amount of R94,871 was paid out to provincial hospitals by way of subsidies in 1962-3. The welfare organizations of the Cape Peninsula are at the moment building a home which on completion will accommodate 205 old people. Because there is a great shortage of homes for the infirm in Durban, the Department of Social Welfare is at the moment considering building a home there itself because the local welfare organizations are apparently hesitant to establish the necessary facilities for old people there. I should like to give the House the following figures for the period 1947-8 to 1962-3 so that hon. members may judge for themselves whether so little has been done or whether a great deal has been done for the accommodation of our old people. In 1947-8 there were 25 old-age homes for all races accommodating 1,950 old people in respect <span class="col_1421-1422" refersTo="page_0725"/>of whom the State paid an amount of R40,212 by way of subsidy. As at 31 December 1963 there was 94 subsidized old-age homes accommodating 4,390 White inmates whose income did not exceed R40 per month and 390 whose income exceeded R40 per month, a total therefore of 4,780 old people who were then accommodated in old-age homes. Furthermore, at the end of 1963 there were a further eight subsidized old-age homes exclusively for the accommodation of the infirm and 558 of these infirm persons were accommodated in those homes. A further 30 subsidized homes have been approved of and on completion will accommodate 1,416 old people. For the financial year 1963-4 provision was made under the Vote of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions for an amount of R714,000 for the subsidization of old-age homes. When one compares this with the amount of R40,312 for 1947-8, I think that we must all admit that the present Government is performing a tremendous service for our old people. But apart from these services that are rendered in the old-age homes, the old people also receive other assistance from the State. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus referred to the free medical services that they receive. It is not only at the old-age homes that they receive those services but any old person can be given free treatment at a hospital clinic in a town or city. If they are ill at home, they can call a district medical officer or a district nurse and can be treated by them. They are also supplied with free medicines by the district medical officer. But here I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot approach the hon. the Minister of Health and discuss with him the manner in which the services of the district medical officers are placed at the disposal of these old people. I wonder whether it is not possible for the old people to be given a card as is the case at a hospital clinic, a card which they can use to receive free treatment on their return to the hospital. The position is now than an old pensioner may fall ill during the night and have nobody to send for a doctor. In any event, he has first to obtain a card in order to enable him to call the district medical officer. If these people can be given an annual card of this nature to show that they are indigent and they also have the right to telephone the district medical officer direct in time of need and receive treatment from him in such cases, I think that it will be of great benefit to them. I think that the problem can be resolved in this way in co-operation with the hon. the Minister of Health. But I do feel that the Government can be very proud of what it has done for our old people during the time that it has been in office.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I have met many of them, and perhaps the hon. member has too, and I must confess that I have often been bitterly ashamed of the conditions under which they have to live. Sir, their lives have mostly been unspectacular, their record of service in most cases is very good, they have contributed their skills and their integrity over the years to build up the proud position of stability and strength that we have here in South Africa, and they have done it as a result of hard work. I submit that we have no right, whatever Government is in power to neglect them in their old age and in their days of decline. I think we should remember also that the people for whom we are pleading here this afternoon are for the most part people who are accustomed to maintain decent standards. Many of them are retired people with professional qualifications. Many of them have devoted years of dedicated service in these professions. Thousands of others are good solid, working people whose inconspicuous devotion to duty should have earned them some degree of peace and serenity in their old age. Most of them, as hon. members know, live on a small fixed income, many of them retired in the 1950s and their income has not increased since then, or at any rate very little. The result is of course that they are reduced to conditions of extreme poverty. I have no hesitation in saying that after seeing the conditions in which many of them live. There are two reasons for that. One of them is of course that the cost of living has gone up whilst their income has remained static, and the other is that the value of money in turn has dropped. I wonder whether the hon. Minister realizes how many of these people, and there are quite a lot of them, find it difficult to get sufficient to eat; they can scarcely afford it. Many of them are too proud to say so, many of them are too proud to debase themselves by begging ignominiously from others. Let us get down to bedrock: What does it cost the average person to deal with his ordinary living expenses <span class="col_1423-1424" refersTo="page_0726"/>as things are in South Africa at the present time? You take an old retired couple; they have to pay rent, they have to buy their food and their clothing, electricity on which to cook and to light their little flat, or whatever it is they are living in, transport, even if it is only a bus twice a week to the lending library to change their books, water, drugs, if they are not well, a radio licence, which as the hon. member for Rosettenville said costs about twice as much now than a year ago. How does the hon. Minister think many of those good upstanding South African citizens can come out decently on anything between R50 and R60 a month?</p>

<p>There have been suggestions from various quarters of the House to-day that our proposals with regard to these matters are socialistic. If that is the case, I can only say that the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to these matters is paralytic. Many of these people are unable even to pay their rent and live in permanent fear of being ejected. Many hon. members on that side seem to think that it is a good thing that they work if they want to work, but many of them are not fit enough to work. I know of many cases of people in their late sixties and even in their seventies who are obliged to go and find part-time employment simply because they cannot afford to feed themselves otherwise. I do not want to introduce a discordant note, but I would say that all the Orange River schemes and the border industries and the Phalaborwas and the Bantustans cannot atone for the neglect of these people who have done their work, who have served South Africa and have given up their health and their strength in the process.</p>

<p>Might I just say as a newcomer to this House that it is a matter of great interest to me listening to this debate here to-day that there is plenty of money in the country for ideological issues, for duplicating post offices and stations, for a Press commission that can sit for 12 years and never report, for setting up population registration offices, but what are we doing for these people except allowing them to rot?</p>

<p>I know that the hon.

They do not make political speeches, they do not write letters to the newspapers. The South African pensioners have no opportunity of shouting at each other across the floor of this House to air their grievances. We are expected to do it for them. It is remarkable to me, if I may say so as a newcomer to this House that whenever there is a third-rate political argument on the go, hon. members on the Government benches are all in their seats, sharpening their knives and shouting their heads off like a lot of fourth-form schoolboys. But when it comes to our social pensioners where are these gentlemen?</p>

<p>May I leave that alone and say to the hon. Minister that we would like to know what he intends to do in regard to these poor pensioners. Why does the Government not get on with the job? Why does the Government not introduce a practicable pension scheme? I have read these debates in Hansard over the years, and there never seems to be any change. The country wants an answer, the pensioners want an answer, and I suggest that there is no possible justification for the hon. Minister of Finance withholding extra funds in his Budget this year in order to ameliorate the position of these people who are in real and desperate need. I would say finally that it is quite clear that if no further provision is made in the coming Budget to assist these people, then we shall be entirely justified on this side of the House in indicting this Government for neglecting South Africa&#x2019;s pensioners in a most scandalous fashion.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I sometimes find myself in a difficult situation in a debate such as this. I find myself in a difficult position in that in one breath the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) praised me and then attacked me in the next. She blew hot and cold in regard to a matter in which we are all interested. I want to thank her sincerely for the compliment she paid me but I like to listen to arguments from both sides of the House in these matters. I have been doing this work now for many years and I know how difficult the circumstances are. I want of course, to do everything I can to improve the position but I have already stated and I want to say again that our system is such that the State cannot be expected to make provision for the individual needs of everyone, and hon. members know this. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) has admitted as much to-day; he realizes that that is the position. We are all working together on these matters and the hon. member has acknowledged this basis of co-operation between the State, the welfare organizations, the community and the church. I think that we have built up a wonderful organization in South Africa. We can achieve so much more if we can hold the interest of the church, the community and the State. [Interjection.] I did not interrupt the hon. member. I am merely mentioning a fundamental principle. This has been our system over the years. The hon. member was member of the Provincial Council and she dealt with welfare organizations. She is a capable member who is interested in social problems. The hon. member for Umbilo has said that he agrees with that basic principle and I think that hon. members opposite will also agree with it. It would be an evil day for South Africa if we were to destroy this structure that we have built up over the years and leave nothing of it standing. We do have such a thing as tradition and the things that we have inherited from the people who have gone before us. The Government has accepted this system. I came to this Parliament for the first time in 1934 and I was a member of the Government and also of the Opposition under General Hertzog. I am now a member of the Government once again and after all these years this is still the basic principle in regard to this system. I want to say that it was unfortunate that the hon. member spoilt her good speech. She allowed hon. members to distract her. I thought that the subject matter of the motion had been exhausted because she started discussing the question of a quorum. The hon. member says that it is our responsibility; she wants to bear no responsibility at all. I thought that the debate was finished and I did not know whether I should discuss these matters again. But the hon. member ended on a very dangerous note. In spite of her acknowledgement that so much was being done under the system that we have had for so many years she said that it was scandalous&#x2014;and she meant that it was scandalous on the part of the Government&#x2014;that we still had people today who had to live under difficult circumstances. That was very irresponsible of her and I was very sorry that the hon. member became so excited after she had praised me in such a fine way.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about &#x201C;forgotten people; people who are accumstomed to maintaining decent standards should be accustomed to doing something for themselves to maintain themselves in their old age&#x201D;. I do not want to go into details but the hon. member spoke about a pension of R60 per month.</p>

<p>If this were to be done, it would cost the State an additional R45,000,000 per annum. At the rate of R60 per month per person it would cost the State R91,000,000, taking only the number of pensioners we have at present. We must make our calculations in discussing these matters. I thought that the <span class="col_1427-1428" refersTo="page_0728"/>hon. member agreed with me when I said that the actual test of the legislation was not merely whether it was just, but also whether it was practicable. A motion was moved in the Other Place last year that the means test should be completely abolished. If it is abolished and the increases that were asked for last year are given, it will mean that 20 per cent of our entire State revenue will be used for the payment of pensions. How are we then going to run the State? These are all matters that we must consider. But I do want to give the hon. member the assurance that if her attention is drawn to cases similar to these to which she has referred, she can write to the Department or to me and we will always be prepared to give our full attention to them. That is what we have done over the years, and the hon. member knows it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Geduld (Dr. Jurgens) explained the position very well. Mr. Speaker, you know, I am almost quite ashamed. I am a shy person. Every year the Opposition asks for more. They are at liberty to move these motions, but then we have repeatedly to explain what has been done until we eventually ask ourselves whether there is no acknowledgment for what is being done. The hon. member for Umbilo admitted that a great deal was being done and had been done over the past years to effect improvements, and I appreciated his remarks. The hon. member for Geduld has made a special study of this matter. I do not want to praise only the hon. member for Umbilo. It was also my intention to praise the hon. member for Wynberg but she has now left. The hon. member for Geduld has made a particular study of all that has been done in connection with accommodation. Some hon. members say that conditions in a particular place are extremely critical and then other members say in their turn that they live in the same vicinity and that this is not the position. There are the conditions that the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) has mentioned&#x2014;and he brought them to the notice of the Department during the course of the year&#x2014;but we cannot keep an eye on everything at the same time. I have asked on many occasions to be informed of those cases so that we can see what can be done. I have said: Do not wait until Parliament is in session. The hon. member for Geduld also said that I should approach the hon. the Minister of Health in regard to the question of indigent people who need the services of district medical officers. I just want to tell hon. members that notes are made of all the requests that are made here. We go through the Hansard and when we find that there are matters that should be brought to the attention of other Ministers, we do so. I shall also devote my attention to these matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) (Mr. Field) spoke about the encouragement of thirft, and I agree with everything that he said. He said that that encouragement must start early. That is correct, but in order to make that encouragement continue into old age, one must not allow those people to lose their sense of independence. Our people are fortunate in that they still have that spirit of independence, and the day they lose it will be an evil day for South Africa. The hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. P. J. Coetzee) said that accommodation should be provided on a larger scale and other hon. members said the same thing. I just want to tell hon. members that we have been given information in regard to what has been done recently to provide accommodation and build homes for old people. We consult with the Department of Housing in regard to every new development. In 1963 I had consultations with them in regard to flats. I am not speaking now about the increased number of old age homes because hon. members will admit that this increase has been colossal over the past years. I just want to direct the attention of the House to this one matter and that is in connection with accommodation. It is my honest opinion&#x2014;and that opinion is strengthened by the inquiries that I have made overseas&#x2014;that there are certain fundamental matters that one has to consider in connection with accommodation. A very important matter is that those old people must not be isolated in separate communities. I think it is wrong to build a separate town for them or to build a whole block of old age homes away from the community. I think that we must keep those people in the communal circle as long as we can. They must feel that they are still part of society. That is also the tendency that I have noticed overseas&#x2014;that these people are kept in the community in order to keep them in contact with that community as much as possible. We are considering the matter at the moment. I have already discussed the question with the hon. the Minister of Housing and we have had an investigation made overseas. This is the system that I have seen in London&#x2014;that one has a common home for the old people but that around this common home there are small flatlets that are situated close to the common home so that the old people living in the flatlets can be moved to the common home when they are ill and admitted to the sick bay and nursed there. If they are not able to prepare their meals in their flatlets, they can also eat at the common home.</p>

<p>There is another system that they call &#x201C;meals on wheels&#x201D;. I did not see it in operation but I saw certain aspects of it which I did not like very much. In Holland and other places the old people go to a certain place to receive their meals and they take these meals to their rooms. The food is kept warm but it is certainly not as good a system as when they eat in the common home.</p>

<p>I want to give hon. members the assurance that we are doing everything in our power to improve the position of accommodation. As I have said, I have already had negotiations <span class="col_1429-1430" refersTo="page_0729"/>with the hon. the Minister of Housing as far as this particular system is concerned so that where new communities are established, provision must be made for accommodation for old people in that community. We will also be achieving another good purpose and that is that we will be removing the old people from the pressure of the heavily populated urban areas and giving them more room.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) gave us a resum&#x00E9; of the measures that have been taken from time to time. One could go on for days mentioning measures of this nature. I would like to refer to a few of them. I do not want to go into details but I would like to refer to a few figures for the purpose of comparison. The first part of the motion of the hon. member for Umbilo deals with the revision of the scale on which pensions are paid. We have been told for years now that pensions should be increased and they have been increased. Benefits have been improved from time to time. The second point is that the means test should be relaxed in its application. The hon. member for Odendaalsrust quoted statistics and pointed out what had been done in that connection. Let me just tell the House what the effect has been of what has been done over the past years in regard to these two matters. The joint effect in this regard is that the maximum amount that is payable at present is 170 per cent higher than it was in 1947. This does at least mean something, particularly in view of the fact that during the same period the increase in the cost of living was only 68&#x00BD; per cent. These are statistics that speak for themselves. In other words, the increase in pensions has far exceeded the increase in the cost of living. Let me mention this case. The total expenditure on old-age pensions in 1947 amounted to R6,575,000 in respect of 60,000 pensioners. In 1963 the amount was R24,828,900, almost four times as much, in respect of 86,000 pensioners. The number of pensioners had not even doubled but the amount paid to them had quadrupled. This merely does mean something. In 1963 the average pension per person amounted to R288 per annum. In 1947 it amounted to R109.6. I mention this merely to show that we have done something. I always say that we must do as much as we can but we must not destroy the things that are binding in our national life. I also want to draw this comparison. It indicates the approximate amounts that have been made available during the past ten years by way of increases and grants in regard to social pensions. In 1954-5, the amount was R4,700,000; in 1955-6, it was R5,828,000; in 1956-7, it was R4,600,000; in 1959-60, it was R3,000,000; in 1960-1, it was R3,100,000; in 1961-2, it was R2,200,000; in 1962-3, R3,000,000 and in 1963-4, it amounted to R1,540,000, making a grand total of about R26,000,000. This does mean something.</p>

<p>I want to hasten to discuss a few other matters that were raised by hon. members. I just want to say that if we abolish the means test, it will mean that old-age pensions alone will cost us about R90,000,000 as compared with R26,000,000 at the moment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I know, but it was advocated in the Other Place and I just wanted to point out what the result of a step of this nature would be. The hon. member for Umbilo has said that we still have too few old-age homes but the hon. member will admit that they are being built quite quickly although more provision must be made in his area. We are interested in Durban and we are always discussing matters with the hon. member for Umbilo. We had asked previously whether there were no private welfare organizations or religious bodies which would undertake to build these institutions. We said that they would receive assistance from the National Housing Board as well as the assistance that we gave them. We discussed this matter two years ago. We asked the hon. member to encourage it and that is what he apparently did but nothing has as yet happened. It seems as though the position there is difficult in spite of his encouragement. I just want to tell him that notwithstanding that fact it is our intention to build an old-age home as soon as possible because there does not appear to be any hope of an old-age home being built by the welfare organizations in Durban. That is why the Department is considering starting a home of this nature there itself. The only difficulty that we have had up to the present is to find suitable premises.</p>

<p>I want to discuss one further matter. My time is very limited but, as I have said, the matters that I do not deal with directly here will receive my attention. Mention was also made of the special allowance that was introduced last year. I can only tell the hon. member that this special grant was made last year in all good faith. The matter was discussed in this House and, as I said here last year, the intention was to give relief where the shoe pinched most. But I want to tell hon. members that this matter is receiving the very serious consideration of the Government.</p>

<p>I think that these are more or less all the general points that I am able to cover this afternoon. I want once again to express my appreciation for the manner in which hon. members on both sides of the House have approached this question of pensions. Whether I or anybody else is Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions or whether this or any other Government is in power, we will always have these problems to contend with and we will always have to approach these problems in the spirit that I have described&#x2014;always <span class="col_1431-1432" refersTo="page_0730"/>bearing in mind the fact that one is dealing with human beings; that one is dealing with individuals and that one is dealing with a delicate situation. Our approach must always be of such a nature that we can always make progress and not retrogress in this important work in the interest of the people, the State, the Church and society.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>While the hon. the Minister has suggested that the case has been fully canvassed, there are one or two points I would like to make from an angle which has not been covered up to now. The angle from which I wish to approach it is, firstly, on the basis of the amount of money paid to pensioners in relation to the Coloured community, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give very serious consideration to the question of increasing the pension of these people for the sole and simple reason that they get approximately half of what the White pensioner receives. The amount is totally inadequate. They have great difficulty in making ends meet, and although the Minister says that in a man&#x2019;s youth and in the full flush of his years he ought to make provision for his old-age, the Coloured people are in the position that they are unable to make the necessary provision. I therefore make the point in the earnest hope that the present pension, which is approximately R140 a year, should be increased considerably in respect of the Coloured community.</p>

<p>The second point I wish to deal with, is the question of the means test. I want to suggest to the Minister that the attitude of the department is&#x2014;and I do not say this in any critical way at all; I offer this suggestion in a constructive manner&#x2014;that the value of the property of the wife, and the income which the children should provide, should cover their maintenance. I think it is a new concept to suggest&#x2014;that a Coloured person is unable to receive a pension until such time as the children have made adequate provision. In the same case&#x2014;and this is one of many&#x2014;the pension was cancelled. There was no difficulty about that; the case has been investigated and everybody is quite happy, but we find that this extraordinary statement is made &#x201C;that re-instatement can only be considered when advice is received that the three unemployed children have accepted employment.&#x201D; In other words, until such time as these three children accept employment&#x2014;one happens to be an epileptic&#x2014;the case cannot be considered. Sir, these are minor matters in an Assembly such as this but it is a very important thing for the persons concerned. I do ask the Minister most seriously to consider the question of overhauling the whole pension machinery and the way in which pensions are decided upon.</p>

<p>The last point I wish to make is in connection with the question of accommodation. It has been my lot to deal with three schemes for the provision of accommodation for aged persons in relation to Bantu, Coloureds and Whites. I should like to ask the Minister to give his attention to the delays with which local authorities have to contend in getting plans approved and in getting work started. The case I have in mind is a scheme which was actually started by the National Housing Commission itself. When the scheme was started it was regarded as a matter of urgency but 2&#x00BD; years have now elapsed and they have still done nothing. There are people, Sir, who are willing to go out of their way to assist the Government in providing accommodation for all groups. I will say that the Government does provide money for the provision of these facilities, but the fact remains that due to complications in other departments, those persons willing to assist are unable to do so, in the way in which these people should be assisted. The final point I wish to make is that there are many institutions in this country who cater for and accommodate old people and who do their best to take care of them. These institutions can be described as denominational. I am aware of the fact that the law prohibits assistance to that type of institution. The fact remains, however, that these institutions do assist, and that they do good work, and that they are willing to assist in accommodating persons who reach old-age and who have nowhere to live. Might I suggest to the hon. the Minister that where people are admitted who are not necessarily of the denomination which runs the institution, some consideration should be given to assisting those institutions to make better provision to house these people adequately. This is a matter on which I can speak with some experience and knowledge because I have dealt with large groups of Bantu and Coloured people and Whites over a number of years. I acknowledge that the legislation, the system obtaining in this country in regard to pensions, is as good as one can find, but that does not mean to say that, because legislation was put on the Statute Book, 10, 15, 20 or 30 years ago, times have not changed and that improvements are not warranted. I am aware of the fact that the Minister, to use the vernacular, is right on the ball. I ask him to keep on in this direction as far as the Coloured people are concerned: (a) To see that they get more money; it is as simple as that&#x2014;no &#x201C;ifs&#x201D;, &#x201C;buts&#x201D; nor &#x201C;maybe&#x2019;s&#x201D;&#x2014;because R12 is totally inadequate; secondly to have some inquiry made into the tardiness of the National Housing Commission and other departments in dealing with local authorities who make application for the construction of accommodation for the aged. These are the points I want to make, and I am sorry to follow the Minister after his very interesting reply to the debate, but I would like to say this to him in conclusion that those of us who work with these people know full well what the position is.</p>

<p>At an earlier stage of this Bill, the hon. Minister stated that the terms of this Bill had been agreed to by the Judiciary. I have attempted to calculate and to compare whether in all cases Judges will be better off as a result of the alteration. I have had a query, which is supposed to have emanated from one Judge who said that Judges in certain categories would be less well-off under the new provisions. I must say as I calculate the position that is not correct, but I would be glad to have the hon. Minister&#x2019;s confirmation.</p>

<p>I know of no case where a Judge will be worse off under this Bill. Candidly as I know the position as to when Judges were appointed and how long they have served on the Bench, I know of no case where a Judge would be worse off. But should such a position arise I will see to it that they are in fact not worse off as a result of the provisions of this Bill. I have, however, gone into the position of Judges who retire next year and the year thereafter, and as I have calculated the position in terms of this Bill they will in fact be much better off than under the old arrangement.</p>

<heading>WORKMEN&#x2019;S COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>Third Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Work men&#x2019;s Compensation Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The Bill before the House deals with four important matters, namely, accidents to members of the Permanent Force of the South African Defence Force and the Police Force; Bantu claims for compensation, industrial diseases and the farming community. I propose to deal with them in that order.</p>

<p>By virtue of the provisions of Section 3 (2) of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, members of the Permanent and Police Forces are covered by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act if they are injured on duty in peacetime while engaged in their ordinary work, but if they are injured on duty in time of war in which the Republic is engaged, they are provided for under the War Pensions Act.</p>

<p>There are however occasions on which these men could be injured while they are performing work which is not connected with either their ordinary peacetime duties or a war, and here I have in mind the question of internal emergencies such as listed in Section 13 (1) of the Defence Act, 1957, e.g. the prevention or suppression of internal disorder.</p>

<p>I think hon. members will agree that, especially in the times we are living in, this is a serious deficiency in our legislation, and that it is only fair and equitable that when men risk their lives for the protection of their fellow men and the safety of our country, they should be entitled to compensation for injuries sustained while performing such duties. The proposed amendment will put that right.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of injuries to Bantu workmen. In terms of the Act any injured workman, other than a Bantu, must lodge a claim for compensation and his employer must report the accident direct to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner.</p>

<p>In the case of Bantu workmen, the employer must in terms of Section 51 also report the accident to the Commissioner but in addition he is obliged in terms of Section 83 to submit a report to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner in his area, or if there is not one, to the nearest magistrate. These officers are then required to submit all the papers to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner in Pretoria, with the result that they have to keep records of all accidents involving Bantu.</p>

<p>The effect of the proposed amendment is that accidents to Bantu workmen will, as in the case of all other workmen, in future be dealt with by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner on receipt of reports from their employers in terms of Section 51 of the Act.</p>

<p><span class="col_1437-1438" refersTo="page_0733"/>This procedure will not only relieve magistrates and Bantu Affairs Commissioners of a considerable amount of routine work, but will be conducive to speeding up the settlement of claims. It will also ensure that fewer amounts of compensation will in future be listed as unclaimed.</p>

<p>The only duties which would be left to the district officers, would be the rendering of assistance to a Bantu workman or his dependants or the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner in connection with the settlement of any claim for compensation or medical aid resulting from an accident to such a workman.</p>

<p>According to Section 83 (3) of the existing Act, a Bantu workman is not required to give formal notice of an accident nor to lodge a claim for compensation, as is the case with other workmen. But since in Clause 5 of the Bill it is proposed to replace Section 83 with entirely new provisions, it is necessary to re-state the position, namely that Sections 50 and 54, which provide for a formal notification of an accident and a claim for compensation, do not apply as far as Bantu workmen are concerned&#x2014;hence sub-section (2) in Clause 5 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Coming now to Clause 6 of the Bill, hon. members will note that in terms of Section 89 of the Act, a workman cannot claim compensation in respect of any scheduled industrial disease contracted by him if the disease is not manifested within 24 months after he was last employed in the occupation responsible for the disease. The only exception to this rule is lung fibrosis caused by mineral dust.</p>

<p>Since the Act was passed in 1941 certain other industrial diseases have been added to the Second Schedule to the Act. Some of these are &#x201C;Manganese Poisoning&#x201D;, &#x201C;primary epitheliomatous cancer of the skin&#x201D;, &#x201C;silicosis or asbestos of the lungs&#x201D;, etc. It is a fact that it could take longer than 24 months for these additional diseases to reach a diagnosable stage.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment is intended to obviate any possible injustice to a workman who would have a genuine claim under the Act but for the present arbitrary restriction of time.</p>

<p>And now, Mr. Speaker. I wish to deal with the provisions of the Bill relating to farmers.</p>

<p>The Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act does not apply to persons employed in agriculture, except in respect of accidents connected with the use of machinery. This means that a farmer is obliged to pay assessments to the Accident Fund only in respect of those of his workmen who work with machinery, and that such workmen will receive compensation in respect of any injury sustained while working with such machinery.</p>

<p>No other farm hands are entitled to compensation or medical aid under the Act unless the farmer has entered into a special arrangement with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner to regard all his employees as &#x201C;workmen&#x201D; as defined in the Act. But in the absence of such an agreement, employees not working with machinery, have no claim for compensation, however serious an accident might be.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment is designed to do away with the option that farmers have at the present time and will oblige them to include all their employees in their annual wage returns.</p>

<p>This will ensure that any farm hand, irrespective of his particular occupation, will be entitled to compensation should he meet with an accident in the course of his employment.</p>

<p>The agricultural class of employers has given rise to considerable anxiety as the annual claim costs have exceeded the revenue for some time resulting in a net loss of approximately one million three hundred thousand rand (R1,300,000) as at the end of December, 1960.</p>

<p>The position had become serious and in order to prevent the agricultural class from continuing to be a burden on other industries, there was no alternative but to increase the assessment tariffs.</p>

<p>The rate was accordingly increased to R1.50 per cent on wages as from the beginning of 1961, but in spite thereof, the agricultural class still showed an overall deficit of one million and ninety-two thousand rand (R1,092,000) at the end of that year.</p>

<p>Hon. members will be interested to know that the tariff for the Iron and Steel Industry, where the accident risk is obviously very much higher than in farming operations, is exactly the same as for farming, namely R1.50 per cent. Yet the Iron and Steel Industry has for many years shown substantial surpluses.</p>

<p>The reason for that is that employers in the iron and steel industry are required to pay assessments on the wages paid to all their employees including office personnel.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am therefore of the opinion that there is only one solution to the problem and that is the one proposed in the Bill, namely, that all farmers must register with the Accident Fund and pay assessments in respect of all their employees and not only those who handle machinery as at the present time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1961 when the tariffs were increased, special steps were also taken to induce farmers to comply with the Act by registering.</p>

<p>At that time only 31,000 farmers out of a total of some 110,000 in the Republic and South West Africa, had registered with the Fund. The intensive campaigns which were undertaken, resulted in some 23,000 new registrations, bringing the total to 54,000. But this is less than 50 per cent of the potential figure and some 56,000 farmers have still to register as employers.</p>

<p>The large number of unregistered farmers is a most important factor in the financial losses suffered by the Fund, and I should like to explain why.</p>

<p><span class="col_1439-1440" refersTo="page_0734"/>The Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is a remedial Act aimed at providing compensation and medical services to any workman who meets with an injury in the course of his employment. It would not be in the spirit of the Act to deny a workman such benefits on the grounds that his employer had failed to register. The Act, in fact, makes acceptance of such claims a duty on the Commissioner. The Accident Fund must then bear the cost of such accidents even though the employer has contributed nothing to the Fund.</p>

<p>Section 73 of the Act entitles the Commissioner to recover the cost of such an accident from the employer concerned as a penalty for failing to register. This is actually done in many cases but where the claim cost is high, the imposition of the full penalty is impracticable since few farmers can stand the impact on their financial resources.</p>

<p>The heavy claims which are the very ones which cause the deficiency in the revenue of this class, have invariably to be reduced in order to save the farmer from bankruptcy.</p>

<p>I might mention that the cost of a fatal case may easily run into R10,000 and claims of R3,000 to R4,000 are quite common. It would accordingly have to be a very substantial farmer who can meet such a claim.</p>

<p>As I have already stated the Act makes provision for farmers to cover all their employees, and, as a matter of fact, roughly 60 per cent of the registered farmers have entered into an arrangement with the Commissioner to cover all their workmen against accidents.</p>

<p>Such an arrangement holds distinct advantages for farmers because, whereas a farmer is ordinarily exposed to the danger of being sued for damages arising out of an accident to an employee who is not covered by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, Section 7 of the Act prohibits an employee who is covered by the Act, from taking civil action for damages.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is every indication that if all registered farmers avail themselves of the voluntary cover for all their employees at the current tariff of R1.50 per cent, they will build up sufficient funds to meet their own accident requirements.</p>

<p>And there seems to be little doubt that as the number of farmers who register, increases, the overall spread will become greater with a very strong possibility of a reduction in rates. As it happens, I have been informed by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner that the 30,000 farmers who have entered into an arrangement to cover all their employees, will in the near future enjoy a reduction in tariff, while there is every indication that should the other farmers continue as at present, they will face ever-increasing rates.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the provisions of the Bill before the House which relate to farmers, were drafted after protracted negotiations between the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner and the South African Agricultural Union and at its Congress in October 1963, the Union officially resolved to accept the principle of compulsory registration of all farm workers.</p>

<p>Large numbers of accidents occur annually in all sectors of agriculture and there is no justification for granting compensation to a minority of employees who suffer injury and excluding the majority.</p>

<p>The enforcement of registration of farmers is also rendered very difficult by the present wording of the Act as it has to be established in each case that the farmer has, in fact, persons in his employ who come into contact with machinery. If farmers have to cover all their employees then every farmer will have to register.</p>

<p>Organized agriculture has for many years been urging a tougher attitude towards unregistered farmers and there has been a good deal of dissatisfaction among farmers since the rates had to be increased in 1961. The present partial compulsory cover also makes it difficult to adjudicate whether certain claims for compensation are acceptable or not.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have come to the conclusion that the simplest, most practicable and soundest way of saving the situation, is by means of the proposals contained in the Bill and I now move that it be read a second time.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>The official Opposition will support this Bill at the second reading. As the Bill provides for certain improvements and extends the scope of the Act in certain respects, the main discussion, if there is going to be any discussion at any length, can more fittingly take place in the Committee Stage when the various aspects which the Minister has dealt with could, I think, be dealt with more advantageously. But there are one or two remarks which I think are fitting at the second reading, and the first is in connection with the introduction of the amendment which will include all agricultural workers under the definition of &#x201C;worker&#x201D;, and it would seem, because of the considerable number of farmers who for the purposes of this Act will become &#x201C;employers&#x201D;, it will be necessary for their benefit for very wide publicity to be given to the provision of the amending Bill and in particular in regard to the provision of medical aid. The Minister will realize that in terms of the Act an employer (and I am reading now from Chapter VIII. Section 75)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; shall furnish and maintain such appliances and services for the rendering of first-aid to his workmen in the case of an accident to them as may be prescribed in respect of the class of business in which he is engaged. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall be an offence.</block>

<p>I have been told&#x2014;and I think it is correct&#x2014;that there are many employers who are covered in terms of this Act to-day who are not aware of the provision which I just read out relating to the provision of first-aid facilities, and it would appear to me that this is one of the <span class="col_1441-1442" refersTo="page_0735"/>aspects which the Minister will have to consider very carefully now that he is including all agricultural workers, because the wide umbrella which is now being erected over the farming community in respect of workmen&#x2019;s compensation will mean that there will be a considerable number of members of the farming community who will now become &#x201C;employers&#x201D; and that will mean that all the other provisions of the Act will apply to them as well. It is not just a mere question of becoming contributors. There are other obligations laid upon an employer in terms of the Act, obligations which are not widely known to the farming community as such. There are some 103,000 farmers who fall into this category, so I do feel that one of the first steps which the Minister will have to take will be to issue some type of explanatory memorandum or to arrange for talks over the radio to make it quite clear to the farming community as such that in terms of the provisions of this amending Bill, certain obligations are now laid upon them as a result of their classification as employers in terms of the Act. The Minister has indicated that as a result of this amendment the rate of contribution is likely to be reduced, and I think at this stage it may be possible for the Minister to indicate what that will actually mean. He indicated that there had been an increase in the rate of contributions because of the losses incurred through accidents as far as the farming community is concerned. The contribution has been increased to R1.50 per annum per R100 of wages paid. But what does the Minister have in mind when he speaks about a possible reduction? Is this matter still under consideration? I think it is important that the farming community should know at this stage what their liabilities are going to be in respect of the tariff rate.</p>

<p>Then I come to another point which is tied up with this. Is it the intention of the Minister by way of regulation to have a differential tariff rate in respect of the farming community? The present rate applies to farm workers who are occupied with machinery, but there are obviously going to be considerable numbers who will come under the Act now who are not going to be in contact with machinery at all. Is there any suggestion that there should be a lower rate of contribution in respect of those workers employed by farmers? There is nothing in the Act as far as I can see which prohibits that, but we will have to get some indication from the Minister as to what his intentions are in that regard so that we can have a full appreciation of what this provision means as far as the farming community is concerned.</p>

<p>The other provisions of the Act deal with industrial diseases and there will be another speaker on this side who will deal more specifically with that group, but I think the proposed amendment does take us a step forward because there are many workers who have had this difficulty that they have contracted an industrial disease and have only discovered it years afterwards when, in terms of the Act, they have not been able to establish their claim. I think therefore that the amendment is a step in the right direction. The provision which is now being made in regard to internal disorder is also a step in the right direction. We hope that this provision will never be used, but nevertheless provision has to be made for internal disorder. I do think that this Bill as proposed, in all its aspects, will bring about a greater sense of security for everybody concerned. But I think there is one comment that I should make at this stage, and that is to indicate to the Government that all these measures which are coming forward dealing with the labour position would appear to me to make it essential that the Government should at an early stage take into review the desirability of bringing all workers, irrespective of their colour, under the control of the Department of Labour. As you know, Sir, many of the legislative measures dealing with Bantu workers are under the control of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and when it comes to workers there are a great number of measures which deal in part with the interests of our workers but are under the control of the Minister of Labour.</p>

<p>Under this Bill we are bringing all agricultural workers under the control of the Minister of Labour, and we are taking away from the Department of Bantu Administration the responsibility which that Department had in the past in respect of the implementation of this Act. That is why I raise this issue with the Minister. If it is found more advantageous to everyone concerned that the destiny of the workers in this country should fall under the control of the Minister of Labour, then I think this tendency should be accelerated, and I would suggest to the Minister that he should put his foot on the accelerator in that regard.

<speech by="#knobel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has already said he has had discussions with the S.A. Agricultural Union, which is the central body representing the farmers of South Africa, and that the S.A. Agricultural Union heartily agrees with him. But the Minister is also aware of the fact that the S.A. Agricultural Union feels that all the farmers cannot be treated on the same basis. You have the crop farmers who work mainly with machinery or who use machinery to a great extent and then you have stock farmers who practically have no machinery on their farms or very little and where the risk of accidents happening is very small. I want to tell the Minister at this stage that I do not think it will be reasonable to treat all the farmers on the same basis. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give serious consideration to the suggestion of the S.A. Agricultural Union that there should be various tariffs for the various categories of <span class="col_1443-1444" refersTo="page_0736"/>farmers. The tariff will then go up as the risk becomes greater. I can assure the hon. the Minister that we farmers who have entered into that agreement with the Commissioner that we shall register all our labourers and that we shall pay the fixed premiums in respect of all our labourers welcome this Bill because the premiums we have had to pay have ultimately become almost unbearable. I personally wrote to the Commissioner and told him that the tariff had now become so high that I would have to cancel my agreement unless something was done to bring in all the farmers under the scheme so that the premiums could be lowered in that way. I informed him that, unless such an arrangement was made, I would in future only register those of my labourers who worked with machinery. Mr. Speaker, I think it is only fair and human that we pass this legislation to-day. The Bantu of South Africa have in the past played an extremely important role in agriculture. Just think back to the years before we mechanized. Had we not had the Bantu in agriculture to assist the Whites, we would not have made the progress which we did indeed make in the agricultural industry. To-day we have mechanization and there is practically not a single Bantu worker&#x2014;man, woman and child&#x2014;on a crop farm who is not at some time or other during the day liable to have an accident as a result of the fact that we have mechanized our farms. Although the Bantu child does not operate the tractor, the tractor carries the Bantu child on the trailer to where the Bantu father works. The child may fall off and be injured; he can even be killed or he can be injured to such an extent that he will suffer from the accident for the rest of his days. That is why I think it is only right that we as White people, as the guardians of the Bantu, should pilot this important legislation through the House. It is only fair towards the Bantu and on the other hand it also affords protection to the White farmer because there are many farmers who are sometimes inclined to try to save a little here and there. The fact that a farmer follows a short-sighted policy and neglects to register his Bantu worker and to insure him against accidents can result, as the hon. the Minister has rightly pointed out, in the ultimate financial ruination of that farmer because of claims for enormous amounts being instituted against him. If we all registered our workers and paid our premiums, there would be a possibility, as the Minister also envisages, of the premiums being reduced.</p>

<p>There are a few small practical problems which worry the farmers as far as this Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is concerned. The financial year of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner ends on 31 December. As you know, Sir, the farmers are honest people; there are no dishonest farmers and we should like the Minister to change the regulations in such a way that there will not be a suggestion of dishonesty on the part of the farmer when he submits his returns. As an honest farmer I believe in forwarding my premium of R1.50 per R100 to the Commissioner in terms of the wage account I submit to the Receiver of Revenue. I think that is the most honest way of doing it. If I have fraudulently shown more wages than I have actually paid I naturally have to pay more to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner in the way of premium. But my problem is this: My tax year ends at the end of February; those of other farmers end at the end of June. Because the financial year of the Commissioner begins on 1 January the farmers have to submit their returns at the end of December and I can assure you, Sir, that it is very difficult for the farmer to calculate how many labourers he will employ during the ensuing year and what their wages will be. That is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the financial year of the Commissioner cannot start on 1 March in respect of farmers who have to pay their income tax at the end of February and on 1 July in the case of those farmers who have to pay their income tax at the end of June. It is very difficult for us to submit a return at the end of December because in that case we simply have to guess how much we shall be paying out in the form of wages. I want to be quite honest with the Minister: When the Commissioner tells me to estimate how many labourers I shall have in my employ from 1 January to 31 December, I shall simply give him the number I had in my employ during the preceding tax year and the wages which I paid during the previous tax year and that is not being quite honest; it worries me because the Commissioner can tell me that it is not an accurate return although it may in the long run amount to the same thing. If the Minister does not see his way clear to alter the financial year of the Commissioner&#x2019;s I trust the Minister will make this concession that I as farmer, when I make my estimate, will be allowed to submit the previous years&#x2019; figures to the Commissioner.</p>

<p>There is another matter in respect of which I want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister. As you know, Sir, all people are not alike: there are people who are careless: there are people who do not care one iota whether their servants are going to have an accident or whether they are not going to have an accident. On the other hand there are farmers who always keep a watchful eye over all their Bantu labourers. Although they are Bantu they are human beings. It worries me as a farmer when a Bantu gets injured on my farm when he sows maize. The farmer who is worth his salt tries to organize his work in such a way that the possibility of accidents is reduced to the minimum. You will get one farmer on whose farm accidents often happen; then you get another farmer on whose farm accidents seldom happen. The reason for that is simply the difference in the personality of those two farmers. In other words, the one is more careful and although all his employees are Bantu he regards them as the main assets on his farm. As I have said the other farmer does not care <span class="col_1445-1446" refersTo="page_0737"/>one iota what happens to his employees. The Bantu are worth very much to us as farmers and just as a farmer should be careful and see to it that his implements, his tractors, etc. are not unnecessarily damaged, he should be equally careful to see to it that his Bantu workers are not injured, because without that Bantu worker you can have the best tractor in the world but it will not go, because a baboon cannot drive it; you have to have a Bantu to drive it for you. I consequently see to it that my Bantu workers are not unnecessarily injured. I also see to it that the Native who drives the mealie planter does not have his fingers cut off by the cogwheels because if he does I am without his services for a few days. But there is another important aspect and that is that I as a careful farmer will submit fewer claims to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner. The expenditure as a result of accidents on my farm will consequently be much lower than the expenditure that has to be incurred on the farm of the farmer who does not care one iota whether his labourers get injured or not. I therefore want to make a serious plea to the hon. the Minister to give his attention to this matter as well, namely, that when I as a farmer have paid my premium for 12 months and have made no claims, I shall be entitled to a no claim bonus. I see the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) is laughing, but surely that is the principle which operates in the case of motor insurance. If you do not claim the company&#x2019;s obligation is reduced and the company can then afford to allow you a no claim bonus on your premium for the ensuing year. I think that by doing that we shall encourage the careless and negligent farmer to be more careful. I trust therefore that the hon. the Minister will give this matter his serious consideration.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying thank you very much to the Minister. We farmers appreciate the interest that he takes and we appreciate the fact that he has introduced this legislation because we believe it will be of great benefit to both farmer and labourer.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House support this Bill and particularly the clause which now includes the farming community. We are quite sure that the vast majority of the farming community will welcome this Bill, and I am sure that the vast majority of those who up to now have not registered will have no objection to joining.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) made a point which I want to support and that is that the Commissioner will have to bring the provisions of this measure specially to the notice of all farmers. The new obligations which will now fall upon them are very important and many of them will not know what those obligations are, and I think a very special effort will have to be made to bring their new obligations to their notice. I also feel that farm labourers should be classified into two categories. There are those who work with machinery and who are more prone to accidents than those who work with picks and shovels who seldom have accidents. It should not be difficult to have two tariffs, one for the former and one for the latter. It may not be very easy to put them into different categories but it should be possible to do so, and I think it is right that they should be classified differently.</p>

<p>Sir, with these few words I would like to support this measure and I am sure that the whole farming community will welcome it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I am not so optimistic as to think that all farmers will welcome this legislation with open arms. I have a few doubts about it. Those who thought they could benefit by compulsory assurance under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and who were forced to do so under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act of 1941, as amended, have already registered and insured their employees under that Act and they are making their contributions. As the hon. the Minister has rightly said there are still approximately 56,000 farmers who have not registered and who still have to make their contributions. I think that the majority of those 56,000 farmers who have not yet registered will be found to be small farmers who do not use a great deal of machinery on their farms. I therefore expect some opposition or a feeling of dissatisfaction on the part of those persons who were not registered previously and who will now be obliged to register. The reason for that dissatisfaction is that some people may think that more farmers will now fall under the scope of this Act for the sake of the farmer who has a great deal of machinery on his farm or who has a fair number of employees who work with that machinery, whose work is more dangerous than that of the farmer with less machinery and who consequently has to make greater contributions from time to time. It may be argued that what is envisaged here is to lessen the burden of the farmer with a great amount of machinery and there may be some truth in that statement. I just want to point out, as the hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) has already done, that in actual fact many farmers would be obliged to register under the Act to-day and to insure their employees had they been aware of the provisions of the Act. The law demands that any person who works with machinery must be insured. When a tractor, for example, is pulling a plough and somebody works with that plough and gets injured some people may perhaps argue that it does not fall under the definition of machinery. Take the case of a person who works with a windmill or the case of the person who rides on a trailer. Farming having been mechanized to the extent to which it has. I think there are few farmers to-day who do not have some kind or other of machinery on their farms with which their employees come into contact. I believe it is in the interests of the people, although it is by way of legislation, to force them to insure not only to safeguard themselves but to safeguard their employees.</p>

<p><span class="col_1447-1448" refersTo="page_0738"/>I referred a moment ago to the high administrative costs. I just want to show you, Sir, what the position has been since 1941. After 1941, after the passing of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, the farmer who had insured all his employees had to contribute only 50c per R100 wages in terms of an agreement he had entered into with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner. That was the position till 1960 when the fund was so depleted and the deficits so high that there was an immediate increase of 300 per cent. In other words, a contribution was demanded not only from those who had insured those of their employees who came into contact with machinery, but also from those who had entered into an agreement to insure all their employees. They had to make a contribution of R1.50 per R100 wages, an immediate increase of 300 per cent in the contributions the employer had to make. But those who had only insured those of their employees who came into contact with machinery enjoyed this concession that they could only insure those employees for the period of the year during which they came into contact with machinery. In other words, if employees worked with machinery for four months of the year, for example, but did other work on the farm for the remaining eight months, it was only necessary for the employer to pay one-third of that R1.50 per R100 wages; or if the period was six months he had to pay half. That concession has also been withdrawn with the result that that increase was not only a 300 per cent increase. I think of those people who had insured for six months and who had to contribute for the whole 12 months; in their case it was a 600 per cent increase.</p>

<p>There was a further increase during the past year. It may sound laughable when I mention it, Sir, but it made a difference in the case of those persons with employees. Not that I want to suggest that the amount that had previously to be added to the wages for rations and housing was sufficient&#x2014;as a matter of fact, I doubt whether it is enough to-day&#x2014;but in any case. Mr. Speaker, it meant an increase in the contribution of the farmer. Previously the farmer had to add R2 per month for housing and R2 per month for rations to the wages when he drew up his wage bill for the year. That amount has now been increased to R3 for housing and R3 for rations. It does not sound a great amount but it is already R2 per month per employee. Taken over a period of 12 months and in respect of 20 or 30 employees, the amount on which the contributions have to be made will be considerable. I simply mention that to show that fairly large increases have come into operation from time to time.</p>

<p>A new category of farmer is now to come under the scope of this Act. I think the person who uses a great deal of machinery on his farm feels very much more assured when his employees are insured so that in the event of an accident&#x2014;as you know, Mr. Speaker, farming is a dangerous occupation&#x2014;the dependants of his employees will at least be covered. I do feel, however, that there are those who, unless the contributions can be reduced, will be hard hit. Somebody referred to potato growers. There are other types of farming which are even less dangerous. The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) said he hoped the Minister would divide farming into two categories when a determination was made. I want to go further; I want to ask for more than two categories. It can even be divided into three or four categories&#x2014;those who have no machinery on their farms; those who only grow vegetables, for example, and have no dangerous animals on their farms which can injure the workers &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member comes to my farm I shall show him a few. There are ostriches, bulls, and even Nationalists as far as the hon. member is concerned. I trust the hon. the Minister will divide agriculture in more categories so that the burden will be placed on those who really engage in dangerous work and that those who engage in less dangerous work will be less hard hit. I think that will give greater satisfaction in the agricultural industry. The great difficulty with accident insurance is that the one man always thinks he has to make contributions for the sake of the other man, that it is the other man who really benefits or who, because of his negligence, places his employees in danger. That is why I heartily support the hon. member for Bethlehem in what he has said. I myself said that last year when we discussed the Vote of the hon. the Minister. I know it was also discussed recently by the South African Agricultural Union and the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner. We are asking that a system be devised whereby those who take the necessary precautionary measures and who do not make any claims during the years would be encouraged. I think that if motor insurance companies can devise such a no claim bonus scheme beneficially, it ought to be easy in this case as well, without too much administrative costs, to come forward with such a scheme. It will be an encouragement to farmers not to expose their workers to danger unnecessarily so that it becomes necessary to claim. I trust the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to do that.</p>

<p>I want to point out that this accident insurance is a mutual insurance scheme. The hon. the Minister has, for example, been asked by how much he intended reducing the contributions of the employers. I accept that the hon. the Minister cannot tell us that at the moment. I accept that this legislation will first have to be in operation for a considerable time so that we can see how many more farmers will be brought under the scope of the Act and what their contributions will be. I believe it will have to be determined what the contributions will have to be in the various classes of accident insurance before it will be <span class="col_1449-1450" refersTo="page_0739"/>possible to make any changes. I do trust, however, that the hon. the Minister will consider the few matters we have brought to his notice, namely, a varying scheme that will lay down different tariffs for various categories with the possibility of a no claim bonus, and see if he can bring about that relief.</p>

<p>I also think that everybody welcomes the amendment to the effect that members of the Defence Force and the Police will now fall within the ambit of the Act. I take it that the contributions will be paid by the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice. I take it that they will constitute a completely separate sub-class under the Act. As I said a moment ago in this case too each one will be afraid that he is making a contribution that will benefit another section of the society.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to one other statement made by the hon. member for Bethlehem. He said he thought the best way of collecting the contributions would be to take the wage returns as submitted by the farmer in his income tax returns. I hope the hon. the Minister will not accept that advice of the hon. member for Bethlehem.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that that will be the only honest return the Minister will get from the farmers, but if the Minister were to do that what about those who pay their employees much more than the amount they are obliged to pay? Any amount the employee receives over R120 per month is not shown in the wage sheet. I do not know what the position is in Bethlehem but in Somerset East and vicinity I do not think there are many White employees who are paid less than R120 per month. The amount that you pay in excess of R120 will not be shown, therefore. An adjustment will therefore have to be made. There is also the case of those who receive over R3,120 per annum who do not fall within the ambit of this law. I think the suggestion made by the hon. member for Bethlehem is impracticable, also for the reasons he himself advanced, namely that our financial years do not all close on the same date. I want to plead with the Minister to put that aside for the moment until such time as he is convinced that the farmers do not contribute what they should. As I know the farmers, however, they are honest as far as this matter is concerned. There is this penalty clause, of course, that in respect of the difference between the amount the employer shows as having paid in wages and the larger amount he has actually paid, he can be assessed threefold as far as the contribution he has to pay to the Commissioner is concerned. I hope that in spite of the fact that difficulties may be encountered and in spite of the fact that the farmers may to some extent be dissatisfied, this legislation which we are passing here to-day will be to the benefit of the farmers; they will know that they will not be faced with heavy claims and that it will also be to the benefit of employees who run the risk of accidents. All the workers will now be sure that they will be compensated for any accident that may happen to them.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Most of my remarks will be confined to Clause 6 of this Bill which deals specifically with industrial diseases. My hon. friend from Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) said this was a step forward. The hon. the Minister said that it was a removal of an arbitrary restriction entirely. Firstly I should like to agree with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana that it is a step forward, although it is a very small step. It is merely the removal of a gross injustice from which the working man has suffered. This is characteristic, Sir, of all industrial health legislation under the Department of Labour. I am not referring to accidents. I am referring to health as such. The Department is ill-fitted to look after, and not very interested in the health of the individual worker. I do not wish to imply that health conditions in factories in general are not attended to. Up to a point they try to introduce preventive measures and they see to amenities but there, more or less, their interest ceases. The actual care of the actual worker and of the workers <i>en masse</i> in regard to their occupational health is left to chance. Nowhere can this be seen more plainly that in the list of diseases which is scheduled by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department namely: &#x201C;Cancer&#x2014;due to smoke&#x201D; and &#x201C;chimney sweeper&#x2019;s cancer.&#x201D; I do not think that such a case of cancer has ever been recorded in South Africa. I do not think such a case of cancer has been recorded in the civilized world over the past 20 to 30 years. It was a disease which was prevalent some 100 years ago and it was soon discovered that it was limited to chimney sweeps and that if they bathed properly the disease would disappear. There are not many chimney sweeps in this country, Sir, and I am sure that most of them have a bath available. I should say that chimney sweeper&#x2019;s cancer went out more or less as the same time as plumbers were taught to wash their hands and so avoid lead poisoning. There are other industrial diseases, however, creeping into the picture. New types of industry are being developed and this Ministry is not very interested nor does it have the staff to face up to these problems. I think it is hardly to be expected that a Department concerned mostly with labour should be interested in occupational health from the truly health point of view. That is where I quarrel with the Act, Sir. I believe that occupational health should come under the care of people who are interested in the undesirable effects which the industry concerned may have on the health of the workers. In this country we are faced with the problem that until illness occurs no notice is taken of it. Unfortunately an illness, even an industrial illness, does not wear a label. It often takes quite a time to recognize the fact that it is the industry concerned which is causing the illness. I want to know whether we must wait until we have grave epidemics of industrial disease before the Department takes <span class="col_1451-1452" refersTo="page_0740"/>any interest. We know, of course, that the greatest industrial disease in the country, pneumoconiosis in miners, threatened the industry at one time, and does still threaten it to some extent, and because it threatened the industry the Department concerned&#x2014;not this department&#x2014;took a great interest in it. Not only does it take a great interest in that disease in that it looks after the individual miner but it takes a great interest in the conditions under which that miner works. It takes a great interest in the health of the persons who enter the industry. Very much the same condition is beginning to develop more and more in the environment of other workers. I have here a list of cases which have been picked up in a city more or less haphazardly because the doctor concerned was interested in the matter. I am sure the Minister must know of some of these cases. The doctor concerned came across some of these cases purely by accident. I may say in passing that the reason why pneumoconiosis is the disease I have picked on is because it is the easiest disease to detect as an industrial disease. It shows up under X-ray so any doctor looking for tuberculosis tends to pick up this condition in a worker. In the manufacture of Vim there were many cases of pneumoconiosis. When this was pointed out to the manufacturers they took steps to prevent further cases if possible. That is not statutory; they do it in order to protect their workers. I want to read from this report of the doctor to whom I have referred&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moulders and polishers in iron foundries: In every foundry which has been surveyed case of silicosis have been discovered. The hazard has been long recognized and several cases have been compensated under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act.</block>

<block name="quote">Spray painters and enamellers in iron foundries: Here again silicosis has been picked up. The formulae used in these processes contain varying amounts of silica powder. A report was made to the medical department of the organization and to date the matter is apparently still receiving attention.</block>

<block name="quote">Powdering of rubber tubing: A hitherto unrecognized hazard arising from the use of talcum powder for rubber tubing was discovered during a survey in a rubber factory. Ten per cent of the workers in the tube section were found to have frankly abnormal lung patterns.</block>

<block name="quote">The manufacture of asphalt: Pneumoconiosis was diagnosed in several workers with long service in an asphalt plant. It has now been arranged that an efficient dust extractor unit will be installed.</block>

<block name="quote">Asbestos: Local industries in which radiological appearances of asbestosis have been found supported by the finding of asbestos powder in the sputum in factories producing, for instance, asbestos cement.</block>

<p>At this stage I want to break off to refer to the well-appreciated hazard of mesothelioma developing in asbestos workers and I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us what he is doing about it because there are cases. It was as long ago as 1950 that Dr. Sleggs of Kimberley pointed out that in every case of mesothelioma that he had discovered the disease had taken many years to develop since the patient had had contact with asbestos. In other words, it has taken all these years from 1959 to 1964 before this man will be acknowledged, as he will be now, we hope. Then the report goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Radiological changes in the lungs of cotton and woolmill workers.</block>

<p>Then there is the case of sclerosis in a tinsmith, which is just the one. What I want to point out and the conclusion I want to draw is this that for every one man who is brought to the notice of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner there are probably 30 or 40 who suffer from a disease to a minor degree who receive no compensation and no attention. But I am less interested in the compensation than I am in the health of these men and the prevention of the illness. There are other hazards. There is the hazard from chemicals. There is a hazard to those who work with plastics; there is the radiation hazard, the hazard of the X-rays which are used. All these require a great amount of thought and attention on the part of the person who is looking after the workmen. Much to my regret I have to look to the Minister of Labour instead of to the Minister of Health. The outlook of the Minister of Labour cannot be any other than to look after the interests of labour. His outlook is therefore not the true outlook of the person who is in charge of the health of the country and the health of the working man. For every man that is picked up and compensated there are 30 or 40 as I have said. Not only are they not compensated, Sir, but they receive no medical assistance. If a man injures his hand or his head or any other part of his body in an accident in a factory, not only does he receive suitable compensation but he receives medical attention. There is no argument about his receiving that medical attention. But the man who is sick&#x2014;he may himself not even realize what is behind his illness&#x2014;the man who works for a time in a factory and after about five or ten years develops asthma or asthmatic symptoms and thinks to himself &#x201C;this climate does not suit me, I must move to a higher or a lower altitude or a more moist or a drier climate&#x201D;, does not realize that it is the neglect on the part of this hon. Minister that has caused him to become ill. He should see that the working man is protected in every way.</p>

<p>I do not expect the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department to issue a blanket law to cover all these conditions. I think each industry will have to be examined for its own problems, but examined it should be; there is no question about it. Just as the mining industry has had to face up to the problem of the dust so <span class="col_1453-1454" refersTo="page_0741"/>must various other industries face up to the problem of chemicals, fumes, etc., to which they are exposing their workers. The only person who can attend to this is the hon. the Minister of Labour. I maintain that he should have a medical committee which can investigate, with other industrial scientists and chemists, what the particular hazard is in any particular industry and deal with that hazard. In reply to a question of mine the hon. the Minister replied last Friday that he did not have the power summarily to close down factories. I think it is time that he took such power because the labourer looks to him for protection. The care of all the working men in the country is entrusted to the Minister. Unless he deals with this question of industrial health as he should he is not carrying out his duty. The problem is not a new one in the world generally nor is it completely neglected in this country. The Anglo-American Corporation has gone so far as to introduce a course in occupational health. It is a long course. It entails some 18 months of instruction and it takes up 600 hours of theoretical instruction and 250 hours of practical instruction. The practical instruction includes visits to various factories especially those associated with chemical products, explosives, chromium, ceramics, tar, radiation, oils, etc. There are many others. I am not saying that this course should be followed by the hon. the Minister, because I do not suppose that Anglo-American do it in quite the same manner as would the State or a University Department but this should prove to the Minister that there is a wide interest in this matter. The Federal Council of the South African Medical Association in September of 1962, passed the following resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in the interest of both employers and employees it is highly desirable that industries should provide medical services within each industry, either individually where the number of employees would warrant it, or by combining with neighbouring undertakings. Such services should be directed by adequately trained industrial medical officers on a full- or part-time basis to suit particular conditions.</block>

<p>A congress in July, 1963, attended by 104 delegates talking on industrial health, which included such distinguished men as Dr. Ohrenstein, the Chief Medical Officer from Iscor, the head of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand, passed this resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the opinion of this meeting that a governmental medical inspectorate for factories and works should be established as soon as possible.</block>

<p>I want to try and make the hon. Minister appreciate that the outlook of his Department should be such as to deal with what is happening to the individual, quite apart from accidents. Accidents are easy to see and easy, or perhaps not easy, to deal with. But illness which is brought on by the very work that the man is doing should not be overlooked by the hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department and he should create a department to look after these people. Will the hon. Minister tell me in his reply to the debate, how these men who are taken ill are going to be compensated, how the doctors treating them are going to be paid. It is quite easy to pay a doctor who takes off a finger or something of that nature, but at what stage do you accept that a man is ill as a result of his work, and how is that doctor to be paid and when the man has recovered&#x2014;temporarily recovered because in some of these cases the illness will leave a permanent mark on the man&#x2019;s life, and every time he goes off sick, will he be regarded as a malingerer or as a man who is sick of an industrial disease? The whole problem of industrial health from the illness point of view must be carefully looked into. It was only two years ago that I drew the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to the case of a zinc factory working in Germiston in which the workers working with boiling zinc were splashed and burned. Some doctors advised that the tank where they were working should be protected by a guard-rail. The factory found that the guard-rail slowed down the work and made the Bantu clumsy. What was the end? It was most interesting to find in the <i>Medical Journal</i> report that the guard-rail was then removed and the Bantu were punished if they allowed themselves to be burnt. That is the general outlook of that Minister&#x2019;s Department as regards industrial health.</p>

<p>I do not want to detract from the speech of the hon. member for Durban (Central) about the health conditions of industrial workers but I think it was very unfair of the hon. member to have said what he did say, namely, that the Minister of Labour was &#x201C;ill-fitted and not interested&#x201D;. I shall not argue about whether the Minister&#x2019;s Department is perhaps &#x201C;ill-fitted&#x201D;. If that is the case there is a possibility that things can be improved. But to say that &#x201C;the Minister is not interested&#x201D; is far-fetched. I do not think there is one person, no matter who he is, who will not be interested in the welfare of any worker in the Republic, irrespective of his race or colour. The hon. member also said that &#x201C;the Minister will only look after industry and labour and not after health&#x201D;. I think even that statement is not worthy of him, because the hon. member spoke about the health of the workers in the Republic and every responsible person in this House is concerned about the conditions under which the workers in the Republic work. The matters raised by the hon. member are definitely matters that should enjoy the attention of the Department of Labour, but we also want to state unequivocally that the Department of Labour has made tremendous progress in tackling all the various aspects raised by the hon. member this afternoon, and we want to <span class="col_1455-1456" refersTo="page_0742"/>tell the Department that we are thankful and appreciate what has been done; we appreciate the tremendous steps that have been taken to protect the health of the workers in the various factories and industries. When we look back we have reason to be proud of what has already been achieved; we can be proud of the way in which the hygienic conditions under which the workers work to-day have been improved. Where we know of certain defects we want to plead with the Minister to-day to have those defects remedied.</p>

<p>We are all grateful for Clause 6 in terms of which the period laid down in the past as far as industrial diseases were concerned, has now been done away with, so that that industrial disease which takes a longer time to manifest itself will now be covered to the benefit of the worker. We should very much like to do even much more for the worker but all these things cost money, and while we dare not consider money when it comes to the health of our workers, we must none the less work within a certain limit to obtain these various benefits for the workers from time to time. We know that the health of the worker is very dear to the hon. member for Durban (Central) and we join him in pleading that attention should be given to certain conditions which are not properly under control as yet. We trust that there will shortly be an improvement. Those of us who represent workers&#x2019; constituencies know how terribly people ultimately suffer from such diseases. There was no provision in the past that the minute the disease was detected in his lungs or in his system it should be attended to and eventually the worker was the one to suffer and nobody wanted to assume responsibility for it. We are grateful for the concession which is made in this Bill and we are convinced that there will ultimately be more concessions.</p>

<p>I shall not venture into the field of farming matters to-day. All I want to say to the farming community is that we who are engaged in industry to-day would have had many a sleepless night had it not been for the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. The Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is there to protect you in case there should be an accident in your factory or workshop. Then you know that your employee who has been injured is immediately protected under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. If hon. members perhaps think that it is being applied unjustly, that they are perhaps asked to pay too much, I just want to tell them that the employers will ultimately reap the benefits.</p>

<p>I want to have a talk to the hon. the Minister of Labour this afternoon in connection with another group of workers. We are to-day extending the benefits of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act to the Police Force and our Defence Force should they at some time or other be called upon to quell local riots and I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), namely, that we pray that that would never happen in our country. But seeing that we must consider the possibility that something like that may happen there is one group of workers who, I feel, perform very essential services and who are excluded from the benefits of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. I think of those people who will not get any assistance should they be injured in assisting to quell riots. I refer in particular to the police reserve force, members of the commandos and those people who may be called upon at some time or other to perform essential services, such as standing guard at water works, electrical installations and bus sheds. The police reserve force can be called upon. They joined to perform essential services and if there are riots they are called upon to do their duty; the same applies to members of the commandos and all those people who may be called up by local authorities or certain concerns to protect and to stand guard at important and essential works. Those people carry a double burden. To whom can they look if they are injured during such riots? Surely he is a person who takes a very great responsibility upon himself. He places his own family in an unenviable position. If there is rioting and such a person gets injured who must pay his costs? Has he not also done his country an essential service? Did he not help to quell the riots? But nowhere is provision made for his protection as far as his costs are concerned should he get injured. Who will be responsible for his hospital costs? Who will be responsible for his loss of earnings? Will it be the owner of the factory where he works? Say, for instance, it is a one-man show who cannot afford it! That is why I want to plead that those people who are prepared to be called upon to give their services in the interests of our country should also be considered. Provision must be made for them so that they can also derive the benefits which the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act offers. They are excluded at the moment. There is no encouragement for that type of person to join the police reserve force or the commandos or anywhere else where they will be called upon to perform essential services. They are afraid to do so because they will not be compensated should they get injured. Last year and years ago local authorities had to call upon their officials to guard certain essential works, such as water works, electrical installations and bus sheds. Those local authorities had to take out additional insurance policies so that in the event of those people getting into difficulty and getting injured there would, in any case, have been insurance money to compensate them. But that type of person is definitely not covered by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister of Labour to bring those people under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act as quickly as possible so that they too will get the benefits which the Police Force and members of the Defence Force get to-day. If we do that it would be an encouragement to those people and a greater <span class="col_1457-1458" refersTo="page_0743"/>proportion of our workers would derive those benefits. It would give great satisfaction.</p>

<p>It is always a matter of great regret to me personally, and I am sure to the other representatives of the Coloured people in this House, that when amendments are made to an Act, such as this, the hon. the Minister does not find it necessary to change the whole basis on which compensation is being paid. Compensation is being paid in all cases on the earnings of the individuals. We know what that means for a Coloured person. It does not matter what injury the Coloured man suffers, it does not matter if he loses an arm or an eye or becomes totally incapacitated, he is almost ruined because of the low salary which he earns, because there is such great disparity between the wage of a White man and a Coloured man, based solely on the question of skin and not service.</p>

I cannot find anything in the Act in that regard, but this could be very detrimental to the Bantu workers if that were the case. I would like the hon.

I will not take it any further.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I was surprised at the hon. member who has just sat down. It is not the first time he has surprised me. But he is always to the left of the Government and this time he was even to the left of the Bill under discussion. He is also going upstream but unfortunately he does not swim with his mouth open. The previous speaker tried to suggest that compensation was paid on the basis of colour. That is nonsense because if members of the various racial groups are on the same salary scale, compensation is paid according to the salary scale, irrespective of colour. The basis is the basic salary the person receives, irrespective of colour. As I said at the beginning, the hon. member is completely to the left of the Government and he has once again made an attempt to jeopardize the co-operation and good relationship which is being built up between White and Coloured by trying to make out a case where he really has no case.</p>

<p>I want to return to the basis on which people in agriculture have to pay their premiums under this Bill. It is quite clear that there are certain categories in agriculture where the danger of accidents happening is much greater than in others. As it is, farmers have availed themselves of the opportunity of insuring their employees who work with dangerous implements, such as tractors, for example, under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act against accidents. That matter has been dealt with fully but I wish to emphasize that where the risk factor is great I think it is fair and just that the question be considered and that there should be a difference between the premiums payable in respect of the agricultural worker who does dangerous work and the one who does not. We admit that there is a great deficit in the fund in respect of agricultural employees, but there is a certain group of farmers who really cannot carry a heavier burden although it affords them the protection which we all admit this Act gives. Every tiny straw that is added will eventually break the camel&#x2019;s back. We must approach the matter realistically and look at it as it is, namely, that a large number of our farmers should not be saddled with a heavy burden. That is why I seriously want to plead with the hon. the Minister that when he draws up the regulations in respect of the amounts that have to be paid to try to give effect to this suggestion.</p>

<p>Another small matter I want to touch upon arises from the remarks made by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) and that is in connection with protection and cover for a certain section of our Defence <span class="col_1461-1462" refersTo="page_0745"/>Force, namely, the Mobile Watch. We find that many of them do not even enjoy the privilege of being covered under ordinary private life insurance. Those men come forward voluntarily to be trained and to equip themselves to protect the country. I think it is generally recognized that the Mobile Watch is of great value to the country in times of disturbances. I want to associate myself with those who said they hoped their services would not be required but in the meantime they are being trained for that task; they are dealing with dangerous machinery, vehicles and even weapons. I should like to plead with the hon. the Minister to include that category under the Act, because unlike other members of the Defence Force and the Police they cannot be covered in any other way against accidents. The members of the Mobile Watch can lose limbs and become completely incapacitated for any service and yet there is no provision for compensation for them. I trust the Minister will bring this group of people within the ambit of the law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I want to thank the House for its reception of this Bill. I will deal briefly with the points raised by hon. members.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) raised the question of publicity. Now that the farmers are to be brought within the purview of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, he suggests that some publicity should be given to the farmers because there are some penal sections in the Act which they may breach unwittingly. I can tell the hon. member that the Commissioner will give full publicity to the amendments, not only to the farmers but to the others as well, but particularly to the farmers. Then the hon. member asked whether I would indicate what reduction there would be in rates. I think the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) dealt with that on the lines on which I was going to deal with it, namely, that the fixing of the rate is of course a matter for the actuaries and the Commissioner. Consultations will take place with organized farmers and obviously, if there are surpluses, as we hope there will be, the rates will be reduced. But I am quite unable to say at this stage what reduction, if any, there will be in the rates. The hon. member will appreciate that in the light of the experience gained by the Commissioner after the farmers come within the purview of this Act, he will be able to decide what reduction there should be. I think it seems obvious to all of us that the wider the contributions are, the more prospect there is of a reduction in the rates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, the present rates will remain.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in the meantime. The hon. member raised the question as to whether all workers should not come under the control of the Department of Labour. I am afraid I cannot debate this matter because it does not come within the purview of this Bill, even if I am ready to do so, which I am not. I am not competent, in terms of the Bill before the House, to discuss that matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) raised several questions of interest, the most important of which is whether there will be differential rates for the different categories. Several hon. members raised that point, including the hon. member for Somerset East. I can tell the House that there will be different categories and different rates. As soon as this Bill becomes law the Commissioner will have consultations with organized farmers and their unions, and they will fix a basis for different categories of workers. It is obvious that some work is more dangerous than other work, and there may even be regional differences. I can give the House the assurance that that question will be fully considered, and I have no doubt that there must be different rates for different categories of work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Will that investigation be extended to include workers in the cities so that office and factory workers will have different rates?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>At the moment I am only dealing with farmers. The question which the hon. member raises is already taken into consideration in the present set-up, under existing legislation.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Bethlehem raised a question as to whether there should not be a different financial year in regard to this assessment of rates. The hon. member for Somerset East also replied to that. The effect of the reply is this, that first of all the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner&#x2019;s financial year runs from January to December, and he has from time to time given very careful consideration to this question of altering the financial year to coincide with the tax year, but he has found it quite impracticable to change the system. The reason is that it would entail changing the Commissioner&#x2019;s entire record system. Any hon. member who has been to Compensation House in Pretoria will have seen that there are hundreds of thousands of records which have to be kept. Each claim is allocated a specific number preceded by the year in which the accident occurs. Of course this makes it easy for reference and identification, and assists very greatly in the accounting process which takes place. I think hon. members will agree that the greatest difficulty will be experienced by the Commissioner if claim numbers refer to accidents which occur in the same year but during different financial years. That would be quite impracticable and confusing.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also raised the question of the no-claim bonus, and quite rightly suggested that if a farmer had no claim it should be recognized, and it could be an incentive for a person to take greater care, <span class="col_1463-1464" refersTo="page_0746"/>probably. Well, I am advised that there is an established principle that employers in any particular class where the accident costs are low qualify for a no-claim bonus, and such bonuses are in fact paid to many employers every three years. So the principle is recognized. I have already referred to the hon. member for Somerset East. He obviously has a very good conception of the Act. He dealt with points raised in the course of the debate, and there is nothing that I can really add. The other questions raised by the hon. member for Bethlehem have already been dealt with by the hon. member for Somerset East.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) raised some very interesting questions in regard to industrial diseases. I will refer his contribution to this debate to the Commissioner, but I want to remind him that any additions to the list of scheduled diseases must be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 94 of the Act, which, as the hon. member probably knows, lays down that after investigation by the Commissioner he may recommend to the Minister the addition to or the deletion from the relevant schedule to the Act of any diseases or occupations, and after his recommendation the State President may by proclamation amend the schedule in accordance with any such recommendation which the Minister may receive from the Commissioner. A notice of the intention to publish such proclamation must be published for any objections to be lodged. So hon. members will realize that I am unable obviously to deal with the technical matters raised by the hon. member for Durban (Central). It is a matter for the Commissioner who investigates any suggestions or claims and then he puts his experts on to it. If he thinks that any disease should be added to the schedule or deleted, he reports to the Minister, and the Minister can proceed with the proclamation. I think the hon. member also said that where a man contracts an industrial disease, he is not fairly compensated for mental anxiety. Well, the hon. member knows that in determining what the damages are, account is always taken of pain and suffering, and I take it that includes any mental anxiety which would cause pain and suffering. That the particular workmen whom he has in mind would be amply compensated for any mental anxiety they may have is clear, but of course it would obviously be a very difficult thing to prove. Still, there is such a thing as pain and suffering and he may be able to establish his claim.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan raised the question of members of commandos and police reservists, whom he said are not covered by this Bill. I think I should just deal in some detail with this point because it is quite an important one. I want to show the hon. member and the House that members of commandos are covered in the existing law. Let me take the definition of a workman. Hon. members will see that in the Bill before them in Clause 3 (1) it says: &#x201C;Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), &#x2018;workman&#x2019; in this Act means any person who has entered into or works under a contract of service.&#x201D; Then hon. members will see, further on, on page 5 of the Bill, that the following persons shall not be regarded for the purposes of this Act as workmen. These persons are excluded. They are, firstly, persons in military service or undergoing training within the meaning of the Defence Act who are not members of the Permanent Force of the South African Defence Force. Now this sub-paragraph refers to sections of the Defence Force such as the Active Citizen Force, the commandos and gymnasiums. Persons belonging to these categories are not workmen in the ordinary sense as of course they did not enter into a contract of employment with an employer as contemplated by the Act. They are accordingly excluded from the Act but&#x2014;and this is the important thing&#x2014;by virtue of Sections 145 and 146 of the Defence Act they are covered by the War Pensions Act of 1942 in respect of injuries which they may sustain whilst on duty, whether in peace-time or in war-time, and this is the position also under the Act as it stands at present. So that members of the commando are not included in the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act or in this Bill, but they are covered by the War Pensions Act, whether they are injured in peace-time or in war-time.</p>

<p>Then the next class excluded are members of the Permanent Force of the South African Defence Force while on service in defence of the Republic, as we find in Section 1 of the said Act. And, thirdly, there are the members of the South African Police Force while employed in terms of Section 7 of the Police Act on service which is service in the defence of the Republic. Those categories refer to members of the Permanent Force and the Police Force who are injured while on war-time service. Such persons are also covered by the War Pensions Act, and as in the past, they will continue to be excluded from the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. But now the hon. member raises the question of persons in the Police Reserve. It is true that they are not mentioned in this Bill and they are not covered by the provisions I have just quoted, but for the information of the hon. member and of the House, that position has been taken care of. In regard to the Reserve Police Force, I find that a special force order was issued by the South African Police on 12 June 1963, and this is what it says in paragraph (2)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In relation to Clause 6 of the Schedule it should be noted that a reservist called up for remunerative service is a workman as defined in the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, and consequently the provisions of the said Act will apply in respect of an accident referred to in the said Act.</block>

<p>In other words, the police reservist is covered under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act as it exists now. That deals with the police reservist who is called up for remunerative service. But paragraph 6 of this order says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1465-1466" refersTo="page_0747"/>Should a reservist whilst voluntarily and without remuneration performing duty or undergoing training sustain an injury or die as a result of an accident, compensation from public funds may be awarded to him or his dependants according to the principles and provisions of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, provided that in the application of Section 41 of the said Act such reservist&#x2019;s earnings will include such regular income from any source as the Commissioner of Police in consultation with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner may determine.</block>

<p>So my reply to the hon. member is that the police reservists are fully covered.</p>

<p>Sir, I find it difficult to reply to the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett), because any reply I may give will be outside the purview of the Bill. It is no use my thinking of introducing any amendments such as he suggests, namely, that there should be a levelling up of wages in order that there may be a levelling up of the compensation paid to Whites and to Coloureds. I cannot do it. There is nothing in the Bill which relates to wages. So I do not think I need take the matter any further, however sympathetic one may feel, but let me tell the hon. member this &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, last year I obtained approval in the Estimates for raising the dam wall of the Kopjes Dam in the Renoster River in the Free State. A White Paper was also tabled in which the details of the work which the Department intended doing there were fully set out. The entire control of the water contained in that dam, the distribution of the water amongst the various settlers, rested with the Kopjes Settlement Management Board, and that board gained control in terms of a special Act, Act No. 38 of 1935, over the water in this dam, the maintenance of all the works, and the distribution of the water in the area under their control. Most of that land was State land which was transferred gratis to the Kopjes Management Board. But now we want to raise the dam wall because in recent years a great need has arisen for the provision of more water for the settlers under that scheme. The reason for it is that the dam was built as long ago as 1911, and since then and right up to the present silting has taken place and the capacity of the dam has diminished to such an extent that the dam can no longer fulfil its object. Not only do we now want to raise the dam wall, but we want to improve the whole construction of the dam. The State will have to incur considerable expenditure there. We also want to do it in such a way that should we at a later stage want to raise the wall in order to put even more land under irrigation, we want to be able to do so. For that reason it is now necessary for the State to undertake this work and build it as a State water scheme, and that the State should have control over it, and that the State should exercise control not only over the maintenance of this principal work, but also over the improvement of the canals and their maintenance, so that we can provide the farmers and settlers concerned with the maximum amount of water at minimum cost. We must therefore introduce this Bill, which in the first instance aims at transferring to the State, at no cost, everything belonging to the Management Board of the Kopjes Settlement. Of course compensation will have to be paid for property which was not originally obtained from the State and <span class="col_1467-1468" refersTo="page_0748"/>which they may have purchased. But the principle is that the Management Board will now hand over control to the State. They will hand over to the State that State water scheme, and further all the land which was originally handed over to the board when the board was given control by the State will now be given back to the State at no cost.</p>

<p>This Bill is a hybrid Bill and notices have been issued, in terms of the Standing Orders, to all interested parties under that scheme to ascertain from them whether or not they are in favour of the transfer of this scheme to the State. The overwhelming majority of the interested parties under that scheme, which to-day is still under the control of the Kopjes Irrigation Board, have expressed their approval of the transfer of the scheme to the State. I take it that the small minority who either expressed no opinion or who objected to the transfer possibly did not realize that it was also in their interest that this transfer be made, and I hope that this Bill, which is a hybrid Bill, and in regard to which we have acted in terms of the Standing Orders, and which will also, if necessary, be sent to a Select Committee after the second reading, will receive the support of both sides of the House.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill is intended to amend the statutes of the Rand Water Board to bring it more into line with present-day needs and with the statutes of other large utility undertakings such as Escom.</p>

<p>Firstly, I just want to sketch the present position under the existing Rand Water Board constitution. The Vaal River is the main artery of the heart of South Africa. Water is indispensable for success and progress; it is indispensable for humans and animals, but here it is particularly indispensable for the existence of millions of people. The water of the Vaal River supplies a large complex of people and activities in an area which stretches from beyond Kinross all along the course of the Vaal River to Sasol-burg and northwards to Pretoria. It is the most densely populated area in South Africa, a part of the country in which almost a fifth of the total population lives. The gold mines of the Rand have to be supplied with water from the Vaal River; there are the great workshops of the Railways and several of the largest industries in the country, and five of the largest electric power stations in the country. One can therefore imagine that any break in this water supply can have serious results not only for the places in the neighbourhood and for the mines and industries there, but that any lengthy interruption will be a disaster to South Africa as a whole. Therefore sound control over the distribution of this water is of vital importance not only to the Rand but to the whole of South Africa. The provision of water for this important area of South Africa is undertaken by the Rand Water Board. That is an organization which to a large extent is controlled by private interests, mainly by the Chamber of Mines. In other words, private interests can to a large extent decide to-day who may get water, where development may take place, how much is paid for water, and to what extent there can be discrimination between the one and the other. That is a tremendous responsibility to any private undertaking. It is almost indefensible to give any person or any private body such tremendous responsibility. Let me say very clearly that I am not suggesting for a moment that those powers have ever been abused. I want to say that we appreciate the efficient way in which the water has been distributed in the past, but this is nevertheless something which is indefensible in principle.</p>

<p>The Rand Water Board was established in 1903 in the first place to supply water to the mines and the municipalities. Originally it was just intended for the district of the Witwatersrand, and originally therefore the water was only distributed to Johannesburg, Germiston and the mines in that vicinity. But later Benoni, Roodepoort and Springs were added. In the course of time more areas were steadily included, such as Brakpan, Randfontein, Nigel, Vereeniging and Pretoria, areas which really lie outside the borders of this area. In recent years water was supplied even to the Eastern Transvaal, to mines and towns as fas distant as Kinross and even beyond it. The total area supplied by the Rand Water Board in 1963 comprised 5,127 square miles, and for all practical purposes almost all that water comes out of the Vaal River.</p>

<p>In 1914 the Rand Water Board was given the right to build a dam in the Vaal River, which is still known to-day as the Barrage, and at the same time it was given the right to take 20,000,000 gallons a day from it. In 1934 the State built the Vaal Dam and gave the Rand Water Board the right to take an additional 60,000,000 gallons from that dam. Later, by law, still more water was made available to it, viz. 195,000,000 gallons over and above the original amount. In 1957 a further 72,000,000 gallons was allowed, so that in 1963 the net amount of water allowed to the Rand Water Board was approximately 250,000,000 gallons a day, which represents 42 per cent of potential of the Vaal Dam. In other words, if one takes into consideration that a large <span class="col_1469-1470" refersTo="page_0749"/>proportion of that water from the very nature of the matter will not be conserved, one can say that in fact the position has developed that the Rand Water Board practically has a monopoly over the water of the Vaal River for use in that great and important complex. In all these years&#x2014;and again I say it with appreciation&#x2014;the Rand Water Board has built up a splendid organization and a very efficient one, and as far as I know it has never exceeded its powers. But the Rand Water Board to-day controls the progress of towns and health committees, of ore milling mines and non-ore milling mines, of Government and provincial institutions, of utility corporations and industries and of large numbers of private persons. Today the prosperity of that whole area of South Africa, and therefore the prosperity of the whole of South Africa, is dependent on the Rand Water Board. I say again that it is difficult to justify such tremendous power being left in the hands of private interests; that this tremendous responsibility should be borne by private interests, a responsibility which must be a very uncomfortable one for them. I think hon. members will agree that it will be much more satisfactory if the State, which is responsible for our individual existence and our progress, should have eventual control over such an institution. You can imagine, Mr. Speaker, that if something were to go wrong with the water supply of the Rand, millions of people would suffer damage and that tens or even hundreds of thousands might perhaps be ruined.</p>

<p>The Rand Water Board is at present being controlled by 34 persons appointed by various bodies. The Railways which uses 2.2 per cent of the water appoints one member; the Johannesburg City Council which uses 31.2 per cent of the water appoints five members; Pretoria, which uses 12.1 per cent of the water, appoints only one member. The ten Rand town councils who together use 18.6 per cent of the water each appoint one member, and the Chamber of Mines, which uses only 22.3 per cent of the water, about one-fifth, appoints 16 members. The State, which is the owner of the water, and which built the Vaal Dam, is entitled to one member. Every time a new town council appoints a representative on the Rand Water Board, it means that the Chamber of Mines automatically gets a new member. We see, therefore, that at best this situation is a very arbitrary one. But that is not all. The votes of the members on that board do not go according to the principle of one man, one vote; it is not based on the very democratic system we have here where each one of us can vote and where nobody&#x2019;s vote counts more than the vote of another member. The vote of each of those city councils counts more or less as the vote of another city council, because every one of those city councils and every one of those bodies has a vote which depends on the municipal valuation of that city.</p>

<p>Let me now give a few examples, Johannesburg, which has a valuation of R1,075,102,027, has an equal number of votes for each of its five members, but each of the other city councils have votes according to their own valuations. Let me give a few examples of the Rand municipalities. According to its valuation, Germiston has 104,897,842 votes and Springs 71,442,834. But now one finds this peculiarity, that where certain municipalities now have a vote according to their valuations, other municipalities do not have a vote according to their valuation, but according to the valuation of other municipalities. Let me take Pretoria, for example. Pretoria does not have a vote according to its valuation. No, Pretoria has a vote equal to one-tenth of the votes of all the other municipalities. In other words, Pretoria cannot use even half its valuation as a vote. Its vote depends on the valuations of other municipalities. Pretoria will receive more votes to the extent that the other municipalities become more flourishing. Its vote is therefore dependent on the prosperity of other municipalities. The Railway Administration does not have a vote according to its valuation. No, the Railways has a vote equal to one-tenth of the valuation of all municipalities, this time including Pretoria. In other words, it has a vote greater than Pretoria itself has, despite the fact that Pretoria uses six times as much water as the Railways.</p>

<p>Then I come to the Chamber of Mines. The Chamber of Mines has as many votes as all the other municipalities together, although those municipalities use three times as much water as the mines. The mines use just about as much water as the Johannesburg Municipality, but the latter has five members, whereas the Chamber of Mines has 16. As I have said, all the municipalities together use about three times as much water as the mines, but they never have more members than the Chamber of Mines. Now we come to what is most peculiar of all, and that is the position of the State.</p>

<p>The State is the owner of all the water. It is the owner of the Vaal Dam, but it has only one representative on the board, the chairman. The chairman, for the rest, does not have an ordinary vote but has only a deciding vote in the case of a deadlock. In other words, in practice the State has no vote. Originally there was perhaps a good reason for this system, but it does not fit in with modern circumstances. This constitution was drafted about 60 years ago. At that time it may have been a good thing&#x2014;I do not want to express an opinion&#x2014;but it does not suit modern times. I want to express my thanks to the Chamber of Mines for the 100 per cent co-operation I received from them right from the beginning. They themselves felt that the system was not suitable for these modern times, and they heartily co-operated to amend the Act.</p>

<p>In the first place, I want to repeat here what I also said to the Chamber of Mines, namely, that it is not our object to interfere in the internal affairs of the Rand Water Board. The State would no more interfere there than in <span class="col_1471-1472" refersTo="page_0750"/>the internal workings of Escom. The object is only that the State should have control for strategic and other purposes. The State must be able to determine the broad policy which will ensure the development and safety of this country. What is being done here to-day affects the welfare of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>In regard to the constitution of a board, there are various principles I wish to formulate here to-day, and the first is that the best boards of great industrial undertakings have always been small, like those of Iscor, Escom and Sasol. That is the first principle. It is not in the best interests of the country to have a board consisting of 34 persons. But now I want to come to the second principle, and that is the principle of impartiality. When appointing or nominating the boards of directors of various bodies, one of two principles applies. The first is the principle of partiality, whereby each looks after his own interest as far as possible, everyone takes what he can get, and other persons must fend for themselves. Hon. members will agree with me that this is not the ideal system, to say the least of it. If we want to apply this principle to the Rand Water Board, we will get the position that everybody affected will want to be represented. One cannot then exclude a few of the larger municipalities on the Rand and the Chamber of Mines. If one wants to apply this selfish policy, one must give representation to every interested body; then one must give representation to all the various municipalities and the large undertakings which are large consumers of water; then one must give representation to Iscor, Sasol and Escom and to each of the other large industries like African Explosives and African Metals and K.A.P. and Union Steel and numerous others, and one must also give representation to numbers of big farmers who get water from the Rand Water Board. One can understand that such a system would be impossible.</p>

<p>The second choice we have would be to adopt the principle of impartiality and to have a board of impartial people who would cater for the interests of everybody, rich or poor, whether it be a municipality or a mining company or an industrial undertaking&#x2014;a board which would look after the interests of everybody as well as the interests of the whole area, in order to ensure that the large city councils are not benefited at the expense of the small ones. Sir, that is the principle we have always accepted in South Africa in appointing the boards of our large bodies. That is the principle which was also accepted in my negotiations with the Chamber of Mines and the representatives of the city councils. I want to take this opportunity of thanking them for their goodwill and assistance in embodying this splendid principle in this Bill. We have agreed that the new Rand Water Board will consist of nine members. The State will appoint all of them in terms of the law. For the first ten years, however, there will be a gentlemen&#x2019;s agreement between the State, the Chamber of Mines and the municipalities in terms of which the Chamber of Mines will be able to appoint two members, and the municipalities will be able to propose persons, two of whom may be appointed. It has not yet been determined how these members will be proposed. After this period of ten years the Chamber of Mines will have the right again to approach the Government for a further term for its members if it feels that to be necessary. The Government will then decide the point in its discretion. The remaining five members are appointed by the State, and that consequently gives the State the necessary majority on the board.</p>

<p>There is a second aspect which is affected, the finances of the Water Board. We do not want to interfere with the internal operations of the Rand Water Board, but the board itself felt that the following amendments should be made as the result of the new constitution of the board. These amendments have also between us been agreed upon. The revenue of the Rand Water Board is obtained through the sale of water at various tariffs or, as it is described in the Act, according to various taxes. In fact, that is the price of water. The various prices charged depend on various considerations. In the first place, there is the uniform tax per 1,000 gallons which is calculated according to the actual operating costs connected with the provision of the water. In that is included maintenance costs, operating costs, the costs of improvements, depreciation, the cost of renewals, losses on investments and the reserve funds. Then there is a special tax for Table I loans. This special tax is described in the Act as &#x201C;fixed charges&#x201D;. The fixed charges comprise the interest and redemption which has to be paid on loans every half-year. In terms of this, there is again an arbitrary schedule of payments. Five per cent of these costs must be paid by the Railways, 50 per cent by the municipalities and 45 per cent by the mines. Now there is this peculiarity, that half of the 45 per cent which has to be paid by the mines is paid by every mine according to the quantity of the water it has used, and the other half is paid according to the quantity of ore milled by each mine.</p>

<p>There is also a fixed charge for interest and redemption for Table II loans. That is paid every six months, and is paid by the municipalities, the Railways and the mines according to the quantity of water consumed. Then there is also a special rate for loans and fixed costs. Here the Rand Water Board can decide between the fixed percentage of 5 per cent, 50 per cent and 45 per cent, or according to the quantity of water it has sold, or a little of the one and a little of the other. The advantage of this system is that it leaves the Rand Water Board free to a great extent to decide what water tariffs each one has to pay. As the result, one gets roughly the following three groups. According to the 1962-3 data, it works out that the founders, the so-called constituting bodies to-day, pay 9.26c per 1,000 gallons; the other local authorities pay 10.25c per 1,000 gallons, and the other consumers 12.75c <span class="col_1472-1473" refersTo="page_0751"/>per 1,000 gallons. Now I want to say immediately that one should not be in too great a hurry and say that this is a very unjust system, because one has to bear in mind that the old founders built up capital by way of redemption and interest they paid over the years, until to-day a capital of over &#x00A3;27,600,000 has already been paid off. In other words, it is those bodies which have paid off that capital sum over all these years, that capital from which all the interested parties are deriving benefit to-day. If one thinks of it, Sir, it is only right that these original founders should enjoy a slight advantage over the new consumers. Perhaps you will be interested to know that had no capital been accumulated by the old founders, it would have meant the consumers to-day having to pay approximately 3d. more per 1,000 gallons. I must say to the credit of these old founders, and particularly the Chamber of Mines, that they were fair in their actions and that the percentage of benefits they claimed for themselves over all these years constitutes only a fraction of that 3d. per 1,000 gallons. At the same time I want to remind you, Sir, that where we are now changing this system it is no more than just that the rights of these founder bodies which will in future no longer have a direct say must be safeguarded to some extent in this new Bill. The old founders are satisfied to receive a slight rebate and, as I have already said, the Act has been amended accordingly. These amendments are in the interests of the whole country. The amendments were considered by the Rand Water Board for more than a year at various meetings and they eventually unanimously approved of them. All the members of all the municipalities who were present there unanimously approved these amendments. Thereafter we wrote to each of those members, before the Bill was introduced here, to ascertain whether those bodies were in favour of it, against it, or neutral. Twelve of those municipalities and the Chamber of Mines expressed themselves as being in favour of it, or neutral. But peculiarly enough, the City Council of Johannesburg suddenly raised an objection to this Bill. This is a hybrid Bill. All the conditions required have been complied with and I therefore move.</p>

<p>Sir, we on this side of the House will not raise any objection to the second reading of this Bill. In view of the importance of water in this country and in view of the large number of individuals who are supplied by the Rand Water Board, we are pleased to think that it is now to fall under the jurisdiction of the hon. the Minister himself. We are sure that he will safeguard the purity of the water etc. We may make some recommendations during the Committee Stage but for the moment accept the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Now that we have this amending Bill before us we can ask ourselves three questions: Firstly, will the Act as amended be more in the public interest than the Act as it stands? Secondly, will this amended Act bring about greater co-ordination and function more smoothly and, thirdly, will it bring about the better utilization of water and also give more protection to our water supplies? I think one can answer in the affirmative to all three of these questions. As the hon. the Minister has explained here, at the moment we have in the Rand Water Board an unwieldy body consisting of 34 members&#x2014;a body which is virtually an anachronism. As you have heard, Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that a city council like Pretoria only has one-tenth of the voting strength of all the other city councils combined. Even if Pretoria were to expand into a city as large as Johannesburg it would still only have one-tenth of the voting strength of all the other city councils combined. It will also be noticed that 12 of those 34 members form a quorum. If one consults the attendance register one comes to the conclusion that the various members of the Rand Water Board do not always evince sufficient interest in the matter by attending the meetings of the Board. We find that some of the members attend as few as two or three meetings out of 13 while the meetings of the finance committee, which is actually an executive committee, are very well attended. This indicates that a large body of 34 members cannot function as smoothly as a smaller body can, and, as the hon. the Minister is now proposing, as smoothly as the statutory body which will now be set up. As the position is to-day, the existing finance committee has become virtually an oligarchy&#x2014;it is controlled by only a few persons.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has said, we must remember that water is a national asset and the body which controls it or controls its distribution must co-operate very closely with the State. The manner of distribution of that water must fit in with the policy of the State. We all know that water is not plentiful in South Africa. That is why it is necessary for us to have good co-ordination between the various departments and the various bodies controlling our water supplies. Hon. members may perhaps know that the Department of Water Affairs usually determines the area to be supplied with water and that it is actually the Department of Health which then proclaims that area. We sometimes find that technical difficulties arise even between those two Departments and the existing Water Board. I had some experience of this in my constituency recently. Difficulties do arise that can easily be ironed out by this statutory body.</p>

<p>The Rand Water Board is a private body. It is under no obligation to the public; it is not really imbued with the profit motive but the motive in establishing it was not to serve the public really. The various members who attend the meetings only look after the interests of the bodies they represent. There is no general advancement of the national interest. This new body will be objective as far as this matter is concerned; it will undoubtedly be impartial. Another point that I want to raise in this connection is that the Rand Water Board as now constituted as a private body has no particular <span class="col_1475-1476" refersTo="page_0752"/>status. Its status will be greatly enhanced by this legislation. It will function on the same basis as Escom, Iscor, Foscor and Sasol. It will be given a public status, as I have said. The public function and the duty of the new Rand Water Board that is being proposed here, is, I think, very well set out in Clause 30 (2) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where more than one person becomes liable to contribute in terms of sub-section (1) the persons concerned shall contribute in such proportions as the Board may, in consultation with those persons, determine.</block>

<p>It therefore has to ensure not only that every area, every town, every region, every city is given its rightful share of water but also that each shoulders its due share of responsibility. It must function in the general interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to make use of this opportunity to congratulate the hon. the Minister very heartily indeed on the way in which he has dealt with this whole matter. He has been interested in this matter since 1961. Since that time he has been trying in a tactful way to obtain harmonious co-operation and agreement between the various bodies who are members of the Rand Water Board. The State could just as well have acted dictatorially, or autocratically, but the hon. the Minister did not act in that way. He has brought the matter to where it is to-day by means of consultation and we are pleased to learn that the Opposition are in agreement with the general arrangement.</p>

<p>We want to associate ourselves with the hon. the Minister in thanking the Rand Water Board for the work which it has done so faithfully over the course of the years; we must thank the officials who have done their work so faithfully and conscientiously. On behalf of the Pretoria complex&#x2014;I do not have the authority to speak on behalf of the City Council of Pretoria&#x2014;and particularly on behalf of Pretoria East where we experienced the difficulty to which I referred just now, namely that the water supply area was approved of but that the water could not be supplied&#x2014;I want to thank the hon. the Minister for this Bill. The people of Pretoria support this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to make use of this opportunity as the representative of one of the Reef cities which up to the present has not been represented on the Rand Water Board to welcome this Bill. There are a few additional aspects that I also want to mention. In the first place I want to make use of this opportunity to pay tribute to the pioneers who established the Rand Water Board, including in particular the Chamber of Mines and its members which for many years played an extremely important commercial role in this organization and in the development of Southern Transvaal as a whole. They have laid an extremely important foundation in the form of the development upon which the whole of the industrial upsurge in that large area has been built. I think that we will all agree that because, in the first place, we transferred the control over water consumption to the State about ten years ago by means of our Water Act, the time has now come when an authority which indirectly represents the State and the whole community would take over the functions that have been performed up to the present by what has virtually amounted to group representation through the medium of the old Rand Water Board. Furthermore, we have reached the stage where all the facets of life in our country must be co-ordinated more and more. We must make plans in this connection. It is of course vitally important that in regard to water which is such a decisive factor that can in certain respects make the existence or non-existence of our society possible, there has to be intimate liaison with the State so that in the planning of our future development we will have the closest co-operation between the authorities controlling water supplies and the authorities responsible for other spheres of planning. That is why I believe, as the hon. the Minister has said that the time is now ripe for a reorganization of the Water Board.</p>

<p>There are two specific matters that I want to mention. The first is this: The powers of the Water Board are in certain respects being defined and reassessed in this legislation. I do not know whether I will be within the rules, Mr. Speaker, in putting this one point to the hon. the Minister under the principle of the definition of the powers of the Water Board but doubts have been expressed as to whether the Rand Water Board does indeed have control over the water behind its weir at the. Barrage. With a view on the one hand to the agitation that has been set in motion on the question of the safe use of water by sportsmen, perhaps also from the point of view of the prevention of the contamination of the water, I feel that this is an opportunity when the powers of the Water Board could have been clearly defined in this legislation. Perhaps it is not too late to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he make provision in the Other Place for a clear definition of the powers of the Water Board which will ensure beyond all doubt that it also has control over the surface water at the Barrage, not only for sporting purposes but also as far as the consumption of the water is concerned.</p>

<p>The other matter that I want to raise is in regard to the use of the water of the Rand Water Board by agricultural small-holders. In terms of Clause 30, to which the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) referred, provision is made for the supply of water to new consumers. If the cost of conveying that water to those new consumers is higher than the estimated normal tariff of the Rand Water Board, they may be charged an additional water levy which will make it possible to recover the additional capital expenses within the normal redemption period. This provision is excellent as far as the development of new towns and new extensions is concerned. In <span class="col_1477-1478" refersTo="page_0753"/>these cases we may perhaps find the position that the developer of the township or perhaps the local authority may apply for water to be supplied to a specific area. That township developer will take the necessary steps to pay the extra amount either in cash or otherwise by way of a higher tariff. But it is also important that the water of the Rand Water Board should be made available on a large scale to the existing small-holders in the whole of the Southern Transvaal. I am thinking now more particularly of the Witwatersrand area, which embraces my constituency, but this applies just as much to the Vereeniging/Vanderbijlpark, and even the Pretoria area. The question is simply whether the Peri-Urban Health Board and other authorities will be able to take adequate action in all cases to make use of the facilities set out under Clause 30. We have found in regard to the old existing agricultural small-holdings that only one or two people have wanted the water to be laid on. It would perhaps have been practicable if the whole community could have been brought into the water scheme and if the additional expenses could have been more or less equally apportioned amongst all the small-holdings that could then have been served. But the machinery does not always exist to enable a large number of small-holders to express their common opinion in regard to specific matters. In this connection I want to refer again to the report of the commission investigating small-holdings which was published in 1958 and which perhaps does not always receive the attention that it ought to receive. I want to direct the attention of the hon. the Minister to how important it is that piped water should be supplied to these smallholdings by the Rand Water Board. At the time the commission stated as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission has found new schemes at various places in the Cape and the Transvaal which are served by means of piped water systems. This is undoubtedly the safest water system on which a residential system can be based but the cost factor is decisive in this regard.</block>

<p>Then they referred to the evidence of the Peri-Urban Health Board of the Transvaal and they had this to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission has come to the conclusion that in all cases where small-holdings are situated closely enough to permanent sources such as, for example, a public supply, it is more economic, as compared with boreholes to set up a pipe distribution system.</block>

<p>This is extremely important [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although it appeared initially that the costs of connecting these Rand areas with the supplies of the Rand Water Board would be high, it was found by the commission to be even cheaper than their own borehole system.</block>

<p>The commission went further and analysed practical cases&#x2014;this was in the Pretoria area&#x2014;to ascertain whether this was actually possible. The example used was the farm Kameeldrif, district Pretoria, where a sub-division of the land into small-holdings of 2&#x00BD; morgen each would have made possible the distribution of water from the resources of the Rand Water Board. In pursuance of this example the commission drew the following conclusion (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Health Board has therefore drawn around at the ultimate conclusion that it is indeed practicable to supply certain smallholding schemes with piped water economically. The condition is, however, that the small-holdings must be fairly small and that an adequate source of water supply must be available.</block>

<p>The Rand Water Board is an adequate source of water supply of this nature. We also have the finding of the commission which very pertinently rejects the question of the supply of water to these agricultural smallholdings by way of boreholes. Here is a resume of the report in a scientific bulletin of the Department of Agriculture which has the following to say in connection with those small-holdings&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Obviously we are drawing on a limited supply which has taken centuries to accumulate and which we are consuming at a rate in excess of its replenishment.</block>

<p>And so there appears to be no doubt that it is one of the tasks of the Rand Water Board to supply water to the large number of agricultural small-holdings around Pretoria and on the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>I just want to mention one final aspect in connection with this matter. Not only is the supply of bore-hole water unreliable but we find on the Witwatersrand that because of the run-off of waste water used for industrial purposes, many boreholes on the agricultural small-holdings become polluted because this poisonous industrial waste water seeps into the boreholes. The use of boreholes as a potential source of water is diminishing in many areas and the people there have to look to a public body such as this to supply them with water.</p>

<p>As I said at the start, I believe that this Bill and the provisions of Clause 30 in particular make it more possible and probable that the Rand Water Board will supply these agricultural small-holdings on a larger scale and I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister do his best to have the necessary co-ordinating bodies established or, if necessary, to have the co-ordinating machinery set up at a later stage to enable the agricultural small-holders already there to make use of the facilities set out under Clause 10 as a co-ordinated group because the individual isolated owners will not be able to make use of those facilities.</p>

<from><span class="col_1479-1480" refersTo="page_0754"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>There is not much I can add to what I have already said or which I think I need reply to. I just want to thank the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) for the few valuable ideas he expressed, which I will certainly consider seriously. In regard to his plea that the State should be responsible for the organization of the widespread inhabitants of the platteland in regard to the provision of water, it seems to me that the initiative should really go out from those people themselves and from the plot-owners; in other words, that it should in the first place be the task of the rural inhabitant to ensure that this organization is established to deal with the distribution of its water. Because the Rand Water Board is not a body which distributes water on a small scale. It does not distribute the water in every town. The Rand Water Board distributes the water amongst the large consumers which then, in turn, supply it to the public in smaller quantities.</p>

<p>I may then just repeat that I am particularly appreciative of all that the Rand Water Board has done over all these years, and especially its founders, the municipalities and the Chamber of Mines, not only for the large role they have played in the establishment of this important body which has also played such an important role in the development of the Rand, but also for the fair and reasonable manner in which over all these years they have exercised their powers to ensure that the water has been fairly distributed, and for their always having divided the costs among the consumers in such a fair manner.</p>

<p>Sixth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Bantu Special Education Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Before dealing with the most important principles contained in this Bill, I just want to deal briefly with the background and the history of special education in so far as it affects the Bantu, and to indicate the reasons why it is now necessary to introduce this Bill.</p>

<p>With the passing of the Bantu Education Act, 1953, all education for the Bantu, except higher education, was transferred to the Department of Bantu Education (formerly Native Affairs). The definition of &#x201C;higher education&#x201D; <i>inter alia</i>, included also special education and consequently that education was not included when Bantu education was transferred at that time. Special education for all racial groups at that time fell under the Department of Education. Arts and Science, whilst the various provinces made provision for certain definite groups of handicapped children.</p>

<p>Special education was administered in terms of the Special Education Act, 1948 (Act No. 9 of 1948), and the Department of Education, Arts and Science was mainly responsible for the education of the following categories of handicapped children&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) deaf children,</li>

<li>(b) blind children,</li>

<li>(c) epileptic children, and</li>

<li>(d) any group of handicapped children for which the Provincial Administration concerned could not make provision (the definition of &#x201C;handicapped child&#x201D; also includes physically handicapped, mentally handicapped and deviate children).</li>

</ol>

<p>As the result of this arrangement we find that the position developed in such a way that the Department of Education, Arts and Science provided for the education of deaf, blind, epileptic and physically handicapped children, whereas the provinces concentrated on the education of mentally handicapped children and the less serious cases of deviate children.</p>

<p>Because the Bantu Education Act took away from the various provinces all control over the education of the Bantu in those provinces, it therefore followed that my Department also had to take over that portion of special education which rested with the provinces, or in other words, the education of the mentally handicapped and deviate Bantu children.</p>

<p>In regard to the education and rehabilitation of deviate Bantu children, the various provinces did not concern themselves with the matter because the implementation of the provisions of the Children&#x2019;s Act in so far as the Bantu are affected was entrusted to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, and therefore that Department had to provide for it.</p>

<p>Before the taking over of Bantu education by the State, the provinces, however, had not made any provision for mentally handicapped Bantu children, but confined themselves simply to the provision of the necessary school facilities for Whites. Soon after the transfer my Department started working in that direction. A Psychological Services Section was instituted, and as the result of that a start could be made with the institution of special classes for mentally handicapped students at ordinary Bantu schools.</p>

<p>We therefore find that the position in regard to the special education of the Bantu just after the coming into operation of the Bantu Education Act was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The education of deaf, blind, epileptic and physically handicapped children fell under the Department of Education, Arts and <span class="col_1481-1482" refersTo="page_0755"/>Science in terms of the Special Education Act;</li>

<li>(b) in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act, deviate children fell under the Department of Bantu Administration and Development; and</li>

<li>(c) the provision of education for mentally handicapped children fell under the Department of Bantu Education in terms of the Bantu Education Act.</li>

</ol>

<p>The position, however, was later changed again. In 1960 the Special Education Act was amended in such a way that the State President could by proclamation entrust the implementation of the provisions of this Act to any Minister, or to one Minister in regard to certain matters or particular races, and to another Minister in regard to other matters or races.</p>

<p>By Proclamation No. R. 23 of 13 January 1961 the implementation of the provisions of the Special Education Act, in so far as the Bantu are concerned, was entrusted to me with a few exceptions. This proclamation therefore had the effect that the provisions of the Act, in so far as they related to special schools for Bantu children, were implemented by me as Minister of Bantu Education from 1 January 1961 and that the special Bantu schools which already existed at that date were taken away from the Department of Education, Arts and Science as from 1 March 1961. That is how it came about that the Department of Bantu Education has been in the position for the past three years of partially administering the existing Special Education Act and gaining experience in regard to this type of education.</p>

<p>However, it soon became apparent that the Act does not comply in every respect with the requirements of Bantu education. Not only does it contain a whole number of provisions which are really dead provisions in so far as Bantu education is concerned, because in practice they cannot be applied, but it also contains provisions which are in conflict with certain accepted principles and policy in Bantu education. Furthermore, there are also defects which hamper the uniform administration of Bantu education as a whole. Later, when I explain certain principles in the Bill, I will go into these various aspects more thoroughly.</p>

<p>I now want to pass on to deal with the Bill itself. At this stage, however, I just want to confine myself to the most important clauses and principles contained in it. Before I go further, however, I should like to give hon. members opposite the assurance and to emphasize that this legislation is not something completely new and that it does not contain provisions which are aimed at disrupting the whole organization of special education for the Bantu as it exists at present and the basis on which it is administered in order to introduce a new and strange pattern. That is not the case at all, on the contrary, the broad principles contained in the existing Act have been re-embodied in this Bill. Certain necessary amendments and additions had to be made so as to comply with the requirements of Bantu education and to bring it more into line with the general pattern of Bantu education. In addition, existing provisions such as those which deal with the powers of the provinces and which do not relate to special Bantu schools as such, as well as certain provisions which at this stage cannot be applied to the Bantu, e.g. compulsory school attendance and the certification of deviate children by a competent official, have of course also been omitted for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, I want to draw attention to the definition of &#x201C;handicapped child&#x201D; as contained in Clause 1. i.e. those children affected by this Bill. Hon. members will note that in the definition, provision is made for special education for deaf, blind, epileptic and physically handicapped children, but not for mentally handicapped or deviate children, as is the case in the existing Act. As I have already indicated, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development caters for the deviate cases in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act. That Department is to a large extent equipped to meet these needs, and we have decided that this arrangement should continue. Not only does it prevent disjointed assistance being given by the two Departments, but it also has the advantage that the problem of rehabilitation, care, training and employment of deviates will as a whole be catered for by one controlling Department. For mentally handicapped children provision is made, as I have already said, in terms of the Bantu Education Act. Therefore, making provision in this Bill also for these two categories of deviate children would amount to duplication.</p>

<p>The second point I want to mention is the type of school which can be established or approved of in terms of this Bill. As in the past, there will be three types of schools, viz. State schools, State-supported schools and private schools. State schools are those schools established by the Department itself and wholly maintained from State funds. State-supported schools are schools the establishment of which has been approved of and which receive a subsidy and/or loans from the Department, while private schools are those schools the establishment of which has been approved of, but which do not yet receive a subsidy and have to function at their own expense. Perhaps I may just mention for the information of hon. members that on 1 March 1961 my Department took over four State-supported schools and that there are at the moment ten subsidized special schools.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we now make provision for the control and management of special schools to be handed over to Bantu authorities or other Bantu bodies. The Bantu, however, are at this stage not able yet to control institutions of this nature on their own, and therefore it is obvious that active White guidance is still essential in the meantime. It would, however, <span class="col_1483-1484" refersTo="page_0756"/>be unwise not to work in that direction at this stage. The deviate Bantu child is in the first place a member of the Bantu community and his education must be planned to prepare him as far as possible to be a member of his own community. That can only be done if the policy applied fits into the broad framework of Government policy which was evolved for Bantu education. The Bantu community will be assisted and encouraged increasingly to play a greater role in this type of education until eventually they will also bear the same responsibility for this as they do for ordinary education. I want to emphasize here that it is not the intention to apply this principle over-hastily. I am of the opinion, and so is the Government, that here we have another sphere where the churches in particular can do good work, as they have already done in the past. There is not the slightest intention of eliminating them in regard to this work. This is only an enabling provision to enable us to transfer schools of this nature to the Bantu when the time arrives and when the Bantu insist on the transfer of schools of this nature.</p>

<p>In the existing Act provision is made for the certification of deviate children by a competent official and for their compulsory attendance at special schools. In view of the fact that there is not yet compulsory school attendance for normal Bantu children, it is simply provided in the Bill that the admission of students to special schools is subject to the approval of the Secretary; in other words, the admission of students will take place on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by briefly dealing with a few clauses in the Bill, viz. Clauses 23, 24 and 26, which do not really have anything to do with special education as such, but which amend certain other Acts. Clause 23 amends the Bantu Education Act, while Clause 26 amends the Vocational Education Act. The reasons for these two amendments are the same, and therefore I will deal with them both together.</p>

<p>Before the Central Government took over Bantu education, the various provinces established, controlled and maintained various institutions where vocational education (as defined in Section 1 of the Vocational Education Act, 1955) was offered exclusively to Bantu persons, and with the taking over of Bantu education in terms of the Bantu Education Act, 1953, these vocational schools were also taken over by the Department of Bantu Education.</p>

<p>Section 1 of the Bantu Education Act defines education as &#x201C;education other than higher education&#x201D; in terms of the provisions of Section 17 of the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, 1945 (Act No. 38 of 1945). Higher education in terms of the provisions of the aforementioned Section 17 is, in terms of Section 84 (1) (c) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act, 1961, not education in regard to which a province can pass ordinances. Vocational education is not expressly mentioned in Section 17 and vocational education for the Bantu was not declared to be higher education in terms of Section 17 either. Consequently until the passing of the Bantu Education Act the provinces had the right to establish and maintain institutions where vocational education was offered exclusively to Bantu persons. Section 2 of the Bantu Education Act therefore also transferred the control of vocational education for the Bantu to the Central Government (in this case the Department of Bantu Education).</p>

<p>Section 17 of Act 38 of 1945 was later replaced by Section 34 of the Vocational Education Act of 1955, and in terms of the new Section 17 vocational education, generally speaking, is now also &#x201C;higher education&#x201D;. Because the Bantu Education Act did not transfer the control of any &#x201C;higher education&#x201D; to the Central Government, the question arose as to whether the Department of Bantu Education could still exercise control over vocational education for the Bantu in terms of the last-mentioned Act. If it is accepted that this is not the case, but that control over vocational education since the replacement of Section 17 must be controlled in terms of the Vocational Education Act, 1955, it would amount to all vocational schools for Bantu persons having to be transferred to the Department of Education, Arts and Science, because that Department was solely responsible for the administration of the Vocational Education Act. In the last-mentioned Act, however, there is no provision in respect of existing schools or vocational education for the Bantu, which are controlled in terms of the Bantu Education Act, and in respect of the staff employed at such schools. It is therefore improbable that it was ever intended to have such a state of affairs, and consequently it must be accepted that vocational education for the Bantu must still be arranged in terms of the Bantu Education Act.</p>

<p>The Vocational Education Act was amended in 1958 (Section 7 of Act 25 of 1958) in order to provide that the State President could by proclamation entrust the administration to the provisions of that Act to more than one Minister. Proclamation No. R.91 of 1961 was issued thereafter, in terms of which certain powers in connection with vocational education for the Bantu was entrusted to me as Minister of Bantu Education as from 1 April 1961.</p>

<p>However, the powers granted to me in terms of Proclamation No. R.91 were never used because the institutions and schools where vocational education was exclusively given to the Bantu were, since the transfer in January 1954, controlled by the Bantu Education Act, and were already linked up with the general pattern of Bantu education.</p>

<p>In order to obviate confusion, particularly when considering the steps already taken in terms of the Vocational Education Act, the amendments contained in Clauses 23 and 26 are envisaged.</p>

<p>The object of Clause 24 is to exempt from registration in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation <span class="col_1485-1486" refersTo="page_0757"/>Act, 1941, Bantu school boards and managers of Bantu schools who in terms of Section 10<i>bis</i> of the Bantu Education Act operate as employers in Bantu education. In terms of the provisions of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, the almost 4,000 school boards and managers of schools who employ approximately 25,000 teachers are compelled to register themselves as employers with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner, and to submit annual wage returns and to pay the amounts levied.</p>

<p>In the case of an employer who is not exempted from the payment of levies to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund, the Fund is responsible for any indemnification and medical expenses due to an injured workman, whether or not the employer concerned is registered with the fund and has paid the contributions. The costs of a compensatable injury can amount to thousands of rands, and where an employer has neglected to register and/or to pay the contributions, the Commissioner can impose a fine equal to the costs of the accident. The Commissioner is of the opinion that it will be almost an impossible task to get this large number of school boards and managers of schools to register and to submit annual wage returns and to pay the levies imposed.</p>

<p>The levies payable by school boards and managers, and which also qualify for purposes of subsidy, amount to approximately R25,000 per annum. If the teachers concerned can, for purposes of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, be regarded as employees of the Government, registration is not necessary, because the Government is exempted from the payment of levies to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner. In such a case the Government (in this case the Department of Bantu Education) must accept sole responsibility for any compensatable accident.</p>

<p>The Treasury and the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner are in favour of such an arrangement, and it is also more advantageous and more economic for the State and for my Department to pay the annual levies amounting to R25,000 to the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund by way of subsidy.</p>

<p>The first compensatable accident occurred in the beginning of April 1962 and therefore the clause concerned is made retrospective from 1 April 1962.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill is a corollary of the Bantu Education Act of 11 years ago, and as the hon. the Minister has explained in his historical survey, it has taken 11 years for us to reach this stage. There is a very good reason for it, namely, that the work in these special schools is of a very specialized nature. It is unlike the work in the ordinary primary schools or in secondary education. We have to have people who are devoted and who have been specially trained for this work. We had the example of our White schools, and now of our Coloured schools, and it is very difficult to say, when we discuss these special schools, whether the work should come under the Minister of Bantu Education or the Minister of Social Welfare. Hon. members will remember that when a similar Bill was introduced for Coloured education it came under the Department of Social Welfare; it comes between the two. Therefore I think it is always advisable in any country to entrust this work as far as possible to religious bodies, to people who are devoted to the work. I do not think it is possible in the ordinary way for a Government Department to train teachers in this work. More important than the actual training is their devotion to their task. We speak of education as not being a job or even a profession, but as a vocation, as a calling. Any teacher who undertakes this work, or the religious bodies that organize this work, do it because they have a calling. It is a religious calling.</p>

<p>Now I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the religious bodies who are at present doing this work in South Africa have been consulted in the drafting of this Bill and whether they are satisfied with the contents of the Bill. I think it is important to consider them. I know the Government subsidizes these bodies.</p>

<p>So much for the general approach to the Bill, but I should like to ask the hon. the Minister one or two questions simply to gain clarity. Firstly, financially, will the funds for these schools come out of the Bantu Education Fund?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased also to see in the Bill that provision is made for subsidizing those schools conducted by religious bodies. I have just a few words to say about two clauses. One is Clause 12, and I make an appeal under Clause 12, as I did when a similar Bill was introduced some time ago.</p>

<p>In Clause 12 we say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The parent of any child admitted to a special Government Bantu school shall in respect of special education provided for that child pay such fees as may be required by the secretary in accordance with the tariffs determined from time to time by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance.</block>

<p>I should like to make this appeal, that we do not impose any tuition fees. This is charitable work and I think it is our duty to see that the education of these children should be free. I urged in a similar case when a matter of this <span class="col_1487-1488" refersTo="page_0758"/>kind was discussed, that if it is necessary to transport these children to school from their homes, we should do that too. We know how in a family where there are four or five strong and healthy children, and one child who has to go to these special schools, that that child is of more concern to the mother than all the other children together. I think we should meet these people and not speak about fees. We should not ask the parents to pay any fees; it should be free. I am not speaking of boarding fees but tuition fees. That is the appeal I make to the House, that we should provide this education free, and that any necessary apparatus should also be provided free. We are dealing with blind, deaf and epileptic children. [Interjection.] I am speaking of Clause 12 (1) (a) and not (b).</p>

<p>Then there is one other clause I should like to pass a few remarks about, Clause 19, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The conditions of service, leave and other privileges &#x2026; of any State-aided special Bantu school shall be as prescribed &#x2026;</block>

<p>I do not think the Minister should take up a very strong attitude in prescribing what the qualifications should be in the State-aided schools. I can understand this in his own Bantu schools, but not in the State-aided schools. There are other details in regard to certain clauses of the Bill which I will not discuss now. My colleagues will discuss them in Committee. We are all anxious to have a good Bill. It is church work, religious work, and we all have these children in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the Bantu Education Act was before this House, we had; tremendous opposition from the opposite side of the House, but tonight we find them adopting a very sympathetic attitude and that they have hardly any fault to find with this Bill. The few little matters mentioned here by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) are matters to which we can devote attention in the Committee Stage. The step which the Government is now taking is a very great step forward. We are reaching a very important milestone here, because although the Minister said in his introductory speech that this Bill really contains nothing which in any important way curtails the existing law, he still gave an indication of how necessary it is for this legislation to be passed. Therefore we can say that this Bill is being welcomed, as the hon. the Minister explained to us and as the hon. member for Kensington also said, because in the first place it is nothing more than a logical consequence of the process of development of Bantu education. It follows logically on the previous legislation already adopted. But we further welcome this Bill because it is one which the Minister is introducing after mature consideration. We heard from him very clearly that for the last three years, since the administration of Bantu education was entrusted to him by way of proclamation, he and his Department have had the opportunity of acquiring a sound knowledge of Bantu education, and this Bill we have before us to-day is the fruit of that.</p>

<p>The existing Act did not cater in all respects for the requirements of Bantu education. In fact, this Bill means that all dead provisions which have no relation to Bantu education are being removed from the existing Act, and that anomalies are being removed; anything which is in conflict with certain accepted principles in Bantu education is being removed from the existing Act. Furthermore, defects which hampered the uniform administration of Bantu education as a whole are being removed from the existing Act. It is for those reasons that this legislation is essential. We must remember, as the hon. the Minister told us, that the Department of Education, Arts and Science will probably introduce legislation next year, or the following year, to consolidate all their education Acts, but it will chiefly concern the Whites, and therefore it is essential that there should be a separate Act dealing with Bantu education. I say that this Bill is very important. If we look at the underlying principles of the Bill, we find that the physically handicapped Bantu child is now being given proper consideration. In the past that never happened; it began three years ago, and now it is taking place to an increasing extent. The Bantu, just like any other people, also have their deviate group, and in the definition a handicapped child is described as one who suffers from blindness, deafness or epilepsy or from some or other physical defect. In every population group&#x2014;and therefore also in the Bantu group&#x2014;there is a certain percentage of children who are handicapped. It is a pity that we have no statistics to indicate precisely what the percentage is, but it must be fairly high. I speak subject to correction, but I think that in those schools approximately 800 of those children are already being catered for, in schools already administered by the Department. Those handicapped children must receive special education. They derive no benefit from ordinary education. The definition describes a &#x201C;handicapped child&#x201D; as one who deviates to such an extent from the majority of children that he&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) cannot derive sufficient benefit from the instruction normally provided in the ordinary course of education, or</li>

<li>(b) requires special education to facilitate his adaptation to the community; or</li>

<li>(c) should not attend an ordinary class in an ordinary school because such attendance may be harmful to himself or to other pupils in that class or school.</li>

</ol>

<p>Therefore we can understand the need for special schools for these unfortunate children, and the task of those schools should be to help that child, despite his limitations, to develop to the fullest possible extent so that he can be <span class="col_1489-1490" refersTo="page_0759"/>of the maximum use to himself and to the community in spite of his handicap. That is a task which can only be tackled by specialized teachers, and therefore we say that this Bill is a very important milestone in education. This measure makes is possible for such schools to be administered properly and for the needs of these children to be provided for.</p>

<p>But a further very important principle we find in this legislation is that it recognizes that the Bantu has his own characteristic approach to problems. The hon. the Minister told us in his introductory speech that since the Bantu Education Act was passed a special psychological section was established to do research and to investigate the manner in which the Bantu child approaches his problems. As the result of the work of this section, extremely important psychological data have become available. We have known for a long time that no psychological test which has been standardised for the White child can be applied to the Bantu child in the hope that it will yield good results, because that test does not take into consideration the peculiar approach to a problem which is typical of the Bantu. We now find that as the result of psychological research, as the result of what has been achieved by this psychological section, we are better able to understand the psychology of the Bantu child and we know more about how that child can be helped. We know that when one deals with children who are physically handicapped, the blind, the deaf and the epileptic, one finds certain deviations of personality which must necessarily result from those handicaps. We know how to teach the White child to cope with those deviations which result from that physical defect. But we base our hopes on that psychological section which is already in operation in Bantu education to advise us how to help the Bantu child so that he will also be able in a worthy way, to surmount his particular psychological deviation resulting from his physical deviation and so that he can become a much better citizen of the State, and also of the Bantu State.</p>

<p>Another very important principle in this Bill is also that the Bantu parent will play a much greater role in this splendid educational project. We find that in two places. We find it, e.g., in Clause 13, where there are advisory committees which are constituted in such a way that under the guidance of expert Whites the Bantu will be trained to an increasing extent to administer those special schools. In Clause 8 provision is made for management boards and for eventual full control by the Bantu. In other words, this Bill opens the way for the Bantu community, when eventually it becomes mature enough to take over this special education, to learn how to manage those schools so that the unfortunate Bantu child will reap the maximum benefit.</p>

<p>There is a further very important principle, namely that the initiative of organizations, religious societies, etc., to which the hon. member for Kensington referred, is not being curtailed. The Bantu are given a chance to fulfil themselves in regard to their religious and other organizations. Sir, it will be a sorry day if eventually we leave all education in the hands of the State alone. I think many of the most splendid ideas and new projects which arose came about as the result of private initiative. When one thinks, for example, of what is being done for deaf White children in this country by the undertaking at Worcester which was established by a church, or of what is being done for epileptic children at Kuils River, again a project which originated from a church, one finds, as far as methods of education and such things are concerned, that one makes much more progress if one does not restrict private initiative. That is just what this Bill seeks to avoid. We are told that it applies not only to State schools, but also State-supported schools and special schools. For the last three years the Minister has made use of them. He did not restrict them. Therefore we need not fear that he will try to suppress them in any way. It opens the way, when eventually we have an exclusively Bantu community under exclusively Bantu management, to stimulating private initiative there, too, so that they can continue to do pioneering work in all these different directions.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, Sir, we feel that this Bill makes a very important contribution. Moreover, Clause 12 is absolutely essential to make the Bantu parent feel that he also has a duty towards his child. If the Bantu parent, just like the White parent, feels that he wants to make a contribution towards the education of his child and the development of that child, he is given the opportunity to do so. Clause 12 (2), however, provides that where the parent cannot do so the Minister may exempt him from that obligation. Therefore we say that this is a laudable piece of legislation. I think that everyone who has the welfare of the Bantu child at heart and who has a feeling of pity for the physically handicapped Bantu child will be glad of this forward step. We give this Bill our blessing.</p>

<p>It appears to me as though the Opposition are not taking very much interest in this debate and that is why I want to say a few words on their behalf. I only have a few minutes at my disposal so I want to be brief. I just want to refer to the wonderful progress that has been made since the Department of Bantu Education took over Bantu education. I do not know whether it is generally known but in 1961, when the Department of Bantu Education took over, there were only four institutions of this nature, State-aided institutions, with an enrolment of about 300 pupils who were mostly blind and deaf pupils. That is the sum total of the institutions that came into being from 1928 to 1961&#x2014;four schools in 33 years. Since 1961, six schools have been added to this number so that to-day we have 10 schools with a total enrolment of 837. Two of these schools will now probably be taken over by the Transkeian <span class="col_1491-1492" refersTo="page_0760"/>Government. We will then have eight schools with about 600 pupils, most of whom will be deaf and blind. This progress has been made chiefly as a result of the interest shown by the D.R. Church in this matter. I want to say here that of these 10 schools, six are D.R. Church schools and four are Roman Catholic schools. The hon. the Minister had a tremendous task in that he had to make provision for the Bantu child from the kindergarten up to the university stage; he had to make provision for the children of 10,000,000 people within the borders of the Republic and increasing and serious attention also had to be given to vocational training. We could not have resented the fact if the hon. the Minister had been inclined to neglect this sort of education to a certain extent. But on the contrary, great progress has been made. I just want to tell hon. members that under the guidance of the D.R. Church and in the light of the success that has been achieved with the deaf and the blind at Worcester, we can be almost sure that the Bantu will be given every chance and that a considerable degree of success will be achieved there. I want to point out further that the percentage of literate Bantu is to-day between 45 per cent and 50 per cent. There are 1,750,000 children at school, nearly 15 per cent of the population, and the hon. the Minister is slowly but surely moving towards his goal of having 20 percent of the whole population at school. The fact that in those circumstances he can still find time to devote to these unfortunate children is an act of love, mercy and humanity.</p>
