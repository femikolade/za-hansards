<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to reply to what was said by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) in connection with the report of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Commissioner. He referred to paragraph 3 of the report and said that as at 30 September 1963, there were 1,609 persons to whom lump sum benefits had been paid but who were not drawing pensions, and that as at 31 October 1963, 1,264 of these persons had been reexamined and granted pensions. He then asked the hon. the Minister to see to it that pensions were also paid to the remaining 345 persons who were not drawing pensions. I do not object to the granting of pensions to people who are entitled to them but I do not think the hon. member interpreted the position correctly. The fact of the matter is that under all our previous laws&#x2014;and that is still the position&#x2014;these persons had to apply for an examination in order to become entitled to benefits. In this case it simply means that as at 31 October these 345 persons had not yet been examined and still had to come up for examination. We must bear in mind the fact that at that date some of them may no longer have been employed on the mines. It is also quite probable that these persons have been examined since 31 October last and that they are now drawing the pensions to which they are entitled.</p>

<p>The hon. member also pointed out that apart from these 1,264 persons who were regraded, a further 859 were certified for the first time and he asked what this meant. He then tried to suggest that there was something radically wrong somewhere; that there had been great laxity, that a shocking state of affairs prevailed with the result that mineworkers who should have been certified in the past have only now been certified. But what is the actual position? It is true that 859 new cases were certified. This can only mean two things. On the one hand it means that we are having the same experience that we have had in the past whenever a new law has been passed in this connection. Every time a new law is passed there is a sudden flood of applications from persons who wish to be recertified. That is also what happened in this case. There was a sudden flood of applications from people who wanted to be reclassified and that is the reason why more people were examined and why more cases came to light. If the hon. member had only looked at page 9 of the report he would have found that there was also a sudden increase of 556 new cases in 1957, just after the passing of the 1956 Act, whereas the following year this figure dropped to 285. That is one reason for this increase in the number of cases. But there is also another reason and I want to say that in spite of all the criticism, in spite of all the suspicion that has been sown, these figures prove that under the new law, because of the improved methods of examination, because of the improved standard <span class="col_6281-6282" refersTo="page_474"/>of certification, more cases are being detected, cases which would otherwise not have been detected at all. That is the reason why more cases are being certified. The hon. member knows very well that too much reliance was placed in the past on X-ray findings. I am sure he will agree with me that it often happened that an X-ray proved negative, or was very doubtful, and because no unmistakable signs of pneumoconiosis showed on the X-ray plate, those persons could not be certified as suffering from pneumoconiosis. But in terms of the 1962 Act, if there is any doubt in regard to the X-ray, or if a lung function test indicates that a person&#x2019;s respiration is 20 per cent impaired, that person is certified. Such a person would not have been certified in the past. I say that that is one of the reasons why more cases have been detected and it is not only I who hold this opinion. I want to refer to the report of the Chairman of the Chamber of Mines for 1963. Mr. Anderson had the following to say in connection with the question of certification (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The basis on which benefits are paid to pneumoconiosis sufferers has been changed radically. Since that time there has been a disturbing increase in the certification figure. Employers cannot help viewing the basis upon which compensation is paid with great concern.</block>

<p>In other words, he supports my contention that the improved methods and the improved standard of certification have benefited the mineworkers in that they are now certified much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. Mr. Anderson also refers to the pneumoconiosis certification standards. I do not want to quote the whole passage; I just want to point out that these are the standards laid down in the Act. He says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unmistakable radiological signs of pneumoconiosis are not a requirement for certification.</block>

<p>What does this mean? It simply means that if an X-ray plate is taken of a person&#x2019;s lungs and there is a doubt as to the presence of pneumoconiosis, it does not necessarily follow that that person will be excluded. If his lung function tests indicate that his breathing is impaired by more than 20 per cent, he is still certified. The other instruction is as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unmistakable radiological signs of pneumoconiosis must be accepted as evidence of pneumoconiosis which has impaired the cardio-respiratory functions by at least 20 per cent.</block>

<p>This means that if a person&#x2019;s X-ray plate shows the unmistakable presence of pneumoconiosis but his lung function test does not indicate a disablement of more than 20 per cent, the doctor cannot disqualify him. That person must then be regarded as 20 per cent disabled. It is as a result of this improved classification and better examinations that the number of certified cases has increased.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with this aspect of the matter I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to have more clarity in connection with cases which are only discovered after death. In other words, if a post mortem examination reveals that a person suffered from pneumoconiosis, is it not possible to lay down specifically that that person must then be regarded as having had a more than 20 per cent disablement during his lifetime so that his dependants can draw the appropriate benefits? There are some people who believe that that is in fact the position but there apppears to be some doubt in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville also referred to the increase in the number of tuberculotics. He said that this increase was disturbing and he suggested that all persons should be tested by means of a skin test or otherwise if they work underground on the mines. I agree with him that we must be extremely careful as far as cases of tuberculosis are concerned. I have stated previously and I want to repeat that the conditions under which a mineworker has to work in the mines form a fertile breeding-ground for tuberculosis. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I want to ask the Minister a few things, due to the lack of information we have as to what is happening in the asbestos mines and the asbestos mills generally. The asbestos silica is the most potent for producing pneumoconiosis; it produces it in the shortest period. Whereas in the gold mines the average working life of a miner is 20 years, or was the last time we had a report, the average working life of an asbestos miner or worker is between six and seven years. In the last report of the Mines Department there has been no further indication as to what is being done. In the ordinary way pneumoconiosis is a world-wide disease produced by numerous types of agents, but we in this country have the asbestos mines. Only we and Canada produce asbestos, and therefore the problem is one which we have to settle ourselves. We cannot very well look to other countries for assistance in solving this problem, and this problem is aggravated by the fact that you cannot use water in the mine. You cannot handle asbestos in a wet state, so that the problems multiply. But surely there must be some research going on to try to overcome this problem, because if it cannot be overcome, and unless we can prolong the lives of the workers in the asbestos mines, I am sure that the country as a whole will be faced with the problem of abandoning the working of asbestos at all. We cannot have an industry in which the life of the working man is reduced to about seven years. I do not think any civilized country would tolerate such a state of affairs. Therefore I should like to know what is being done, and whether the <span class="col_6283-6284" refersTo="page_475"/>Minister is insisting on such safety measures as are available. I understand that a great part of the risk is in the actual mills. I am told that by the Minister&#x2019;s Department. If that is so, is the Minister insisting that every new idea or new mechanism which can be applied to the mills so that the fibre is sealed away as much as possible is being applied? Other things that can be done is to insist on the men wearing masks. But here it is not a question of air being forced underground, or of grilles which can be wetted, but the problem lies in the crushing in the mills. I understand further that there is at least one mill, newly constructed, which is almost hermetically sealed, and it is hoped by this means to avoid the high incidence of asbestosis among these people. If that is so, I think nothing can excuse the Minister from insisting on the immediate application of this principle to all other mills. We cannot tolerate this terrible disease afflicting these men at this rate.</p>

<p>Another point is that we are completely in the dark as to what is happening in regard to mesothelioma, the cancer produced by asbestos. We had information some three years ago from a certain doctor, and I have since heard that Dr. Webster is doing research on it, but we have no information. Unfortunately the health statistics do not give us separate tables for the various types of cancer, so that this particular type of cancer can be put in a separate category. This is a matter which I will take up with the Minister of Health, to see whether it is possible to do so. But the fact remains that we are in complete ignorance as to what is happening, and I think it is something which should not be kept from this House. This House ought to know what risks the asbestos miner is running of acquiring asbestosis, which is silicosis in its worst type, and we should also know what is the incidence of the cancer caused by this dust.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) and other speakers raised the old but very important subject here yesterday of the desirability and the urgent necessity of extending the lives of our gold mines and they suggested that as much gold-bearing ore as possible should be extracted from those mines. In that regard I should like to support the remarks made here by those members. There are some people who only look for the rich gold reefs; they are only interested in picking the eyes of the mine. In the main those people think only of their own financial gain. That attitude is not in the interests of South Africa or in the interests of the mining industry. That is why, having regard to the enormous costs involved in bringing mines to the production stage, a very urgent appeal should be made at the highest level that mines should be operated until they are worked out, until all the ore has been brought to the surface and until every ounce of gold has been extracted.</p>

<p>On this occasion I want to pay tribute to the late Mr. Willem Boshoff, an Afrikaner, for everything he did in this sphere. I want to pay tribute to the Boshoff mining group for the work which they have done in the past and which they are still doing in extracting the less payable low-grade ore and in recovering that gold for South Africa. This group is not mining gold simply for its own benefit; in many respects it is rendering a very great service to the country. I want to mention one example. When we talk about extending the life of a gold mine I want to mention the case of the Stanhope mine which originally, in the nineties, belonged to a Mr. Geldenhuys. This mine was originally called the Geldenhuys Deep and it was taken over at a later stage by Rand Mines. The Boshoff group purchased this mine from Rand Mines in 1949 and has been working that mine ever since. When the Boshoff group took over the Stanhope shaft all the equipment had been dismantled but within three months the group had completely re-equipped that mine and it was ready to start production. It is estimated that that mine will continue to produce gold for the next seven years. Let me say just as a matter of interest that that mine has already produced gold to the value of R2,035,000,000. This is a mine which was abandoned by its previous owners. Here we have a striking example of the way in which gold can still be recovered from the less payable ore and how the life of a mine can be extended. Then there are also the Wilfred, Princess and Roodepoort shafts. It is anticipated that these mines will continue to produce for the next 15 years. These are all mines which have been taken over by the Boshoff group. That is why I say that I think we must pay tribute to the late Mr. Boshoff and his group for the work they have done. I take the liberty of recommending to any person who is interested in this subject that he read the interesting work by Mr. Piet Mering which was published recently entitled &#x201C;Goud vir die Soeker&#x201D;.</p>

<p>There is another matter that I want to touch upon and that is in connection with the evil of employing foreign Bantu labour in our gold and affiliated mines. The State has been taken to task in many debates in this House because of the increase in the number of foreign Bantu in the Republic. This thing is assuming alarming proportions. I exclude the Shangaans from the Portuguese territories because we have a permanent agreement with those territories but it is disturbing to see the increase in the numbers of foreign Bantu in this country. We know that the State has practically no control over the recruiting organizations which recruit foreign Bantu for work in the mines. I want to say that these foreign Bantu are responsible to a large extent for the growth of the Bantu population in the Republic. I do not want to discuss this matter but it does create social and political problems the ramifications of which one can hardly assess. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister and also to the Chamber of Mines to see to it that the organizations which recruit Bantu labour for the mines concentrate <span class="col_6285-6286" refersTo="page_476"/>to a greater extent upon the Ciskei and other areas in the Republic. I want to tell the House what the position was as at 30 June 1961. Out of a total of 426,325 Bantu employed in the affiliated mines, 393,100 were employed in the gold mines and 33,225 in the coal mines. Of these recruited labourers, 233,972 were employed in the gold mines of the Witwatersrand and 100,273 on the goldfields of the O.F.S. Out of this total of 426,325 Bantu, 263,972 or 61.9 per cent were foreign Bantu. There were 162,534 indigenous Bantu or 38.1 per cent. This labour was recruited as follows: 22.7 per cent in Mo&#x00E7;ambique, 12.6 per cent in Basutoland, 11.6 per cent in other Africa territories, 9.1 per cent in the Federation, 4.1 per cent in Bechuanaland and 1.8 per cent in Swaziland. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that in one year, 1961, these foreign Bantu took R16,100,000 out of our country. Over a period of ten years, therefore, an amount of R160,000,000 has been taken out of the country by these foreign Bantu, although there is unemployment amongst our own Bantu in the Ciskei and the Transkei. I want to ask that we encourage our indigenous Bantu in the Republic to seek employment in the mines and that we recruit less labour in those countries to the north of us which are so hostile to the Republic of South Africa. I make this plea also because I do not want our gold mines to build their economy and future on a foreign Bantu labour force. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to follow up what has been said by my hon. colleague. I can only say that he mentioned some very interesting figures and I congratulate him because they were most enlightening.</p>

<p>The matter that I want to discuss amounts to a request to the hon. the Minister. Nearly all our newspapers have carried reports recently dealing with the question of prospecting for oil in this country and in every report reference has been made to the interest which the Government itself has in these prospecting operations. Let me tell the hon. the Minister that in this respect the newspapers are giving the country very good news indeed. It is not necessary for me to comment on the necessity of having our own oil supplies in this country. I just want to mention in passing that I think it would be unwise for us to say too much in this House about the importance of oil in view of the fact that beyond our borders we face a hostile world. We know what a mighty weapon this could be in their hands. We do not know whether they will make use of it but we do know how disastrous it would be for our country if they did. It is gratifying therefore to hear that the Government itself is intensely interested in the question of prospecting for oil. We read that geologists and geophysicists from all parts of the world will be called upon to advise these prospecting companies. That is very gratifying news. I just want to add, in case I may be asked how much money this is going to cost, that in my opinion no sum of money would be too great to spend on efforts to discover oil in this country. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to be so good as to tell us something about the possibilities in this regard.</p>

<p>Then I want to say a few words in regard to another matter and that is the question of alluvial diggers&#x2019; certificates. The hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister are well acquainted with the position. They have received numerous deputations in this regard. I myself have accompanied six deputations to Ministers, including Dr. van Rhijn and all his successors, and the point at issue has always been the question of a Union certificate. As the position is at present, there is a provincial certificate. The Cape diggers cannot dig in the Transvaal and vice versa. I feel that we are playing the diggers in the two provinces off against one another. There is a great deal of friction between these two camps, the Cape and the Transvaal, and I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to give this matter his careful consideration. We know that there are two opposing camps but I still believe that if the hon. the Minister will use his influence the Transvaal diggers&#x2019; committees and the Cape committees can be persuaded to discuss this difference of opinion in a sensible way with a view to repealing the provincial ordinances. I also believe that we are restricting the rights of these people as citizens of the country. A Cape digger cannot dig in the Transvaal, and vice versa. This is a restriction upon the freedom of these people. I think they ought to have the right, as they used to have in the pioneer days, to take out a licence in any province they like; that is not the case at present. I make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister in this regard because I think the time has come for us to settle this whole matter. We as the representatives of these people have had to complain to the Ministers on numbers of occasions. On each occasion we have had to return to these people and tell them that the Minister says that if he accedes to their request there will be dissatisfaction either in the Transvaal or in the Cape.

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>There are one or two matters I should like to discuss with the Minister. I want to make a plea for consideration to be given to the mining of our base minerals. We have heard some discussion here about marginal mines and dying mines and what is to happen to certain towns when these mines are worked out. It is a well-known fact that due to the depression and for other reasons the City of Kimberley once landed in the position where things were very bad. Due entirely to the efforts of local men some efforts have been made to stimulate interests in other industries. The point I wish to establish is this. Will the Minister not give consideration now, to making provision for those cities and towns which rely on diamonds and gold for their welfare. I should like to mention a place like <span class="col_6287-6288" refersTo="page_477"/>Postmasburg, for example, which for a long time was in a very bad way, but with the discovery of the Brits diamond mine has seen a new lease of life. This leads me to the point that in order to establish industries certain things are necessary. I believe that we are not making the best use of our wealth in the shape of minerals and base metals. I refer particularly to the Japanese contract where 5,000,000 tons of iron ore are being carried away from the Northern Cape at the rate of 500,000 tons a year to be processed into pig iron, after which it is shipped to Japan. Responsible people have stated that this undertaking, in the area where the mine exists, will give employment to 140 non-Whites and 50 White workers. One asks oneself whether or not, that material should have been processed closer to the source of supply. I also refer to the position regarding manganese. We know that the supplies of manganese are practially unlimited. It is a well-known fact that estimates, as to the quantity, vary between 50,000,000 and 100,000,000 tons. That manganese is also being carted away via Port Elizabeth, and one wonders whether the time has not arrived when better use should be made of that material near to the site where the manganese is found. As the hon. the Minister himself said yesterday, we would like to diversify our industry. Here is an opportunity which the hon. the Minister could well take. I do not cavil at the decisions which have already been made, because I think there is still enough manganese to warrant some of the decisions which I should like to be taken. We have the situation, that the suggestion which has been made that a steelworks should be erected at Barkly West, which is believed to be the best site, in order to use this material from the mines to the best advantage, is not a feasible proposition, because it is a long way from the coal fields and because it is costly to transport coal. In the report of the commission of inquiry into the use of nuclear power in South Africa, the question of the transport of coal is dealt with. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) has mentioned that uranium is no longer in such great demand and that the world to-day is switching over to nuclear heat as a means of generating electric energy. I therefore submit the proposition to the hon. the Minister that the time has arrived when the Northern Cape region should be developed as a whole and that the raw material, which abounds there in plenty, should be processed as near to the source of supply as possible. I say that, because the time will come when these deposits will be worked out. When that happens we are going to be faced with the same problem which is facing the Reef, the old Witwatersrand. I want to take time by the forelock, with the experience of the City of Kimberley as an example. As far as nuclear power is concerned the commission itself says that the time must come, in the not too distant future, when consideration will have to be given to making a start in using nuclear power as ordinary commercial power. It can be said, of course, that it will take many months or years to plan, and many years to bring about, but when one sees what is done in Britain, where there are also tremendous deposits of coal, one cannot help thinking that the Government could with advantage go into this matter of putting up a nuclear power station and make a start. Sir, a very useful report was prepared in this connection, for quite a different reason. That was because, at that time, the Railways could not cope with the transport of coal. That is no longer the case. The Railways are able to cope with the transport of coal and, according to the report, the Railways would like to keep this traffic. We have seen what surpluses have been earned by the Railways. I believe that with the development of this country, there will be no loss of revenue for anybody, if a nuclear station is established in the Northern Cape for the express purpose of making the maximum use of the minerals and the base metals which abound there. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will give this matter his most serious attention, because I would remind the Minister that with 50,000 tons of iron ore per annum being carted away for ten years to Japan, a lot of work is going to be created in Japan. I say that we should create employment in this country for our own people. As I said earlier there is enough iron ore to carry out this contract and there is probably a lot more. The hon. the Deputy Minister did give an undertaking in this connection not so long ago, and is in the process of investigating the prospects with regard to minerals and base metals in the Northern Cape. Sir, we, in that part of the country are dependent on mining, and I think the time is overdue when we should seriously consider this matter well in advance, instead of having to come here cap in hand to the Government and to plead for relief to be given to marginal and dying mines. We must not forget that similar situations can arise in other directions.</p>

<p>The last matter which I want to raise with the hon. the Minister is this. He can correct me if I am wrong. I understand that in dealing with the diamond deposits, which we believe exist in Namaqualand, it is intended to differentiate between the land which is known as Coloured land, the Coloured settlement, and land which is going to be prospected by Whites. My information is that there is a possibility that the advice of several White groups might be followed and that the Coloured people will be required to work as employees only on the development of any scheme which might be initiated in Namaqualand, in the Komaggas area in particular. I know that the hon. the Minister has appointed a committee to go into this whole matter. I put some questions earlier this Session as to the position of the Coloured diggers and who would look after their interests. Sir, I have studied the personnel of that particular committee very closely, and I think some of the selections are very good. What I say is not said in any disparaging way as far as the <span class="col_6289-6290" refersTo="page_478"/>others are concerned, but I do not think many people on that committee know anything about diamonds and digging for diamonds in alluvial deposits. Alluvial deposits and mines are different propositions entirely. I think the country expects to hear what the Minister&#x2019;s intentions are, because this business of the Komaggas diamonds and the diamonds in Namaqualand has been under discussion for a very long time.

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>There are a few matters I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister. We all realize that in time the gold mines will become exhausted and will have to close down. In that case there are two interested groups which are affected by such closing down or by a decrease in production. In the first place there are the owners of the mine. Much is already being done for them by the Department and by the State as such. Assistance is given to them in regard to the pumping out of water, tax relief, etc. But I really want to talk about the second group which is affected by the closing down of a gold mine, and that is the town in which the gold mine which has to close down is situated. I want to say immediately that the Opposition has adopted a more intelligent attitude in this debate than ever before in regard to this very difficult matter. The attitude adopted previously, particularly by some members of the Opposition, harmed the Rand more than it benefited it. I want to put the matter to the Minister very clearly. I want to say that we on the Witwatersrand realize that in time the gold mines there will become exhausted, but I just want to bring a few matters to his notice because I think that this need not discourage the establishment of industries on the Rand, but that it should rather be an encouragement, in spite of the concept of decentralization. I know that we talk about the decentralization of industries to replace the closing gold mines for the specific reason that we are concerned about the consumption of water and electricity in that area and the further increase in the numbers of Black people in that area. These are all hampering factors which perhaps justify restrictive measures to keep industries away from the Witwatersrand. In regard to water, I want to say immediately that as soon as the mines close down there will be a tremendous amount of water available which was formerly used by the mines and which will now be available for other purposes. The same applies to electricity. The same also applies, in my opinion, in respect of the problem of Black-White relations, because every gold mine which closes down, depending on the size of the mine, means that between 5,000 and 16,000 Bantu leave that area, which immediately makes a tremendous difference in the ratio as between the Blacks and the Whites. But I want to add that on the Witwatersrand we now have in certain areas the establishment of Coloured areas. Employment will have to be provided for these Coloureds, and in order to do so we ask that industries should be established there to replace the gold mines so that employment can be provided for the Coloureds, even though we have to compel the industrialists by legislation to employ Coloureds in their industries. I feel that in this case it is essential.</p>

<p>Sir, I leave that thought with the hon. the Minister. Then I want to mention two matters affecting the mineworkers specifically. In the first place, when a mineworker has gone to the Bureau for an examination, he receives a certificate which sets out his position. The hon. the Minister has already explained this matter to us, but I should like him to repeat it for purposes of the record. On that certificate given to the miner these questions appear: &#x201C;Are there signs of pneumoconiosis, yes or no?&#x201D; Then a cross is drawn which indicates that there are signs of pneumoconiosis. The next question on the form reads: &#x201C;In what stage? Under 20 per cent lung impairment, above 20 per cent, etc.?&#x201D; Then perhaps a cross appears to indicate that there is less than 20 per cent lung impairment. The miner simply cannot understand it. There is a definite finding that he has contracted pneumoconiosis, but his lung impairment is less than 20 per cent. He is therefore not placed in the first category, and then he wants to know why he is not certified, because the form indicates that he has pneumoconiosis. I understand the position, but doubt still exists in the minds of the mineworkers, and I want to ask the Minister please to state the position very clearly.</p>

<p>The second matter I want to refer to in regard to the miners is the question of skin diseases. We know that any impairment of the chest or lungs is now classified as an industrial disease in the mining industry, but now we find, in my own constituency and everywhere else, that mineworkers are not so affected by their work in the mines, but that they develop skin diseases as the result of the damp and moist conditions underground. They contract eczema, skin rashes and all kinds of other diseases. I understand and accept that this can also be the position in other industries, but I just want to ask whether this has not already happened so often in the mining industry that we can specifically ascribe this disease to working in the mines, so that compensation or relief in some form or other can be given to the mineworker.</p>

<p>In order to save time, I do not propose to reply to every hon. member who has taken part in this debate, but I shall deal with each of the various subjects which have been raised here by hon. members.</p>

<p>I want to deal in the first instance with the problem of marginal mines which has been touched upon by speakers both on that side and on this side. I want to give a few answers to questions which have been put to me in this connection. I refer in the first place to what was said here by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) when he pleaded that we should do everything in our power by means of a scientific approach to <span class="col_6291-6292" refersTo="page_479"/>exploit and to retain in this country the greatest possible tonnage of ore. He also urged&#x2014;and this is a matter which falls more appropriately under the Department of Economic Affairs&#x2014;that we should encourage the establishment of industries in towns which are threatened by the closing of marginal mines. The hon. member for Springs also dealt with this matter, and although he expressed his appreciation of what the Government had done in this connection, he accused us of having done too little too late; he said that we should have tackled this work sooner.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni says &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;. In this connection I want to say that this problem of marginal mines is one which has not existed in recent years only; it has been a problem in this country over the past 25 to 30 years. Hon. members will recall that as far back as 1947 investigations were instituted and recommendations made in this connection by the Social and Economic Planning Council. But hon. members must also remember that the Free State gold-fields were discovered immediately after the war; those gold-fields had to be developed as well as the gold-fields in the Western Transvaal area. During that period immediately after the war there was an acute shortage not only of capital but also of labour in the mining industry in general and particularly in the gold-mining industry, and because of the discovery of new gold-fields and the shortage of labour, this problem of marginal mines was not regarded at that time, as it is to-day, as a matter requiring urgent attention. Neither the previous Government nor this Government regarded this problem initially in the serious light in which we view it to-day. Hon. members must also remember that the gold-mining industry itself has always been very sensitive as far as the question of subsidization of the gold-mining industry is concerned. That is why one of the obvious methods, which is perhaps used in certain countries, was always rejected, namely the possible subsidization of marginal mines. But let me put this to hon. members on that side who have been criticizing us, particularly the hon. members for Springs (Mr. Taurog) and Germiston (District). They have been accusing the Government in recent years of having done nothing and of having been negligent in this matter. Let me ask them whether they themselves have ever put forward any positive proposal as to how these marginal mines can be assisted. It is true&#x2014;and I do not hold this against them&#x2014;that they have been talking about taking care of those towns in which gold mines will have to close, but have those hon. members ever put forward any positive suggestion, either in debates in previous years or even in this debate, as to how to lengthen the life of these marginal mines?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I know of no positive proposal that they put forward, and I do not really blame them for not having done so because I know bow difficult it is to find the answer to this problem; I know how difficult it is to find the solution. Sir, you will recall that in 1956, when the first round-table conference was convened, a conference which was attended by all the various interested parties, to suggest ways and means whereby the life of the marginal mines could be lengthened, only a few trivial proposals were put forward which, if given effect to, would have made a difference of only a few cents in the production costs. No proposal of any real significance was put forward, and in spite of all the investigations which have been instituted in recent years nobody has been able to come forward with any suggestion of real significance, apart from the proposals that we have adopted in the past year or two. We have granted assistance to the marginal mines in respect of the pumping out of water, and in this connection the State will be spending R1,750,000; this year we have made provision for loans to marginal mines, and this will possibly cost us R3,500,000 this year. What other solution would hon. members suggest? There are two solutions which have been suggested; the one is that the production of marginal mines should be subsidized. We investigated that proposal very thoroughly in respect of each of the mines concerned and we came to the conclusion that it was not a practical solution, quite apart from fundamental objections, because the cost of subsidization would be so high in comparison with the additional gold which would be mined that it would not be worthwhile. Another solution which was proposed by the Chamber of Mines was that gold-mining taxation should be reduced. But, Sir, a reduction of gold-mining taxation would not help the marginal mines either because they pay no taxation in any event. We have been in touch with the Chamber of Mines for years with regard to this problem; we have been putting our heads together for years in an attempt to find a solution, but it is difficult to arrive at a solution. The Government has again set aside R15,000,000, part of which will be used in an attempt to solve this problem, and I cordially invite hon. members on the other side, in the interests of this country and in the interests of the gold-mining industry, to come forward with positive, acceptable suggestions. I would also point out that it is wrong to allege that we have only been able to produce these two schemes after seven years of intensive investigations. The Government has assisted the marginal mines in various ways in recent years.</p>

<p>I am referring to mines such as Virginia Merriespruit, Free State Saaiplaas, Freddies, etc. Various schemes have been implemented by the Government which have not amounted to a direct grant of money to those mines but which have meant a loss of revenue to the Government. These mines have been enabled <span class="col_6293-6294" refersTo="page_480"/>to remain in production for a longer period by means of governmental measures.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of ensuring that the maximum amount of gold is obtained from all working mines, I want to refer to the fact that tax and lease formulae are of such a nature that they encourage mines to mine a low-grade type of ore. The Government Mining Engineer, through his Inspector of Mines Leases, continually keeps a close watch on behalf of the Minister over all leased mines in terms of the gold law. I can assure hon. members who have raised this matter that these officers are very accurate. They keep a close check on mining operations with the object of ensuring that the eyes of the mines are not picked and that the maximum amount of gold is mined. The officers of this Department are devoting considerable time and thought to the question of preventing mineable gold from remaining un-mined.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Springs, as well as other hon. members, has asked what my views are with regard to an increase in the price of gold. That question, of course, is one which should more appropriately be directed to my colleague, the Minister of Finance, and in the circumstances I do not want to go into this matter too deeply. I just want to say what my own experience has been in recent year&#x2019;s, in spite of the official opinions of governments: Wherever I have come in touch with economists and financiers, particularly in Western Europe, I have found that economists at any rate have been more and more inclined to advocate an increase in the price of gold. In other words, I have found that more and more the thinking people in Europe, who reflect upon and investigate these things, are adopting the attitude that eventually there will have to be a more realistic gold price in relation to the dollar. I think people are beginning to realize that in spite of all other more or less artificial means which are being applied to preserve international liquidity, the only real way to ensure that is by means of an increase in gold production, and an increase in gold production can only be brought about by an increase in the price of gold. The argument which has always been advanced against an increase in the price of gold is that it will promote inflation and that Russia will benefit if the price of gold is increased. I think it is being realized to-day that an increase in the price of gold will not necessarily result in inflation because there is already inflation in America and other countries in spite of the fixed gold price, and that an increase in the price of gold would merely give recognition to the already existing inflation. I think the attitude of certain countries towards Russia is also gradually beginning to change. It is said that if the price of gold is increased Russia will benefit, and the question which is being posed to-day is why there should not be an increase in the price of gold when the prices of all other products supplied by Russia have increased in past years. People are beginning to realize that if the price of gold is not increased in due course Russia will eventually be the only country mining gold. When the cost of mining gold in South Africa eventually rises so steeply that it no longer pays us to mine gold, the mining of gold in South Africa will be discontinued, and then the largest source from which the West to-day obtains its gold will no longer exist. Russia is a country in which the cost factor does not enter into the picture, and Russia will be able to continue to mine gold whatever the costs of production may be. Russia will then be the only gold-producing country and the West will have no source from which it will be able to augment its stocks of gold. This is an idea which is beginning to penetrate the minds of people in Europe and which may eventually lead to an increase in the price of gold.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. H. J. Botha) has asked me to investigate the northeastern Cape. I want to say to the hon. member that I will follow up the idea put forward by him to see what can still be done there.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Springs and Lichtenburg (Mr. M. C. van Niekerk) put certain questions to me in connection with oil. I just want to say that in terms of the Petroleum Act, Act No. 46 of 1942, the Minister may grant a lease to prospect for petroleum to anybody who in the opinion of the Minister has the necessary technical and financial means at his disposal. About a dozen such areas have so far been allocated to prospectors. The majority of these prospectors are South Africans. Some of them are making use of foreign capital and foreign experts. The largest part of the country is already covered by prospecting leases which have already been granted. The Department of Mines exercises very thorough supervision and will see to it in the future that these people to whom prospecting rights have been granted carry out their obligations under those agreements. Sir, a few days ago the newspapers carried a report which practically suggested that oil had already been discovered in Natal. I just want to say in this connection that one must not pin one&#x2019;s hopes on such exaggerated reports. The fact of the matter is that fossil oil was discovered there as far back as 1956 by the Department&#x2019;s geological survey division. There are very favourable indications there. Research workers found a year or two ago that it would be worthwhile to investigate that area further, and a special departmental team, which was specially constituted for this purpose, together with Biological Survey, is carrying out a very thorough investigation in a portion of that area in Natal. It will still take some little time to come to a decision. But one cannot say that there is oil there until such time as boreholes have been sunk to a great depth and until such time as oil has in fact been found there.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Prospecting rights have been granted to about a dozen prospectors, but the contracts have not yet been completed.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) has asked me about the marketing of uranium and about the stretched-out agreement. This is a matter of secrecy and I cannot give him all the information that he might want. I can only tell him that the original contract with the Combined Development Agency provided for the sale of uranium up to the end of 1966. All the uranium was to be delivered by the end of 1966. Afterwards two stretched-out agreements were arrived at. The first stretched-out agreement was that deliveries be slowed down up to 1970. Subsequently there was a second stretched-out agreement in terms of which deliveries had to be concluded by 1973. That is the only information I can give the hon. member. By these agreements the bulk of the deliveries is currently being made to the United States of America and during the latter half of the programme the balance will be delivered to the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>In regard to the further sale of uranium I may add that there is hardly any demand at the present time for uranium but that the uranium producers in South Africa, in conjunction with the Atomic Energy Board, have set up a sales promotion organization throughout the entire world. Numerous trips have been undertaken and valuable contacts have already been established for future sales. I am sorry that I am unable to furnish more information as regards to the results, because I have to observe certain secrecy provisions in this regard. In regard to the peaceful use of uranium it is known that fossil fuels are about 20 per cent cheaper than fission materials. But there are optimists who believe that within the next decade there will be a break-through as the result of research which is being conducted in most countries to-day. There is also a general feeling that some stock-piling may be commenced within a few years&#x2019; time. A proposition, which has already been mentioned by the hon. member for Karoo, is a nuclear power station for the Cape, for instance. This has already been investigated by a specialist committee a few years ago. As hon. members will recall they recommended that such a station would not be economically advisable at the present moment. It is still much cheaper at the present moment to generate electricity in the ordinary way than by means of atomic power.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>The capital costs are also very much higher because you must have a very large installation and the bulk of electricity to be delivered must also be very large. You could not install it for a small town, for example. A very large bulk of distribution is required. I must add that although this committee has recommended in that way the work is still being continued by means of a nuclear power sub-committee of the Atomic Energy Board. This sub-committee is keeping abreast with current events and is from time to time making reports. So this matter is not forgotten. We are still at it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) raised certain matters in regard to pneumoconiosis which have already been replied to by the hon. member for Odendaalsrus. The hon. member for Rosettenville mentioned paragraph 3 of the report of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Commission of last year. He drew certain conclusions from the figures mentioned in that report. I am sorry to say that those conclusions of his, although well meant, were not entirely correct and that they do not reflect the true position. I recall that in correspondence with the hon. member it was already explained that reclassification into higher categories of disability could only take place after further medical examination. Until 31 October 1963 the 345 cases of miners, on whose behalf the hon. member pleaded for pensions, had not yet presented themselves for examination at the bureau. I am quite sure that by now the majority must have presented themselves, that they must have been examined and that they probably already receive pensions. The hon. member also referred to the comparatively large number of miners who had not previously been certified to have pneumoconiosis but who have since been certified to have pneumoconiosis or pneumoconiosis plus tuberculosis. These figures do not provide a basis for criticism but they are a very good testimony of the success of the new Act and the efficiency of the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau. A fair percentage of these certifications is due to the more scientific approach which is permitted by the new Act. I must also say that an upsurge in certification is natural immediately after the introduction of new legislation, as the hon. member for Odendaalsrus has already mentioned. The reason is that miners who are no longer employed on the mines apply for examination once a new Act is passed and as these examinations are worked off the rate of certification drops and may even reach a more stable level.</p>

<p>The position in regard to tuberculosis is really not as serious as the hon. member concluded from the figures. The hon. member has probably misread the paragraph concerned in this report. The report gives the total number of new certifications without breaking them up into pure pneumoconiosis on the one hand <span class="col_6297-6298" refersTo="page_482"/>and the combined condition on the other hand. It is therefore not right to conclude that the majority or even an undue percentage have the combined condition. There has been no increase in the incidence of tuberculosis amongst miners; if anything there has been a slight decrease. The hon. member suggested that every miner should regularly undergo special tests for tuberculosis. I am not a medical man, but I am not aware of any tests that can be carried out effectively at an ordinary medical examination. Apart from this there would be no point in carrying out these tests on Europeans unless the Bantu workers were also tested in a similar way. When one considers that there are approximately 50,000 European miners and approximately 500,000 Bantu miners who would have to be tested at least once every year it must be clear that this suggestion is really not very practical. However, the bureau has introduced a system of regular sputum culture testing for all miners who have been found to have pneumoconiosis in any degree, and quite a number of cases of tuberculosis which are undiagnosable by ordinary means are detected in this way. I am afraid that, except for very strict periodical examinations, this is all that can be coped with at the present moment.</p>

<p>With regard to asbestosis the hon. member for Rosettenville suggested that I should consider making a regulation to regulate the establishment of residential areas near asbestos mines. He suggested that no residence should be permitted within five miles of any asbestos mine. Well, I do not think the suggestion is feasible but I am quite prepared to go into this matter. This is, however, one of the matters which will receive attention in the research programme on asbestosis and mesothelioma, which is already in progress. This might interest the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford). If the escape of asbestos dust from mills can be controlled effectively such a regulation will probably be unnecessary. The problem which has therefore to be tackled very seriously is the problem of dust prevention and dust control. I wish to assure the hon. member that this matter is receiving active attention.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) spoke appreciatively of the State&#x2019;s attitude towards pneumoconiosis sufferers in the past. I appreciate what he said. In this regard I should like to make a little announcement which may perhaps interest hon. members. Hon. members know that at the moment negotiations are taking place between the Chamber of Mines and the Mining Trade Unions in regard to a new method of pneumoconiosis certification and compensation. During the past week the Chamber of Mines and leaders of the trade unions approached me and submitted to me a scheme on broad lines. Because I know that Parliament is, and has been for all these years, interested in the lot of the mineworker as such and in the compensation and treatment of the pneumoconiosis sufferer, I felt that this was a matter which we should tackle very seriously. I have, therefore, decided to appoint a commission of inquiry. This commission will not be very large, but it will have to work very speedily. The task of that commission will be more particularly to investigate the proposals which have now been made by the Chamber of Mines and the trade unions, especially in regard to the pneumoconiosis compensation paid to our mineworkers. I do not want this commission again to cover the whole field which has already been covered by various commissions, but I want them more particularly to investigate the proposals submitted to us and to determine whether those proposals are really in the interest of the mineworkers or not. I hope hon. members will agree with me there.</p>

<p>I have not yet considered the personnel of this commission. There are various ideas in this regard. But I think the idea should be to have a completely objective commission and that not even my Department or the workers or anybody who is slightly interested in the matter should be represented on this commission. I think it would be best to have a completely objective commission.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) has mentioned the question of asbestosis, and lung cancer. I can inform him that a programme of intensive research, which will provisionally stretch over a period of five years, has been put into operation with effect from 1 April 1964. This research covers two aspects. In the first place there is the aspect of dust control and the prevention and extraction of dust and the prevention of air pollution in the vicinity of asbestos mines and mills. Secondly there is the aspect of medical research in connection with the causation and the prevention of these two diseases. The work in connection with dust will be undertaken and controlled by the Mine Air Research section of the Government Mining Engineers&#x2019; Division and the cost will be borne by the State. Considerable progress has been made in connection with the improvement of dust conditions in asbestos mines and mills. The position is being carefully watched by way of regular inspections in dust cellars. The hon. member mentioned a certain mine. I do not know whether we have the same mine in mind but there is a mine in the Northern Transvaal which has made considerable progress in regard to dust control and the dust counts for last year were considerably lower than those of previous years. I do not know whether it will be possible to force the mines, particularly the smaller mines, to make use of the same methods because these methods will be too expensive for the smaller mines. But the Government mining engineer is watching the position and shall force smaller <span class="col_6299-6300" refersTo="page_483"/>mines to make use of those particular dust control methods that they can afford.</p>

<p>The research on the medical side is being undertaken by the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau and the pathological research section of the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit of the C.S.I.R. This unit has already done a considerable amount of work and steps are being taken to expedite and to extend this work. The medical part of this research is being financed jointly by the State and the asbestos mines on a rand for rand basis. It appeared from discussions which took place recently in London, at which my Department was represented, that the problem of asbestosis and mesothelioma was an international one. And as hon. members know research is now being conducted on an international scale. The Department is cooperating fully in this international investigation and further discussions will be held later this year in New York. I may also add that this is not only a problem of the mines it also occurs in factories and other industries. For this reason research over a very wide field is necessary. I can assure hon. members that the Government is fully aware of the importance and the urgency of the matter and is giving it its active attention.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) paid a tribute to the Boshoff Group. I may tell him that to a large extent I share in the tribute he has paid to them. I just want to say in passing, without derogating from that tribute, that the methods adopted by that group have cerain limitations and that those methods cannot be applied to the gold-mining industry as a whole because they can operate only under certain working conditions, at certain depths, in certain temperatures and with due regard to certain water problems. Nevertheless, we recognize the great work which has been done by that group.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the foreign Bantu in the gold-mining industry. Although I agree with the hon. member, I just want to tell him that it is not so easy to reduce the percentage of foreign Bantu in the mining industry. In the first place, we know that our own Bantu are not so keen on working in the gold mines. Secondly, we know that our own Bantu are willing to work for only 10 or 11 months in the gold mines, whereas the foreign Bantu work for 16 months and longer. They have a longer contract and that of course reduces the cost of recruiting and training. Then our Bantu also tend, after having worked in one mine for a little while, to go to another mine. That is not the case in regard to the foreign Bantu. We should like to reduce the number of Bantu coming from beyond our borders, but there are certain problems involved. That is one of the first matters which I, as Minister of Mines, took up with the Chamber of Mines after I became the Minister. I can only say that there is already an improvement, because whereas in 1957 36 per cent of the Bantu on the mines were South African Bantu, to-day they constitute 40 per cent.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Lichtenburg spoke about oil. I have already dealt with that. The hon. member also spoke about the national character of diggers&#x2019; licences. At the moment the plea is that diggers&#x2019; licences should not be valid for one province only, but that if a digger has a licence he should be able to use it in respect of the whole country. I can just tell the hon. member that after the great discoveries at Grasfontein and in the Transvaal in 1927 the Cape diggers asked that their licences should be valid in the Transvaal, and the Transvaal diggers opposed it. The same happened when the discoveries were made at Goedvooruitsig and Pypklip in the Transvaal. Then the Cape diggers again wanted to be allowed to go to the Transvaal, and the Transvalers again refused. Later, when discoveries were made in the Cape, the Transvalers wanted to come to the Cape but the Cape diggers refused. So we have a difference of opinion among the diggers. I told a deputation which came to interview me that if the diggers could arrive at unanimity among themselves, I would consider making their licences national in character. The matter therefore rests with them. In this regard I also want to say that we hope, when the Namaqualand fields are distributed, to give greater opportunities to diggers to go and work there. They need no diggers&#x2019; certificates for that; a certificate as to their moral character is sufficient for that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) raised certain matters in regard to the processing of raw materials. I can only say that I fully agree with the hon. member that it is necessary for us to process our raw materials to a much larger extent before they are exported. There are many problems connected with this processing, particularly with the marketing of those materials. These matters fall under the Department of Economic Affairs and if the hon. member is agreeable I shall refer the matter to him.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me about the participation of Coloureds in the Namaqualand diamond diggings. This matter is also being given attention to. We are co-operating with the Department of Coloured Affairs.

<p>*The hon. member for Randfontein mentioned certain matters which I should like to deal with briefly. He referred to skin diseases. I can only say that if it is proved that skin diseases arise as the result of working in the mines, special provision will have to be made for it.

If it is found that working on the mines causes skin diseases, we shall have to make provision for it in a different way, and not in this Pneumoconiosis Act.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>As I see it this Bill consists of two parts. The first one gives the hon. Minister additional powers to build houses and it also enables him to build different types of houses. The second part provides the machinery for the transfer of the various works of the Group Areas Development Board to the Department of Housing. I think these are the two main aspects the Bill is intended to provide for. We support the third reading of this Bill because we think both these objects are necessary. But that does not mean that we are not perhaps critical of some of the methods that are incorporated in the Bill to achieve these two ends. For example, during the Committee Stage of this Bill, we on this side of the House moved certain amendments to Clauses 4, 6, 12 and 13. The object of those amendments was to try to introduce something into this Bill which we thought it seriously lacked and that something is a spirit of co-operation. We on this side of the House believe that to achieve the objects of this Bill, in other words, to provide more houses and quicker, a method of co-operation with the local author rities concerned would have been a far better approach than to take almost dictatorial powers to make these people do the job if there were any hold-ups or any reasons at all why the schemes did not go as fast as the Minister wanted them to go. But unfortunately the Minister has rejected all those proposals. He has decided to do it by the method he has enunciated in this Bill. At this stage we want to repeat that we would far rather have seen him adopt the other method, that of cooperation. Because we would like to remind the hon. the Minister that we do not know of one local or regional authority that does not want to provide housing for its people. I do not believe there is any such local authority in the Republic of South Africa. I believe that every one at all levels is just as keen to provide housing, and proper housing, for their people as I believe the hon. Minister is. That is why we believe he would have got the co-operation of all of them without resorting to the means he has adopted to achieve his end in this Bill. I would like to remind him too that in the application of this Bill I think he should remember that in the case of many local authorities their resources are already <span class="col_6303-6304" refersTo="page_485"/>overstrained. He must not believe that the only thing they have to do is to provide houses. Their means are already overstrained by many things, and one is the matter that the hon. the Minister himself has to deal with, namely the proclamation of group areas. Sir, when group areas are proclaimed in quick succession, it puts a terrific load on the resources of local authorities who have as well, to provide all facilities and amenities that are required by the existing community as well as those the Minister wants to be provided for the new community. Then in addition to that you have this movement from the platteland to the towns which is also occupying the thoughts and taxing the resources of the local authorities to a large extent at the moment. That movement is a very big one and it requires houses and the provision of all the things that the local authorities are set up to provide for the people living in their area. In addition to that you have the problem of providing for immigrants. All these things add up to the fact that local authorities in almost any area have their hands full already, and new housing schemes have to be inaugurated, planned and carried out with the co-operation and the sympathetic co-operation of those local authorities. I might remind the hon. the Minister that in Durban alone one of his proclamations of last year, I think the number was 272 of 4 October, displaced 2,000 White people from Isipingo for whom housing has to be found somewhere. But the same proclamation displaced an estimated 49,000 Indians for whom housing will have to be found. Now whilst this Bill is obviously designed to assist to a certain extent to provide housing for those people, the hon. Minister must remember that those two areas which are being vacated by those two groups will also have to be dealt with by the local authorities, and it is not quite so easy as to say that the one group moves out and the other moves in. The hon. Minister knows that without me having to tell him. The difficulty of repopulating an area evacuated by Indians is considerable. It is not so easy to get that area repopulated by the European section of the community without extensive work and money being spent in the area. All these are problems which I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister so that, where he has these terrific powers, he applies the Act with a sense of co-operation and patience. In addition to all these factors, when you start to increase the size of a local authority, or provide a housing scheme, it is not merely a question of building houses. Perhaps your water resources are totally inadequate to cope with such an area. And this Bill provides that another local authority can in certain cases be called upon to provide those services, but they in turn have planned to provide for their own people and not for the people in an adjoining local authority area. All these are problems, the provision of water and services, the provision of transport, because many of these new schemes and townships will be established some considerable distance from the area where these people work. We have had the experience of that in most of our big centres where there is a tendency to put the non-European section on the outskirts of the towns. So quick and cheap transport has to be provided for these people, and that is another feature that I want the hon. the Minister to take into consideration when planning and approaching these problems.</p>

<p>Then there is also, of course, the question of the manpower shortage, and if the hon. Minister is going to push on regardless with these schemes, of course, he is going to run other sections of the work of the community short of skilled men and artisans. We have a shortage in all sections, and if all the manpower is going to be taken for the implementation of this specific Act, then obviously it is going to create certain shortages elsewhere. That is another factor that I wish to bring to the notice of the hon. Minister now. Then, as has already happened, these schemes, have created shortage of materials. We have in Durban at the moment, I believe, one of the biggest shortages of bricks that has been experienced for many, many years, and whilst the hon. Minister is experimenting with other types of building material, and this Bill provides that he can launch out in the direction of wooden houses, and housing of that kind, nevertheless, this shortage of manpower and material becomes very important in the light of this Bill, and I hope that he will take those factors into consideration as well. Whilst we are on the question of the provision of new types of houses, I noticed in the <i>Digest</i> that a convention is taking place in Pretoria in the near future to discuss all types of new building material, not just wood. I would ask the hon. the Minister to try and keep both himself and ourselves in touch with the result of that meeting, because it might produce building materials of a type better even than wood, or it might produce materials which combined with the wooden structure might do away with some of the complaints we have against wooden houses, and it might remove some of the fears we have in that regard, such as the fire hazard and the infestation of wooden houses by pests. I think I have brought the points that we want to bring in connection with that particular aspect of the Bill to the attention of the hon. Minister.</p>

<p>Then we come to the taking over of the functions of the Group Areas Development Board. We welcome this transfer. I made this quite clear to the hon. the Minister at the second reading, because we believe that the Group Areas Development Board has failed. We have always advocated that the whole of the transfer of population and the sorting out process of the groups should have taken place via a progressive and well-planned housing scheme and that people should rather have been induced to go to the areas by providing housing of a better type and conditions of a better nature, and I believe that this move of <span class="col_6305-6306" refersTo="page_486"/>transferring the bulk of the work of the Group Areas Development Board to the Department of Housing will probably be a step in this direction. I sincerely hope it will be. But I hope too that in transferring the work of the Group Areas Development Board to the Housing Commission and the Department of Housing, the hon. Minister will have learned the lessons that have caused the failure of the Group Areas Development Board. I hope that under the new powers and under this transfer, the Housing Commission will be able, for example, to deal with the properties, the buildings that they are now going to take over from the Group Areas Development Board under Clause 5. I hope they will deal with them more expeditiously than the Group Areas Development Board had done. I believe that that has been one of its biggest failures. I hope that they will make these buildings, these houses, these homes, they are going to take over more readily and more quickly available to the people for whom they are intended. I hope too that they will quickly recondition those that are in bad shape, and there are many; some are derelict. I would like to mention to the hon. the Minister that I received a telegram following the second reading debate on this Bill from Isipingo asking me to please try and induce the hon. Minister to do something because the houses of the Group Areas Development Board, the houses taken over by them, in many instances are lying derelict and are being occupied by hoboes and people of bad character, who are bringing fears into the minds of the people at Isipingo Beach. That is one example of a spontaneous reaction from an area asking that something should be done. The reason why this telegram was sent was that the houses are not being used for the purpose they were intended for. They are taken over by the Group Areas Development Board and there they stay and they are not transferred to the population group for whom they were intended. I hope that in making these houses quickly available, that the Housing Commission and the hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department of Housing will make these houses available to people first of all at rentals they can afford and if they are going to purchase, at prices they can afford. I sincerely hope that the Housing Commission will stop this practice of making a double profit on the transferring of houses from the original owner to the final owner, so that the man who purchases the house and the man who is selling the house do not bear this terrific extra cost. I believe it is inflating the prices of houses to the persons to whom the houses are transferred, after the area has been proclaimed under the Group Areas Act. If the Housing Commission does this and has learned the lessons of the failure of the Group Areas Development Board, then I believe in the process it will save a considerable amount of the taxpayers&#x2019; money, money which has been spent on buying in properties which have been put to little or no use and properties which have deteriorated very, very quickly indeed and are in need of a great measure of repair, which is going to cost quite a lot of money in many cases.</p>

<p>The other point that I would like the hon. Minister and the Department to take into consideration in taking over the administration of this work is the question of the throwing together of people of all classes after a proclamation has come into effect. What I mean is this: Amongst all colour groups in our country, the people of those groups have sorted themselves out into classes.</p>

<p>What bearing has that on the Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am coming to that. I just want to make this point to show what I mean in the provision of houses. When these people are put into an area which has been set aside for that particular colour group&#x2014;and this Department is going to carry out that work, Sir, by the provision of houses and the development of those schemes&#x2014;the tendency seems to be to bring all those people who have sorted themselves out into different classes back together again because a housing scheme has been provided which throws them together again. This is causing a lot of hardship and a lot of trouble to people. The hon. Minister shakes his head. Let me give him an example of what I mean. There is a Coloured man employed in the fishing industry who has worked hard and earns R28 a week, which is quite a good income for this Coloured person. He has had to live in a township where all of these classes have been thrown together. What has happened as a result? He does not mind living in that township. But because the houses are all of a similar type and various classes have been thrown together there he cannot have a party of his friends at his home at night unless it is invaded by people of lower classes in that village. This is actually happening. And if he is rude to these people, the wheels are removed from his motor car and things like that. This is the point I want to make to the hon. the Minister that in the provision of housing, he should try and sort out the types of houses according to the class of people, so that he attracts to one area people of that particular class who will occupy those particular houses. This is very important. I do not want to go on with it, because I think the hon. Minister knows what I mean. We have had cases of this kind in Paarl, and I think the hon. members who represent the Coloured people here can quote to the hon. Minister very many cases of complaints of this nature. I do not want to take it any further.</p>

<p>Sir, with those remarks I want to say to the hon. Minister that he must approach this question constructively. I believe he will, because his object is the same as ours, namely, to provide houses. But in approaching it he must take into account these various aspects I have put to him so that in rehousing these people who are being replaced, they will be rehoused in the best possible manner and they <span class="col_6307-6308" refersTo="page_487"/>will have the best type of houses and they will live there under the best possible conditions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Minister has been entrusted with one of the greatest tasks that can be given to anybody. He has, I think, been entrusted with what will be the future appearance and the future layout of the whole of the country, and depending on how he approaches his task, will depend what this country will look like in the future. In years to come it will be decided whether his name will go down as one of the great developers, one of the great original thinkers and workers and organizers of the country, or whether the country will be blotted and spotted with ugly houses in regular rows, and in the latter case he can only hope that people will forget that he was responsible for it.</p>

<p>In housing we have to consider two aspects, namely the aspect of economics and the aspects of social services. Most of what I will say will be confined to the social aspect of it, because from my point of view, I feel, that housing is a most important social service. Speaking of the housing of an individual who pays for his own house is of course one thing. He provides, or the community provides for him at his expense certain facilities, such as water supply, lighting, sewage, garbage removal, hospitals, libraries, etc., but when we come to housing which is a community development we are faced with entirely different problems, and the social service aspect becomes more prominent. And in a country where segregation is compulsory there are unavoidably groups of people who are allotted certain areas and for whom therefore inevitably there must be to a large extent housing which is really a social service to the people as a whole. So we must take a completely different view of this type of housing. One or two aspects I would like particularly to emphasize.</p>

<p>I wish to emphasize two factors, both of which are safety factors. The most important, to start with, is physical safety. It sounds perhaps a little unusual that we in a civilized country should be concerned about our physical safety, but nevertheless in the great housing schemes physical safety should be the most important and the first attended to item in the planning. The first place that should be built in a housing scheme is the police station and the second house should be the house for the policeman to live in. Physical safety in these housing schemes in the early days (I think it is better now) was terrible, it hardly existed at night. Recently, I visited Baragwanath Hospital. This hospital is probably the largest hospital in the southern hemisphere and it serves the large south-western housing area of Johannesburg. As you stand at the entrance of the hospital you can look over the wide area, extending for miles, which consists of housing which has been carried out under State control. You might say it is almost across the road. But until fairly recently, there was no street lighting. Slowly the Government has installed lighting in this area. It is not yet complete. At least a few months ago there were still areas which were not lit. This unlit area was at night a place of terror. The people in these unlit areas would not leave their houses at night. Seriously ill people, or people who were hurt seriously would not leave their homes, they would rather lie in pain in their homes than allow themselves to be taken out to the hospital, no distance away. Women in labour would not send for the midwife, and it would not have mattered if they did send for a midwife, because she would not come out anyhow. In other words, there was no safe movement at night in this area, and in the unlit portions of the area it still applies. As the lights have been switched on in the various areas, so has crime tended to disappear, so much so that the doctors at Baragwanath tell me that as before they only received their patients in the morning they now receive them during the night and they find that the crime level has fallen enormously. So much for the police aspect. You see, these people have no remedy if the law is not provided for them. In an ordinary city the people if they do not get the law enforced, will meet together and they will form ratepayers&#x2019; associations and property-owners&#x2019; committees, etc., but this cannot be done in a new housing scheme, and in any event most of the occupants in these new housing schemes are not educated up to that standard. They do not appreciate yet the value of co-operative effort. Therefore the onus rests on this Minister to see that the people that he puts into these housing schemes are adequately protected, and he should also continue to protect them. In certain of the Southern States of America where housing schemes have been installed for many years now, I understand that the authorities who erected these houses appoint a housing manager, and the housing manager is a man with a great deal of power. He not only sees to it that the people keep their houses in decent order, but he also sees that the local authority gives them service. He looks at it both ways, not only from the point of view of the local authority, but also of the individual occupier of the house. Where the people have no local vote, social amenities and public amenities generally are not up to the standard of those in the area where there is a vote. Anybody can see that if he takes the trouble to go into areas where they have no vote. This is no better to be seen than in some of the Indian areas of Durban, where since the Indians were deprived of their municipal vote, the standard of service they receive, in the way of roads, water sewerage, etc., does not match up to that in the other areas.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to density in housing. What should the density be in a housing scheme, the density of people? Because density is a most important thing. How many people can you put on an acre of land in a decent housing scheme? If you are dealing with people on a Transatlantic liner or in a multi-storeyed first-class hotel, 1,000 people to <span class="col_6309-6310" refersTo="page_488"/>the acre is luxury. But if you put 100 people in single-storeyed houses on an acre in the ordinary way (that is a tenth of the others) it is crowding. Therefore we come to the problem that the hon. the Minister must remember that the poorer and the humbler the people, the more space you must give them. It is not purely economic. He must also provide the amenities and parks, etc. on a scale which will provide for the people to have some leisure. If we are to civilize these segregated people, we must given them an opportunity to lead a civilized life, and it is difficult to lead a civilized life if you are over-crowded and if the local authority is not attending to the communal wants. Therefore more space must be allowed. If you have no internal plumbing, and cases will happen of this nature, then you must provide for water storage; if you have outside latrines (which I hope they never will have), then that also has to be provided for and more space must be given to these people. One must not ask too much of the humbler group in looking after their homes. The smaller the ground that they are given to look after themselves, the better it is. They cannot afford the time or money to look after it. By that I do not mean that their houses must be planted on small pieces of ground, but I do mean that verges of the roads, etc., where grass can be planted and looked after by the authorities are better than to give the people large bare areas of earth which will be dust-bowls and merely breed germs.</p>

<p>Now I want to turn to another aspect, the aspect of the segregated industries in which these people will work. We have not only segregated the people but we are segregating the industries.</p>

<p>Where do you find that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I will show you segregated industries. We collect groups of garden factories. You see a very lovely garden factory when you drive from the airport into Durban, garden factories with lovely green lawns all around them, with trees, beautiful roads. Nobody lives there. These people who are encouraged to segregate themselves or to segregate their industries, ignore the fact that smokeless power travels in wires, that pure water runs in pipes and that the raw material and the finished product can be put on the road. Surely, it is cheaper to move the water and the power and the material in this way rather than to move every day anything from 1,000 to 10,000 workers 16 to 20 miles back-backwards and forward. These grass lawns are not even used by the Whites, the non-segregated group; they are used by nobody. They look nice and they give so-called fresh air, but they do not give fresh air where it is needed, where the people live. The loss in time and money to the country is appalling. The money has to be provided by industry and I am not particularly interested in that, because others can speak on it better than I can, but I want to say something about the time that is lost. That is paid for by the workers, and this lost time must run into centuries. How many centuries, even in a young country like ours, have been spent by workers travelling to and from their work? Time does not belong to us, nor to the Government; it belongs to the worker, and who will give it back to him? The one thing in life, Pascal said, that you can never repay is the time that you steal from another man. The most noticeable sign in these garden factories is &#x201C;Keep Off The Grass&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I want to turn for a moment to housing standards. This country need not follow blindly the standards and types that have been used in other countries. I do not think they do. What they do follow is a standard type which they pick out, an ugly square box like a match-box, and they leave out the inside doors as a rule and they are not very good houses. These houses do not need to be ugly. There is no need for them to be bare and miserable match-boxes. I would suggest to the Minister that he go to Rongaat on the north coast of Natal and see what one has been able to do in housing his workers in beautiful, simple homes&#x2014;nothing extravagant. It will do him good to see it. We can suggest some other homes, but the great difficulty about the homes the Minister is providing at present is that they lack privacy. Nothing is more destructive of family life than a lack of privacy. Imagine a condition in which you are never alone and never know what it is to be able to sit down with your head in your hands and have a cry, as a woman might, or sit and smoke and think, as a man might do, but you are living a communal life. The result is not regarded as a home. It is regarded as a place to shelter from the weather, and to sleep and eat, and to get out of as soon as possible when the sun shines again. But it certainly is not regarded as a home. That is one of the main reasons why the bulk of the children in the poorer areas are playing in the streets. I feel that we must at all costs attempt to recreate among these segregated people the sense of family. It is not often realized that the only institution in our social life which has not changed to a large extent is the family. From the days before Christ the family has existed as an entity, and we in this country are, I think, tending to destroy it among these people, and we should make it our duty to maintain the family and to support it at all costs, because civilized life turns around the family and it tends to create a stable population.</p>

<p>I want to return to the question of privacy. Everyone must have somewhere, albeit a cubby-hole, which is his own. We must sit down and consider what we should do if we did not somewhere have a room where we can sit down quietly and be ourselves by ourselves. In Greece, which is an old civilized country, this problem&#x2014;and I commend it to the Minister&#x2014;is solved by the house consisting of a large living-room with a number of <span class="col_6311-6312" refersTo="page_489"/>small rooms leading off it. The average size of these room is about six by six feet. Such a size would not be tolerated here by the Department of Health, even for the lowest classes, but in Greece, which has a climate not unlike our own, it is considered to be the most convenient form of house, because it has that great thing that the father or the mother or the child can be alone in his own spot. He can have his own things there and leave them there. Then again there is the growing house. The houses I have seen in the housing schemes have been square blocks with no passages and where the rooms cannot have more than one window. To add to a house of this nature means that generally you have to pass through one room to get to another. I think the Minister should bear in mind that the time comes to a family where it needs more room and can afford more room, but it cannot afford to move. To move house is a difficult and expensive matter. It often means leaving friends behind. So he should provide some houses at any rate in the better areas, the middle class areas, where the houses will be able to grow and the people will be able to increase their living space without having to move. He must make provision for the middle class person in his housing scheme.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to come to the question of indoor sanitation, for the protection of health. He must make every effort to provide indoor sanitation in every house. It is unreasonable to expect a mother to keep her baby clean if she has no access to a private lavatory for the private use of a family. A communal lavatory becomes like a cesspool. It is not possible to keep it clean. You only have to go into public lavatories in various parts of the world to see what they are like. In America I could not find a public lavatory in a large city like Boston with 2,000,000 inhabitants. So I made inquiries and I was told that there used to be public lavatories but they were abolished because they could not be kept clean, and this is a White population, highly educated and industrialized. So they were abolished, but they made every large store or restaurant put lavatories in their buildings, and they were held responsible for keeping those lavatories clean. That is what I want to bring to the notice of the Minister, that if he gives a family a lavatory inside the house the place can be kept clean by the family. As I have said, the Minister has a great task before him. I have tried to give him some assistance in his thoughts, and I hope he will be able to carry out his duty and that in future his name will be blazoned throughout the world as the man who built beautiful and great suburbs for South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid that if I concern myself only with the provision of toilet facilities I shall never be able to perpetuate my name. [Laughter.] But since toilet facilities form an essential part of the provision of housing, the experts in my Department will certainly give their attention to this matter. The hon. member mentioned the problem of density. The density of population is a problem, of course, that is experienced throughout the world. I agree that one must do everything one can to overcome this problem. This problem is also influenced by the availability of transport facilities and other amenities. But in South Africa the density of population per morgen is from 13 to 15 families, which is a much lower density than the population density in other parts of the world. On my recent trip overseas I visited one of the new towns outside London where the density of population is about 30 families per morgen. In many European countries it is as high as 70 families per morgen. We in South Africa have a low density because we have the space. But the density of population is also determined to some extent by the way in which one plans. There are methods of planning to-day which are in direct contrast to the old method of simply drawing squares. In Western Europe they have circular planning by means of which one can increase the density of population and still have sufficient open space. One can also protect one&#x2019;s pedestrians. All these matters are being dealt with by our experts and I can give the House the assurance that we are well-informed as far as the latest methods of planning are concerned.</p>

<p>But I also want to give the hon. member the assurance that the question of protection for the public which he raised is not a matter which is my responsibility. It is not my task to build police stations. That is the task of the Department of Public Works in consultation with the Department of Justice. When we establish a community we as a Department can draw the attention of other departments to the requirements of that community but I do not think we should try to take their work out of the hands of the Departments of Justice and Public Works. They themselves must ascertain what the requirements are and provide the necessary facilities. I, as Minister of Housing, cannot undertake to build police stations and provide protection for the public. If I were to do so I would be exceeding my authority. [Interjection.] If it is part of a scheme, it must be done in consultation with the other authorities concerned, but it is not our task to provide it. The Development Board is prepared under certain circumstances when we establish a new community to provide certain facilities out of its own funds and has in fact done so in the case of Lenasia, for example. The Development Board built a post office there, but we did not provide the other services connected with a post office; all we did was to erect the building as part of the complex of buildings which was established there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) referred to sub-economic schemes and associated himself with the statement made by the hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) that we should not settle people in such a way that the more well-to-do people <span class="col_6313-6314" refersTo="page_490"/>are forced to live amongst people who are less developed. In point of fact that does not happen. If it does happen it is only in exceptional cases because wherever housing is made available on a large scale the scheme is first planned and approved. Such a scheme also has to be approved of by the Townships Board. In most cases when a master plan is not available, we try to draw up such a plan which reflects the eventual development, even though that development may not take place immediately. Hon. members must not make the mistake of jumping to the conclusion, because we may perhaps give preference to sub-economic houses in particular areas, that that is the only type of housing that we provide, because sub-economic housing does not make up the bulk of the housing that is provided by my Department. As a matter of fact, it forms the smallest part. The bulk is economic housing because the policy of the Government, with the approval of the whole country, is to place the emphasis upon economic housing. Sub-economic housing is only intended to meet the position in time of need or when one is dealing with families whose incomes are so low that they cannot afford economic housing. But I do want to remove any wrong impression which may exist in the country that the Department of Housing only provides sub-economic housing. I think much of the prejudice to these housing schemes made available by my Department flows from the fact that people are under the impression that we only provide sub-economic housing. The Department provides excellent homes on an economic basis, in terms of specifications which we draw up, homes which conform to modern standards. This is not simply theoretical. When hon. members consider what we are doing at the moment at Triomf in Johannesburg, at Bosmont for Coloureds, at Kroonstad in the form of housing for Whites, at Crown Gardens in Johannesburg and at numbers of other places&#x2014;I am only mentioning a few examples&#x2014;and also what we have in mind at Bosmansdam, I am sure they will agree that the Department has succeeded in setting a standard of economic housing which is adequate for any decent family and which meets all the demands put forward by the hon. member for Durban (Central)&#x2014;privacy, the protection of family life and so forth.</p>

<p>When we come to the provision of sub-economic housing, I am sure hon. members will agree that in the nature of things sub-economic units must do without certain of the amenities which are provided in an economic house, otherwise they could not be sub-economic. We in South Africa have not yet resorted to subsidizing housing and I hope we never will do so. All we do is to make cheap money available for sub-economic houses, at three-quarter per cent, interest. But because the State makes money available for sub-economic housing, I think the State is entitled to say that only those people who cannot afford economic housing must be settled in sub-economic homes. If a man cannot afford certain conveniences, he must be satisfied to do without them.</p>

<p>We have various schemes. We have a sub-economic scheme at very low rentals for persons who have been sleeping out in the open, and who are simply given a roof over their heads. We have such a scheme which is resorted to in extreme cases. Then we have the basic sub-economic scheme of houses with two rooms, a scheme which has been greatly criticized. But the two-roomed house is not the type of house which is generally provided; it only provides the basic requirements because we say that if a man cannot afford anything more it is better to give him two rooms than to let him live under a bush. Large sub-economic units are also available in the case of larger families, but these again are also stripped of all the conveniences which are provided in economic units. One must protect those families against wet, cold weather and, as far as possible, provide a number of rooms for them, but all this must be done within the limits of the family&#x2019;s income and in accordance with the standard which is accepted internationally nowadays, i.e. that a person should not spend more than one-fifth of his wages on housing.</p>

<p>I want to go further and tell the hon. member for Umlazi in particular that under these housing schemes or town planning schemes it ought to be possible for the more well-to-do person, if he can afford economic housing, to rent a home or otherwise, to build a house with the assistance of the Department or with the assistance of a local authority through the Department. He can then have his own house built in an area which has been planned for the more economic and developed group. That is our policy. I agree with the hon. member on one point and that is that we must guard against monotony in our sub-economic schemes. I can give the hon. member the assurance that I have already asked the Department to guard against this and that we do not build large schemes in which the houses are monotonously alike that people are deterred from occupying them. The hon. member for Umlazi went on to say that the Group Areas Development Board acquired properties and then neglected them, leaving them to the mercy of the elements. Well, that may be so in a few cases but when we bear in mind the fact that the board has acquired thousands of properties over the past years, properties which it has then disposed of again, the few that are neglected make up a very small percentage of the total. But we have our regional offices everywhere and the public need not hestitate to submit their complaints. They can report the matter to the regional representative of the Department and I am sure he will give his attention to it immediately. It is true that properties are damaged hut we cannot put a policeman on every property. I want to give one example. Here in the Peninsula alone we have acquired 175 properties over the past 10 months. We have renovated these properties and then disposed of <span class="col_6315-6316" refersTo="page_491"/>them again; in other words, we have made them more habitable than they were formerly. I myself have gone to look at properties which the Development Board acquired in a poor state in Bellville but which were renovated and repaired and modernized and made quite habitable for the economic groups so as to meet the existing housing needs.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised the question of the spirit of the Bill. He said: &#x201C;The spirit of the Bill lacks co-operation.&#x201D; I do not think the hon. member is correct. I stated at the outset that we had the wholehearted cooperation of the vast majority of local authorities but unfortunately there was a minority of local authorities which were not housing conscious. There are certain local authorities which are obstinate and which have adopted the attitude that it is not their duty to provide housing, in spite of the provision contained in the Slums Act and the Housing Act that they must give priority to the provision of housing. Does the hon. member know that last year we had to return to the Treasury R6,000,000 which had been earmarked for certain local authorities but which they did not use? In other words, the State and my Department made provision to meet the needs which we knew existed but this money was simply not used because of the laxity of certain local authorities and in other cases because of an unwillingness on their part to make housing available. But those local authorities are not in the majority. We are enjoying the wholehearted co-operation of most of them. The other day I visited a town in which there is a need for at least 60 to 70 houses for Whites but the town clerk told me that there was no housing need there and that it was not their intention to apply for a loan. That sort of person understands only one language and that is the language contained in this Bill. We cannot allow a man to thumb his nose at the State from his own little kingdom and not to do his duty simply because he is in all probability too lazy to do it. It is those people whom we have in mind. I have no quarrel with the vast majority of local authorities who are giving us their wholehearted cooperation.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the question of the shortage of building materials. That is true; there is a shortage of building materials. But because this Government foresaw that there would be a shortage of building materials it appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Louw, after my officials and I had returned from a visit abroad. This committee has now to report to us in regard to the materials that are available for building, apart from wooden houses, and also in regard to the question of costs and the question of the availability of these materials in the country. I know of one factory which has only recently been established and which is manufacturing these industrialized houses. I also know of another large firm which is operating on a large scale in Europe in regard to the manufacture of heavy concrete buildings and which is very interested in and will quite probably come to South Africa. If they do come to this country they will bring with them a unit which will enable them to manufacture 1,000 units per annum. While I am on this point, I must emphasize one matter and that is that we must take care when discussing these matters that we do not talk about &#x201C;prefabricated&#x201D; houses. That is not what the State has in mind. What the State has in mind is houses which are produced through the medium of factory processes. These houses are not the same as the ordinary prefabricated homes in the usual sense of the word. The industry is rather concerned that we may possibly at this stage harm their cause by talking about &#x201C;prefabricated units&#x201D;. I want to tell the hon. member that Professor Louw will quite probably submit his report in regard to this matter during the course of June. That report will be made public.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of transport facilities. I may tell him that, together with other Departments, we serve on an inter-departmental transport committee. When communities are established, very careful consideration is given to the question of the transport facilities which must be made available there eventually. Even though those transport facilities cannot be made available immediately, things are planned in such a way that these facilities can be made available there over a period of years. There is the closest co-operation with the Department of Transport in this connection.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time. <span class="col_6317-6318" refersTo="page_492"/>Since the implications of every clause of this amending Bill are clearly set out in the Explanatory Memorandum which has already been tabled, I do not think it is necessary for me to discuss each clause in detail.</block>

<p>Amongst other things the amendments provide for an extension of insurance coverage for servants who own properties under the Administration&#x2019;s House Ownership scheme and for facilitating the application of the departmental disciplinary code. The Bill is also designed to clarify an aspect in regard to which there is not complete clarity in the existing legislation.</p>

<p>Clause 1 contains a consequential amendment which arises from the amendments contained in Clauses 3 and 8.</p>

<p>Clause 2 extends the insurance coverage for servants who participate in the Administration&#x2019;s House Ownership scheme. The present insurance benefits are only applicable in those cases where a servant dies or leaves the service because of serious physical injury, provided he has been declared to be 100 per cent disabled. The proposed amendment extends the benefits on a percentage basis to servants who sustain less serious injuries and who cannot be offered alternative work in accordance with their capabilities.</p>

<p>Clauses 3 and 8 refer to the higher retiring ages of the staff. Legislation which was passed in this connection in 1955 provides that servants may remain in the service for a further three years after reaching the normal retiring age.</p>

<p>So far, however, only a small percentage of the staff has made use of this concession, this is due largly to the fact that servants had to exercise their option irrevocably at least nine months before they reached the lower retirement age as to whether they wished to stay in the service for a further three years. The result is that we have not fully realized our aim to retain the services of experienced servants after they have reached the lower retiring age. The amendments contained in Clauses 3 and 8 are designed to make the conditions more attractive. A servant will now no longer be bound to stay on for a minimum period of three years; he will be able to retire at any time after having given six months&#x2019; notice. At the same time the pension benefits payable to a widow whose husband dies during his extended term of service are also being improved.</p>

<p>Clause 4 is designed to give the Administration specific authority to accept a cession of a claim for damages ceded to the Administration by an injured servant or by the dependants of an injured servant, and to institute such claim against a third party on behalf of the persons concerned.</p>

<p>The Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act of 1941 provides amongst other things that a workman who is injured on duty under circumstances in which a third party can be held responsible, may claim damages from the third party in addition to the compensation to which he is entitled in terms of the Act. Similarly the employer may take steps to recover from the third party the damages which he is called upon to pay to the workman.</p>

<p>In order to save a railway servant or his dependants the worry and expense usually involved in litigation, it is the practice to permit the persons concerned to cede their claim for damages to the Railway Administration which then acts on their behalf.</p>

<p>Some doubt has arisen recently, however, as to whether the Administration is entitled to accept such cessions. The proposed amendment puts the position beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>Clause 5 proposes an amendment to the Railways and Harbours Service Act. In terms of the existing provisions a servant who is sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine (excluding periodic imprisonment) is automatically dismissed from the Railway Service. There are numbers of offences which are punishable with imprisonment without the option of a fine in terms of various laws and ordinances, for example, to smoke on railway premises, where this is forbidden, to neglect to take out or renew a radio licence, and also traffic offences. In the nature of things these offences do not affect a servant&#x2019;s capability and his usefulness to the Railway Service; it can be assumed therefore that when the provision relating to automatic discharge was originally inserted in the Railways and Harbours Service Act, the draftsmen did not visualize that offences of this kind would be punishable with imprisonment without the option of a fine.</p>

<p>The object of the amendment is to limit automatic dismissal to cases where servants are guilty of serious crimes and crimes involving fraud or dishonesty.</p>

<p>Clauses 6 and 7 increase the maximum fine which can be imposed for a minor offence in terms of the Railway disciplinary code from R4 to just less than R10.</p>

<p>Because of the fact that disciplinary officers are inclined to impose a fine of more than R4 because of the present-day value of money, many offences which from a departmental point of view are really of a minor nature are converted into offences of a serious nature. The result is that such penalties are recorded on a servant&#x2019;s service card whereas this would not be the case if the fine were R4 or less. That is why it has been decided to increase the maximum fine for an offence of a minor nature to just less than R10 and at the same time to fix the minimum fine for an offence of a serious nature at R10. No existing rights of appeal are being restricted as a result of these amendments.</p>

<p>The Federal Consultative Council of Railway Staff Associations has been consulted with regard of the proposed amendments to the disciplinary code as well as the amendment in respect of the higher retiring ages, and they are in agreement with these amendments.</p>

<p><span class="col_6319-6320" refersTo="page_493"/>As far as Clause 9 is concerned, hon. members will remember that the construction of a guaranteed railway line between Delmas and the farm Middelburg, No. 39, was approved by Parliament last year. Since then, however, the guarantors of the railway line have requested the Administration to change the route so that the railway line will be 2&#x00BD; miles shorter which will reduce the cost by R257,127. Provision is being made in Clause 9 to comply with this request.</p>

<p>Clause 10 makes provision for the authorization of certain improved conditions of service for the staff which were introduced with retrospective effect.</p>

<p>Since this Bill consists mainly of provisions which will benefit the employees of the Railways, it is only natural, of course, that we on this side of the House will support it, and in the circumstances we wholeheartedly welcome this Bill. The hon. the Minister may rest assured that we will help him to expedite its passage through the House as much as possible. We are particularly pleased to see that provision is now being made in Clause 2 for people who become less than 100 per cent disabled as the result of injuries. A sound precedent is being followed here which has already been accepted in many other legislative measures such as our insurance laws and other legislative enactments. It is possible to determine medically to-day whether a person is totally disabled or what the degree of his disablement is and what work he is still able to perform. We particularly welcome Clauses 3 and 8 because we realize what an extremely difficult problem we have in South Africa in retaining for the community, not only for the State and the Railways but for the community as a whole, the services of people with ripe experience and a high degree of skill. When one bears in mind that 3,000,000 Whites in this country have to provide practically all the managerial talent and all the technical knowledge and all the academic guidance for a population of 13,000,000, when one bears in mind that even if reforms are introduced which will make it possible to make better use of the services of other elements of our population it will still take years before it will be possible to absolve the White man from this responsibility to any great extent, then it is tragic to think that so many people have to retire at a comparatively youthful age thus depriving the community of their valuable services. It is a pity particularly when one bears in mind that thanks to the contribution of medical science, with its increasing knowledge of the process of ageing, one reaches the prime of one&#x2019;s life, mentally, at the age of 60 nowadays. That is the age at which one can achieve most in the career for which one has equipped oneself. We sincerely hope that this experiment by the Administration will succeed and that the result of it will be that South Africa will be able to retain for the Railways for a longer period than at present the services of people with very valuable experience and knowledge, people who cannot easily be replaced.</p>

<p>There is only one clause which gives us a little difficulty and that is the one dealing with railway construction. Other members on this side of the House have drawn attention to the fact that this Bill departs from the sound practice, which is laid down by law, that new constructions must be recommended to this House by the Railway Commission. In this case that practice was followed originally, but important amendments are being effected here and this House has not had the benefit of a report from the Railway Commission with regard to these amendments. Perhaps it was not very important in this case, but is it a sound precedent which is being created here? Does the Minister propose to make this his regular practice? Is it going to happen often? Or is the position perhaps that the reports of the Railway Commission are not really valuable? That is not my view, and I hope that we do not want to create the impression, by bypassing the Railway Commission, that their services are of no real value to this House. However, other hon. members who feel strongly with regard to this matter will take it further. I just want to say to the hon. the Minister that where administrative experience has shown that an improvement can be brought about in our services in the interests of the employees and where the Government is prepared to translate that experience into legislation such as this, we will always support such legislation in this House.</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place I want to express my appreciation and gratitude for this White Paper which very clearly and explicitly sets out the amendments which are being brought about in this Bill. I also want to express my gratitude to the hon. the Minister for the further benefits which are being granted under the insurance coverage scheme. I want to point out that these benefits are being given without any increase in the premium. The only condition is that it will be subject to a trial period of five years. Sir, one must welcome this step, particularly when one bears in mind that before 1958 the only insurance coverage which then existed was in those cases where servants died before they had paid off their loans. In 1958 these benefits were extended to officials who became 100 per cent disabled, and this was also done without increasing the premium. At that time the premium was also made subject to a trial period of five years, but nevertheless no increase has taken place since then. These increased benefits will be of very great assistance to those unfortunate officials who have to give up their means of livelihood as the result of serious physical injury sustained by them. I want to point out that fine progress has been made in the past year in respect of this insurance coverage scheme which was introduced for the benefit of railway officials who purchase houses under the existing house ownership scheme. We are grateful to the hon. the Minister and the Administration for <span class="col_6321-6322" refersTo="page_494"/>the fact that it has become possible to make this further concession.</p>

<p>Then I should like to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) in connection with the concession which is being made to officials who prefer to retire from the railway service at the age of 63 rather than at the age of 60. As the hon. the Minister has correctly stated, as a result of the fact that these people were called upon to make an irrevocable decision before they reached the retiring age of 60 as to whether they wished to carry on until the age of 63, and the fact that the widow, if the railway servant were to die during this period of three years, would be in a much worse financial position than she would have been if her husband had retired at the age of 60, most of these people preferred to retire at the age of 60. Having regard to our manpower position in South Africa, as the hon. member for Yeoville has quite correctly stated, the Railways cannot afford to lose the services of experienced officials at a time when they can render valuable services to the Railways because of their experience and when they are willing to place their services at the disposal of the Administration for a further period of three years. However, because of the considerations which I have just mentioned and which are now being removed, it has not been possible hitherto to retain their services.</p>

<p>As far as Clauses 6 and 7 are concerned I want to say that it almost goes without saying, having regard to diminished value of our money, that it has become necessary to increase the figure in respect of fines in the case of contraventions from R4 to R10 and to regard a fine of less than R10 as a minor disciplinary contravention which will not be recorded on the service card of the offender. Obviously the same applies to Clause 5 where an official is sentenced to a term of imprisonment without the option of a fine but where his contravention is such that it does not affect his suitability or his usefulness to the railway service. I happen to know the official concerned and I can testify to the fact that this particular official, who was sentenced by a magistrate to a term of imprisonment without the option of a fine, is a capable, experienced official. The offence he committed was that he crossed a full-length white line on the road while he was overtaking three motorcars which were ahead of him. His appeal is still pending, but if his sentence of imprisonment is confirmed it will mean that the Administration will lose the services of an outstanding official. As the present railway regulations read, his services will have to be terminated automatically. I fully sympathize with this person because a few years ago in the Cape I sinned in the same way and committed the same offence.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps I was less audacious than this official; I preferred to pay the fine, but if I had not done so and had gone to court, I might also have been sentenced to imprisonment. Fortunately in the case of a Member of Parliament I believe one only forfeits one&#x2019;s seat if one is sentenced to 12 months&#x2019; imprisonment without the option of a fine!</p>

<p>Since there is some doubt as to whether the Administration is legally entitled to institute a claim under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act on behalf of an official or his dependants, one welcomes the fact that this matter is now being put beyond all doubt in Clause 4.</p>

<p>Then I just want to say a few words with regard to the remarks made by the hon. member for Yeoville in connection with the shortening of the proposed railway line at Delmas. Sir, I do not regard this situation as strange at all. After all, the position is that the Railway Board brought out a report which was submitted to this House; this House duly passed a Construction Bill, and this matter now comes before the House again at the request of the guarantors who are asking for a shorter line, which will mean that the costs of the Administration will be reduced. I do not see any reason therefore why we should have any misgivings with regard to this matter.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that the hon. the Minister has come along almost every year with amendments of this kind to make provision for better conditions of service and greater benefits for the staff. Most of these improvements go unnoticed and yet they are important because they affect more than 200,000 people and their dependants in this country. I feel therefore that we should express our thanks to the hon. the Minister on this occasion for keeping a very watchful eye over the interests of the staff and for the sympathetic attitude which he always adopts towards the staff in giving them more and more privileges and benefits whenever it is possible to do so. The hon. the Minister deserves our thanks and the gratitude of the railway officials generally. No wonder the railwaymen realize that in the present Minister of Railways they have a true friend.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has indicated we welcome this Bill which makes provision for an improvement in the conditions of service of the staff of the Railway Administration. We also appreciate the fact that the hon. the Minister has presented the House with a White Paper which clearly sets out the terms of this amending Bill. But, of course, we know from past experience that when you get an explanatory memorandum on a Bill such as this, you still have to go into the Bill carefully and examine it with a critical eye. There are certain matters which I should like to put to the hon. the Minister with a view to obtaining greater clarity and possibly a greater appreciation <span class="col_6323-6324" refersTo="page_495"/>of the contents of the Bill by the railway servants who are affected by this measure.</p>

<p>The first point I would like to make is in regard to Clause 2. As the hon. the Minister has stated, and as hon. members well know, insurance cover at present is only extended in the case of death or 100 per cent disability. What is proposed here is that if there is a partial disability the railway servant will enjoy insurance cover according to the percentage of that partial disability. But the point is that he does not automatically get insurance cover: he gets it under conditions which will be laid down by the Minister. The Minister has not indicated those conditions in his speech but he has certainly done so in the White Paper. The Minister has given examples of the conditions which he envisages will apply to the granting of these particular benefits to a railway servant. It is indicated clearly in the White Paper that insurance will only be paid to the servant who is partially injured or disabled if he does not refuse to accept an offer of alternative employment from the Administration. The point that arises from that is this: Take the case of, say, an engine driver who has suffered a 50 per cent disability. He is then offered alternative employment. He gets the benefit if he accepts that offer of employment. But what about the financial obligations of that servant? Because one can hardly envisage that an engine driver, for example, who has suffered a 50 per cent disability and who has accepted alternative employment, will receive anything like the remuneration which he received as an engine driver. It is possible that he will be offered a job which carries a lower rate of remuneration than the position of engine driver.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Well, that is the point. What then is the advantage to the servant? That is the point that I should like the hon. the Minister to clear up; that is why I brought an inquiring mind to bear upon this provision. What benefit does the railway servant derive then? Under the existing Act he gets his insurance cover, but here he is only getting an extension of insurance cover under conditions to be determined, for a five-year period, by the Minister. He is placed in this position that he gets no extension at all if he refuses the offer of alternative employment. He may be 70 per cent disabled and he may then be offered a job by the Administration as a messenger boy. If he refuses this offer on the ground that he can do better outside, then he does not get this cover at all. I think the hon. the Minister should tell us clearly in his reply what his intentions are in this regard so that there will be clarity in the minds of the railway servants themselves in regard to the extension which he proposes here. We welcome this provision; it is an improvement, but I think the staff should understand precisely what they are being given here. I want to say here that I do not like the trial period aspect. I think when we introduce legislation of this nature we should lay down specifically under what conditions the railway servant will enjoy full insurance cover. It should not be possible for the Minister or his successor, who may wish to folllow another policy, to alter the conditions under which railway servants will enjoy full insurance cover. These insurance benefits must not be dependent on the whims of the Minister who happens to occupy this portfolio. I think these things should be specifically laid down in the legislation, and I hope the Minister will clarify this issue when he replies.</p>

<p>In regard to Clauses 3 and 8 the Minister himself took the step of extending to officials the right to stay on for a further three years after their retiring age when he was faced with a shortage of personnel, particularly a shortage of trained and experienced personnel in the higher echelons. He conceived the idea of offering them this extension provided they gave notice of their intention nine months before the time and contracted for the full period of three years. As the Minister says in his introductory speech and as is well known it has met with very poor response for the reasons that we well know. Now the Minister comes with this proposition that they can opt to stay on for a longer period but they will have a certain discretionary right after six months to leave at time they like plus, of course, the additional benefit that is provided under Clause 8 to the widows.</p>

<p>How many servants, experienced trained staff, have the Minister attracted under this policy? Is it left entirely to the discretion of the servant to approach the Administration for permission to stay on or does the Administration follow any policy at all in special fields, such as technical fields, of approaching them and saying &#x201C;What about staying on?&#x201D; What has been the response of the staff to such a suggestion? Does the Minister think these further facilities will now assist him to retain some of the men who, as my hon. colleague has pointed out, are quite capable of carrying on a very useful life for three or four or five years in certain fields.</p>

<p><span class="col_6325-6326" refersTo="page_496"/>Clause 4 really only gives statutory recognition to a position that has existed for a long period of time. Then I come to Clause 5. There was something in the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech which puzzled me. I do not know whether I have his exact words, but he more or less said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die wysiging beoog om outomatiese beeindig te beperk tot gevalle waar dienare hulle aan einstige misdrywe skuldig maak</block>

<p>The Minister then adds an &#x201C;and&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; en waarby bedrog of oneerlikheid betrokke is.</block>

<p>As I read it, and I think I understand Afrikaans, I get the impression that the inclusion of the words &#x201C;an offence involving fraud or dishonesty&#x201D; in Clause 5 is intended to cover any serious offence, any serious offence where the courts will impose a sentence of imprisonment without the option of a fine. That is what worries me. As the hon. the Minister knows this provision has been amended on several occasions. The Minister did not tell us whether this particular alteration was discussed with the Federal Staff Consultative Committee. I do not think it was. I know the other provisions were. But the hon. the Minister can enlighten me on this point when he replies to the debate. What puzzles me is this: A case is cited in the explanatory memorandum, to justify this provision, of an apparently high-ranking officer in the Administration who, through negligence, was found guilty by the court of a traffic offence and sentenced to 100 days&#x2019; imprisonment. We all know that no court will sentence anybody to 100 days&#x2019; imprisonment unless it was a very serious traffic offence. Nobody in this House knows whether this particular servant had been guilty of any traffic offences previously. Whether it was a case of drunken driving or not we do not know. What worries me about this is this: Formerly the policy that applied as far as high-ranking servants of the Administration were concerned was that they had to set an example to the public, that they had to be beyond reproach, that they had to be men of good character, people who earned the respect of the public. But as the amendment is worded it is confined to only two specific categories. I can assure the hon. Minister that I took the trouble of consulting legal opinion on this. It is confined only to two categories, i.e. if a servant commits an offence involving only two factors, namely, fraud or dishonesty. He must either falsify books or commit a theft. Sir, we are given other examples in the White Paper of offences which carry as a penalty imprisonment without the option of a fine. The one offence given is if you do not possess a radio licence. This is the first time that I have learnt that you can go to prison without the option of a fine if you have not got a radio licence. I took the trouble to look that up and it is not true: you are given the option of a fine.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>He can be sentenced to imprisonment, without an option of a fine, for a serious crime. Are you objecting to this?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. I am not objecting to this. I want to get something better to protect the interests of the servants and the Administration. I do not think you can relate the fact that a radio licence has not been paid to the example which is given here of a traffic offence involving a sentence of 100 days because the one is of a far more serious nature. What crime must be committed in South Africa that will lead to imprisonment without the option of a fine? What about arson or rape. I can give hundreds of examples of serious offences involving imprisonment without the option of a fine. Are those crimes not to be included in a provision of this nature? What the Minister has obviously got in mind&#x2014;because he also mentioned it in his introductory speech&#x2014;is that this amendment must cover serious offences. I think it is wrong to create the impression amongst servants that it is only in respect of two categories of crime that their services will be dispensed with by the Administration. I think any servant who has been found guilty by a court of law of having committed a serious crime is not worthy of holding the office he does hold in the Administration. I do not think that principle can be argued away.</p>

<p>What I want to suggest is that he should ask his law advisers to consider this again and when we come to the Committee Stage, instead of defining the offence as he is doing now, amend this clause to the effect that if a servant is found guilty of an offence and sentenced to, say, a minimum of six months&#x2019; imprisonment, he will be dismissed from the service of the Administration. Lay down the minimum in the clause instead of only mentioning these two offences, namely, fraud or dishonesty. I do not think the explanation given in the explanatory memorandum is entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>One small point in regard to Clauses 6 and 7. Far be it for us to enter into a discussion on an agreement the Minister has already arrived at with the staff associations. But there is one point that puzzles me very much and it is this: As the Act stands at the moment any offence which only elicits a caution or a reprimand is not recorded on the record of the servant. In other words the existing Act provides for two degrees of offences as far as a caution and a reprimand are concerned. There can be a caution and a reprimand for a minor offence and that offence is not recorded <span class="col_6327-6328" refersTo="page_497"/>in the record of the official concerned. But you have a reprimand and a caution which can also be classified as a serious disciplinary infringement of the regulations of the Administration. According to the amendment of the Minister a caution or a reprimand is now to be considered only as a minor offence which will not be recorded against the record of the official. If you look at the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report you find a number of cases where servants have been seriously reprimanded for even defalcation and such serious reprimand is obviously recorded against that servant&#x2019;s report. I want to know from the Minister why a distinction is made between the two types of offences which elicit a caution and a reprimand, i.e. a minor and a serious offence. Why is the caution or reprimand in respect of a serious crime recorded on the servant&#x2019;s report and the caution or reprimand in respect of a minor crime not similarly recorded? I shall be pleased if the Minister would give us the reasons why that was acceded to by the Administration. I think it is important that we should know.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 10 I hope the Minister will give us an assurance in connection with the retrospective aspect of what is being validated in this clause. I admit frankly that I have not had time to study all the notices listed in the First Schedule. I should like to have the assurances that none of the notices we are asked to validate in regard to any promulgations or staff regulations are detrimental to the interests of the servants because of their retrospectivity which we are asked to agree to in this clause.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with Clause 9. As my hon. colleague has pointed out this is the first time that we are establishing a precedent which I personally do not like. I tried to find another example, but could not, where, after this House had passed a construction measure based on information given to it by a report of the Railway Board which had carried out a full investigation of any proposed new construction, this House has been asked to go over the head of the Railway Board and amend that construction measure. This line is now to be reduced by 2&#x00BD; miles and the expenditure is to be less. We have very little information, Sir. I do not know whether these 2&#x00BD; miles are to come out in the middle of the line or whether it is going to come off the terminal point. The Minister has not given us any information on that. But I cannot even balance the figures. Because when the Minister replied to the second-reading debate in which we approved of this line he indicated that it cost something like R196,000 to build one mile of railway track. If you calculate what these 2&#x00BD; miles would cost it comes to something like R490,000 on the Minister&#x2019;s own calculation, but the actual reduction in costs we are asked to approve in this Bill is only R257,127, whereas, according to the Minister&#x2019;s figures, it should be something like R490,000. I took the trouble of looking up the former debate and I find that I asked the Minister how the routing of that line was determined. The Minister said the reason why the line was 16 miles long was because it followed the shortest possible route to the terminal point where the coal was actually going to be mined. Let me remind this House that that line was agreed to as a result of an agreement arrived at by the Administration with certain mining houses. They were given the right to mine coal at a certain place. We were informed in the last debate that the terminal point of this line was actually going to be near the pithead for easy loading because the responsibility rested on the guarantors to load the trucks at the terminal point. We were also told that this line would follow a distance of three miles along the main line before it would branch off. We were also told at the time that it was going to show a profit of something like R428,000 per annum. We were told a great many things by the hon. the Minister but we have not been told anything to-day. What on earth is the use of a board report upon which this House passes Bills for railway construction if the Minister comes and alters the whole proposal in one little clause without giving the House any information? If you carry this principle through to its logical conclusion why have a Railway Board construction report; why have a Construction Bill? Why have a board? The amendment contradicts entirely the report of the board. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) will see that I am right if he takes the trouble to read the board&#x2019;s report. I think it is the duty of the Minister to give this House much more information about what he proposes here. I regard the steps taken by the Minister in this matter amount to no more than contempt for the opinion and the sense of responsibility of hon. members of this House. I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will give us the fullest possible information as to why this line is to be reduced by 2&#x00BD; miles. What will be the economic effects as far as the guarantors are concerned and as far as the Administration is concerned; which new route will it follow; is there going to be a change in the terminal point; is there going to be a change in the junction point or has the whole thing been re-conceived altogether? We should like to know. What we would also like to know is whether the Railway Board has in any way been consulted about this prior to the Minister agreeing to this shortening of the line, because he said in his introductory speech that this was in terms of an agreement arrived at with the guarantors.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I thank hon. members for supporting this Bill. As the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has said it is in the interests of the staff and I can assure my friend, the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant), that the staff will welcome all these changes. In addition they are apparently much better informed than the hon. member in connection with the implications of the changes.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 9 which deals with the shortening of the railway line, I can only say <span class="col_6329-6330" refersTo="page_498"/>that the Act provides that only when a new railway line is to be constructed must the Railway Board first submit a report. The Act does not say that the Railway Board must again submit a report if the route is changed or if a line is shortened in respect of which a law has already been passed. This is a very simple case. It is a guaranteed line, in other words, the Railways are guaranteed against any losses. The firm who issued the guarantee asked us to move the terminal point to the farm Middelburg. Because of that the total length of the line will be reduced by 2&#x00BD; miles. All this House is now asked to do is to approve of the shortening of the line. There is nothing sinister in it. Everything is in order. It is simply that the law provides that this House must approve of this change. It is totally unnecessary to ask the Railway Board for another report. What purpose will that serve? The report of the railway is at the disposal of hon. members; it was submitted last year and it gives all the details in connection with the original line. I think something similar had already happened in the past. I speak subject to correction but as far as I can remember a railway line in one of the Native areas near Germiston was either shortened or lengthened a few years ago and it was done in the same way, namely, an amendment to the original Act. The Railways are in any case guaranteed against any losses that may be suffered on that line. Whether the line is 16 miles or 131 miles long all the losses that may be suffered will be carried by the firm who issued the guarantee.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) wanted to know what conditions I envisaged in regard to the concession to servants who become partially disabled and who had purchased property under the house-ownership scheme. The position to-day is as follows: Unless a servant is 100 per cent disabled he does not get the benefit of the insurance cover. In other words, if a servant is 50 per cent disabled to-day and he leaves the service of the Administration, due to the inability of the Administration to provide him with other work, he receives no insurance cover at all. I am introducing this amendment at the request of the staff. This is a concession to them. This really means in effect that if a servant becomes partly disabled and the Administration is unable to provide him with other suitable work and he is compelled to leave the service he receives the benefit of this insurance cover. The hon. member should welcome that. The staff welcomes it. It has nothing to do with the contributions they have to make because the contributions are based on his wages and length of service before reaching the retiring age. The contributions remain the same. Even if an engine driver is offered another job at half the salary he got as an engine driver he still has to pay the same contribution. This does not change that position at all. This is merely an additional benefit to the servant who cannot be accommodated and who has to leave the service. He now gets the benefit of this insurance cover based on the percentage of his disability.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>There is no necessity for it. His payments are based on his wages and length of service before retirement. Let me put it this way: I am placing an additional burden on the insurance fund without raising the premium. I have to see during the next five years what affect that will have on the insurance fund. I cannot say to-day how many cases there are going to be that will be covered by this amendment. There may be many or there may be few.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein wanted to know whether the management approaches members of the staff and asks them whether they would like to stay on after their retiring age. Whether the management approaches individual members of the staff I do not know; but on the whole it is left entirely to the staff to decide whether or not they wish to stay on for the additional three years.</p>

<p>Yes. If the hon. member will look at the original amendment of 1955 he will see that it is within the discretion of the Administration to either accept or refuse a request from any servant to remain on over and above his normal retiring age.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. It all depends on the servant&#x2019;s record. There have been cases where the management has refused a request to remain longer in the service. That position still obtains.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein also criticized the amendment in Clause 5. As I <span class="col_6331-6332" refersTo="page_499"/>said by way of interjection the hon. member is apparently under a misunderstanding. The present position is that if a servant is sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine he is automatically dismissed. All I am doing now is that, except in the case of dishonesty or fraud, dismissal will not be automatic but that it will be within the discretion of the Administration. In the cases the hon. member has mentioned it is obvious that he will be dismissed. It all depends on the seriousness of the crime for which the particular servant is sentenced.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>If there is a discretion why add these two offences?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Because the Railway Administration is an undertaking which has to safeguard public money and public property. It has to create confidence in the public. That is why any servant who is guilty of dishonesty is dismissed from the service even if he is not taken to court and sentenced to imprisonment.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 10 I can give the hon. member the assurance that all the circulars referred to improve the conditions. I can give him the list after the debate.</p>

<p>I am also making a concession in Clause 6. The present position is that a reprimand or a caution or any fine of R4 or less is treated as a minor offence and the servant&#x2019;s record is not endorsed. I am now raising that to R10. That is in the interests of the servants.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>One does not want to plead for this too seriously, but I am apparently misunderstanding the position and I just want to put this question to the hon. Minister: If suitable alternative employment cannot be found for a servant and he retires is he paid insurance compensation in relation to his injury? But if he does stay on and he has to work for a lesser wage or salary, because of his disability, than he used to receive is the position that he does not receive that compensation? And although his remuneration is less he may still have to pay the higher contribution? Will the hon. the Minister not give us an undertaking that he will go into the matter and see whether it is not possible to say that in such a case his capital obligations will also be reduced in conformity with his injury so that he will pay less monthly? While the Minister is taking a very important step and a good step in the interests of his employees I think it follows logically that he should also consider this further step.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The position to-day is that the moment a servant has paid his purchase price in full he is given transfer. In other words he can raise a bond outside and pay off the balance he still owes to the Administration. The payments are usually calculated according to his salary and the period he must still serve before he retires, so that the day he retires his house will be fully paid for. The difficulty is this that if he is allowed to make smaller payments his house will not be fully paid off when he retires. That will be to his own detriment.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>No, the purchase price cannot be reduced. This is a concession. The present position is that when he leaves the service, even if he is 70 per cent or 80 per cent disabled, he is not covered. I am now giving him the benefit of the insurance cover which is based on his percentage of disability. But we cannot go further otherwise we shall have to make the premium very much higher. It must be remembered that the purchaser himself pays the premium. If I were to make any further concessions it would step up the premiums very considerably.</p>

<p>On Clause 5,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I took the trouble to again look up the provision that is amended here, and I think the hon. Minister missed my point that I made in my second-reading speech. The original wording was &#x201C;if a servant is convicted by a court and sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine &#x2026;&#x201D;, then there was no doubt whatsoever, he had to be dismissed from the service. That could involve any crime for which he had been sentenced without the option of a fine. Now the hon. Minister inserts here &#x201C;of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty&#x201D;. It then reads &#x201C;if a servant is convicted by a court of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty, and sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine&#x201D;. It is classified now. It applies only in the case of two crimes where he is sentenced without the option of a fine.</p>

<p>Yes, there is no question about that, but before it could be any crime if he was sentenced without he option of a fine. Then he had to be dismissed. Now, if <span class="col_6333-6334" refersTo="page_500"/>he commits two particular crimes, if he is found guilty of dishonesty or of fraud and sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine, then he is automatically dismissed. But if he is found guilty of any other crime for which he gets a similar penalty then he is not automatically dismissed.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>That is what I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>That is wrong, because I stand on the principle the Minister put when he replied. I take the stand that because we deal with public money and because railway servants should have the trust and respect of the public in every sphere, also their private life, we should be very careful. I think it is wrong in principle. I think it is a bad thing for the hon. the Minister to issue an explanatory memorandum and to say that because a servant committed a serious offence in terms of the court, nobody else having found him guilty, but the court, he should not be automatically dismissed. He can be convicted to 100 days imprisonment without a fine, and I say that the court would not inflict such a sentence without being aware of the full conditions. To me it is wrong that Parliament must come along and set an example like that to the public that it does not matter what you do outside, you can be drunk on the road, you can drive under the influence, you can be sentenced, but as far as we in the Railway Administration are concerned, we do not mind at all. We will continue to employ you. Any other self-respecting corporation or company would not retain such a man in its service. He must carry the penalty of his conduct. That is my objection to the manner in which this clause is worded. I see the point of the hon. Minister, but should not a limiting factor be inserted, for example, to say that if he is sentenced to a period say of no less than six months, then this provision will apply. If he is convicted to less than six months it cannot be such a very serious offence, and then he would not be subject to automatic dismissal and it would be at the discretion of the Administration. But as the clause is now worded, on the face of it, legally if a servant commits arson, rape, culpable homicide, anything, he is not subject to automatic dismissal. I say that that is wrong. If the Minister says that he is quite prepared to give a man who has been found guilty by the courts and sentenced without the option of a fine because he was guilty of culpable homicide or arson or of rape, that he is quite prepared to give such a man another chance and to keep him in his service &#x2026;</p>

<p>But that is what the hon. Minister is saying when he draws this distinction. I am quite sure that this amendment that the Minister proposes was not asked for by the staff associations, because I do not believe that the staff associations would act in such an irresponsible manner. Let me draw the Committee&#x2019;s attention to the fact that the previous section as it is now on the Statute Book says quite distinctly that if a servant is convicted by a court and sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine&#x2026;he is subject to dismissal. Why not leave it like that? I would appeal to the hon. the Minister to consult his law advisers again in regard to the wording here, and if he finds that my contention is correct, will he undertake when the Bill goes to the Other Place to have an appropriate amendment inserted there to meet the situation that he obviously does want to meet?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member. I think, will recollect that a year or two ago, I also amended the Act to prevent servants who receive periodical imprisonment from being automatically dismissed. I do not think there was any objection on the other side of the House. Now all the present amendment does is to say, that except in the cases where there is fraud or dishonesty a servant who is convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine must not automatically be dismissed. It is will be within the discretion of the Administration. That does not mean to say that a man who has committed rape or culpable homicide will not be dismissed. It will only take effect in regard to offences that have been committed by a servant that are not serious, or do not deterimentally affect that servant&#x2019;s work and that servant&#x2019;s employment with the Administration. But there is no question of slackening of discipline. As a matter of fact, as I told the hon. member, there are numerous cases of servants who have been dismissed for matters that have not even come before the courts. It must be left to the discretion of the Administration as to whether a servant must be dismissed. Now this particular case that has been referred to, whether it was a senior or a junior servant would have made no earthly difference&#x2014;the only offence committed by this man was that he passed certain cars where there was a solid white line. Originally he had to pay on admission of guilt a fine of R30. Instead of paying the R30 and admitting guilt, he decided to fight the case. For some reasons the magistrate sentenced him to 100 days&#x2019; imprisonment. Now does the hon. member seriously suggest that that servant with so many years&#x2019; service, who committed that type of offence, a man who had a clear record, should be automatically dismissed from the service?</p>

<p>I am not disputing at all the discretionary right of the Administration, not in the slightest. That is not what is at question here. What is at question here is the amendment proposed by the hon. Minister to insert certain words into existing legislation. With due respect to the hon. Minister, I think he creates the wrong impression when he says that this particular section which is now being amended has been on the Statute Book for many, many years. The hon. Minister changed the wording in 1963 by way of an amending Bill, and in 1960, the real change was made in an amending Bill and it was found to be unsatisfactory and last year the Minister came and he inserted these words which I have referred to and now in 1964 he is adding further words. I am not disputing the question of the discretionary right of the Administration as to who they should sack or not sack. I am only questioning the provision he is seeking to exempt himself from, and that only in the case of two particular offences there should be automatic dismissal. By that the hon. Minister creates the wrong impression. Serious offences of another nature can be committed and a man may be convicted without the option of a fine and he should also automatically be sacked, as this section originally said he should be. What the Minister is saying is that he should not be, that only a man who is sentenced because of dishonesty or fraud must be sacked. I would appeal again to the hon. the Minister to give further consideration to the matter and to try and fix a limitation if he wishes to insert provisions of this nature.</p>

<p>The point that I wish to raise is in relation to the Railway Police. I agree that this amendment is necessary and desirable so far as the ordinary servant of the Railway Administration is concerned. Of course the Railway Police are also servants as defined in the Act as I read it, and if they are servants as defined in that Act, with this amendment we would have an anomaly in relation to the practice so far as the South African Police are concerned. I am glad the hon. Minister of Justice is here, because he indicated in reply to a question in this House earlier that where a policeman was convicted and sentenced by a court to imprisonment without the option of a fine, he was in all cases dismissed from the force. Of course after a departmental inquiry had been held, but in every case that man was found so guilty and sentenced by the court to imprisonment without the option of a fine, he was dismissed. Now this Bill has to do with the Railway Police. A Railway policeman who for example commits an assault upon a prisoner and is sentenced by a court because the court considers the assault of such a serious nature, to imprisonment without the option of a fine, then you have an offence that of course does not involve fraud or dishonesty, but nevertheless it is a very serious offence and perhaps in respect of any policeman (including a Railway policeman) one of the most serious offences he can commit because he is placed in a special position where he is entrusted with the safety of that person.</p>

<p>As this Section 19 stands without the amendment, he would be dismissed if sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine. Is not that correct? We are now amending the law in this clause to provide that they shall not be dismissed automatically except in the case of fraud or dishonesty. I accept that that is a very good amendment for the Railway servants in the normal course. But the position of the police is different, and I hope the hon. Minister will indicate that he will follow the practice of the Minister of Justice. If he does not do that, then he is setting a different standard for the Railway Police who, after all, have by-and-large the same sort of powers to deal with prisoners as have the members of the South African Police. I hope the hon. Minister will give us the assurance that the practice of the Minister of Justice followed in relation to the Railway Police.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I come back again to the point in regard to which I was seeking information from the Minister during the second reading debate. The Minister said just now, on a previous clause, that the Act was amended many years ago. Let me tell the hon. the Minister that Section 20 of Act 22 of 1960, says this in regard to the question of caution and reprimand &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I know, but I am seeking information on it. We are now only busy making the law, it is not the law yet, and I want to know why we are making the law in this way. I suggest with respect to the hon. the Minister that he should not take the explanatory memorandum at its face value. The position is simply that the Act, as it stands at the moment, states two classes of crime which may be placed on the record of service of a Railway official. In regard to minor offences there is a caution and a reprimand which will not be recorded in respect of a minor offence. But when you come to paragraph (b) of Clause 20 of Act 22 of 1960, then the Minister will see that there is also a caution and a reprimand for a serious infringement which is placed on the record of service of the official. Now I would like to know from the hon. the Minister why the two categories of infringement which caused a caution or a reprimand have been done away with, because as far as the amendment in this clause is concerned, a caution and a reprimand will be classified only as a minor offence. I query that, for this reason that year after year, we have reports from the Auditor-General in the Railways and Harbours Select Committee dealing with defalcations of public money in the Railway Administration, and in a number of cases where there have been these defalcations of a minor nature, it is pointed out that the official was seriously reprimanded or cautioned, and that serious reprimand goes on his service record, so that when it comes to promotion or the placing of additional responsibility on an official, a full picture of his service and his record is presented. Now how is this class of offence going to be classified? It is being done away with. That is the information I am seeking from the hon. the Minister. I put the question pertinently: What was the reason for doing away with the two classes of offences as far as caution and reprimand are concerned?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The explanation is very simple. I don&#x2019;t regard a caution or a reprimand for a serious offence as severe enough. If a servant is guilty of a serious infringement then he should receive a more severe punishment than a caution or reprimand. If he is guilty of a serious offence, then he must be punished accordingly, and a caution or a reprimand is not sufficient punishment for a serious offence. Caution and reprimand in future will not be endorsed on his record, but if he is fined R10 or more it will be endorsed.</p>

Now the Minister&#x2019;s only answer to me when I raised the matter at the second reading was that he said that the terminal point of this line had been shortened and was now being placed in the farm &#x201C;Middelburg&#x201D;.</p>

It is not being moved to &#x201C;Middelburg&#x201D;; it has always been there. It always ended in &#x201C;Middelburg&#x201D;. How can it now be shortened by 2&#x00BD; miles?

When we ask reasons, we are entitled to the fullest information before acceding to a request of this nature.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Hon. members are no doubt aware that this Bill is the product of a series of investigations of the various aspects of compulsory motor vehicle insurance&#x2014;commonly known as third-party insurance&#x2014;as applied in many countries of the Western world. The investigations referred to were first of all conducted by a commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. D. H. C. du Plessis, a former General Manager of Railways, then by a delegation of members of my Department and the Department of Finance who visited New Zealand, and finally by a Select Committee of this House. I want to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the members of this Select Committee. I think they had a very arduous task and extremely difficult problems to solve. I think they have acquitted themselves of their task very well. I am especially pleased that the recommendations of the Select Committee, as embodied in this Bill, were unanimous.</p>

<p>The investigations became necessary as a result of general dissatisfaction on the part of the public with the way in which insurance companies generally handled the matter, especially in regard to the payment of compensation and the ever-increasing premiums. We are all aware of the happenings during the past few years in the third-party insurance field and the consequent effect this has had on the public&#x2019;s mind and pocket. Having imposed an obligation upon the public to take out compulsory motor vehicle insurance, I have always felt that the State should be entitled to know how the obligation which it has imposed upon its citizens is handled by private enterprise. As has been stated on many occasions in this House, I have every confidence in private enterprise and for that reason I refused to deny the insurance industry the opportunity of undertaking third-party insurance. My trust in the insurance industry, however, relies on the knowledge that the industry is making a sincere effort to operate a system as effectively and economically as possible. I therefore wish to take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, of reassuring the insurance industry and I do not judge its efficiency and honesty in dealing with third-party insurance by the conduct of a few companies who have been the cause of grave concern in the immediate past.</p>

<p>As hon. members are no doubt aware, the provisions of the existing Act do not call upon me to interfere in the determination of tariffs of premiums, which are applied by registered companies in respect of the different categories of vehicles and areas in the Republic, otherwise than to publish such tariffs when presented to me. This state of affairs has often given rise to adverse comment when I was called upon in terms of the Act to announce increased tariffs. In order that this position may not recur in future it is now proposed that the Minister of Transport should have the final say in the determination of the tariffs of premiums at which any registered company will in future be allowed to undertake third-party insurance. It has been realized, however, that the determination of a tariff of premiums in respect of an industry handling over R16,000,000 collected in respect of 1,500,000 vehicles, is a task of such magnitude that it requires the attention of experts well-versed in this intricate field of economics. It is proposed therefore that a special premiums committee should be set up, consisting of representatives of the Department of Transport, the Department of Finance and of Census and Statistics, as well as of three representatives from registered insurance companies, whose task it will then be to advise the Minister <span class="col_6341-6342" refersTo="page_504"/>on the tariff of premiums to be applied. Another new principle embodied in the Bill provides that no insurance company will be allowed to charge a tariff lower than the tariff determined by the Minister, thereby preventing new companies or existing registered companies from undercutting with a view to attracting business. The Bill does, however, provide that registered companies may apply for a tariff which is higher than the general tariff.</p>

<p>Hon. members will remember that several of the companies which have lately been the subject of court orders, have come into the insurance market as a result of the fact that they charge tariffs which were much lower than the average tariff and which have proved to have been the cause of their eventual failure with consequential financial suffering by the public. In order that the premiums committee may be able to fulfil its task, the Bill empowers the Minister to prescribe that statistics should be kept by registered companies for submission to the premiums committee. The Secretary for Transport will be required to provide the staff to assist the premiums committee in the performance of its functions. However, as the tariff of premiums is not the only consideration associated with third-party insurance, it is also proposed to establish an advisory committee which will be representative of all parties concerned. This advisory committee will provide a forum for discussion of all the general aspects of third-party insurance, such as the introduction of a scale of medical and hospital fees and the ways and means of giving publicity to the various aspects of third-party insurance and the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. As in the case of the premiums committee, the Secretary for Transport will provide all offices necessary to assist the committee in the performances of its functions.</p>

<p>Another very important feature of this legislation is the fact that the Minister of Transport will in future be empowered to refuse to allow insurance companies to undertake compulsory third-party insurance unless such companies have complied with such conditions as may be imposed by the Minister. This position does not interfere with the functions of the Registrar of Insurance in regard to the registration of Insurance companies undertaking motor insurance business. Insurance companies who wish to undertake insurance business, i.e. compulsory motor vehicle insurance under the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 1942, must in the first place be registered with the said registrar to carry on motor insurance business. This provision does, however, empower the Minister of Transport to impose additional conditions on companies undertaking, or wishing to undertake, insurance business under the said Act, particularly conditions relating to the giving of security or other guarantees for the payment of claims for compensation, or refund of premium moneys in the event of such companies becoming incompetent to fulfil their obligations. In practice this means that the Minister of Transport may call upon existing registered companies and companies intending to become registered companies for the purposes of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 1942, to provide guarantees which would protect the public against financial loss in the event of the insolvency of such companies. Hon. members may be aware of the fact that an agreement exists at present between the Minister of Transport and all registered insurers who have formed themselves into a registered company known as the M.I.A. This agreement provides for the payment of compensation to victims of accidents caused by the negligent driving of uninsured vehicles, vehicles of which the identity of the driver or owner, or of the registered company which may have insured the motor vehicle, cannot be established. I am referring here to the hit-and-run motorist.</p>

<p>The Agreement, is, however, at present the subject of cancellation and consequently a provision has been embodied in this Bill which empowers the Minister of Transport to make it an obligation upon all companies desiring to undertake third party insurance either to be members of the MIA or to contribute to the funds of a Contribution Fund which the Minister is empowered to establish in the place of the MIA.</p>

<p>These provisions will ensure that the public will at all times be protected against the evils caused by irresponsible drivers of uninsured motor vehicles or drivers who fail to stop after accidents.</p>

<p>Whilst I do not wish to embark on a campaign against the legal fraternity in respect of their actions in claiming compensation against registered companies, I am able to advise the House that numerous complaints were received by my Department which indicated that it was a common practice amongst claimants to deny registered companies all information in regard to accidents until such time as the companies admitted liability.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this difficulty the Bill now provides that claimants will have to complete claims forms and they will be unable to issue summons against a registered company until a period of 60 days has elapsed after the date of receipt by the company of such claims forms.</p>

<p>It is hoped that by supplying a registered company with all the information relevant to the claim, a large proportion of legal and other costs will be avoided and that fewer cases will proceed to Court.</p>

<p>Representations were received from registered companies to the effect that the present wording of certain paragraphs of Section 11 constituted some difficulty of interpretation. An effort has been made to clarify that position by re-writing paragraph (ii) of the proviso to sub-section (1).</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of the present Act all claims by third parties against registered companies must be intimated within two years. The Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, however, <span class="col_6343-6344" refersTo="page_505"/>provides for a different period of prescription in respect of recoveries by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner against registered companies. With a view to the determination of a tariff of premiums, however, it is considered essential that all claims against registered companies should be intimated within two years, and a provision has accordingly been inserted in the Bill limiting the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioners&#x2019; right of recovery in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act against registered companies to a period of two years from the date of the occurrence which gave rise to the claim.</p>

<p>In a decision of the Court of the A.A. Mutual Association Limited vs. the Administration of the Transvaal during 1961, it was ruled that hospital authorities and other suppliers of medical services to victims of motor vehicle accidents have no claim against a registered company for the recovery of any costs incurred as a result of such an accident, except in cases where the amount of the compensation payable has been determined and includes such costs. The Bill now purports to confer such a direct right of action on hospitals and other suppliers of medical services, also in cases where the amount of the compensation has not been determined, but such right is also subject to a period of prescription of two years.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that the provisions of the Act are properly implemented the Bill provides for the appointment of inspectors, and for the extension of the powers and duties of road transportation inspectors to include duties in terms of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that mony received by way of compensation is not squandered, the Bill now empowers the Minister of Transport to make regulations in consultation with the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions prescribing the circumstances under which such compensation should be paid to the Secretary for Social Welfare and Pensions and the manner in which the said Secretary shall deal with the money.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this provision seems to make inroads on the private affairs of our citizens, but, I am able to state without hesitation that the inclusion of this provision was preceded by very careful consideration of all its aspects including such matters as the composition of our population.</p>

<p>Many sad tales are told about the way in which people, not accustomed to own or control large sums of money, have been guided by less scrupulous friends always ending with sorrow and suffering.</p>

<p>The Bill empowers the Minister of Transport after consultation with the provinces and the Medical and Dental Associations to establish scale of hospital and medical fees generally which may be claimed from registered companies in cases where such companies are liable for the payment of such costs.</p>

<p>In concluding my introductory remarks I wish to assure this House that every effort has been made to avoid the recurrence of the unpleasant happenings of the past as far as third party insurance is concerned.</p>

<p>With the co-operation of the insurance industry and the medical and legal profession, I am satisfied that we shall experience a long period of stability in this field and that there should be very little ground for dissatisfaction or complaint by anybody.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>When Mrs. Bertha Solomon, who was then the member for Jeppes, persuaded Parliament in the 1940s to accept a motor vehicle insurance Act very few people realized the problems that were being created for the legislators. To judge by the speech the hon. the Minister has made this evening, he is becoming very acutely aware of these problems. The fact that this legislation has been examined by a commission which had to visit Australasia and that it has been examined by a Select Committee during two sessions shows how it bristles with difficulties and what tremendous responsibilities rest on the shoulders of those who are charged with its administration. I want the Minister to know that he has the sympathy of this House in the most difficult and complex problems he is called upon to face in administering this law.</p>

<p>This legislation seems to be an attempt to bring about a law which will reconcile divergent interests and which will look after the interests of the people after some very unhappy experiences the public has suffered in the past. We see in this Bill an attempt to reconcile the rights of the public with the rights of some 50 insurance companies who joined together in the agreement of 1942 and the one remaining large independent company and with the interests of no fewer than 15,000 agents who are all engaged in writing this type of insurance. But we feel that the most important of these three elements to be protected is the public. Some people will say&#x2014;it has been said to my knowledge&#x2014;when they read this Bill, that there is not enough apparent action taken to protect the public, that it seems to protect the insurance companies, to see that they can collect proper premiums, to see that they are protected against unscrupulous lawyers, that they are protected against too high fees charged by the medical profession and by the provinces which administer our hospitals and against members of the public. Sir, I think it is inevitable&#x2014;and I think the Minister agrees&#x2014;that when you want to protect the public and maintain the principle of private enterprise, on which we are at one, the companies should be assisted to function properly and that they should be protected against unfair competition and undue exploitation. In order to allow private enterprise to function properly one has to guard against the tendency for a monopoly to develop. Yet I believe that with this type of insurance, where the risks are high and where the profits are of necessity minimal, the danger always exists that insurance companies will naturally tend to combine in order to fix premiums and in order to try fix standards <span class="col_6345-6346" refersTo="page_506"/>of compensation, a fact which may&#x2014;I say &#x201C;may&#x201D;&#x2014;be against the interests of the public. That is why we are glad that, whereas the Minister is undertaking the great responsibility of fixing the premiums, he is fixing a minimum premium and not preventing companies from charging higher premiums. He is to some extent permitting the laws of compensation to operate in this very important field of insurance. At the same time, by fixing reasonable minimum premiums, we hope, with the Minister, that he will prevent the activities of fly-by-night organizations, organizations which spring up to rake up as much of the public&#x2019;s money as possible and then, by reason of weak administration, fail in their ultimate enterprise, let the public down, while some of the so-called entrepreneurs may come out richer than they went in. We believe that one of the most important inducements that such fly-by-night organizations can hold out in order to get hold of the public&#x2019;s money is a low premium, a premium which sometimes from the nature of things must be uneconomic. We are glad that the Minister has accepted this responsibility to see that the minimum premiums are realistic in relation to the service that is supplied to the public and that such premiums will be maintained. It is right that the premiums should be as low as possible. This is one of the few forms of compulsory insurance that we have. It would be utterly wrong if, by this type of insurance which is intended to meet a real social need, a type of insurance that is intended for the general protection of the whole public, people could unduly enrich themselves at the expense of the public.</p>

<p>It is not an easy problem to solve. When one speaks to people and examines the evidence or reads about it, the public always say that the premiums are too high, whereas the companies will always emphasize that they run this business, or if not at a loss, then almost at a loss, but certainly always risking a loss more than in the case of other types of insurance.</p>

<p>We believe this Bill to be a worth-while experiment and one which we support. But I think it would be wrong for us to say that we think this is the final answer to the problem. We believe that to a very large extent the Select Committee, which has done excellent work, has offered to Parliament and to the Minister only an experiment. But it is an experiment which, now for the first time, will be conducted scientifically. One of the problems that the Minister and others who deal with this matter had to face in the past has been the absence of really reliable statistics. The various companies kept their statistics in different ways; it was not always easy to correlate the information that was received. But machinery is now established whereby the Minister, over a period of years, will get full and reliable statistics in accordance with a system to be prescribed by him. I believe that one of the fine results of this legislation will be that, within a period of time, it will be possible scientifically and accurately to analyse these statistics and to find out what is really happening to the public and to the insurance companies in the field of compulsory third-party insurance. If it was only for that very important reason this legislation deserves the support of every member of this House. We now ensure that there will be constant examination of all the facts concerning motor vehicle insurance; we now ensure that this is undertaken scientifically and that the solutions which should be found for the problem will be based on a scientific basis. To-day, I think the Minister will agree, the situation&#x2014;and I am not guilty of a pun&#x2014;is a real hit-and-miss situation, a lot of it has been guesswork up to now. Now at last it will be possible to devise over a period of time a scientific approach to this problem.</p>

<p>One detail that worries me a lot, and I would very much like the hon. Minister to comment upon it, is the fact that it appears from the evidence before the Select Committee that as many as 10 per cent of the motor vehicles on the roads of South Africa are uninsured.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, unlicensed. It is very difficult to understand how that can happen. I noticed that some of the witnesses before this Select Committee suggested that it was due to the shortage of manpower. That may be so, but even if one takes into account the shortage of manpower, the fact that one out of every ten vehicles, something like 150,000 vehicles, travel on the roads of South Africa without carrying this most essential protection for the public, that is to say, the third-party insurance, and are not making their fair contribution to the funds that should exist for the protection of the public, makes one feel that something must be done in that connection. How does it come about? When people take to the road in a motor-car they have to exhibit a disc with a large figure in red upon it of the year for current insurance. That should be visible. Is is that these people travel with forged certificates, or is it that the police do not give attention to this? Surely with all the resources available to the State it should be possible to undertake a campaign to get these pirates, these dangerous anti-social pirates, off the roads of South Africa. I do hope that we shall not take a defeatist attitude towards this problem. It is utterly wrong that people can use vehicles upon the roads of South Africa and escape the responsibility which all their fellow-motorists have to accept and make their contribution towards the protection of the public. There will be other opportunities to discuss details, but with these general remarks we want the Minister to know that this Bill too will have our support.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House learnt with pleesure that the hon. member <span class="col_6347-6348" refersTo="page_507"/>for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) on behalf of his party supported the measure which is now before the House. Nor did we who were members of the Select Committee expect anything else. Perhaps I should remind you, Sir, that the decisions come to by the Select Committee in connection with this extremely important measure were unanimous. That is indicative of the serious attention the Select Committee gave this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member made one submission, namely, that the public should be protected in the first place. We had two opportunities of considering this measure and throughout that was the main objective of the Select Committee. But where that was the main objective I immediately wish to emphasize that we tried to maintain the balance between protecting the public on the one hand and protecting private enterprise on the other hand, and not to disturb the balance by placing too heavy a burden on private enterprise as one could very easily have been inclined to do. The existing Motor Vehicle Insurance Act gives the Minister the right to establish a State corporation without having to have any legislation to do so. The Select Committee, however, felt that where we were dealing with a social measure, where it was the State who prescribed, a sincere attempt should nevertheless be made to give private initiative, particularly the insurance companies, an opportunity of trying to strike a balance between the interests of the two parties, thereby ensuring that we brought about the greatest possible measure of public safety. I am pleased that the hon. member appreciates that point, because, as I have said, this is a matter to which the Select Committee gave its attention throughout. It was equally shocking to us to learn about the high percentage of unlicensed and uninsured motor vehicles on our roads. That is a matter which also received the undivided attention of the Du Plessis Commission. I do want to repeat all the facts but in that regard we are dealing with a dreadful evil. I do not want to anticipate the Minister&#x2019;s reply in that regard. I am sure he will deal with that aspect.</p>

<p>I think few measures have come before this House which have been as thoroughly gone into beforehand as this measure. That again emphasizes the importance of the measure before us. The hon. the Minister has dealt fully with the principles involved and as incorporated by the Select Committee in the Bill before the House. He went into it in great detail and I shall not repeat what he said. But I do, however, want to refer to a few other aspects. In the first place I once again wish to point out the importance of the fact that this is a measure which has been very thoroughly thrashed out beforehand. We had the Du Plessis Commission which undoubtedly did splendid work. As a result of the findings of the Du Plessis Commission a mission was sent to New Zealand to see how their system operated and whether it would be possible to apply a modified version of this system to South Africa. After that the measure was again referred to a Select Committee last year and as hon. members will remember the measure was again referred back to the Select Committee this year and to-day we ultimately have the measure before us. All those factors have contributed to the production of a measure which, in my humble opinion, tries to maintain the balance between protecting the public on the one hand and private initiative on the other hand.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#luttig">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LUTTIG</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was telling hon. members what amount of preparatory work preceded this measure. I was explaining the various steps and measures that had been taken. I have not seen any criticism of this measure other than that expressed in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 15 May in which they say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Third-Party Light at last: At last into the murk of recent insurance experience has been cast a beam of light&#x2026;All the obnoxious features of last year&#x2019;s short-lived draft have been scrapped. In their place are apparently solid foundations for a healthier insurance record in the future &#x2026; The Bill seems to meet this situation. Mr. Schoeman, who administers third-party insurance, will be able to order the inspection of books (without prior warning), and to call for guarantees of solvency of any company. No less important, the Minister will fix the minimum third-party premium. One other pleasing aspect of this Bill, compared with its predecessor, is that it keeps State intervention to a minimum, leaving private enterprise to get on with the job.</block>

<p>That is exactly what I said previously. The criticism concludes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Three cheers for the Select Committee. Hurrah, too, unless one is mistaken about the guiding hand behind this proposed overall, for Mr. Ben Schoeman, the Minister of Transport.</block>

<p>The reason why I read out this criticism is because there are indeed differences and big differences between the measures introduced last year and the one before the House at the moment. I think it is important that we study these differences a little closer and focus attention on them.</p>

<p>The main object of the Bill which the Select Committee drafted and introduced last year&#x2014;the Select Committee felt very strongly about this in view of what happened in the past&#x2014;was to protect the public in respect of the premiums paid and to control those premiums. I say &#x201C;protect&#x201D; and &#x201C;control&#x201D; because we have unfortunately experienced in the past that in <span class="col_6349-6350" refersTo="page_508"/>many cases the premiums collected disappeared after collection. The money was consequently not used for the purpose for which it was collected to the extreme detriment of the public. Everybody knows what happened a year or more ago in connection with the premiums collected by certain companies. We were told of cases where within six months after collection that money had been squandered and the public had to pull the chestnuts out of the fire by paying two premiums during the same insurance period in repsect of the same vehicle, while many will not receive any compensation for the premiums they have already paid. Consequently, because of past experience the Select Committee thought it fit last year in the first place to provide in this measure that those premiums should be paid into a fund, a pool, over which the State would have a measure of control. We got this idea from the mission who had been to New Zealand where they have such a pool system.</p>

<p>Secondly, the Committee also felt and provided that premiums should be collected by local authorities so as to ensure that the money would indeed be used for the purpose for which it had been collected. In other words, what the Select Committee felt very strongly about, was that from the moment the motorist pays his premium there must be absolute control and protection. When the Committee was in session last year it heard evidence, <i>inter alia,</i> from the organized insurance industry and I am very sorry to say that the insurance industry unfortunately did not submit any suggestions which would really have solved the problem the Committee was investigating, namely, to ensure that the premiums paid were safe and the funds protected with a view to lowering the premiums. They did not submit any concrete proposals to solve that problem. After the Bill had been tabled Parliament went into recess and during the recess one had an opportunity of reconsidering calmly the various aspects and implication of that measure. Those interested realized that unless active steps were taken immediately the insurance companies would in future to a large extent be deprived of the administration of this scheme. As I have said, where we particularly wanted to maintain the, balance between private enterprise and the safety of the public we then had the opportunity of reconsidering that aspect of the measure which had been referred back to the Select Committee. Other factors also cropped up. Some of the members of the Committee discussed the matter amongst themselves and it was felt that as the principles were formulated in last year&#x2019;s measure doubt would arise in the mind of the public and that we should have an opportunity of stating those principles more clearly so as to remove any doubt. Because it was realized what the implications might be the assurance industry, <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> their chairman, gave evidence before the Select Committee which sat this year and drafted the Bill and in that evidence they made the following remark which was of the utmost importance to us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The aims of this Bill as we see them are to secure the interests of claimants and to protect the premiums paid by motorists. These objects we fully subscribe.</block>

<p>Those were precisely the objects we aimed at. Because of this attitude it was possible for the Select Committee to consider other ways and means of achieving the same object, namely, to protect the premiums and to ensure that claims were met and that it would not be necessary for the public to pay two premiums during the same year in respect of the same vehicle. That was why the Committee decided to vest the Minister with power to refuse to allow an insurance company to undertake third-party insurance unless such a company was in a position to give a guarantee and surety in respect of the payment of claims and the refunding of premiums in case it went insolvent.</p>

<p>In view of what I have just said, namely, that we found common ground with the insurance industry, we can now be accused of having vested the Minister with certain powers which actually belong to the Registrar of Insurance Companies. The hon. the Minister referred to this aspect in his speech and I just want to emphasize that the powers conferred upon the Minister in no way interfere with the duties of the Registrar of Insurance Companies for the following reason: Before an insurance company can approach the Minister of Transport for permission to do third-party insurance business, it must, in the first place, be authorized by the Registrar to conduct motor insurance business as defined in the relevant Insurance Act. When we discussed this matter with the Registrar of Insurance Companies, he said the following in his evidence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition the idea is to insert a provision in the Insurance Act, subject to the recommendations of this Select Committee, which will make it obligatory for those insurance companies which fall outside, as well as those which fall within, the 1942 group, to comply with the following requirements: Firstly, the assets of such a company must exceed its net liabilities by 10 per cent or by R100,000, whichever is the higher.</block>

<p>I do not want to take up the time of the House in dealing with his evidence in further detail but I just want to point out what the Registrar intends to insert in his new legislation because of the decisions of this Select Committee; in other words, the point I want to emphasize very strongly is that by having vested the Minister with those powers we have not in any way taken away any of the powers of the Registrar of Insurance Companies. As is evident from what I have just read out he gave us the assurance that he would insist that companies must comply with <span class="col_6351-6352" refersTo="page_509"/>certain requirements and only after they had complied with them would they be allowed to approach the Minister for permission to undertake third-party insurance. This is therefore not a measure which in any way detracts from the powers of the Registrar but places somebody else alongside him. The Minister of Transport is not empowered to interfere with the duties of the Registrar of Insurance Companies but he is empowered to demand from such insurance companies such guarantees and sureties as relate to their liability under the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. I want to make this point very clear because it can easily be misunderstood and I am very anxious to avoid that.</p>

<p>It is very gratifying to be able to state that 74 of the 76 companies which are already doing third-party insurance have offered to guarantee any claim which may be made against any one of the 74 members because of the insolvency of such a member. Furthermore, such guarantee also covers the refund of any additional or second premium in the event of the insolvency of that member.</p>

<p>In emphasizing these few aspects of this important measure I wish to say that it is my personal opinion that, as far as social legislation is concerned, we are to-day doing pioneering work probably unparalleled in the Western world and I believe that if the insurance industry, the medical profession and the legal profession co-operate in an honest and unselfish way with one another the order we are creating here will be generally accepted. I am convinced of that.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that this is a subject on which a great deal can be said. It is a subject which has received a great deal of attention since the Du Plessis Commission. I want to thank those responsible for the measure before us for the good job of work they have done. The hon. the Minister has gone into the broad principles to-day and I do not want to do so again. Our first object was to ensure the safety of the premiums and we have evolved means which we hope will eventually mean a lower premium. When you discuss this matter with friends they immediately pose this question: Will the measure you are now introducing lead to an immediate lowering of the premiums? The reply is that it is impossible to say that that will be the immediate effect but what we can say is that we are creating the means which may in due course lead to lower premiums. Far be it for me to say that we have solved all the complicated problems connected with third-party insurance in this measure. The field is too wide and the problems too many to say that but what we can indeed say with certainty is that we have created the machinery and laid the foundation which will enable us to find the answers to those problems through experience and the collection of data. It is important that hon. members take note of the fact that Clauses 2 (6) and (7) have been inserted in the measure to give hon. members of this House an opportunity of discussing the workings of the Act. It is provided that the Advisory Committee must submit an annual report to this House. We know the hon. the Minister must lay down the premiums but apart from that the fact that the Advisory Committee has to submit a report to this House will give this House an opportunity of discussing this measure in detail, something which has never been possible in the past. This is an entirely new principle which has been introduced.</p>

<p>I want to conclude. If this measure before the House does not succeed I cannot see what else we can do but to resort to that step which we do not wish to take, namely, to establish a State corporation. I believe that the pattern we are creating here and the basis we are laying down will strengthen the mutual trust which can arise; mutual trust will be built up particularly on the part of the insurance world where there has been little trust in the past. Where there may have been a measure of suspicion in the past it is my fervent hope that with the establishment of the Advisory Committee and the Premium Committee this Bill will lead to the creation of greater confidence amongst the interested parties. I just want to express one idea in conclusion. No matter how good this measure is in essence it does not yet solve the real problem. The real problem lies in the number of reckless accidents which dominate our lives. This is a real threat to our continued existence. I do not want to read the findings of the Du Plessis Commission to the House. We have already discussed that aspect during this Session. If ever there has been a matter in regard to which we should have a national convention where we can pool all our resources to combat death on our roads, it is this matter of unfortunate road accidents and the consequent death and mutilation, apart from the man-hours and manpower that are wasted at a time when we cannot afford to lose them.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that we have done our best to submit a measure to this House which, in respect of third-party insurance, has to meet the problem, but which also creates the machinery whereby further problems will gradually be solved and whereby premiums will not only be safeguarded but be lowered, we hope. But that does not solve the problem. The solution lies in combating the deaths on our roads, in combating those accidents which hit us so mercilessly. If ever there was a problem in respect of which a National Convention should be held, a convention which everybody in the country ought to attend to find a solution, it is this problem of death on our roads.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The only fault I can find with the speech of the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. Luttig) is perhaps that of modesty. The hon. member referred to and accepted the judgment of the <i>Financial Times</i> in which they referred to the guiding hand of the Minister in regard to this Bill. After sitting for two years on a Select Committee and hearing <span class="col_6353-6354" refersTo="page_510"/>an awful lot of evidence, and dealing with matters that have been described on both sides of the House as being delicate and difficult, I think the hon. member for Mayfair is being very modest when he accepts that the guiding hand of the Minister is responsible for this Bill. I think the hon. member, as the Chairman of that Select Committee, was the guiding hand for the unanimous decision arrived at by this Select Committee. [Hear, hear!] It is not very often that one can talk in this House on a matter in regard to which there has been unanimous agreement, especially when it is fraught with so much difficulty.</p>

<p>I want to say to the Minister that I am very pleased that he has accepted the Bill which the Select Committee has presented to the House, because the Minister has assumed, in terms of the Bill now before the House, a large measure of responsibility for the future administration of this Act and for the administration certainly of those aspects of this Bill which the Select Committee thought it would be wise to introduce to avoid what the hon. member for Yeoville referred to as the very sad happenings of the past. When one is dealing with companies that went insolvent in the past and with commercial enterprises conducted by human beings, I do not think it is within the power of the wit of man to devise a formula whereby he will be able to ensure that no companies will go under and that no undertakings will be established that are not for the benefit of the public. We are dealing here essentially with a matter which is in the public interest. In essence, this is really a social measure. We have looked at the various formulae which have been suggested but there is no formula or law which the wit of man cannot get around. So the responsibility of the Minister is to ensure from time to time, according to the circumstances which arise, that no insurance company which underwrites third-party insurance will find itself in a position that the public who have taken out this insurance will have to reinsure, and secondly that the persons who are injured as the result of the negligent driving of the insurers of that company will suffer and not be able to claim.</p>

<p>The Minister, in accepting this Bill, has taken on a very grave responsibility, and I wish the Minister luck in administering it. I want to say to him that the only way in which the public can be assured that companies will not go under is for the Minister or for somebody to keep a constant eye on the state of insurance companies from time to time. It is true, as the Minister said, that the Registrar of Financial Institutions also has a great interest in what happens, but he is a public servant. He has no responsibilities other than those which he assumes in his capacity as a public servant. The Minister here has accepted greater responsibilities because if anything goes wrong the Minister will be blamed for it. Such is the way of public opinion. I think it is because the Minister has that responsibility, because so much more depends on his decisions, politically, socially and economically, that he has a greater responsibility to himself, to the country and to the Government, and I think that the Minister will discharge that function far more efficiently than any public servant possibly could in the result. The hon. Minister will be provided with a committee to advise him on insurance matters generally, and he will also be provided with an expert committee on premiums. The hon. member for Yeoville dealt very eloquently with this matter that we will be able now perhaps to get a scientific approach to insurance. The responsibility will be the Minister&#x2019;s, but the advice he will get will come from those experts in the commercial world and in the insurance world.</p>

<p>Now the Minister spoke about the lawyers. He was very careful to say that he was not going to be involved in a war with the lawyers. I am very pleased about that, but I do want to say that the Minister is quite justified in pointing to certain incidents which have occurred in relation to this particular legislation. The provision that no summons may be issued until 60 days have elapsed from the time that a notice is given to that insurance company that a claim will be lodged is something which, I think, everybody will welcome, and certainly the public. In 60 days it will be possible for that insurance company to assess the claim and to assess the damage and to settle the case. It was originally provided, as we know from the evidence, that an insurance company should be entitled in terms of this Bill to have a compulsory medical examination. That has not been abandoned. I wish to emphasize that. It is now made possible by means of the rules which will be published in respect of the various Supreme Courts and magistrates&#x2019; courts. I think that is perhaps one of the most important aspects of saving costs, that the insurance company can insist that the injured victim is examined by doctors and that reports as to his condition should be submitted to them, so that they have all the information at their disposal, and 60 days is a fair period in which to assess the claim and to make an offer. I have no doubt whatever that a large percentage of the costs involved in these third-party claims, which are high, will be avoided by this provision that 60 days must elapse between the notice given and the summons.</p>

<p>I hope that if the Minister will use his influence in relation to road safety, which the hon. member for Mayfair spoke of, the whole cost structure of third-party insurance can be reduced considerably, especially if it is put on a scientific basis. One of those factors&#x2014;and I must say that this is my own personal view&#x2014;which will cut down the incidence of death on our roads is the provision of safety belts. The Minister knows that there are at least two Commonwealth countries which have found, at Government level, that 80 per cent of the people killed while passengers in cars on the roads of those countries would not have been killed if those persons had been wearing safety belts. So the Minister has all the opportunities and all the responsibility and I am sure he will <span class="col_6355-6356" refersTo="page_511"/>have what he needs most of all, and that is all the help from all the people in South Africa to assist him, firstly, to reduce the premiums, secondly, to reduce the costs, and thirdly, to reduce the incidence of injuries on our roads.</p>

<p>There are aspects of this Bill&#x2014;the hon. member for Yeoville referred to one&#x2014;which deal with the hard luck cases. The Minister pointed out that there was an agreement between all the insurance companies which undertook insurance under this Act and himself relating to hit-and-run cases and persons injured as the result of being run into by persons driving motor-cars not insured under the Act. This is a most worthy provision in this Bill, that this agreement which the hon. the Minister indicated was about to lapse should now be part of our law. I think it is in keeping with the spirit of this legislation because it is social legislation. There are many hard luck cases which occur, and one of the aspects to which I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention&#x2014;we will deal with it in more detail at a later stage&#x2014;is the provision in the Bill that if you are injured as a passenger in a motor car and you are being carried for reward, that injury will not entitle you to claim if that carriage is illegal. That sounds a fair enough provision on the face of it, but originally you could only claim, if you were a passenger in a motor-car, from the driver, or from the insurer of the driver if you were being carried by that driver for reward. I do not know what was intended by the Legislature at that time, but the courts interpreted this provision to mean that, regardless of whether the Road Motor Carrier Transportation Act allowed you to be transported in a certain manner&#x2014;for example, if you contributed to the cost of your transport; if, for example, you said to the driver of the car, &#x201C;I shall pay half the cost of the petrol or oil&#x201D;&#x2014;it constituted carriage for reward. So you find that rugby teams which travel from Cape Town to Stellenbosch, for example, may travel in four motor-cars owned by four members of the team. The members of the team will obviously say, as they always do: &#x201C;Of course this is quids in. We shall all pay for the petrol and oil.&#x201D; That would, at least in some of the provinces, be regarded as carriage for reward. The passengers would be entitled to claim if the driver was negligent and maimed or injured them. If they were killed, their dependants would be able to claim under this Act. No longer is this to be the case because we have now said in this Bill that carriage for reward does not include any carriage which is illegal in terms of the Road Motor Carrier Transportation Act, or in terms of any law. I want to emphasize that there are hard luck cases. If this Bill were to be passed in this form there would be many hard luck cases. Let us take taxis for example. A taxi is the Classic example. The object of including this amendment is to avoid the claims which will arise in respect of pirate taxis. The hon. member for Yeoville said that none of us wanted pirate taxis to be included in this Bill. What is a pirate taxi when you come to consider it? Are not the cars used to convey these rugby players pirate taxis? One can go even further. All I am saying is that there are hard luck cases here. In Natal there is a place called Verulam, which is approximately ten or 11 miles from Durban as the crow flies. All the taxis in Durban and all the taxis in Verulam are registered to operate within a radius of 11 miles from a certain point in each of these two towns. If I get into a taxi in Durban and say, &#x201C;Take me to Verulam&#x201D;, and the taxi driver, who is a registered, licensed taxi driver, but is not licensed to take me more than 11 miles out of Durban, has an accident just more than 11 miles from Durban, I have no claim.</p>

<p>Yes, but what sort of claim I have against the sort of taxi driver who is prepared to sacrifice his licence for the sake of earning another 50c is of course problematical, as the hon. the Minister appreciates. I am not criticizing the hon. the Minister. This is a matter which was discussed in the Select Committee. I hope that we may be able, during the Committee Stage of this Bill, to find some room for these hard luck cases. The M.I.A., as the hon. the Minister pointed out, provides in its agreement and now in this Bill for those hard luck cases. Some of these people are really hard luck cases and, but for being misled, they would have had a claim. They now will have no claim whatsoever. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give his consideration to this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville also referred to the extraordinary situation which the evidence given before the Select Committee revealed, namely that 10 per cent of the motor vehicles on our roads in the Republic are not only unlicensed, but uninsured in terms of this Act. It is quite incredible that 10 per cent of our vehicles are uninsured as well as unlicensed, but we are concerned here with their being uninsured. The revenue represented by that 10 per cent is large. That is of course 10 per cent of the hard luck cases that we are going to provide for. Nevertheless, this apparently is the fact.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I am indebted to my hon. Leader. Ten per cent of the drivers constitute all those hard luck cases for which the hon. the Minister has provided a special fund. The evidence clearly showed that this only came about because, for some reason or other, whether it was manpower shortage, or bad eyesight, or whatever it was, they could not detect which cars did or did not have discs on their windshields. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that when the regulations are published in terms of this Bill, he should provide in those regulations that these <span class="col_6357-6358" refersTo="page_512"/>discs, instead of being white with red letters on them like the licence discs, be a vivid and different colour from year to year. In other words, it will then be visible at a glance from a hundred yards that a motor car is not registered in terms of this Act this year, because the colour of the discs this year is blue and the colour last year was red. If you therefore see a red disc or only one white disc, you will know that the driver is not licensed. I do not want to say very much more about this Bill. There is very little more I can say about it. I want to say how difficult it would be in any event to start an argument in this House about the various aspects of this Bill, about the various clauses about which there are of course a hundred points of view. We have heard a hundred points of view from our members. We have heard a hundred points of view on the Committee. I want to say to the hon. the Minister in all sincerity that I appreciate the responsibility that he has undertaken under this Bill and that I hope he can make it work. I think the most we can hope for is what the hon. member for Yeoville has said, that this will form the basis for some experience so that, in the fullness of time, we may well find the formula for this very difficult social problem and this very difficult financial problem.</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in discussing and reviewing this Act, I think it is necessary that we should first of all inform this House that the Act should be seen in this perspective, namely that third party insurance is not comprehensive insurance. Comprehensive insurance is an entirely different matter. Third party insurance was introduced in South Africa to cover those unfortunate people who were involved in accidents, but never received any compensation in respect of it, because the owners could not afford it. It was introduced originally to provide compensation for the less privileged and the unfortunates. We should not confuse this Act with comprehensive insurance. The hon. member for Durban (North) has referred to the manner in which the chairman acted and linked us together in order to make unanimous decisions possible in that way. We, as a Select Committee, can also tell this House that we enjoyed the wholehearted co-operation and assistance of the Department as such. The members of that Department aided and assisted us, with the greatest diligence and readiness to serve. We are grateful for the assistance they gave. The Select Committee defined seven principles which they desired to combine in this Act. The one principle is to provide protection for the premium payers as far as practically possible&#x2014;protection firstly against the possibility of their being required to pay that premium more than once or twice. That is the first aspect. The second aspect was to protect those premium payers so that, in the event of insolvency, they would not be held liable for claims that may be instituted, notwithstanding the fact that they had paid their premiums. That was the first principle we tried to comply with. The second principle with which we tried to comply, was to protect the premium payers against the expensive consequences of a possible monopolistic third party insurance scheme, and against a continuous increase in premiums as a result of the elimination of healthy competition. I think this Committee complied with this requirement very well, too. The third principle with which we tried to comply, was to let the insurance companies enjoy the benefit of the healthy economic competitive efficiency they are going to exercise in the work they have to do, so that the company which does this work efficiently, will also enjoy the benefit of that efficiency, and will not be tied to the block of inefficient companies. The fourth principle was to attempt to eliminate the unduly high costs with regard to litigation and the unnecessary usurious profit certain members of the legal and other professions made out of third party insurance. I think the hon. member for Durban (North) also dealt with it partly and showed how we succeeded to a large extent in that respect, too. The fifth principle was to eliminate as far as possible the claims arising from accidents in which pirate taxis are involved, whereby the premiums are being pushed up to an excessive extent. I think we have succeeded in that also, and we have eliminated that shortcoming. The sixth principle with which the Committee tried to comply was to make the application of the Act easier and more realistic. The seventh principle is to give the public, the pedestrian, the widow and orphans of the father of a family who may have been killed in an accident, the maximum benefit and the maximum compensation. The hon. member here next to me asked why there has been this change of mind in respect of a pool system which we favoured last year, but which we no longer have here. I shall try to show the hon. member that we have a better system than the original idea of a pool system. This has arisen because the companies succeeded in satisfying the Select Committee that they have a mutual guarantee among themselves; and because we also succeeded in giving the Minister the necessary means under the regulations, the power to see that the premium income does not simply disappear, this idea of a pool was no longer necessary. To this, of course, there should also be added the other practical possibilities of the application thereof.</p>

<p>Dealing with the first principle, namely, protection for the premium payers against having to pay premiums more than once per annum, I should like to mention a few examples. I shall mention only two examples. I do not wish to take up the time of the House. When we consider that the Johannesburg company became insolvent when there were 100,000 premium payers, and that these 100,000 people again had to pay a full half-year&#x2019;s premium of R8.00 each, then in respect of that one company alone, the premium payers were robbed of R1,000,000. That is one <span class="col_6359-6360" refersTo="page_513"/>example of what has happened in the past. The loss as regards the claims that cannot be met, cannot be determined. It may be many millions of rand. I should like to mention a second instance. This is one of the most recent cases, namely, the case of the Yeoman Company. This company also became insolvent. It was one of the small companies. This company had 12,656 Group 1 (e), namely, private motor premium payers, at a tariff of R17.00. Fortunately this insolvency took place only a month before renewals were due. However, had it happened six or eight months before the renewal date, those 12,656 people would have had to pay their premiums again for the whole six or eight months. The same company had 909 premium payers under Group 2 (a)&#x2014;lorry owners&#x2014;with a tariff of R24.50. This insurance is valid as from 1 December 1963; in other words, the 909 lorry owners each had to pay R12.25 again. That amounted to R10,911. When one thinks of it, lorry owners are frequently some of the poorest people. They may be earning money by daily transporting milk, for instance, at a low tariff. Then they still had to suffer this loss. They cannot afford this. It should be remembered that this was one of the smallest companies. It should be remembered that when a third-party company becomes insolvent, the claim is recoverable from the public and the owner direct in terms of the Third Party Insurance Act (Section 13). In other words, all these people who pay these premiums, still have to pay these claims in the event of insolvency. Mr. Speaker, I wish to state this clearly. The House of Assembly cannot pass an Act to prevent insolvency. However, having regard to the powers we are now conferring upon the Minister, we can eliminate a recurrence of this loss to the greatest possible extent. In referring to these cases of insolvency, I should like to point out that it is not a great percentage of third party insurance, but third party insurance in S.A. already amounts to R16,000,000 is handled under this scheme. Therefore it is a small percentage, but it frequently involves those people who cannot afford to pay it. The second principle has been mentioned by me already, namely to eliminate the monopoly of high premiums. It was very clear to us that after a Premium Committee and an Advisory Committee have analysed all the statistics and the tabulated information, a recommendation should be made to the Minister so that he may determine a minimum premium. No insurance company may have a premium tariff that is less than that minimum, but those companies which cannot undertake that work at that premium tariff, may apply for a higher tariff. There may be such companies. We may have companies which may say: &#x201C;We have so much fire insurance, and so much life insurance and other insurance, and the people insured with us already prefer to have their third party insurance with us too, but we are not going to provide it at this low tariff. I wish to charge a higher tariff because my setup differs from that of a company dealing only with third party insurance.&#x201D; This Act opens the door so that this may well happen. In other words, there will not necessarily be only one premium. There will be a minimum premium, but premiums could also be higher than that minimum premium, provided the Minister approves and publishes it. The possibility also exists that the Premium Committee will see to it that that minimum premium which is instituted is a premium which duly complies with the findings and the calculations made by the actuaries, who will make it a sound premium. In this regard the hon. the Minister and the regulations provide for this&#x2014;will see to it that the premiums collected in one year are shown in a separate premium account, and that they will not be dealt with together with a whole lot of other things. The claims against these premiums will then be capable of tabulation. They will not be hidden under a whole series of other accounts. It is not necessary to elaborate upon these minimum premiums any further. I have said the companies which, on the basis of these properly controlled statistical data, are the most efficient will necessarily reap the benefit. As I see it, that will be the norm on the basis of which the minimum premiums will be determined. The companies not having that degree of efficiency are the companies who will have to charge more than that minimum premium. The minimum premium will be a safe premium which will prevent insolvency. For that reason provision is made in this Act for an Advisory Committee and a Premium Committee to advise the Minister, and those Committees will be able to check the books and obtain the data of the company so that in that way they will be able to furnish the Minister with the requisite advice. The statistical data the Advisory Committee and the Premium Committee will have, will also be available to the insurance companies. It will be a valuable service to them. According to that information they will in future be able to determine how they may improve their own efficiency. This may ultimately result in cheaper third party insurance schemes. However, this is not a promise we are holding out. We merely trust that it may lead to that. We hope this will come about.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) has already referred to the fourth submission I have made, namely to try to eliminate the high costs in connection with litigation. I think he has adequately explained how sixty days have to elapse in connection with a claim that is lodged, and that the claims should be properly determined before litigation can start. I can explain further how we introduce the unemployment insurance so that claims may not be instituted after two years. In other words, we are providing in the first place for a sixty day protection to dispose of all the minor claims and to settle them, so that there will not always be people who think: &#x201C;Here is an opportunity for me to make money&#x201D;. The Select Committee <span class="col_6361-6362" refersTo="page_514"/>even heard evidence that there are actually cases of people who have tried to make a livelihood out of third party insurance claims. For instance, they get hold of a nurse and say to her: &#x201C;When the ambulance arrives with a patient who has been involved in an accident, you must put my number on the man&#x2019;s foot-sole so that they may know that he is my patient, or that he is the person whom I as an attorney have to protect.&#x201D; This person then acts on behalf of the man involved in the accident who may be a stranger to him, as the attorney who has to institute an action on his behalf. The person involved in the accident would perhaps never even have used an attorney. He and the company would have settled the matter easily. These people are there to canvass the patients and clients. In this Act we are trying to eliminate that.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the fifth principle for a while. Here we are trying to protect the M.I.A. fund&#x2014;and if it is no longer in existence, the fund the Minister will create. We propose to effect this by trying to eliminate the pirate taxis, as they are generally known. It should be remembered&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Durban (North) has said so too&#x2014;that the court has held that people who used this illegal transport in the past, could in fact institute a claim. What is the actual position? Do you know that the premium for a bus is R360 per annum? The premium for a taxi is R58 per annum, but the premium for an ordinary motor car is only R17 per annum. There are hundreds of cases of ordinary motor cars which carry only an ordinary premium, and many which do not carry any premium at all, yet act as pirate taxis. In the mornings these cars are filled up with passengers. Frequently it incidentally is the poorest type of car&#x2014;motor cars which are not even roadworthy. They are frequently the old dilapidated motors. They frequently come from the Native residential areas. Instead of the employees travelling on the properly controlled buses or suburban trains, these pirate taxis are filled. When such a motor vehicle is involved in an accident, they say they are paying passengers. This will now be eliminated. It is a great pity that we have to take measures against these people&#x2014;people who actually began to drain the fund. There are certain cases referred to by the hon. member for Durban (North) as hard luck cases&#x2014;the unfortunate border-line cases. It is a pity there are such cases, but the Select Committee was faced with the problem that a line had to be drawn somewhere. That line had to be drawn in such a way that the pirate taxis would be eliminated finally, particularly when one considers that they are competing illegally with the buses which have to pay a premium of R360, and with the taxis paying a premium of R58. They merely pay a premium of R17, and frequently nothing at all.</p>

<p>What is the ratio between those vehicles draining the fund in an unlawful manner, and the lawful vehicles?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>That is an interesting question. The Select Committee could not consider any ratios because there has never been an Advisory Committee, the requisite statistics have never been kept, and every insurance company simply carried on its own insurance work and nobody could submit to this Select Committee any figures worth mentioning. That is why I am very pleased that the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Durban (North) referred to the opportunity offered here for experimenting with regard to third-party insurance on a scientific basis. For that reason the Select Committee regarded it as being so essential to have an Advisory Committee to see to it that that Advisory Committee will collect the requisite tabulated statistics, and will compile them in such a manner that it will be something worth working on in the future. The hon. member need only watch the reports of court cases, and he will see how many prosecutions are instituted in respect of pirate taxis. Then he will see also how many claims are instituted, for which M.I.A. funds are used in respect of hit and run accidents. We have tried to close all the loopholes we could possibly close in order to provide that protection.</p>

<p>Now I come to the sixth point. It is the practical application of this Act, and how to facilitate the application thereof. For this purpose the Act provides for an inspectorate. This inspectorate will be entrusted with various duties. In the first place it will have the task of seeing to it that the 10 per cent uninsured and unlicensed motors are eliminated to a large extent. I rather like the idea of the hon. member for Durban (North), namely that provision should be made in the regulations for the token on the windshield to be different from year to year so that one can at once see at a distance of 200 to 300 paces whether the token on the car is of the proper colour. The Act has been framed to provide protection for the man who pays his insurance premium honestly, so that he may pay the minimum and so that he should not have to put up with the other parasites which exhaust the funds. This is one of the functions of the inspectorate. The inspectorate, the Advisory Committee and the Premium Committee are the three factors that will facilitate the application of this Act in all its aspects, and who will assist the Minister in this connection. I am not going to refer to the fund the Minister may institute. I think the hon. the Minister has done so already.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the seventh aspect, which to me is an important aspect. I said at the outset that third party insurance has not been instituted in order to protect a motor vehicle. It has not been introduced to protect the driver or the owner of a motor vehicle. Third party insurance was introduced in order to give the unfortunate pedestrian, the widow and the orphans of that father who was a breadwinner and who has been killed, the maximum protection or the maximum compensation <span class="col_6363-6364" refersTo="page_515"/>or the maximum care or the maximum assistance. Just think of a poor family of five or six children who are living from hand to mouth. The whole family is dependent on the daily wage earned by the father. Suddenly he is killed and the driver of the car which has killed him cannot afford to pay one penny compensation. He may still owe the full purchase price of the car. Unless he is insured, that family is left destitute; there is nobody to look after them. This Act is a social Act which provides for that case. This Act sees to it that we do not simply load those people on to the shoulders of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. We are now creating a proper scheme to which the more affluent people, the more fortunate people, the motor vehicle owners, contribute in order to make the future of those unfortunate people at least bearable. To me that is one of the important aspects. In order to do so effectively, Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to close all the gaps and to drag in the 10 per cent also to whom reference has been made, who have never taken out licences. It is necessary also to see to it that the insurance companies doing this work do it on a proper basis, remain solvent, and receive remuneration for their work without having to exploit the premium payers. Thirdly, the Act has to see to it that those funds should not just disappear, as they have done in the past, and when claims are lodged, there is no money to pay out to these people.</p>

<p>I am pleased to be able to say that the Select Committee also thought fit to eliminate certain agricultural implements which formerly were compelled by law to carry third-party insurance. This Act provides that agricultural implements not used for the carriage of passengers, need not carry compulsory third-party insurance. This has become necessary. Many of the farms in this country are traversed by two or three or more roads, and it is necessary for the farmers to transport their implements over the road, sometimes for quite a distance, in order to do their work. We now provide that those people need not take out third-party insurance on those implements.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I think there is one aspect we have to consider and that is that we are saddling the hon. the Minister with very much greater responsibility than he had in the past in connection with third-party insurance. We are placing upon his shoulders the responsibility, on the advice of his premium committee, to determine the premium. He is responsible for that. To a large extent we burden him with the responsibility to take protective measures, after the Registrar of Financial Institutions has registered a company as one which may continue, to see to it that that company complies with certain requirements before they may transact third-party insurance business. Having placed that responsibility upon the shoulders of the hon. the Minister, we are now giving him an Act in terms of which he will in future be able to conduct his experiment scientifically for the first time. I think this is the proper time too to make an appeal to the public to give their wholehearted co-operation in order to make a success of this experiment. My appeal is that the public should try to be more road conscious and to have fewer accidents. We must train the person not to turn to the right first before he turns to the left, in order to make a wide turn. Surely he is no longer driving a wagon which requires a wide turn. When we look at all these beautiful roads in Cape Town, the feeder roads, the fly-over roads, etc. then we realize that the Provincial Administration and the National Transport Commission already are aware of the correct manner of providing road junctions in order to achieve the greatest degree of safety.

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think it can be denied that the question of third-party compulsory insurance has been very much in the public eye in recent years and quite rightly so. Sir. The problem with which the Select Committee had to contend, was to find a basis that would be fair, firstly, to the vehicle owner, secondly, to the injured party in an accident and his dependants and, thirdly, to the insurance companies who are compelled to do this business. I emphasize the word &#x201C;compelled&#x201D; because we must realize that this is a compulsory social measure, and as such all insurance companies are obliged to carry out this business, if they are prepared to comply with the requirements of the Minister of Transport. That then was the problem of the Select Committee, but the responsibility of the Select Committee was to secure the premium income paid in by motorists and, secondly, to obtain for the motorist the lowest possible premium. In other words, its responsibility was to obtain the lowest cost for the greatest protection to the motorist.</p>

<p>When we refer to protection, we are acutely aware of the thousands of motorists who were left without cover and had to reinsure, at their own expense, when companies went into liquidation. It is not only the question of having to reinsure that is the great problem when companies go into liquidation; it is the tragedy of the unpaid claims which are left in the wake of a company going into liquidation. In that regard. I believe it would be interesting for this House to know that in the case of one single company which went into liquidation and which was handling approximately 15 per cent of the premium income of the Republic (that is roughly R3,000,000 per annum) the unpaid claims against this company, over a period of three years, amounted to over R7,000,000. That was the responsibility as well as the obligation with which the Select Committee was confronted. It was an urgent and important problem, because in addition to the financial security of the motorist, the toll of life and limb, apart from the waste of valuable machinery and time which accidents on our roads are causing, <span class="col_6365-6366" refersTo="page_516"/>there is the inevitable result of increased premiums.</p>

<p>I think it would interest the House to know that, from evidence given to the Select Committee, 3,006 people were killed on our roads in 1961 whilst 39,231 were injured. Since then those figures have unfortunately been stepped up considerably. The collapse of six of the registered companies doing third party business during the last three years involved a loss to the public of approximately R12,000,000. It will be interesting for the House and the country to know that, when we are dealing with accident figures, approximately 50 per cent of the vehicles on our roads are driven by non-Whites. I should like to make it clear that I am not suggesting that 50 per cent of the vehicles are owned by non-Whites. As far as commercial vehicles are concerned, most of them are in the hands of Bantu. As time goes on these people are going to possess and control still more motor vehicles, and I am satisfied the problem is going to become more serious.</p>

<p>Reference was made by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) to the position in New Zealand, and that this Select Committee was asked to make a comparison with compulsory third party in New Zealand. I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister the fact that we found it impossible to try to compare the situation in New Zealand with that in South Africa. The Republic of South Africa is approximately eight times the size of New Zealand. We have a vast countryside and miles and miles of road, whereas New Zealand has nothing of this magnitude. The whole of New Zealand is approximately the size of the Transvaal. New Zealand has a population of 2,500,000 and 800,000 vehicles. We have a population of 16.000,000 with 1,250,000 vehicles. So it was not possible for us on the Select Committee to take the New Zealand situation as a comparable basis.</p>

<p>Reference has been made by the hon. the Minister to the alternative that faced the Select Committee, namely, the possibility that a State-controlled public utility company should take over this particular sphere of business. I should like to tell the House that there was no evidence given to the Select Committee by anybody whatsoever suggesting that this would be a suitable alternative to what we were considering. If I remember correctly, I think we only had one memorandum from a private individual suggesting this particular alternative. What was however of interest was the consideration that could have been given to an alternative in the form of a tax on petrol in order to make up for insurance premiums. That suggestion too was not submitted by any responsible organization or body, and therefore it was not necessary for us as a Select Committee to give consideration to it.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to &#x201C;hit-and-run&#x201D; cases and other instances of people being injured by uninsured cars. It would be interesting to disclose that in 1962, 411 claims were reported to a voluntary body which has taken over the responsibility&#x2014;on a voluntary basis I wish to emphasize&#x2014;for payment to people injured by uninsured cars or payment to people injured as a result of &#x201C;hit-and-run&#x201D; cases. In respect of these 411 claims this organization paid out approximately R350,000. The outstanding claims, at the time this information was given to us, came to approximately R615,000. The total paid out since the inception of this purely voluntary body of insurance companies who came together, as a social measure, to protect the innocent person who was injured under these circumstances, was R1,333,333. This House owes a debt of gratitude to these public-spirited men who were prepared to accept the responsibility which did not legally fall upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>When one refers to insurance premiums, and the spiralling costs, one is impressed by the evidence submitted to the Select Committee, that approximately 87 per cent of all premium income received by an insurance company was paid out in claims. This means that only 13 per cent is left to the insurance company to cover all its overhead expenses and so on. The courts in South Africa have set a very high standard for payment of claims. I am informed that it is amongst the highest in the world, and something of which this country can justly be proud. Something, however, we cannot be proud of is the fact that we have one of the highest accident rates in the world. We were the highest until recently, but the United States of America has now taken that unenviable record away from us. That is something which, in my opinion, unless stopped at an early stage, is going to be responsible for a still higher premium, as the years go by. It has been the experience of all other countries in the world, where this type of compulsory motor vehicle insurance is in existence, that premiums are increasing year by year. In that regard the Minister has a very onerous responsibility to try to combat the continuing increase in premiums.</p>

<p>Mention has been made in this debate of the fact that approximately 10 per cent of all the vehicles on the road are neither insured nor licensed. What is as worrying, if not more worrying, is the fact that five out of nine motor vehicles are not insured under comprehensive insurance. That is a voluntary insurance; there is nothing to compel the motorist to take out that type of insurance. It is a worrying feature that, as third party insurance premiums increase, we find a decrease in the number of motorists who are insured under comprehensive insurance.</p>

<p>The inauguration of an Insurance Advisory Council, as recommended in this Bill, will be a very useful body indeed. It is going to serve a very practical and necessary function in the insurance world. It will be the first time that the Minister and his Department will be able to have direct access to third party insurance statistics. It will also give the Minister the opportunity <span class="col_6367-6368" refersTo="page_517"/>of ordering the inspection of books of insurance companies and of calling for guarantees of solvency of any particular company doing third party insurance. I would like to recommend to the hon. the Minister a feature which was not recommended by the Select Committee. That is the necessity, in my opinion, of insisting that all cars on the road should have road-worthy certificates when they are more or less five or seven years old. They follow this system in the United Kingdom. It is a feature which the Select Committee did not feel obliged to incorporate in this legislation, but it is one which I strongly recommend to the Minister as something which is necessary and justifiable.</p>

<p>Another aspect that I should like to commend to the hon. the Minister, and one about which I felt particularly strong in the Select Committee, is that no licence should be issued by the licensing authorities, unless the motorist produces proof of payment of his third party insurance premium. I am not suggesting that simultaneous payment should be compulsory in respect of insurance and licence&#x2014;I do not think that would be wise because of the additional financial strain that would place on the motorist. I do however think that this Bill could possibly be improved by making it a condition of the issue of a licence that the third party insurance premium has been paid. I do not believe it will greatly inconvenience the public. In effect, it will just compel them to keep their third party insurance receipts for at least two months before they pay their licences. In that way we shall be killing two birds with one stone. We shall at least make sure that a car is insured before it can be licensed. I know it will involve a change in the dates of payment of licence and insurances, but that is not an insurmountable problem.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the high costs involved in settlement of claims. But it is not only the question of the high costs what we have to consider, but the long delays in settling claims. This is a most worrying and irritating aspect to the motoring public, and their dependants, in the case of the death of the motorist. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that consideration be given to the establishment of &#x201C;special courts&#x201D; to hear all third party insurance cases.</p>

<p>I cannot do that</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>It is a suggestion the hon. the Minister may recommend to his colleague, the Minister of Justice. I think if he did make that recommendation, the hon. the Minister of Justice would give attention to it. We know of cases&#x2014;and evidence in this regard was submitted to the Select Committee&#x2014;where a period as long as three years had elapsed, before a third party insurance claim was paid out. As a matter of fact, in one case payment was made to the widow after she had also died! The money had consequently to be paid into two estates!</p>

<p>The Select Committee, in its wisdom or otherwise, turned down a recommendation that no inducements should be allowed to any insurance company to attract third party insurance business. I feel strongly on this matter. My colleague from Parktown (Mr. Emdin) and I, voted in the minority in this regard. We feel that unless the Minister is prepared to give consideration to the exclusion of any form of inducement being offered by third party insurance companies, you run the risk of having a repetition of many of the unfavourable features which came into third party business in recent years. I should like the hon. the Minister to give this particular matter most serious consideration. It may sound a small matter but, just as a loophole was found whereby lower than normal third party insurance premiums were able to be charged, different tactics can be resorted to in the form of inducements in order to attract business. In the process, increases in the premium cost and administration of companies may result.</p>

<p>In discussing third party insurance with the man in the street, one is struck by the fact that he knows so little of what his rights and privileges are under third party insurance. You cannot blame him, because he is not informed what he is entitled to or what contract he has taken on with the insurance company concerned. When you enter into an insurance contract with a life insurance company or with a fire insurance company, you are given a copy of your contract. You are able to study all your rights, privileges and your obligations usually printed on the back of the contract That however is not the position in the case of third party insurance. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that, on the back of third party insurance receipts, the most important rights and privileges accorded to the motorist should be recorded in a concise and pithy way. I do not think it is something which is impossible of fulfilment. It will make the public much more aware of the rights to which they are entitled, especially as the State is criticized for making this a compulsory type of insurance.</p>

<p>I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom when he made an appeal that this House should combat touting by doctors and solicitors in the case of third party insurance victims. That is a practice of a very serious nature indeed. I know it has occupied the attention of the Minister&#x2019;s Department. It is necessary that we in this House should give a warning to those persons, who are carrying on these malpractices, that they must cease and that they will be penalized if they carry on. The Minister should insist that the necessary steps are taken in order that this unsatisfactory feature is eliminated completely. In that regard I wish to refer to a judgment of Justice Theron on the 3rd of May, 1963, when he ended his judgment as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It certainly seems most peculiar that in both these actions against the same company, <span class="col_6369-6370" refersTo="page_518"/>the plaintiffs failed to appear. It seems to me that it is becoming a practice for people to make all kinds of frivolous claims against insurance companies in the hope that the company will, at the last moment, make some attempt to pay them something. I think that something should be done. I don&#x2019;t know what can be done to stop these malpractices.</block>

<p>I think we can leave it to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;in view of the wide powers the Select Committee has given to him&#x2014;to take the necessary action to overcome this problem.</p>

<p>I have dealt in brief outline with what the Select Committee felt were the more important features and the most necessary aspects for protecting the public. Although I am prepared to say that I do not think we have found the perfect answer to all the problems, I think we have produced a Bill which will show the direction for future generations to handle this particular problem. I do hope that this House will apply itself most devoutely, in the Committee Stage, to suggest any alternatives and improvements to this particular Bill.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not propose to keep the House long, but I should like to associate myself with the tributes paid to the Chairman of the Select Committee in connection with this Bill. He frequently guided us through turbulent waters, with the result that a very pleasant spirit prevailed in our meetings at all times. Right from the outset the Committee was fully alive to the seriousness of the circumstances that have arisen as a result of the fact that five or six companies who had transacted third party insurance became insolvent. Thousands of people suddenly found themselves no longer covered by insurance and they had to re-insure. This matter was of primary importance to the Committee from the beginning. In consequence of that, we always gave priority to the consideration of the best way to protect the public and to prevent something like this recurring in future. Prolonged discussions took place and various methods were investigated thoroughly. Various solutions were considered and ultimately it became clear to us that unless an out and out State scheme were to be established, it was imperative that provision be made to see to it that all companies who enter the field of third party insurance, should furnish adequate security. In order to achieve this, power is given to the Minister in this Bill to make regulations whereby he may compel a company to register; regulations whereby he may compel a company to furnish the requisite guarantee for the payment of claims to the satisfaction of the Minister. In order to prevent a company from using premium moneys for other purposes&#x2014;in the past we had the position that companies were found to have used third party premium income to pay fire insurance claims&#x2014;the Minister may also make regulations to prevent these malpractices. He may even go so far as to control the administration and investments of these funds, as well as the interest collected. Furthermore the Minister may call for the production of the books of any company in order to ascertain whether the company is managing its affairs properly. With these and similar measures we hope the public will in future be secured to the fullest extent, and that the recurrence of exploitation will be prevented.</p>

<p>Having made provision for this guarantee, the Select Committee felt that the matter could safely be left in the hands of private enterprise. We pursue the policy of giving private enterprise an opportunity to do business in this country, and we believe that the insurance companies and their various agents will appreciate this attitude and will see to it that the public are given the best services at the lowest tariffs. Another aspect which received due attention was the question whether the cost could be reduced to such an extent that it would be possible to reduce the insurance premiums. Many proposals for achieving this object were considered; amongst other things, consideration was given to the methods in vogue in New Zealand. Consideration was given to the suggestion that the collection of premiums should be left not to agents, or to the companies, but to the Post Office and magistrates&#x2019; courts and municipal offices, in an attempt to reduce expenditure in this way. However, it was found that such methods would not produce the desired results, and might only open the door to abuse. The idea was also canvassed to have simultaneous payment of licence and insurance moneys on the same date, and it was felt that this might lead to a saving of time, work, paper and printing costs and that in this way the expenses could be reduced. However, there the danger was realized that if licence moneys and the insurance premiums were to be payable on the same date, it would mean an excessive sum of money, a sum that a very large section of the public might not be able to afford, or at least would prove to be an embarrassment to a large section of the public, and in that way it might then happen that a very much larger number of uninsured cars would be on the roads. In my personal view it is fairly unlikely, although not impossible, that there will be a reduction in premiums. This seems to be the considered opinion of all those who have gone into the matter that unless the number of accidents on the roads is reduced, the costs will continue to rise. I just want to quote some figures in connection with accidents on the roads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The total number of road vehicle accidents in South Africa increased from 39,405 in 1946 to 121,202 in 1963, according to the figures issued by the Bureau of Statistics. Of the 39.405 accidents in 1946, 771 were fatal. 1,925 were major. 8,746 were minor, 27.953 were responsible for property damage only; a total of 3,855 of the 121,202 accidents during 1963 were fatal, 7,817 major, 21,130 minor, and 88,400 were responsible <span class="col_6371-6372" refersTo="page_519"/>for property damage only. Casualties during 1946 totalled 13,952; 850 persons were killed, 2,328 were seriously injured and 10,809 persons slightly injured, compared with 45,020 casualties, 4,294 persons killed, 10,595 persons seriously injured, and 30,131 persons slightly injured in 1963.</block>

<p>If we consider these figures for a moment, I think it is clear that the possibility of a reduction in costs is very remote. I should like to point out also, in passing, what the value of advisory committee and the premium committee can be. I submit that the two committees will be able to play an exceptionally valuable and important role in this respect. Having regard to the special experience and the collection of statistics which we never had before (statistics were never kept), I believe that in course of time a true picture, based on scientific data, will be formed and these committees will be able to give the hon. the Minister scientific and valuable advice.</p>

<p>Whereas in the past the premiums were fixed by the various companies, and it was the duty of the hon. the Minister only to announce the premiums, it is provided now that the Minister will have the final say; that having received the advice of these committees, he must fix the premiums. The hon. the Minister may perhaps find it a little more difficult than in the past, but I believe that the fact that the Minister will now control the matter, will give rise to very great public satisfaction, and I am convinced that there will be a new confidence in this third party insurance Act, and that from all quarters it may be expected that there will be greater co-operation in this connection.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Referring to the arguments advanced in connection with this piece of legislation, one cannot help but be complimentary that the case has been covered as well as it has been. Undoubtedly the legislation will do a great deal to bring about that which the public is expecting, which is to give them protection in the case of accidents. I do not think there is any question at all that the Bill will do what the Minister intends it to do. I was, however, interested to hear the chairman of the Select Committee make mention of the fact that although he was not certain that this Bill would be completely successful, because no legislation ever is, he wanted to make a few remarks about whether or not third party insurance should be a function of the Government, as a social measure. I was very interested in that, because, although, in this country we all advocate private enterprise, one cannot help but wonder whether in dealing with a matter of this kind it should not be a function of the State. Knowing the attitude of insurance companies in regard to third party insurance, is it not possible that the insurance companies themselves might not come back and suggest that this piece of legislation should be dealt with as a social measure? The problem is a social problem. The concern of most people is in the fact, that, although there is a greater number of vehicles on the roads, and the number is increasing every day, the premiums for this particular class of insurance are steadily rising. I can say without any fear of contradiction, Mr. Speaker, that the experience of insurance companies, over many years, has shown that they are not very keen on this class of insurance. I have been surprised that they have been able&#x2014;I take it in a spirit of goodwill&#x2014;in order to try and do something, to get together and try to produce something which would be of benefit to the nation as a whole. I believe that the hon. the Minister who is already busy with the unification, one might say, or the bringing about of uniformity in the traffic laws in the provinces, and who has sponsored this piece of legislation, will concern himself with the cause and causes as to why this legislation is necessary, not so much for the protection of the public, but as to what is happening to them. We hear that the hit- and-run merchant, has been getting away with it, to the detriment and sad loss of the victims. I wonder if a little education of the public might not be introduced, I rather liked the point made by the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) who suggested a document for third party insurance. Because I have dealt with this particular aspect in the sale of motorvehicles, I might be able to make a suggestion which I think will be of some use: When a new vehicle is sold, it usually carries a book showing the service and the guarantee that go with the vehicle. To-day reputable firms in this country&#x2014;and there is a great number of them&#x2014;also give a written guarantee in connection with used vehicles which are sold. A number of, shall I say, sales promotion ideas are advanced at the time of the sale, owners are given log-books, coupons and all sorts of instructions. In the case of new vehicles there is a transparent flimsy on the windscreen telling the owner how to treat the engine. I believe that it should be a standard practice at the time of delivery, for the individual, who is insuring under third party, to get something in writing, and it should be brief. The ordinary insurance that goes with a motor-vehicle, that is the general insurance, has got a very nice policy, giving in big print the benefits and in small print the disabilities. I think it is a matter of educating the public into realizing what should be done under third party insurance in the event of accidents and loss of life. I throw out this suggestion to the hon. the Minister in the hope that he will give very serious consideration to it. The small token, which is gummed onto the windscreen, is all the individual gets. When I think of the lower income group, the poorer people who find themselves involved in accidents, I realize that in most cases they do not know what to do. Then we get the conditions which were explained by other speakers this evening. There is another very serious problem which we, in this country, are failing to tackle and that is the road-worthiness of cars. Anyone who handles vehicles knows, that as far as <span class="col_6373-6374" refersTo="page_520"/>the road-worthy certificate is concerned, there are numbers of vehicles on the roads which are in very bad need of repair to put them in a road-worthy condition. In other parts of the world they have examinations. This angle has been propagated before, but because of the difficulty in the rural areas, which I do not think is valid any longer, it has not been pressed. I would say that the correct way to deal with road-worthy certificates is not to try and fix on one day in the year, but rather on the anniversary of the date when the licence was originally issued, on its birthday so to speak, once a year, at least. Every vehicle should be inspected at a suitable place, as is done in other parts of the world, and examined for road-worthiness, in order to ensure that it is in a fit state to be on the road. It is a simple thing to do and if it is done in a proper way it can be cheap, or low-priced. It need not be irksome. It is, however, one thing that really needs attention because there are vehicles that go on year after year. When some cars become involved in an accident, one says &#x201C;Well look at this vehicle and see what it looks like!&#x201D;. Furthermore there is a great deal of fallacious theory propagated in the name of safety belts. Safety belts might stop an occupant from going through the windscreen, but his neck is broken just as effectively because the belt holds the passenger fast and his head goes on. That is just the difference. It is a fact. When one investigates motor accidents one finds numbers of people with broken necks and many with bashed in faces. You will find that when a motor-vehicle comes to a sudden stop at high speed, no safety belt or anything else will prevent occupants from being killed. The psychological effect is quite evident in aircraft where everybody puts a safety belt around his middle and thinks: Well, now everything is fine. In actual fact when an aircraft comes unstuck, the seat, the belt, the passenger, the lot, goes up front and very quickly too.</p>

<p>These matters are matters which should be dealt with at the appropriate time. Because we are legislating here this evening, I think that we ought to get down to the real causes of the necessity for this legislation. One has only to look at the long straight roads which we are building, the high speed at which cars are travelling. The roads are so narrow that when vehicles pass each other at 70, 80, and even 90 miles an hour, one can feel the draught when they pass. One has only to look at the accident rates and see the sites where these accidents take place to discover what can happen on perfectly straight roads. There was a picture in the paper the other day which was an eye-opener, and one wonders how these things happen. I would say it is a matter of educating the public. The cost of licenses and insurances for motor-vehicles to-day, which are no longer luxuries but are now necessities, particularly for people who are moved away from the centre of the towns, long distances, to go to and from work, becomes a very serious and an onerous business.</p>

<p>One other point I would like to ventilate is that in the built-up urban areas one sees large numbers of accidents taking place. Third party risks are involved. The reason is that one finds a great deal of weaving, and passing from one lane to another without let or hindrance. It is my considered opinion that the time has come when we should look into this matter and fix minimum speeds on certain lanes. The driver who dawdles along the highway, and there are many of them around Cape Town where you have some beautiful roads indeed, is as big a menace as the individual who drives recklessly and at great speed. I saw some statistics compiled in the United States, where the figures were broken down. I do not propose to quote percentage figures, because I do not think anybody can do that. The astonishing thing is that the causes of accidents, which everybody speaks about so glibly, are not borne out by facts. High speed is not the killer. It is sometimes the very low speed, the dawdler, who creates the conditions under which accidents occur. People in Cape Town must know while driving on the roads and travelling on them every day how many people there are who cannot even drive on a five-lane highway without hitting their neighbour or going over the embankment, turning the car over and causing an accident. Here we have a good piece of legislation and the Minister is giving himself an onerous task to administer it. We would like to wish him luck with it. I think the Select Committee did a good job. The evidence makes interesting reading. I suggest that the time has come when we ought to consider whether or not a campaign for the education of the public should be launched.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that this Bill has received such general approval. It is a Bill which is the product of members on both sides of the House, Therefore when this Bill is put on the Statute Book it will be an Act of Parliament as a whole in the true sense of the word. I quite agree that the Select Committee has placed great responsibilities on the shoulders of the Minister. In fact, to a large extent they have given the Minister of Transport the work of the Registrar of Financial Institutions. It also means that additional work has been put on to my Department, and it is very important work and a very great responsibility. I agree with the hon. member for Yeoville that this Bill will be somewhat in the nature of an experiment. Quite a number of new principles are contained in it, and very important principles. None of us can to-day say that it will be effective. Nobody can say that it will solve all the problems or, what is even more important, that it will afford general satisfaction. As one hon. member correctly stated, in so far as the public in general are concerned, they are concerned with only one thing, the premiums, and the higher the premiums are, the more dissatisfied <span class="col_6375-6376" refersTo="page_521"/>they are. If the public expect insurance premiums to be considerably reduced as the result of the passing of this Bill, I am afraid, and I think the Select Committee will agree with me, that this will not happen. I am convinced that if these provisions are applied they will perhaps reduce the cost of third party insurance, but I do not think that premiums will be reduced appreciably. I think there is only one thing which will reduce premiums, and that is to have fewer accidents on our roads, and unless the number of accidents decreases (and the public should realize this), there is very little chance of premiums being appreciably reduced.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) really spoke about road safety. That is a matter which has repeatedly been discussed here and one in regard to which we all feel very concerned. Many serious attempts are being made to reduce the slaughter on our roads.</p>

<p>I do not really want to make amendments to this Bill. As has been said, it is the product of two years&#x2019; work. The Select Committee sat for two years; they heard all the evidence and considered everything possible and investigated everything, and I do not think it behoves any other hon. member who was not in the position to deal with this matter over a period of two years and to hear the evidence now to move amendments. We must just wait and see how the Act works and if there are defects there will be an opportunity next Session to make the necessary amendments.</p>

<p>Certain suggestions were made here which can be dealt with administratively, and which I think have quite a lot of substance. One was, for example, made by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. Mitchell), viz. that the insurance disc should have a different colour every year, so that one can immediately see whether it is the disc for the current year. I think that is a sound suggestion and it can be considered. The other suggestion he made was not a sound one. That was when he referred to the hard luck cases. I think that the provision in the Bill is a sound one, in other words, that any passengers in a motor car which is not entitled to convey passengers in terms of the Motor Transportation Act will now be excluded from the coverage of the insurance. What the hon. member really proposed was &#x201C;that we must condone illegality&#x201D;. I do not think that was his real intention. That was the position in the past, and I am very glad that it has now been changed in this Bill. I do not think that was a good suggestion which the hon. member made.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville expressed his concern about the number of motor cars which are not insured and asked what was the reason for that. There is only one reason, and that is the application of the law. When they talk about a shortage of manpower, the position is simply that the police themselves are not able to take action. As hon. members know, they set up a road block once in a while and investigate motor cars, perhaps once a year. Usually it is only when an accident has taken place that it is discovered that the car was not insured. It is not only that 10 per cent of the cars are not insured, but 10 per cent are not licensed either. The Select Committee has made provision in that regard, namely that certain powers are given to road inspectors, i.e. the road inspectors appointed in terms of the Motor Transportation Act, and they will now also be entrusted with the task of seeing that cars are insured. Perhaps that will help to reduce the large number of uninsured cars.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs asked whether provision could not be made for all cars to have roadworthy certificates before they were licensed. As he correctly stated, this matter was discussed by the Select Committee, and many sound reasons were advanced as to why that could not be done. Nor do I think that it is practicable at this stage to insert such a provision in the Act, that every car should display its roadworthy certificate. But then there is another very good reason, namely that it has been generally proved that the number of accidents which take place as the result of mechanical defects is minimal. That is not the main reason for the numerous accidents. It is not that the vehicles are not roadworthy but, as I have said on a former occasion, 90 per cent of the accidents are due to human fallibility, which has nothing to do with mechanical defects. Therefore a roadworthy certificate will not do much to reduce the number of accidents. It may help to reduce the accidents slightly, but it will have no appreciable effect. Then the hon. member also suggested that no licence should be issued until the applicant can produce a certificate showing that he has taken out his third party insurance. That is also a matter which was discussed by the Select Committee, but was not accepted by them for many good reasons.</p>

<p>I repeat that I do not think we should now start tampering with this Bill. I could also propose quite a number of amendments, but I thought that we now have here a joint product in regard to which unanimity existed, and let us accept it as an experiment and see how it works. If defects come to light in the months that lie ahead, we can always amend it later. Let us first give the Act a fair chance, in the form it was proposed by the Select Committee.</p>

<p>These are minor amendments in context but important in words. I think when the select committee dealt with this particular clause their intention was that there should be set up the Advisory Committee on Motor Vehicle Insurance and the Premiums Committee, but on reading through the text again, it seems to me that the select committee was at fault in not amending the text before it came to the Minister and the House. The word &#x201C;may&#x201D; is used on page 5 in 1<i>bis</i> (1), in line 7, where it says &#x201C;the Minister may establish a committee &#x2026;&#x201D; I think it is quite clear that the intention was that this advisory committee should be set up and that it should be obligatory on the hon. Minister to appoint this committee. The same position applies when we come to page 7 in 1<i>ter</i> (1) regarding the establishment of the Committee on Motor Vehicle Insurance Premiums. I know it can be said that reading the whole of the clause, although the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; appears, the other sub-sections make it obligatory on the Minister to appoint such a committee, because otherwise he cannot carry out the other provision of the clause. Again, I think it would be clearer if the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; were introduced instead of the word &#x201C;may&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>In dealing with the establishment of the Motor Vehicle Insurers&#x2019; Contributions Fund, I would like to get the Minister&#x2019;s reaction on a recent development which has taken place as far as third party motor insurance is concerned. I refer to the fact that certain companies or a company, has seen fit to issue a directive that third party insurance shall not be granted to a certain section of our population unless roadworthy certificates are produced. If that is the case, it occurs to me that a large number of motorists on the road are going to be uninsured, because if they cannot get insurance through a particular company, we have reason to think that they will not get it elsewhere as well. Excuses will be made whereby the Bantu of this country will not be able to get third party insurance. If this practice is permitted, then firstly, I would like to know from the hon. Minister whether that is a legal procedure, and if it is legal in terms of the original Act, whether he thinks that this is a satisfactory feature of third party motor insurance, and whether he should not issue some form of instruction in this particular regard. But what is worrying me equally as much, is the results of this deprivation of the Bantu of our country of third party motor insurance, and the effect it is going to have on the Voluntary Insurers&#x2019; Contributions Fund. This is a body of insurance companies who have come together in a voluntary capacity and they are allowing compensation to be made available to innocent victims of hit-and-run cases and cars which are uninsured. If the Bantu, in this manner, is going to be deprived of third party insurance, a tremendous volume of claims is going to come onto this voluntary body and they will not be able to stand the strain. Already the claims outstanding against this group amounts to roughly R650,000 which they will make good of their own accord. They are not obliged to do it in terms of the Act. If this stipulation for roadworthy certificates has the effect of depriving certain sections of our population of the opportunity to get third party insurance, this voluntary body will have to go out of existence. They will not be able to take the strain of all these uninsured cases and the claims that are likely to be made against them. The result will be that we will be obliged, in terms of this Act, to form our own insurance contributory fund, and that may have the effect&#x2014;I think it will have the effect&#x2014;of still further increasing the premiums. That is something which I know the Minister and his Department want to avoid. Under those circumstances, I should like the Minister firstly, to give an indication to us of what his attitude is to a policy of this nature and secondly, to ask him if he has given consideration to the effects that such a directive as has been issued by a particular insurance company is likely to have on the motor vehicle insurance contributory fund.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) has created an impression which is not quite correct. The hon. member referred to a certain insurance company or companies which he said refused to accept third party insurance from certain people, or from a certain section of the community. I do not think that is correct. If <span class="col_6379-6380" refersTo="page_523"/>that is what the hon. member meant, we must make it clear that that is not the case. As far as I know, the position in regard to one company is that that company demands roadworthy certificates in the case of certain vehicles in regard to which we know there is a very high accident figure. When a roadworthy certificate is demanded, it does not necessarily mean that the company will refuse to insure that vehicle. If the hon. member had any doubts in this regard, I think he should have made sure of his facts before making that statement. If this impression is not corrected, it will cast a very unjust reflection upon an insurance company which operates in this way. We know the feelings that exist between insurance companies but it is not necessary for us to create wrong impressions in regard to what is being done. But apart from this, the first statement that I want to make is that as far as I know no company has ever refused to undertake third party insurance although in certain cases roadworthy certificates have been required. Actually, the production of a roadworthy certificate is a matter which was discussed in a fair amount of detail by the select committee. The desirability of demanding roadworthy certificates or not was discussed and considered by the select committee. A very strong feeling exists that roadworthy certificates ought to be produced when third party insurance is renewed. I cannot see any wrong in this if it is done in the case of vehicles in regard to which we know there is a high accident figure. Indeed, it is a fact that third party insurance is not refused; it is only provided that a roadworthy certificate must first be submitted before such insurance is given.</p>

<p>But another aspect of the matter which the hon. member may care to consider in connection with his doubts in this regard is the fact that when the Minister approves of an insurance company for the handling of third party insurance, he can impose any condition he sees fit to impose and if any irregularities arise such as those which the hon. member for Springs has in mind, the hon. the Minister has the power, in approving of that company, to impose certain conditions which will prevent that company doing anything or refusing to do anything in regard to any matter about which the hon. the Minister has doubts.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>I thought I had made it clear that my objection was to the demand for roadworthy certificates from a certain group of our population, and not the whole population, and in that regard discrimination might be shown against this particular section in demanding roadworthy certificates. I should like the hon. member for Ceres to know that my whole complaint is not based on this question of whether a company is right or wrong in demanding roadworthy certificates from a certain section. My plea in the second reading was that roadworthy certificates should be demanded from all people for all cars older than five or seven years. The Minister, however, gave his reasons why he cannot accept that. My concern is that if this practice is going to be pursued, we will have so many more thousands of uninsured cars on the roads, and when those uninsured cars are involved in accident, the burden of it will be carried by this voluntary fund. I am trying to save the existence of this motor vehicle insurance fund as a voluntary organization, and not to have in its place a compulsory body such as is envisaged in the Act if the contributory fund goes out of existence, as it can do at any time they so decide. They can dissolve themselves, and then make it obligatory on the State to establish a body in their place. That is my concern. I am not concerned so much with the principle of whether a company should have the right to demand roadworthy certificates or not. I am concerned that we should keep this voluntary body in existence for as long as possible, and that the claims against it should be limited to the absolute minimum possible. It is for that reason that I should like to get the reaction of the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I will reply very briefly. There is no provision in the Act for any discrimination on the grounds of race or colour. In terms of Section 3, the registered companies are obliged to insure, but under Section 6 there are certain circumstances justifying their refusal to insure, and in Section 6 (3) a company can refuse to insure a vehicle under this Act if the company has reasonable grounds for believing that the vehicle is not roadworthy, or if the company doubts its roadworthiness. Then it may demand that the applicant submit the motor vehicle for examination. I think this is an excellent provision. On the one hand the motorist is compelled to insure, and on the other hand the company is compelled to insure subject to Section 6 (3). This really achieves the object which the hon. member had in mind when he spoke yesterday. He wanted every motorist to submit a certificate of roadworthiness. Well, it is entirely up to the company. They can demand a certificate of roadworthiness if they have any suspicion that the vehicle is not roadworthy. But there is no provision that any discrimination can take place on the grounds of race or colour. It is merely based on the question of the suitability or roadworthiness of the vehicle, and that is my policy too.</p>

<p>In moving the adoption of the customs and excise taxation proposals, I should like to inform the House that in addition to the proposals now before the Committee it has been decided to withdraw the excise duty of 2&#x00BD;c per pack on playing cards with effect from the date and time when the proposals now under discussion were tabled. The tax on playing cards yielded approximately R300 per annum. This amount does not justify the cost of collection. Some of the taxation proposals are merely adjustments in order to facilitate conversion of the present tariff to the Brussels Nomenclature form. In the case of acetic acid, for instance, the proposals represent a theoretical increase in duty on imported vinegar substitutes, and a reduction in duty on local acetic acid. The new duty formula in respect of motor cars was published for comment on 20 September 1963. No serious objections were received and it has been decided to apply this formula which entails increases as well as decreases in duty. The increases and decreases in duty are both effective immediately.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members will remember that when the second reading of this Bill was discussed on the first occasion, we discussed the clauses up to and including Clause 15. Hon. members will also remember that I was then dealing with the fact&#x2014;and it is not only a fact which all hon. members should accept as such, but one which should not give rise to equanimity, but on the contrary it is a fact which should cause hon. members concern, whether they belong to the attorneys&#x2019; profession or not&#x2014;that to an increasing extent during the past 40 to 50 years people have increasingly encroached on the terrain which originally was generally accepted as being the terrain of the qualified attorney alone. As I have said, this causes one concern, because if one regards the administration of justice in the country in a serious light, it is absolutely essential that there should be a sound Side-Bar as well as a sound Bar, and not only that, but that it should be made possible for them to make a decent living at all times. In that regard it is particularly interesting to consider the figures for the Cape Province which I have available here. We find that whereas in 1924 there were twice as many attorneys in the rural areas as in the cities, viz. 328 in the urban areas of the Cape, as compared with 671 in the rural areas, 40 years later one finds that there are 601 city attorneys as compared with 525 attorneys in the rural areas. In other words, the country attorneys have not increased, as one would have expected in view of the fact that the people have become more prosperous during the past 40 years and have also increased in numbers, but in fact their numbers have been reduced by 146; and that is not only the position just in recent years. On the contrary, there was a slight increase in recent years. Already in 1944 one finds that there were 523 attorneys in the rural areas, as compared with 671 in 1924, and since 1944 to 1964 the number of attorneys in the rural areas was increased by only two. Hon. members will immediately agree with me that this is an unsound state of affairs.</p>

<p>But if one has regard to the increase which took place even in the cities, one finds that in the 40 years from 1924 to 1964 the number of attorneys in the cities increased from 328 to only 601, while in the case of all the other professions the number was practically trebled or more. I think, e.g., of the advocates. There are many more of them, as compared with the attorneys.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with this aspect of the matter, I am increasingly becoming convinced, and I think there are many attorneys who also share that conviction, that one of the present defects in the attorneys&#x2019; profession is that there is a lack of disciplinary action on the part of the law societies as such, not because they do not want to take action, but because to a large extent they are hampered by their Act from taking action. I mention this here in passing because I want to state my standpoint in that regard, viz. that if the law societies feel that they, either by amending their own Act or through me, want to come to Parliament to obtain greater powers for themselves in that regard, I will not only be well disposed towards the matter but shall go out of my way to assist them in that regard. The reason why I say that, and hon. members are aware of this, is that if an attorney does not do his work properly there is little or nothing which the law society can do except to issue a warning and eventually to go to court and to ask that such an attorney be struck off the roll. Of course, that is not something one likes to do. One only does that when one is forced to do so. But there is a growing feeling that preliminary steps should be taken to remedy the position in order to obviate taking this drastic step of having a man struck off the roll. I am thinking, for example, of something which one finds in the English law, namely the refusal of a licence to such attorney to practise until such time as he complies with certain requirements. I mention this just in passing because I want hon. members to understand clearly that in so far as the attorneys&#x2019; profession is concerned they can never be accused of being loath or disinclined to put their own house in order when it is necessary to do so.</p>

<p>An aspect which should cause concern to hon. members who are not lawyers in regard to the fact which I have mentioned, that the attorneys are increasingly being squeezed out of their profession, an aspect which closely affects the ordinary man in the street, is that to the extent that attorneys are being deprived of work which traditionally has been regarded as being theirs, to that extent the attorney is compelled, and simply has no option, to increase his fees in regard to litigation. Because if that is all he can make his living from, it is obvious that the present fees prescribed for that work will not be sufficient to ensure him a decent living. But if eventually he has to rely only on that work, there will be no option but to increase the costs of litigation, and nobody wants that. In fact, we have done our best in past years to keep the costs of litigation as low as possible. I make this point because I want to make it very clear that it is in the interests of all of us as far as possible to ensure that the attorney will not be squeezed out of his profession. On the contrary, I want to make it quite clear that what the attorneys are asking for here is nothing extraordinary; it is not inspired by selfish motives. All they ask is that they should be given the same consideration as other professions, such as the medical profession.</p>

<p>That brings me to the next clause which needs explanation, namely Clause 16 of the Bill. Hon. members will see that in essence Clause 16 is the same as the old section, with the exception of the deletion of sub-sec. (b). That is of course being deleted because of the general standpoint from which we set out, that an attorney should receive his basic legal <span class="col_6389-6390" refersTo="page_528"/>qualifications in his own country, and that is also the basis of this Bill. I do not want to say anything in respect of the other sub-sections, but I want to confine myself exclusively to sub-sec. (h). I want to admit immediately that this is a delicate clause and that it may perhaps be said that it is not a very elegant clause, to use the words of the hon. member for Standerton. But at the same time, I want to emphasize that this is a necessary clause, for the reasons I have given, and I will explain the reasons for the necessity of this clause, but I say the wording of this clause as it stands here is not the wording chosen by me or requested by me, but is the wording asked for by the Association of Law Societies. They are responsible for it, but I support it wholeheartedly as it stands here and recommend that it be passed as it stands.</p>

<p>It has happened through the years, as the result of the increase in the volume of State administration, that increasingly more <i>quasi-</i>judicial bodies have been established. Hon. members are aware of numerous boards which fulfil <i>quasi</i>-judicial functions. I believe that just as it is the exclusive right of the attorney and the advocate to practise in the courts of the land, so it ought to be the exclusive right of the advocate and the attorney to appear before these <i>quasi</i>-judicial bodies to plead the cases of persons and companies and interested parties. I believe, together with the Law Society, that we should put a stop to another problem, viz. the fact that an attorney is struck off the roll because of unprofessional conduct. One no longer wants him to be a member of the attorneys&#x2019; profession and one does not wish to give him the right to practise, but nothing prevents him from posing as a consultant in some sphere, and then he simply has free access to these <i>quasi</i>-judicial bodies. Hon. members would be surprised at the number of people who pose as consultants, not only attorneys who have been struck off the roll, but other people who should not be entrusted with such matters, often people who cannot make a living in any other way; they pose as consultants and help their clients from the frying-pan into the fire. It is also surprising how many clients such people are able to find before they have played out their role and the public discovers that they cannot really assist them in any way. I am concerned, although strictly speaking it does not fall within my functions, that people who are not attorneys&#x2014;so I am informed and I have seen examples of it&#x2014;even go in for conveyancing. People who are not attorneys at all prepare documents, which do not have to be certified by an attorney, in regard to conveyancing. I think hon. members will agree that it is not fair that attorneys should have to face this unfair competition, bearing in mind that the attorney is bound by certain ethical principles, that he cannot advertise, that he has to maintain a professional status, something which these other people do not have to do and which makes it increasingly difficult for him. Attorneys in the rural districts inform me that there are large areas of the platteland where an attorney dare not charge a fee for drawing up a will. He must simply do it gratis because there are so many other people who for the sake of other incidental business offer, and even advertise in secret or in other ways, to draw up wills gratis for members of the public, and then the attorney is also compelled to do so in order to retain his clientele to some extent. Hon. members will agree that it is not fair that the attorney should be faced with such competition.</p>

<p>Hon. members also know that a large proportion of the attorney&#x2019;s income is derived from administering estates. I realize that I am treading on very delicate ground here, but I want to state the case very pertinently and clearly. It happens that too many other people enter this sphere without it really being their basic profession, or without it being an aspect of the activities from which they earn their main income. That is not a sound state of affairs. I fully realize that there are many organizations which have obtained vested rights in this sphere through the years. The attorneys also realize it, but I feel that the time has arrived that the interested parties should be brought together in order to demarcate spheres of activity; that they should decide where the work of the one begins and where the work of the other ends. Hon. members are aware of the fact that in past years much ill feeling has been engendered because of the fact that the one has encroached on the terrain of the other, and that happens because the various terrains have never been properly demarcated yet. It is true that very wide powers are asked for in this clause, not on my initiative but on the initiative of the Law Society. I intend, if these powers are granted to me, to exercise them in the closest collaboration with the bodies concerned; to give the fullest opportunity to all those affected, or who may or will be affected to study the draft regulations, to make representations in that regard and to consult with one another. Perhaps this is a matter which we need not debate fully in this second reading, but which should rather be debated in the Committee Stage. I am aware of the fact&#x2014;and I want to respect it&#x2014;that there are people who have obtained vested rights in this regard. I need not mention names on this occasion. Hon. members know those bodies just as well as I do. But in the past unfortunately we made no progress in all the attempts we made in that regard, for the simple reason that we had no authority to take any steps. This clause will give the Minister the authority necessary to put this matter on a sound basis. That is what I have in mind in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>The only other two things which I still have to explain in this Bill are, firstly, Clause 20, which only protects the rights of persons who are studying overseas at present. I want to confine myself to Clause 18, which contains the other main principle of this Bill, viz. the investment of the trust funds of an attorney. It <span class="col_6391-6392" refersTo="page_529"/>is a lengthy clause and in the main, except for what I am going to mention now, it contains the same provisions as the old section. The deviation contained in this clause, and which I want to recommend to hon. members, is that every attorney, as hon. members know, must keep a trust account and a private account, but the trust account which the attorney has to keep at present is a dead account; the money in it is unproductive, and I think all hon. members will agree with me that if one can turn unproductive money into productive money it is not only in the interest of the individual but also in the interest of the economy of the country as a whole. Therefore in this clause we accept the principle of turning this dead money into live money, and of course the only way to do that is to invest that money. As soon as one invests these trust funds, the question of course arises as to who should receive the interest on that money. In this regard there are three alternatives. One can firstly take the standpoint that the interest should go to the various clients; one can adopt the standpoint that the interest should go to the attorneys, and there are countries&#x2014;<i>inter alia,</i> Britain, if I remember correctly&#x2014;where it goes to the attorney. Or else one can adopt the standpoint which is adopted in the Bill, that it should go to the Fidelity Fund. In our consultation we were confronted with these three ideas, and the Law Society and I came to the unanimous decision that the fairest thing was for the interest on this money to be paid over to the Fidelity Fund. Hon. members may perhaps ask me why it should not go to the client, but the reply to that is very simple. In the first place it cannot go to the client because it is almost impossible to allocate this money. All attorneys know&#x2014;and I mention it only for the information of lay members of this House&#x2014;that an attorney has to deal with the accounts of 101 different clients; in the one case he is dealing with an account of perhaps R10, and in another case with an account of R40, and in the third case with an account of R400, and it is an impossible task to allocate that interest to the various clients at the end of the financial year or at any other time. Secondly, it is a fact that the Fidelity Fund was established and is maintained by the attorneys for the very purpose of protecting their clients&#x2014;not for the protection of the attorneys but for the protection of their clients. Every attorney has to make an annual contribution to that fund, otherwise he dare not practise. That contribution has increased over the years, with the result that at the moment it means that the attorney has to make an appreciable contribution to that fund every year. The present amount which the attorney has to contribute is a minimum of R60, for which the attorney receives absolutely nothing. But not only does he have to contribute this R60; he must further pay the bank fees in connection with that account of his own pocket, and he must pay the audit fees in respect of that account. Hon. members will therefore see that an appreciable amount has to be paid in this way by every attorney, for which he in fact receives nothing in return. If, therefore, we upset the principle contained in this clause, viz. that the interest of trust funds should be paid into the Fidelity Fund, we not only have the assurance that that fund will be fairly strong, but there is at least the expectation that as this fund becomes stronger in this way, the contribution of the attorney can be reduced <i>pro rata.</i> I think it is no more than fair that it should be done in that way. Hon. members will also see that such moneys can be invested in any bank, building society or other financial institution approved for this purpose. In the Committee Stage I will move an amendment to the definition of &#x201C;banking institution&#x201D; to include certain financial institutions which have brought it to my notice that they have been excluded from this definition. I want to make it quite clear that the institutions in which these investments can be made are the soundest financial institutions in the country, and that there is no chance of the clients&#x2019; money being speculated with, as the result of which the client will run the risk of losing his money. The institutions in which such trust funds can be invested are simply of such a nature that no risk is involved, because these institutions are properly controlled by legislation.</p>

<p>These are the main principles of this Bill. This Bill, as I explained in the beginning, really emanates from the Associated Law Societies. It is a Bill which I can confidently ask hon. members to accept as it stands here, because it is one which will not only greatly benefit the attorneys&#x2019; profession, but also the administration of justice in general.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has said that this is not a piece of rush legislation; that it is a piece of legislation which has been the subject of discussion between the hon. the Minister and the various law societies over a considerable period of time. We have had this Bill in our hands for quite a considerable period, since the hon. the Minister talked out time on this same measure some few weeks ago. Sir, I think this is a very important measure; there I agree entirely with the hon. the Minister. It is a measure which required the very close scrutiny of this House because our legal profession in South Africa is one which I believe we can proudly say stands as high as the legal profession of any country in the world. That applies both to the Side-Bar and the Bar, and above all, it applies to our magistrates and the judiciary of this country, who, I believe, have gained a reputation far greater in the affairs of the wide world than even the importance of this country of ours warrants. I want to say immediately that I agree with the hon. the Minister that this being a Bill which deals with a great deal of detail, the best opportunity of dealing with many of these matters will be in the Committee Stage, but I would like to say in general that we on this side of the House approve of the provisions of this Bill. There are exceptions which will be dealt with in the Committee Stage. I wish immediately <span class="col_6393-6394" refersTo="page_530"/>to deal with a matter to which the hon. the Minister himself referred and that is the power which this Bill gives to the hon. the Minister to provide by regulations, &#x201C;which act shall not be performed by any person other than an attorney, notary and conveyancer or an agent referred to in Section 22 of the Magistrate&#x2019;s Court Act&#x201D;. Sir, as a member of the profession I know that throughout the years during which I have been a member of the profession this has been a burning question as far as the attorneys&#x2019; profession is concerned. I accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that in respect of various matters there are established rights which must be taken into account. Perhaps it is a pity that a measure dealing with this matter was not introduced many years ago. It has, of course, always been a somewhat contentious matter. I would like to say at once that although this provision has been inserted in the Bill with the full approval of the four law societies, I as a member of one of those law societies regret that it was necessary in the end to include it in this measure in this particular form. I realize that there are very great difficulties attached to this matter and I realize that a Minister of Justice must on occasion accept responsibility.</p>

<p>It is a question of formulation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a question of formulation and of consultation with the interested parties. But I believe that in the final result this House itself has or should have a responsibility in respect of this matter. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that we on this side are indebted to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) for designing an amendment which will be moved in the Committee Stage and which I sincerely hope will be accepted by the hon. the Minister because I believe that it will entirely dispose of the suggestion that arbitrary power is being vested here in the hands of the hon. the Minister, and through him, the Cabinet, without this House having any say in the matter. I believe that the amendment is merely designed to provide for Parliament to have an opportunity of dealing with the matter after the decision has been taken and, if it sees fit to do so, to reverse that decision. I feel that this is an amendment which should be seriously considered by the hon. the Minister. I would like to say at once that as a member of the attorneys&#x2019; profession myself I believe it would be in the interests of the profession and of the law societies, and it would certainly remove an onus from the shoulders of the hon. the Minister, which I do not think should be placed on his shoulders. I believe that in the final result it should be placed squarely on the shoulders of this House. I hope that when we come to the Committee Stage we will be able to convince the hon. the Minister that it is desirable to accept such an amendment.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not propose to traverse the detailed provisions of this Bill. The hon. the Minister has been good enough to deal with the various clauses. If I may say so, when he dealt with the earlier clauses on another occasion he did so in perhaps even greater detail than the hon. the Minister would normally have done. He was batting out time, and with a straight bat he succeeded in doing so, and carried off the honours of the day. Sir, the provisions of this Bill will have to be looked at very carefully because it is quite clear that it is very necessary to place on a proper basis the affairs of the second estate, if I may use that term, i.e. the attorneys, who form a very important part of the legal profession. I must say that I agree with the hon. the Minister that it is very necessary that the growth of <i>quasi</i>-judicial boards, in a society which has changed immensely in the light of modern development, should be looked at carefully. There may be cases in which there are established rights, and I am very glad that the provision which is before us makes it possible to take established rights into account, even if it involves the rights of a particular individual. I think it was a very wise decision to frame the provision in this particular way.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister has referred to the question of trust funds. I would like to say immediately that I think that in conjunction with the law societies a very reasonable and sensible provision has been devised. I think anyone who has practised as an attorney knows that there is a certain amount of hard money, held on behalf of other persons, which sits in the account of the bank. I believe it is reasonable that the matter should be dealt with as it is dealt with here. I personally think it would have been quite wrong to have allowed attorneys to benefit directly from the interest earned on those funds. I believe that this provision, which will ensure an even stronger Fidelity Fund, is one which is in the interests of the public. I think it is a very reasonable solution of the whole problem. I happened, a while ago, to talk to a bank official and I said that only the bankers would lose as a result of the provision. His reply was: &#x201C;Oh, no, we win both ways; you see, even if the money comes out of your account, it still comes back into the banking system so this does not affect us in the slightest.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, I do not propose to go through all the provisions of the Bill, but I would like to say that it is a good thing to find that there has been this tremendous growth of bilingualism amongst the attorneys of this country. For my part I believe it is reasonable, in respect of persons who qualify hereafter, to require them to have at least a reasonable basic knowledge of both languages. I believe that the provision here that they should have passed both English and Afrikaans in the matriculation examination is a reasonable one. I believe in the end this will be regarded as something which is of very great importance to the profession. I know that there will be difficult <span class="col_6395-6396" refersTo="page_531"/>cases, and I wonder whether persons who already in the process of studying for their matriculation examination should not be given a period within which to qualify in the second language. Then there are also the cases of persons who obtain their qualifications overseas. I think that is a matter which should perhaps be looked at.</p>

<p>Then there is a further very important matter which I would like to raise with the hon. the Minister and that is the question of attorneys who have been struck off the roll. I understand that the practice is that no further examination of the rights or wrongs of those cases where there have been breaches of our law in respect of trust funds takes place; that apparently no further action is taken unless there is a recommendation from a particular law society. I would like to say that I believe that where an attorney has been guilty of improper conduct &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if you feel that I should not proceed with the matter further I do not propose to do so. There is a provision dealing with trust accounts, however, which makes this very relevant. I believe that there is a very heavy onus on the Minister. My belief is that in the vast majority of cases where there has been misfeasance there is a criminal responsibility. I believe that there have been far too many cases in which there has been a misfeasance and where persons have been struck off the roll, where there has been no prosecution. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister can give us any further information in this regard. I believe it is in the interests of the profession that the highest standard should be maintained.</p>

<p>Sir, there will be a further opportunity of dealing with the provisions of the Bill in detail. I welcome this Bill very much indeed. I think there are certain provisions which will have to be looked after very carefully. I believe it would be advisable to introduce certain safeguards, but I believe that in conjunction with the law societies the hon. the Minister has produced a Bill, most of the provisions of which are entirely free from objection or even query. I can only express the hope that in respect of some of the other matters to which I have referred, better solutions will be found than those contained in the Bill. In these circumstances we on this side of the House support this Bill and will be happy to assist in its passage through this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister at the outset for having introduced this measure. I am very pleased to be able to rise and discuss this measure, because I have on two occasions already introduced motions on this matter in this House. We in South Africa are the only people in the world who apply the Roman-Dutch law, know that the golden era of Rome was the time when her legal profession flourished. We know also that the golden era of Holland was the time when her legal profession flourished. I feel that in South Africa there has been erosion of our legal profession, which started with the attorneys, and therefore I am so pleased that the hon. the Minister has taken the trouble to introduce this measure here, as he is now putting a stop to that erosion which began with the attorneys. I should like to emphasize that the profession of an attorney must be regarded as the broad basis on which the pyramid of the hierarchy of our administration of justice is founded. If this broad basis is unsound, then the entire hierarchy of our administration of justice is unsound, and then it will adversely affect our administration of justice in South Africa. Attorneys are responsible for initiating virtually all litigation in this country. All civil matters, whether in the superior or the inferior courts, commence in the office of the attorney. He initiates the processes which start the lawsuit; he guarantees the costs incurred in connection with the matter, and he in turn must recover those costs from his client. He briefs the advocate and the advocate looks to him for his fees. In other words, the advocate are also dependent on the attorneys. Without the attorneys the advocates cannot exist, and the Judges are drawn from the ranks of the advocates. If you do not have a sound body of advocates, you cannot have a sound judiciary. So you see that the broad basis on which everything rests really is a sound body of attorneys. If the attorneys suffer want, the advocates also will be affected adversely, and so will the judiciary. If the attorneys&#x2019; profession as such does not attract people of good character and calibre, those other orders in the highest courts of our country will also suffer as a result. For the attorneys&#x2019; profession to attract those good and honourable people, it has to offer its members a good livelihood. It is a fact that in recent times it has not offered such a good livelihood to all. In recent years I have complained about the lot of the attorneys&#x2019; profession.</p>

<p>I should like to show in broad outline from what the attorney really earns his living. Take firstly the legal work, that is to say litigation. There are not many civil suits in the rural districts. If an attorney in the rural areas had to make his living from civil work, he would die of starvation, for hardly 10 per cent of his income is derived from actual legal work in the rural areas. That is the reason why there is an increase in the number of attorneys moving to the cities, for at the present time you find most of the legal work in the cities. Because the attorneys are being compelled to an increasing extent to look to legal work for their living, it is a fact that the number of attorneys in the rural areas has decreased. I should like to emphasize that the rural areas cannot do without the attorneys. The attorney is a particularly important person in any rural town or district. He renders <span class="col_6397-6398" refersTo="page_532"/>services to that community; he usually becomes the mayor; he serves on the town council; he serves on all the boards; he renders a public service to that town. He plays an important role in that small community. Because their numbers are now dwindling in the country districts, those communities are so much the poorer without them.</p>

<p>I come to the second source of income, and this is conveyancing. I am now speaking particularly as a rural attorney, and I am not referring to the urban attorneys. In the rural areas conveyancing has always gone hand in hand with the other remunerative work that goes with it, that is to say, the commission on the sale of property, etc. The sale of property has also gone out of his hands now, and he is dependent only on the actual conveyancing. But you have to remember, Sir, that he always has to share that income with his correspondent who has to do the actual registration work in the office of the Registrar of Deeds. In this respect also, therefore the rural attorney is limited as regards his income.</p>

<p>Thirdly there is the matter of administration of estates, as the hon. the Minister has said. In that respect also the attorney has to cope with great competition, and in recent years he has forfeited most of his income from that source also. Take the fourth source of income, such as insurance agencies, auctioneer&#x2019;s work, and other agency work. As regards insurance work in the country districts at the present time, you hardly find a garage to-day which is not an agent of an insurance company. I know of many shops in the rural areas which are also doing insurance agency work because they then get cheaper insurance for themselves. So insurance work on the rural areas has gone out of the hands of the attorneys almost completely. Then most of the big companies, such as Sanlam and the Old Mutual to-day have their own offices in most of the rural towns. So as regards insurance work, it is no longer a source of income for the attorney either.</p>

<p>Then I come to his last source of income, namely the <i>quasi</i>-judicial work. We know that many people in the rural areas now also appear before road boards and other boards, whereas formerly only the attorneys appeared for them. Now any person appears before them as a consultant of a client. In respect of public auctions, the attorney also has to compete with auctioneers to hold that work in the rural areas.</p>

<p>So you see, Mr. Speaker, there has been much erosion as regards the attorneys&#x2019; profession. I am pleased the hon. the Minister has now thought fit to come forward with this legislation.</p>

<p>As regards the trust fund, I am very pleased he has met the profession to this extent. That trust fund really places a very great burden upon the attorneys. I think it is the only profession in the country working with trust funds where the members have to guarantee that they will deal with trust funds in a proper manner. There are many other people who handle trust funds. I could mention them by name, but it is not necessary; we do not wish to poke each other in the eye. But not one of the other professions handling trust moneys has a fidelity fund such as that of the attorneys. The right to invest their trust-moneys is a tremendous concession to the attorneys. You know, Sir, that on every cheque the attorney pays into his bank to his trust account, he has to pay the commission. The client does not pay it. The attorney pays the banking fees. In addition, he has to pay R60 per annum to the guarantee fund. At first it was R20, and at present it is R60. I know of young men who came from Stellenbosch University to practise in the Free State, and who could hardly afford to pay that first R60 as a deposit in the trust fund in order to be able to practise. This guarantee fund will now be strengthened by the interests earned on that trust money. We should remember that that fund is not there for the benefit of the attorney. It is there for the client. And the interest that money will earn will indirectly go back to the client owing to the strengthening of the fund. In other words, it is not a security for the attorney, but a security for the people whose money is handled on trust. I am very grateful to the Minister for this provision.</p>

<p>I am satisfied with the provision in connection with <i>quasi-</i>legal work, but if improvements could be made, such as the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) has indicated, I shall welcome them. I shall do anything to get together at a round table conference all the people who are interested in the administration of estates, so that we may discuss the matter. In the past the attorneys&#x2019; profession has always been in the unenviable position that it has tried to negotiate but the other people refused to talk to them. If only we could discuss the matter, I think the matter could be put right. I do not wish to say any more on this subject. I am very pleased about the reception this measure has had from both sides of the House. It is a source of great satisfaction to me.</p>

He said this Bill was important because it dealt with attorneys; that you had to have healthy attorneys to have a healthy Bar and that you had to have a healthy Bar to have a healthy Bench. I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. gentleman. When he refers to the motions he has introduced on previous <span class="col_6399-6400" refersTo="page_533"/>occasions into this House, one must remember that the hon. member also introduced a motion in which he asked for fusion &#x2026;</p>

I am very gratified to find that the hon. member for Heilbron now no longer feels that there should be fusion between the attorneys and the advocates.

<p>No, I am not being nasty about it. I am never nasty towards my colleagues at the Bar.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister has somewhat glossed over some aspects of this Bill. One of those aspects is the question of university education. As I understood the hon. Minister he said he thought it was a good principle that one should qualify in one&#x2019;s own country. There is indeed something to be said for that principle. If the university education which is referred to in this Bill had anything to do with a legal qualification but it has not. In the Attorneys Act, the Act we are now amending, provision is made that if you have a degree then instead of doing five years&#x2019; articles you need only do three years. In addition, of course, you have to pass your normal professional examination and your practical examination. But if you have a university degree your period of articles is only three instead of five years.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Even if it is not a legal degree.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Quite so. That degree may be a B.Sc. or a B.Com. or a B.A. degree. It is also provided in the law as it now stands that in respect of certain overseas universities such degrees can be recognized and, if recognized, the person could be exempted from two years of his articles. That is now being done away with and I think it is unnecessarily being done away with. The hon. the Minister may have a good reason for it but he has not advanced it. When he introduced this Bill and on a previous occasion I heard no good reason why it is necessary to do away with this. The principle that is involved here is a very simple one. As I say, you can have a B.Sc., B.Com. or a B.A. degree but that is not a qualification for law. It is an element of education. Apparently the legislators felt&#x2014;and this is the only reason I can find for this provision&#x2014;that if a man were educated, if he had a B.A. degree from a recognized university, he was the sort of man you could exempt from two years&#x2019; articles. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that if one has a degree from an overseas university, a university which is recognized by the Minister as a university of standing&#x2014;and I am sure nobody will say there are not many such universities outside the borders of the Republic&#x2014;then surely one is as educated as though one had a degree from a South African university, and perhaps more educated in many respects in the sense that one&#x2019;s education is broader because one has had it amongst other people in different places. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not reconsider this aspect of the Bill or perhaps withdraw this aspect completely when we come to the Committee Stage. I shall anticipate what the hon. the Minister might say. He may not say it; he can stop me if he is not going to say what I am going to say then I shall not say it! If the hon. Minister is going to say that a person can get recognition from a South African university if he has an overseas university degree, then I say that is certainly not universal practice in South Africa. As far as I am aware it is not the practice of South African universities to say: &#x201C;If you have such and such a degree I am prepared to give you one of mine; just come and register yours and I will give you my degree.&#x201D; They will recognize that degree and perhaps admit you to status if you wish to proceed to a higher degree than the one you have. In that case you will get status and recognition. But I know that is not so in the case of a number of universities. I doubt very much whether that is the position in the University of Cape Town. None of the universities that I know do it. I think it is a universal law with universities that if you wish to take a degree they will give you credit for some subject which you took at another university or they will admit you to status to take a higher degree but that is as far as they will go. I regard this as a retrograde step because it has nothing to do with legal training whatsoever. If the hon. the Minister will confirm that that is so I hope he will delete this clause.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) has referred to the growth of bilingualism in South Africa and how encouraging it is to find this amongst attorneys. The hon. member for Germiston (District) expressed a thought, of course, which we all have. It is highly desirable that everyone in South Africa should be bilingual.

I do not believe every attorney in Durban is going to be bilingual for a very long time, not because he never could speak Afrikaans, but even if he could speak Afrikaans there is so little opportunity for him to speak it that he does not become bilingual.</p>

<p>I am no exception, Sir. I live in Durban and we speak English most of the time. Occasionally one has to cross-examine somebody in Afrikaans. I will be quite frank, I am at a disadvantage when it comes to that compared with my colleague here, the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson), who is a bad example because he is so highly bilingual, compared with most colleagues in other provinces. But this is a consummation devoutly to be wished for and one hopes that it will come. I wonder why&#x2014;and I just wonder this because we have two Bills before the House although we are only discussing this one&#x2014;it is matriculation English and Afrikaans for the attorney, whereas it is university English and Afrikaans for the advocate.</p>

<p>I am against the clause as it stands at the moment. The hon. member for Germiston (District) indicated why we were against it, namely, that we did not know what jobs were going to be reserved. The hon. member for Heilbron said that practically every garage in the country was an agent for an insurance company.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) indicated what it would be.</p>

<p>The division of the Bar is, of course, a division between the Bar and the Side-Bar which also amounts to a sort of job reservation in the legal profession. Only advocates can practise in the Supreme Court; attorneys cannot go there. Only attorneys and advocates can represent people in the magistrate&#x2019;s court. But there is a very good reason for that. The reason is that these people are qualified and trained and specialized to deal with Supreme Court matters. The same thing applies in the case of the magistrate&#x2019;s court. But the basis of that job reservation is qualification. Indeed, I go so far as to say that the main reason for it, perhaps the best reason for it, is that it saves litigation costs in the end if you have an expert doing the job. Is that going to be one of the bases upon which the hon. the Minister is going to reserve work for attorneys? Is it that only they are qualified to do this work? Because I am quite sure there are many accountants in this House who will disagree that there are certain jobs which the attorneys are qualified to do and they are not. They disagree with that. They may be right. I do not know. I do not want to pass judgment now. But there may be such cases. Is that going to be one of the criteria which will guide the hon. the Minister in deciding which of the jobs will be reserved for attorneys?</p>

<p>The hon. Minister spoke about Clause 17 which deals with appearances before <i>quasi-</i>judicial bodies. As the hon. Minister has said there are many guan-judicial bodies. There is the Rent Board, for example. Does it not often happen that a group of tenants in a block of flats decide to bind together and go to the Rent Board and complain about the increase in their rent? They do not want to get involved in any expense so they delegate one of the residents to go to the Rent Board and argue their case for them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>There you are, Sir. How is one to know that the hon. Minister has not got that in mind? Take the Group Areas Board. It often happens in Durban that the Indian ratepayers in Durban delegate their chairman or their secretary or some other person with the gift of the gab to represent that community&#x2019;s interests at the Group Areas Board. Does the hon. Minister intend to prevent that? The hon. Minister is silent, Sir, about that. Apparently if we are not going to have it for the Rent Board we might have it for the Group Areas Board. If the hon. Minister can say before which of these <i>quasi</i>-judicial bodies he is going to allow persons other than attorneys and advocates to appear, then surely they should be mentioned in the Bill; surely we should decide that here. I do not think it is something which should be decided by the Minister and his Department.</p>

<p>There is one other small matter which I want to raise with the Minister and ask him for his reasons.</p>

<p>Sir, I am sure the House is not interested. But I was constrained to reply to the unfortunate, unnecessary and unhonourable remark of the hon. gentleman.</p>

<p>There is another matter I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister. When the hon. the Minister introduced this Bill some time ago he spoke at some length about the various clauses in the Bill which he did not deal with to-day. One of the provisions was that advocates have to have a six-month period of grace before they practise as attorneys. That provision of course has always been in our law in relation to attorneys who are going to go to the Bar to practise. They have to have a six-months cleansing period (I use the word not in a derogatory sense at all). The reason for that is a very good reason. The reason is that that man has been working in an attorney&#x2019;s office, he has been in daily contact with attorneys, he has been in and out of other attorneys&#x2019; offices, he has been dealing with other attorneys and if he then goes straight to the Bar it is felt that the influence he has had, and the friendship he has had with other attorneys, would influence a lot of briefs his way when he goes to the Bar. Indeed I think there is a lot of wisdom in that, and this has been the practice that you must have a sixth-month &#x201C;cleansing period&#x201D; as it is called. But <span class="col_6405-6406" refersTo="page_536"/>now it is provided that there is going to be a six-month cleansing period the other way as well, and as far as I am aware this is something new.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. Minister exactly why this is so. Obviously the same reasons as apply in the case of an attorney going to the Bar do not apply in this case.

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>As one of the few practising attorneys in this House, I also feel disposed to say something on this legislation, but before doing so, I should like to refer to some of the remarks made by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). The hon. member has a way of rising and making his speeches with all kinds of motives and making witty remarks about others, but when something is said about him he is terribly sensitive, This is not the first time he has done so. He referred to the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) and said he had made a dishonourable remark here.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) referred to an interjection by the hon. member for Heilbron as a dishonourable interjection. I do not think it is proper of him to use a word in respect of that interjection. If he is not anxious that what he says here should become known to the attorneys at Durban, I cannot see why he really became disturbed about it. If the hon. member is satisfied that all the attorneys should hear what he had to say here to-day, why is he worried? And if under the circumstances he ought not to be concerned, how can he possibly refer to the interjection of the hon. member as a dishonourable interjection?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Why was it necessary for him to say that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>That is a different matter. Many interjections are made here, and I think it is a good thing that, if the hon. member is proud of what he said here, the attorneys at Durban should know about it, and I hope the hon. member will not be prejudiced thereby. But what I should like to say now is this: With great pride he mentioned here how the advocate is protected because he may appear in the Supreme Court only. He is quite satisfied with that delimitation of work. That is correct and it ought to be so, and it should remain so. The hon. member will obviously object if the attorney were to suggest that he should also be given that right. He has the same academic qualifications; he holds the B.A., LL.B, degrees, but the hon. member will most assuredly object to the practising attorney also being given the right to appear in the Supreme Court. In South Africa we really have exceptional circumstances in respect of this dual system, and I should like to suggest that this dual system is in existence in order to protect the advocate, and not to protect the attorney. In most other countries of the world, there is only one lawyer and he appears in all the law courts, from top to bottom. The ordinary attorney will welcome it here, and what is more, academically he is as well trained in 90 per cent of the cases as the hon. member for Durban (North) who practises as a barrister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Must we have that system here?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to argue about that with him, as to whether it is right or wrong that we should have the other system. But the hon. member is completely inconsistent. He is satisfied with it, but when the hon. the Minister now seeks to put right what is wrong in respect of the attorneys, he objects to it. I shall try to show in a moment where it is wrong and why the attorneys also should be protected on the ground of the same considerations raised here by the hon. member as to why he should be protected in the Supreme Court. The attorneys, like the doctors, are usually called in when people are in trouble when they have problems. The doctor is called in when the man is ill, and the attorney is called in when he has some other difficulty and needs legal assistance. Generally speaking it is true that when people are sick and they can be cured, they do not mind what they pay for it. However, there is a different attitude towards the attorney. Because the client has problems which cost him money, the attorney, generally speaking, is less popular in the community. He nevertheless fulfills a very important function. As a practising attorney I know how often we receive telephone calls from rural towns, asking us to try to send an attorney to them, smaller towns where there are no attorneys, because the people need an attorney, because they require him and because they want to use him when they require his services. That is quite apart from the other prominent role the attorney usually plays in his community. I think it is common cause that the attorneys are essential not only in the cities, but in all the various rural towns. As I said earlier, in most cases the attorney is as well trained academically as the advocate. In general we find that the attorney holds the B.A., LL.B. degrees. What the hon. member for Durban (North) has said is true, namely that when he holds a university degree such as a B.A. or a B.Com. degree, he need to serve articles for only two years. But whereas an advocate can go into <span class="col_6407-6408" refersTo="page_537"/>practice as an advocate after he has attained the B.A., LL.B, degrees, the attorney first has to serve articles for a period of two years as an articled clerk to an atttorney before he is admitted to practice as an attorney. In other words, he really requires seven years of study, five years at the university and two years as an articled clerk, and during that time he has to gain practical experience and he also has to attend classes and pass a practical examination. I am mentioning these things merely as a background to show what qualifications an attorney requires. After serving his two years as an articled clerk, he writes his practical examination for admission, and then he is admitted in the Supreme Court to practice as an attorney. But that is not the only qualifications the attorney possesses. In most cases he has to continue his studies and he has to pass a notarial examination, a very difficult examination, and then he is admitted to practice as a notary public, in the Supreme Court. This is an essential requirement in most towns where notarial work has to be done from time to time. Then there is another qualification the ordinary attorney has to acquire and that is conveyancing. It is not every attorney who can go to a deeds registry and sign his name as a conveyancer at the top of the certificate of a deed of transfer or a mortgage bond. All attorneys cannot appear before the Registrar of Deeds and sign a deed that the land has been transferred or that the mortgage bond has been registered. You first have to acquire the qualification of conveyancer. Those matters, in regard to conveyancing, are the very things in respect of which abuse is made to such a great extent. I shall try to mention some examples of that just now.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these requirements expected of a practising attorney, we find that the attorneys are disappearing from the rural areas to a large extent. As I have said, I think it is common cause between us that attorneys are needed there, and it is a healthy set-up that they should be there in the various towns. The hon. the Minister has referred to the decrease in the total number of attorneys in the Cape Province. As he has said, during the period from 1924 to 1964, during 40 years, the number of attorneys in the rural areas of the Cape has dwindled from 671 to 525. That is the rural area of the Cape, not including the big cities. I should like to mention a few places in particular. Take a place like Caledon. In 1924 there were ten attorneys, in 1934 there were 11, and to-day there are six only.</p>

<p>There are six attorneys, six registered attorneys and not six firms. Of course they may all be in one firm, but I happen to know this is not so. I mention the case of Calvinia. At Calvinia there were 13 attorneys in 1924, but to-day there are three; at De Aar there were 13 in 1924, the number having decreased gradually until to-day there are only five. At a place like Jamestown there were two in 1924, and to-day there is not one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to Robertson. I am one of the few remaining there. At Robertson there were 11 in 1944 and to-day there are six; in Oudtshoorn there were 14 in 1924, and to-day there are only nine. That is the picture one finds in the rural areas all over, the number of attorneys is dwindling. I do not think it is because there is less business, for we have to assume that in the rural areas too business is increasing, and most of the rural towns are growing continually. In most cases farming has become more intensive and from the very nature of things, one would have expected the number of attorneys in the rural areas to have increased. But that is not so in fact. Our experience is that there is only one reason for this, and that is that much of the work which formerly was the attorney&#x2019;s work, has gradually and to an increasing extent been taken out of his hands. The hon. member for Heilbron has referred to garages which are also doing insurance work now. In saying that he did not intend to convey that insurance work should be restricted to the attorneys. I am the last one to plead for that, and nobody will plead for it. The hon. member was merely pointing out that in the past this was the position, that the attorneys usually acted as insurance agents. He did work on commission to some extent. It is more especially commission work which has been taken out of his hands. Not the appearance in court. There is little interest in appearances in court. But the commission work on which the attorney in the rural towns was dependent to a large extent, as distinct from his purely court work, the remunerative work in the rural districts and that work has gradually been taken away from him, and not the less remunerative work such as appearance in court. This has never been remunerative. The collection of moneys was never remunerative either. The competitors of the attorneys in the country districts are not interested in this. They are interested only in the work which is remunerative to the attorney.</p>

<p>Sir, there have been black sheep among the attorneys in the past. We do not dispute that. But just look at the position in which the attorney is placed. It is a position of great trust. Having regard to that, I think we have to admit that the attorneys generally must surely be some of the most honest people on earth. An attorney is placed in the position that from time to time thousands of rand and <span class="col_6409-6410" refersTo="page_538"/>sometimes hundreds of thousands of rand are entrusted to him by clients to handle on their behalf. I can bear testimony of a firm in the country districts which is well known to me, and which has developed in respect of the investment of funds for their clients, and at the present time they are in control of more than R2,000,000, which they invest on behalf of their clients in mortgage bonds and other investments from time to time. That shows the position of great trust in which an attorney is placed. Now we should remember that nobody can suffer any loss through an attorney. That has been mentioned here. In the first place the attorney is bound by a code and if he does not do his work well, the client may go to the Law Society which may take steps against him if the offence is of a major nature, and the attorney could then be struck off the roll. This cannot be done to the ordinary layman who appears before the Road Transportation Board or the Rent Board, or what have you, for somebody. The attorney bears a great responsibility to his clients. He must serve his client well according to his code. Over and above this, there is the Fidelity Fund, which ensures that the public cannot suffer loss in consequence of the acts of attorneys.</p>

<p>There is something else hon. members should take into consideration, something in connection with which the attorney in the rural areas frequently has difficulty, namely the question of advertising. An attorney may not advertise. I think that is proper. In recent times we have devoted much time to the question of whether there should be some form of comprehensive notification to the public of the work of the attorneys, for the very reason that the attorneys have in recent times had to face up to such greatly unequal competition. So we considered this matter. But the fact of the matter is that at the present time the name of a firm of attorneys may not even appear in bold type in the telephone directory. It has to be printed in small type, because otherwise it may appear to be an advertisement. I think it is a salutory principle, and for that very reason I feel that there should be a delimitation or reservation of work to a large extent, in the same way that the work of the hon. member for Durban (North) is reserved also. For that very reason I feel that the professional man, the attorney, like the doctor, should not have to contend with unfair competition on the part of people who are not subject to the same code.</p>

<p>This is one of the few professions where, if the hon. member has been to an attorney and the attorney has registered a transfer for him in the deeds registry, or if he has acted for him in court, the hon. member may have the attorney&#x2019;s account taxed. There are fixed fees binding upon the attorney. But now he may go elsewhere and think he is getting cheaper service, while what he is going to get is expensive service. When he is finished with the man who has given him service, he frequently has to go to the attorney again to help him out of his trouble. As I have said, the attorneys cannot advertise. But there are other factors too which are making the livelihood of the attorney rather precarious in the rural areas. The most important is the factor of financial influence. The attorney has to cope with unequal competition because he frequently has to compete with other parties where financial influence is brought to bear. That is why we feel that it really is desirable that there should be some degree of work reservation. I should like to mention a few examples of work which is done by people who are not qualified attorneys. We have referred to a few files in the office of the Law Society, in connection with experiences in certain towns. We found one instance where a bank charged a fee for a Section 62 (3) certificate. That is a certificate given in connection with a sale from an estate, to the effect that all requirements have been complied with. There is a tariff for this certificate, the deeds registry tariff and if an attorney draws up an account, he may charge that tariff and that tariff only. But here we had a case where the bank furnished such a certificate, and what is more, the bank charged nearly three times as much for that certificate as an attorney would have been entitled to charge. Another example is the Deeds Registry. There an attorney is protected only to the extent that certain documents lodged in the Deeds Registry must bear a certificate prepared by an attorney or an officer of the deeds registry. But other instruments not covered by that particular provision in the Deeds Act, do not fall under this. It appears now that documents such as group areas declarations lodged together with all deeds of transfer in the Deeds Registry, do not require a certificate, although it is part of the conveyancer&#x2019;s job and forms a part of the transfer to be passed. Now we find that auctioneers, completely unqualified persons, are preparing those group areas declarations, and charge fees for doing so, while it really is the work of an attorney. And now I come to the point in respect of which I have the greatest objection, and where I think the hon. the Minister should do something for the attorneys. That is in regard to the Rent Board, the Valuation Court and the Road Transportation Board. It seems to me that in respect of those boards the hon. member for Durban (North) and I differ. Here in Cape Town we had an instance where a former chairman of a Rent Board, who was also a retired magistrate, appeared before the Rent Board after he had ceased to be chairman of the Rent Board. He established a business as Rent Board consultant, and he appeared before the Rent Board for clients in goodness knows how many cases, as ex-chairman of the Rent Board. We think that is wrong.</p>

<p>Of course. I could mention numerous other things which we feel are not right. Now I should like to make a few remarks in connection with this trust account. I do not know whether hon. members are fully aware of what an attorneys&#x2019; trust account comprises. An attorney&#x2019;s trust account comprises, i.a. the following: In cases where an attorney acts on behalf of his client in relation to the registration of a transfer, he drafts for his client a provisional bill of costs, and he asks the client to deposit that amount with him, because certain disbursements have to be made out of that sum in respect of stamps, transfer duty etc. and it includes among other things, fees also. That sum is deposited for the time being in the trust account, because it is not the attorney&#x2019;s money until such time as it shall have been allocated. The same thing applies to collections. When an attorney makes collections on behalf of a client, those moneys are deposited in the trust account until accounts are settled. Similarly as regards transactions where certain moneys are paid to the attorney and he must in due course at a certain stage pay these over again. Every attorney is compelled to keep such a separate trust account, and the trust account is subject to a number of requirements of the Law Society, e.g. it has to be audited from time to time. However, it frequently occurs that there are substantial sums of money in the trust account. As you will see yourselves, there are numerous transactions which are handled by an attorney, and the various amounts in the trust account sometimes run to thousands of rand. These moneys have been lying idle there for years. The amounts vary, these sums in the trust account, and in this Bill we now merely ask that the trust moneys may be capable of being invested and earning money in the meantime. Now, it is obvious that an attorney cannot always exhaust his trust account. The amount goes up and down, and he will be able with safety to invest a certain amount in excess of the minimum amount which is required in his trust account. He could invest the other amounts for short periods. Now it is provided here that these moneys are to be invested with approved financial institutions and that the interest may be used for the Fidelity Fund. I am fully in agreement with that. I agree with the hon. member for Germiston (District) that it would have evoked criticism and in my view it would also have been wrong, if the interest on trust moneys, of which a part becomes the property of the attorneys, or at a specified time already may be the property of an attorney, should go to the attorney as the attorney earns the fees, he will not at once debit them in his books and transfer it from his trust account to his ordinary account, although it is already his. Frequently the money remains in the trust account for a long period. In spite of that, I agree that it would have evoked criticism if the attorney were to have had the benefit of it, and I think we are in agreement that the wise course for us to follow is rather to use that money to build up the Fidelity Fund.</p>

<p>We welcome the provision made here. I know the powers conferred here in this clause, have not been drafted very elegantly, and we may perhaps be able to improve on the clause, but generally speaking I think we welcome the fact that we are endeavouring to improve the position of the attorney in the rural areas.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend replying to the speech of the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. S. L. Muller). I am sure he will forgive me if I say that it sounded much like the lament of the lawyer. I accept that the problems of the lawyer, and perhaps the country lawyers in particular, are many, and that this Bill is designed to be of assistance to them. Whether the denuding of the country of attorneys is serious or not I do not know, but I think it is part of the general drift to the towns which takes place in any progressing country.</p>

<p>I want to confine my remarks to the principles contained in two clauses, Clause 16 (1) (h) which empowers the Minister to determine what acts shall not be performed by a person other than an attorney, and Clause 17 which empowers the Minister to designate which statutory proceedings shall be reserved for attorneys. The Minister has described the first provision as a delicate one and has indicated that it is perhaps not a very elegant provision. It does create problems in more than one direction, and I accept the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that so far as he personally is concerned he intends to exercise the powers granted to him by that provision with caution and after consultation. But the principle which is really involved in both these clauses is the delegation by Parliament of legislative powers to the executive Government in the person of the Minister of Justice. I do not intend to traverse the oft-quoted arguments about the dangers and also about the values of conferring delegated legislative powers on Ministers and subordinate authorities, but I do want to quote once again the words of Sir Cecil Carr, who is, or until recently was, counsel to the Speaker of the British House of Commons. He used these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In so far as delegated legislation contains the germ of arbitrary administration, every possible safeguard must be devised.</block>

<p>What I am particularly concerned about in regard to both these clauses is the preservation of the prerogatives of Parliament rather than the protection of the individual interests of the attorneys&#x2019; profession. I believe that Parliament owes a duty to the country to be jealous of its prerogatives and it must always surrender no more of its powers to executive Government than it can itself control. I intend, therefore, moving in the Committee Stage certain amendments which are designed to preserve the authority of Parliament but which at the same time, I believe, will not <span class="col_6413-6414" refersTo="page_540"/>detract from the obligations of the Minister to administer the law in terms of the Bill. I agree with the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) in his plea that acts which are to be reserved for consideration and attention by the legal profession, that is by attorneys, should be inserted in the law itself. The Minister has quite fairly indicated that there are practical difficulties. It is a matter which will need consideration and consultation. I accept, therefore, that it will not be possible to be as exact as we would like it to be and to see that the actual acts are specified in the law itself. In that regard I should like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the comments of the select committee which was set up by this House in March 1959 to consider a Bill which was also designed to reserve certain functions to attorneys. The Bill under consideration at that time was the one to amend the Estates Act. The select committee came to this conclusion, that it would not be in the public interest to enact legislation which would have the effect of depriving the individual of his existing rights to make his own nomination of persons who shall undertake the administration of estates. I specially quote this because it is an authoritative view of a select committee of this House, and as far as I can remember I believe it was unanimous. It rather indicates what we on this side have been trying to indicate, that there is a great diversity of interests which will be involved when these provisions are put into force. There are private interests and professional interests and vested interests which have to be taken into account and these all, I say, make it necessary for Parliament itself to be very cautious in regard to the powers it is granting to the executive Government in terms of the Bill now before us. I hope, therefore, that the amendments which will be designed towards preserving the authority of Parliament will be acceptable to the Minister. He has not seen the amendment, but it will be put on the Order Paper, and I will make sure that his Department also gets an advance copy; because I think it is very clear that this is an instance where Parliament must be particularly jealous of its prerogatives and must be very cautious in surrendering those prerogatives it has. It is not only the legal profession which will be involved. The Minister has quite clearly said he would consult, and he rather indicated that he would consult the Side-Bar Association in particular, but I think from his own remarks he recognizes that the ambit of interests is much wider and that therefore the precaution which he will have to take will have to be very guarded and, therefore, he should welcome the opportunity of making sure that there will be a revision of the powers he has used to determine what acts shall be assigned only to attorneys and what type of statutory proceedings should be reserved to attorneys.</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>The ground covered by this Bill has been discussed very comprehensively by other speakers and so I only have a few words to say in this regard. In the course of my remarks I shall reply to what was said by the hon. member who has just sat down. As one who has practised on the platteland as an attorney, I can state that the stage has been reached when something has to be done to protect the profession not only in the interests of the attorney himself but also in the interests of the public. It is a fact to-day that the more he is deprived of professional work, the more the attorney on the platteland has to concentrate on non-professional work such as estate agency work, auctioneering and so forth. It is obvious that the more an attorney has to concentrate upon non-professional work, the more the standard and the quality of his professional work suffers thereby. It may be said that a rural attorney&#x2019;s professional work does not have to be of a high standard, but nothing can be further from the truth. It may be that the urban attorney or advocate is consulted in regard to involved legal opinions and the drawing up of documents in connection with legal proceedings, but the rural attorney has often to attend to matters which are of vital importance to his client in the sphere of contract work, notarial work and in many other spheres, work which is important to the client from a financial point of view. If mistakes are made by the attorney at that primary stage of negotiations, these mistakes can have very serious results. That is why I contend that it is in the interests of the public that the professional work of the rural attorney and the standard of that work must at all times be above suspicion. That is why I welcome Clause 16 (h), not because it is a particularly elegant clause but because it appears to me to be a clause which will solve a very difficult position in the most practical way.</p>

<p>Hon. members have expressed themselves against the delegation of powers. I contend that we must in the first place hesitate to delegate powers to a Minister in matters in which ideological or party political interests are at stake. But here we have a case in which no interests of this nature are at stake. The person occupying the post of Minister of Justice will probably always be a person with legal qualifications, but the Minister holds such an important position, a position which requires such a high degree of impartiality on his part that I cannot imagine his not acting impartially and fairly in regard to other vested interests. But I want to say further that if the Minister has to exercise his discretion in terms of Clause 16 (h), it will place a very great responsibility upon the legal profession as a whole because then the Minister will have a very good stick with which to beat the law societies in future if any serious complaints are made against the legal profession to the effect that attorneys are not doing their duty. Then he can tell them: You cannot expect my protection unless you put your own house in order immediately.</p>

<p><span class="col_6415-6416" refersTo="page_541"/>I also have a few remarks to make in regard to Clause 14 (b). Apparently&#x2014;and I am speaking subject to correction here&#x2014;Clause 14 (b) which makes provision for a practical bookkeeping examination, introduces a new provision as far as B.A., LL.B. students are concerned. In the past the only thing that was required of such students to enable them to practise as attorneys was that they had to undergo a two-year period of training and pass a practical examination in court work as well as in the work of a notary and conveyancer. In terms of Clause 14 (b) an LL.B. student will now also be required to pass a practical bookkeeping examination to comply with the limited bookkeeping requirements that are set. I say that I am speaking subject to correction. If this is the case, I welcome it. If this is not the case, I want to make a specific appeal to the hon. the Minister to introduce a provision whereby LL.B. students will also have to pass a practical examination in bookkeeping. I have always objected to the fact that an LL.B. student has to a certain extent too little practical training to enable him to practise as a platteland attorney, particularly as far as the bookkeeping requirements are concerned. Because he has a large amount of legal knowledge, the LL.B. student is in most cases in an attorney&#x2019;s practice entrusted with court work and so forth, with the result that he gains very little bookkeeping knowledge, if any, in his two-year training period. When he himself then becomes an attorney he always suffers the disadvantage of not having had sufficient bookkeeping experience. That is why if this provision is going to be applied to attorneys, I wholeheartedly welcome the fact. In any event, I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to introduce such a provision if this is not the case.</p>

<p>Then I welcome that fact most heartily. Indeed, I think that as far as the requirements for attorneys are concerned, we must proceed more and more in the direction of making compulsory those subjects which are required in practice. I think that in this connection far more attention can also be given to encouraging students who want to become attorneys to take B.Com., LL.B. course instead of the B.A., LL.B. course because, whether we want to admit or not, even on the platteland one&#x2019;s life is becoming a business life more and more and it is very necessary for the practitioner there to have business experience as well. In saying this I do not mean that he should encroach upon the sphere of the accountant by so doing but the law and the business world are very closely connected with one another and it is highly desirable and necessary that the attorney on the platteland should also have a very sound business knowledge, no matter what his academic qualifications may be.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to hear that. I understand that representations have been made to the Minister by the Joint Council of the Society of Chartered Accountants, who are concerned lest the powers granted to the Minister under Clause 16 (h) will give the Minister the right to preclude accountants from undertaking the work of administering estates. As the Minister probably knows qualified accountants have to pass a special paper on the administration of estates. In my own experience, I have frequently been called in by professional firms to draft their accounts, particularly in involved estates, and it would seem quite unfair and unreasonable if the right of accountants to administer estates should be taken away from them by reason of the power the Minister has in terms of (h). I hope that in the Committee Stage we will be able to argue that in greater detail, and I hope that during the course of the Minister&#x2019;s reply he will indicate that it is not the intention of his Department to take away from accountants the right to practise as administrators of estates and to frame estate accounts. Accountants must serve five years&#x2019; articles, the same as the members of the legal profession, and they are particularly qualified in work concerning the framing of accounts in insolvent and deceased estates and liquidations. They have particular qualifications in that regard. Both the Insolvency Act and the Companies Act require them to undertake this class of work, and it would be a pity if this class of work should be taken away from them by this Bill. It may be that the fears expressed by certain accountants are unnecessary fears, and I hope that the Minister in his reply will indicate the extent to which he intends, if he does so intend, to deprive accountants of this work. It seems ludicrous that in a small country town the attorney should now be required to do estate work, which was formerly done by his colleague the accountant. In fact, these professional men in all country towns are feeling the effect in that much of the work they previously did is now being done by big institutions, which in many cases undertake to do the work for no fee or a very small fee, as part of its services. But that denudes the attorneys of much of their work. The banks do certain work which they formerly did, and the building societies render certain services which were formerly rendered by the attorneys. One can well understand the attitude in wanting to ensure that they can make a living. The hon. member for Ceres has indicated how many attorneys have left the profession in country-towns,<span class="col_6417-6418" refersTo="page_542"/> but I think that is a feature of all professions in country towns. As we have the movement of the population from the small towns to the big centres, so we also have the movement of the professional men to the towns, where they can make a better living and there are probably better chances for the education of their children. But I hope that the Minister in using the powers granted to him under Section 16 will not deprive the country accountants of the work they have done for many years and for which they are specially qualified.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) surprises me. You know Sir, there is an idiomatic expression which states: Shoemaker, stick to your last, but it appears to me as though the Opposition have either never heard of that idiomatic expression or are diametrically opposed to it. Not one of the speakers on their side, except for the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) is an attorney. The others are all persons who have nothing to do with the Law Society. They are members of another profession because I consider an advocate to be a member of a profession different from that of an attorney. They are the ones opposing this Bill. The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) has not yet spoken. I wonder whether he agrees with this Bill or not. He is one of the attorneys on the Opposition side. If the hon. member replies to my question, he will have to agree with every provision in this Bill. But he will not reply.</p>

<p>I come back now to the hon. member for Pinetown. He said that accountants have to pass an examination in the administration of estates. Attorneys will now have to pass an examination in bookkeeping but must we now say that attorneys may not keep their own books because there are accountants available to do this work? I think that that is quite wrong. I shall not object if the Minister prohibits auditors and banks from administering estates because I think that this is work which belongs to the attorneys because they are trained to do it. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. S. L. Muller) quoted from Section 62 (3) of the Administration of Estates Act which requires a certificate when a property in an estate is sold, a certificate which has to be obtained from the Master of the Supreme Court. The hon. member said that this certificate was obtained by the bank. Of course, the bank administered the estate and obtained the certificate but, knowing what happens in practice, I should not be surprised if the bank also had power of attorney to pass transfer. Once an attorney has been instructed, he will draw up the power of attorney and he will make the necessary arrangements for anything else that is required. That is why it is necessary for paragraph (h) to remain in this Bill so that we can be protected. I said just now: Shoemaker, stick to your last! Only advocates have spoken on the other side and it is they who condemn certain parts of this Bill. I know that the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) is awaiting an opportunity to speak. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has now said that we must be fully bilingual. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) complained about this provision and said that it was wrong to compel the profession to become bilingual. Years ago I had a case between two farmers, both of whom were Afrikaans-speaking, in connection with certain farming equipment which was sold together with a farm. Certain difficulties a ose. The deed of sale was drawn up by a person who had nothing to do with the legal profession and because of this fact, the case went to court. The matter dealt with ploughs and harrows and so forth and the Judge&#x2014;I do not want to mention his name but he was a Judge who was appointed by the United Party at the time because they wanted to get rid of him&#x2014;was unilingual. When the evidence was heard in court in connection with harrows, he did not know what the Afrikaans word for it meant. It was almost impossible to go on with that case. It is not always so easy to translate these farming terms for a Judge. Dictionaries had to be used simply because the judge was not bilingual. That is why it is desirable to have bilingualism in the legal profession so that the time of the court will not be wasted. If the time of the court is wasted the case takes longer and the costs are proportionately higher. I want to say in passing that people say that this bilingualism which the hon. the Minister is now seeking to introduce is the thin end of the wedge. There is opposition to this provision. The objectors even say that the Government will introduce a measure soon which will require members of Parliament to be bilingual. Well, that is not a bad idea at all. We on this side are bilingual but I doubt whether all the hon. members opposite are bilingual and whether they are always able to follow what is said here.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words in regard to the investment of trust funds. The interest on these trust funds will now be deposited in the Fidelity Guarantee Fund. The Act was amended a few years ago to provide that when the amount in the Fidelity Guarantee Fund reaches R500,000, attorneys will no longer have to contribute to this fund. At the moment, as the hon. the Minister has already said, they have to contribute an amount of R60 per annum. When the amount in the fund reaches the figure of R500,000 that contribution will cease. I should just like to know from the hon. the Minister what will happen to the interest on trust moneys when the fund reaches that R500,000 level. Will the interest on the investment of trust funds with banks and so forth, then be paid over to the poor attorneys or will it continue to be paid into that fund indefinitely?</p>

<p>I do not have much more to say in connection with this Bill. I welcome the measure, particularly paragraph (h) of Clause 16. I hope that the rules which are going to be drawn up by the hon. the Minister will give adequate protection to attorneys both on the platteland and in the cities. I am convinced that the hon. <span class="col_6419-6420" refersTo="page_543"/>the Minister will not simply act on his own. The requests that certain work be reserved for attorneys will come from the Law Societies and after discussion with them, that work will then be reserved for attorneys. I thank the hon. the Minister for this measure and I am pleased that after all these years this measure has now been brought before Parliament in the interests of the Law Societies.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) feels that this is a debate which should be conducted not only by lawyers only, but by attorneys only. I should very much have liked to hear the views of farming members and other members representing platteland constituencies on the value of attorneys. I personally believe that it is a great and honourable profession, and some eloquent pleas have been put forward on behalf of the attorneys&#x2019; profession by country attorneys. But to me it would have been more impressive still, if support for their pleas had been forthcoming from persons other than attorneys living in the country. I say that the attorneys&#x2019; profession is a great and honourable and old profession, and we would all like to see that it remains an honourable profession. I believe that it is still very much an honourable profession in this country. I think the attorneys&#x2019; profession is thriving in general as much as one could wish. The particular aspect which is causing concern is the position of country attorneys, whose numbers have gradually dropped.</p>

<p>I think what has made the attorney&#x2019;s profession such a respected one is largely the independence which its members have always evinced. The independence of the lawyer to whichever branch of the profession he belongs, is perhaps one of the attributes of the profession which is so highly respected. In this respect the position of the attorney differs from that of other professional men. I think the hon. the Minister as the custodian, in a broad sense, of the profession must be careful before he takes any step which will undermine the independence of the profession even to a certain extent. I am speaking of independence in the sense of independently making their way, wherever they happen to be in practice, without any protection other than that which is fully warranted.</p>

<p>I venture to suggest that in so far as it can be said that there is any undue protection of advocates it is upon the only basis which is reasonable and permissible, and indeed upon a basis which gives protection not only to advocates but to many other professional people such as chemists, pharmacists, quantity surveyors, conveyancers, and so forth. In all these cases there are certain tasks that need performing and certain academic qualifications have been laid down which have to be complied with. In the case of advocates it has been laid down that they must have certain qualifications, and we are discussing one of those qualifications to-day. I do not think it can be said that advocates enjoy any special protection such as we are considering here. In this case we are considering passing a clause, Clause 16 (h), which would empower the Minister to introduce a new type of protection, a protection which I suggest does not fall into the other classes that I have touched upon, because here it has been realized that various institutions such as trust companies and banks and accountants administer estates, and from a technical point of view they apparently do it perfectly adequately. Indeed we must remember that the public has been turning to them for reasons best known to the public. One of those reasons possibly was the fear in the past that there may be defalcations amongst attorneys. There are naturally very few cases where there are defalcations, but the profession has had the wisdom to take steps to eliminate that fear in the minds of the public which caused the profession to lose further work of this kind. I refer here, of course, to the establishment by the profession of the Fidelity Fund. I do not doubt that the establishment of that fund, did to some extent stop the flow of work away from attorneys.</p>

<p>Sir, I do suggest that one has to be extremely careful when one attempts to strengthen the position of the attorney in the country. I think it was the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) who suggested that it might be the charms and the lures of city life, both for the attorney and his family which is partly responsible for the falling off in the numbers of attorneys in the rural areas. I am not certain that the profession may not have to reconsider some of its own rules in this modern age. The hon. member for Ceres touched upon the question of advertisement. One naturally recoils from the idea of an attorney advertising, but that is the type of thing to which the attorneys might possibly have to give careful consideration in order to meet the sort of competition that they are experiencing in the country districts. Therefore where we are presented with a clause such as Clause 16 (h) which simply empowers the Minister to lay down acts which shall not be performed by any person other than an attorney, a notary, a conveyancer, etc., one is very concerned at the possibility that such a clause might become law. It should be noted that this is a power which presumably will apply <span class="col_6421-6422" refersTo="page_544"/>to work performed by attorneys throughout the country, including the towns. While a case may have been made out for the protection of country attorneys, apparently this will apply in the towns too. I personally think it is questionable whether there should be that protection in the country districts. I am well aware of the fact that there are fine men in the profession in all parts of the country, but I say again that if you give attorneys this type of protection, I do believe that they will conceivably forfeit a measure of respect among their competitors and it may possibly lead to a weakening of their own fibre. I do not wish to be dogmatic about that; but I think it is possible that it may lead to that, and I wonder therefore whether adequate consideration has been given to this very complicated matter.</p>

<p>Sir, I was saying that the hon. the Minister is seeking to take a power which will prevent persons, who have hitherto done certain types of work, from continuing to do so. He has indicated, very fairly, that this is a delicate provision, and I therefore regret the language of the hon. member for Prinshof who seemed strongly to resent the fact that anybody could share that view with the hon. the Minister and feel that there were two sides to this question, even perhaps in the interests of the profession itself. Sir, it follows therefore, that we on this side of the House would be extremely reluctant to give the hon. the Minister powers in such a blanket form.</p>

<p>Although the acts he has in mind have not been specified, he did in the course of his speech refer to the administration of estates, and I think he touched upon the question of conveyancing; but he said little else as to specific items of work contemplated. Here one must remember that wherever a specific measure has been introduced to deprive certain persons of the right to administer estates, there has been tremendous opposition from the persons concerned and this House has thought it wise not to press the issue. It is true, as the hon. the Minister has said, that there will be consultation; he has not said with whom there will be consultation except with the law societies themselves and presumably such other institutions as are referred to in the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>So far as this particular clause is concerned I am not happy about it, both from the angle of the profession itself and from the angle that it may not have been adequately considered against the changing background of life, and from the angle as to whether it is truly in the interests of the esteem of the attorneys&#x2019; profession itself.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to move on to other aspects of the Bill which certainly have my unqualified support. One of those provisions is the provision in regard to bilingualism. In order to be an advocate it has always been a requirement that you have to be qualified in Latin; that you should have taken at least one course in Latin, and I think both English and Afrikaans are at least as much needed as Latin. It is said that in order to be able to study many of our authorities one requires a knowledge of Latin since they stem from Roman law. Those authorities naturally are in the Latin language. That also applies to the works of many of the authorities on the Roman-Dutch law. If a knowledge of Latin is required, then it is even more important to have a sound knowledge of English and Afrikaans, the judgment of our courts being in English and Afrikaans and many of our text-books being in English and Afrikaans, not to mention the question of court work and the saving of the courts time by an adequate grasp of Afrikaans and English. I am very glad that the rights of people at present in the profession are being protected. I do not think more need be said in that regard.</p>

<p>I also support the provision in regard to the Fidelity Fund. Various arguments have already been advanced in support of this provision; but it seems to me that the effect of this will be that the public themselves will benefit to a certain extent because the costs of running an attorney&#x2019;s office should be reduced, and since the fees which you may charge are related to those costs it is hoped that it will be possible to keep the costs within reasonable bounds. The hon. the Minister has said that in some countries they go even further, but I think the particular decision taken here is a highly commendable one.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, that the Bill will perhaps have the effect of discouraging persons from studying outside our country. In the case of attorneys it seems to me that the odds are almost overwhelming against studying overseas because they must get their professional qualifications in South Africa. If therefore they do in fact spend some time overseas they will still have to spend a very considerable period here in order to acquire our own professional degree. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has touched upon this and has indicated that any degree, whether it be a legal degree or otherwise counts for the purpose of reducing the period of articles. That seems to me to be a further argument, particularly in this case. Sir, it is so widely accepted that travel broadens the mind and that meeting persons in other countries is a valuable experience, that one instinctively feels that it is a pity to depart from that. It has always been possible in the past and I do not believe it has done any harm &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Well, that is the point. One certainly would like to have reciprocity from these countries. I am not certain how that will work out, but one should give consideration to reciprocity even if it is not the fullest reciprocity. However, I agree that that is an aspect which has to be borne in mind. I do not know that there is any reference in this Bill to the question of reciprocity; but it seems to me that in most cases any study overseas is additional to the study undertaken here.</p>

<p>To sum up, Sir, this Bill in general will be of assistance to the attorneys&#x2019; profession. It contains certain provisions which deserve one&#x2019;s full support. In other cases where we have certain reservations it seems from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude that we may be able to bring about improvements in the Committee Stage, and I trust that that will be the case.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not be very long because it seems to me that this measure, except for one or two small disagreements, is an accepted measure, and I do not think the Minister and I have ever heard so many attorneys talk for so long without a fee. I rise merely to say that any legislation which will assist legal men in their profession and protect them, as other professions are protected, should be supported. Sir, although this has no direct bearing on this Bill I do want to take up a few moments in drawing the attention of the hon. the Minister to the difficulty experienced by Coloured youths in becoming articled. I understand that only one Coloured lad has been articled in the past year. It seems that there are two possible reasons for that. The first is prejudice, and the second is that it was an accepted rule when I was a practising attorney that no one attorney may have more than two articled clerks, and in the majority of cases where you have a partnership of two men, each attorney already has his two articled clerks. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can make an appeal in this connection to the legal profession. Whether we accept the policy of separate development of the Government or whether we do not, the fact remains that it is intenteded by the Government to establish Coloured areas in which there will be courts which will probably be staffed by Coloured people. One finds that there is no opportunity for these people to qualify for the posts which the Minister himself will probably want them to occupy, that is to say, for the post of prosecutor and so on, unless we can remove what I believe is prejudice on the part of these people or do something about the fact that most firms already have their full quota of articled clerks. I am not going to deal with the question of the difficulty of the Coloured attorney practising in a White area. He cannot do it unless he gets a permit. It is unfortunate, but I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to-day to use his influence, in whatever way he can, to make it easier for Coloured lads to become articled. I was going to article a Coloured lad just before I gave up practice; I would have been very happy to article him. There are many matriculants who feel that they would like to become articled clerks but they have no opportunity to do so. Sir, I hope that any difficulties in this Bill will be ironed out, and I want to say to the Minister that if it is intended in the future to create separate institutions, the Government should take the lead and help these boys to receive training to qualify for the posts in which their services will be used in the future. I hope that plea will not fall on deaf ears.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I thank hon. members on both sides of the House for the support which they have given to the principles of this Bill. Sir, it seems to me, if I may say so in passing, that we have now reached the stage in this House where we discuss Bills that we support almost at greater length than Bills which we do not support! However that may be, I am very grateful that hon. members have received this Bill in the spirit in which I presented it to the House, and on behalf of the law societies&#x2014;because after all it is their interests which are at stake here; it is really their legislation which is before the House&#x2014;I want to express my cordial and sincere thanks to members on both sides for the spirit in which the debate has been conducted here.</p>

<p>I want to reply very briefly to the points which hon. members have made here. Let me deal first with the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett). I just want to say&#x2014;the hon. member knows that that is so but I want to state it perfectly clearly for the sake of the record&#x2014;that there is, of course, no legal obstacle in the way of any Coloured youngster who wishes to become an attorney. There is no legislation or custom which stands in his way; he is just as free as anybody else to become an attorney. For my part I would welcome it because I believe that every racial group should be given an opportunity to earn a livelihood. Personally I would welcome it if better facilities could be provided, as far as practitioners are concerned, to enable young Coloured men to become attorneys. I also want to give the hon. member the assurance that I shall discuss this matter with the authorities concerned and promote it to the best of my ability. More and more courses are being introduced at the universities to enable them to qualify as attorneys, and I shall use the necessary influence, particularly as far as the Western Cape University College is concerned, to see what headway we can make in that connection.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson). I again want to point out to the hon. member that the profession to which he and I belong, whatever arguments we may advance, is better protected than any other profession as far as I know. We are not only protected in this sense that <span class="col_6425-6426" refersTo="page_546"/>no unqualified person can enter our profession but we are also protected in the sense that we do not have any bad debts at all unless, of course, the attorney concerned becomes insolvent&#x2014;and after all that is the most important consideration of all. What is even more important is that attorneys are under an obligation towards the hon. member and myself to pay our fees, whether they recover those fees from their client or not. That gives us even more reason to be much more indulgent when attorneys ask for protection and, note well, not for absolute protection. Let me also say this to the hon. member for Pinelands and to the hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl) who also discussed this matter with me and who, like the hon. member for Pinelands is interested in this matter and has informed me of his interest, that what I am seeking to bring about here and what the attorneys want is not absolute protection for themselves; they are not seeking the total exclusion of other people who, as I have already said and as the attorneys admit, have acquired vested rights. Those vested rights have to be taken into account; the attorneys do want to take them into account and will take them into account. For my part I am obliged in any case to take vested rights into account. All we are asking for is an opportunity to demarcate the various spheres of work. Take the question of the administration of estates as a whole, for example. Hon. members will agree with me that there are certain aspects of the administration of estates which are peculiar to the one and not to the other. Take the question of trustees in insolvent estates, particularly where it is a matter of involved book-keeping, as in the case of insolvent companies. I readily admit that this is not work on which attorneys ought to have a monopoly. I readily admit that this sort of work falls within the scope of the functions of the accountant who is eminently qualified to do this sort of work.</p>

<p>Let me be very candid, gentlemen, in this regard. We have been trying to negotiate for years and years. Why did we fail in our negotiations? Because we were negotiating from weakness. We had no bargaining power. We could not negotiate as a matter of fact. We did not even know which people had vested interests and which did not. But if we pass this Bill then we will be negotiating from strength. That makes it a different proposition altogether.</p>

<p>*I want to make it clear that it is not a question of the attorneys wishing to develop a dog-in-the-manger mentality. They have never adopted such an attitude, nor will they ever adopt it in the future. But they are entitled to ask that their interests should also be taken into account. I cannot agree for one moment with the statement of the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) that it will harm the profession if protection is given to it. Medical practitioners are in no worse position because protection is given to them. To me it seems that advocates become better and better the more they are protected. I do not believe therefore that we would be doing any harm to the profession. On the contrary, I believe I feel that we should help a profession which has gone out of its way in the past not only to render good services, but service for which in many cases they receive no remuneration. We must realize that the attorney, just like the general medical practitioner, is not only an attorney, just as the general medical practitioner is not just a medical doctor; he is a friend; he is a man who helps people in distress and trouble. The most important aspect, however, is that he first helps and then sees what money he can get for his assistance. He does not first lay down his price before he agrees to help. I know that there are some attorneys who do not do this, but the average attorney is a man who first helps and who very often first helps without having any guarantee that he is going to be paid for his services. There are many of us who were formerly attorneys who would have been much better off to-day if we had been paid for all the work we did. That is the position and we cannot get away from it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) says that we should under no circumstances interfere with the right of the individual to nominate the person whom he wants to act on his behalf.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<p>That is what the select committee says.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I fully agree with that. I do not want to interfere with that right either. But if you look at this matter from the other angle, we are not interfering with the individual&#x2019;s right when we say what work must be done by an attorney and what work must not be done by an attorney. On the contrary, we have already done that in the past; we have said that only attorneys and advocates may appear in court. We have already laid down such a demarcation, and in doing so we have not interfered with the individual&#x2019;s right. In the same way we are not going to interfere with the individual&#x2019;s right in this case either. I have admitted that Clause 16 (a) is not elegantly framed. Hon. members on the other side have referred to an amendment which I have not seen yet and which I have not had an opportunity of studying. I am quite prepared to listen to any arguments which hon. members may put forward in that connection. I am entirely in favour of it if they can improve this clause provided we do not violate the principle that attorneys are entitled to a certain amount of consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) put a question to me in connection with the limit of the Fidelity Fund; he wants to know whether the interest will accrue to the attorneys once that limit has been reached. At this stage I am not in favour of the proposition that the interest should go to the attorneys at any stage. What I am in favour of is that <span class="col_6427-6428" refersTo="page_547"/>the cost of auditing the accounts and the bank charges might perhaps be borne in the future by the fund, depending upon its strength. That, however, is quite a different matter and we can talk about it again later on. There would only be reproaches, which we want to avoid, if we agreed to the suggestion that the interest should accrue to the attorneys when the fund reaches a certain figure. In any event, that is my personal attitude at this stage. There may be other people who hold a different view.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has referred to the question of university degrees which are acquired overseas and to which no reference is made in the Bill. The hon. member is aware of the fact that there used to be reciprocity between ourselves and Britain as far as this matter is concerned. When we left the Commonwealth, the reciprocity which we enjoyed there was done away with, and it is because of that fact that we are doing away with the reciprocity which Britain formerly enjoyed in this connection. But that still does not alter the fact, as the hon. member himself has argued, that if universities recognize one another&#x2019;s degrees, then official recognition may be granted to such degrees by the committee for the recognition of law examinations. We are obliged, of course, because of the principle of reciprocity, to take the same steps here as the steps taken in Britain as far as we are concerned. This was only a concession which applied, I would not even say while we were members of the Commonwealth, but while we were in the Empire. This is something which had its origin in those days. In saying that I am not suggesting that I do not want students to go and study overseas. On the contrary, one welcomes it if students want to go and study overseas; one welcomes it for obvious reasons which I need not enlarge upon. But the principle remains&#x2014;and I think hon. members will agree with me&#x2014;that one ought to receive the basic training which entitles one to become an attorney on one&#x2019;s own soil, and since that is one of the aims of this Bill I wholeheartedly agree with it. The hon. member also referred to the period of six months, &#x201C;the cleansing period&#x201D;. I can only say to him that this is a matter which I discussed with the General Bar Council and they fully agree that what applies to the attorneys should also apply to the advocates. The reason for that is obvious. In the first place one does not wish to create the impression that one profession is inferior and that the other is a superior profession. In the second instance, the fact of the matter is that a person who practised at the Bar received greater publicity in his practice than the man who practised as an attorney. It is usually Supreme Court cases to which publicity is given and not cases handled by attorneys in the magistrates&#x2019; courts. The first man has an advantage over the second. The reason for adopting this attitude is to treat everybody alike.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the Rent Board and the Group Areas Board as far as the question of appearance before <i>quasi-</i>judicial bodies is concerned. It is certainly not the intention and I do not believe that there is any law which prevents an individual from appearing on his own behalf or which prevents a group of individuals from deputing a member of the group to appear on behalf of all of them. That is certainly not the intention. The idea is to prevent people who are not qualified at all from appearing before <i>quasi-</i>judicial bodies on behalf of other individuals without having any interest in the matter themselves apart from their interests in the remuneration which they can get of it. It is not possible at this stage to draw up a list, nor does one want to draw up a new list in this connection every year. It is not possible at this stage to give a list of all the <i>quasi-</i>judicial bodies. What will happen is that from time to time, as these things are investigated, one body will be proclaimed as a <i>quasi-</i>judicial body and another body will be deproclaimed, depending upon the circumstances. That is why it is felt that the clause should be framed in the way in which it is framed in this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) correctly referred to the responsibility of this House in connection with Clause 16 (a). I do not want to try to escape that responsibility, and I would therefore wholeheartedly welcome a discussion of this matter in the Committee Stage. The hon. member raised the question of attorneys who are struck off the roll and the subsequent institution of criminal proceedings. Hon. members are aware of the fact that when an attorney is struck off the roll it frequently happens that the Judge makes adverse comments and orders that the papers be referred to the Attorney-General for his attention. I want to go so far as to say that in most cases the law society concerned refers the case to the Attorney-General to decide whether action should be taken or not. In many cases action is taken but I think there are also cases where, quite correctly, no action is taken because the Attorney-General finds that it is not the type of case in which a prosecution ought to be instituted. After all, the mere fact that an attorney is struck off the roll is sufficient punishment. Any punishment which may be meted out to him thereafter is entirely secondary. The main penalty is the fact that he is struck off the roll. There are very few other professions in which a contravention carries the severe penalty that the offender is forbidden to continue to practise the profession for which he qualified. I do not think that a heavier penalty can be imposed upon a person than to prevent him for ever or for a certain period from practising the profession for which he qualified. I cannot imagine a more severe penalty. That does not mean to say that where moneys have been embezzled, particularly in those cases where the money is not refunded, the law should not take its <span class="col_6429-6430" refersTo="page_548"/>course. It goes without saying that in those cases prosecutions will be instituted. But cases may occur&#x2014;and I am aware of such cases&#x2014;where the law society would feel quite correctly that no further steps should be taken.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) and Ceres (Mr. S. L. Muller) outlined the principles of this Bill very clearly, and I thank them for their explanation of the terms of the Bill.</p>

<p>As hon. members on the other side have said, we can conduct a very fruitful discussion in the Committee Stage on many of these clauses. As far as that is concerned I am not wedded to any of the provisions of this Bill. If hon. members wish to move amendments I shall be very grateful if they will inform me of such amendments timeously so that I will have an opportunity of discussing them with the law societies, amongst others, before I come to any decision in that connection.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is an entirely non-contentious measure, on which there ought to be complete unanimity in this House, but that is no reason why we should debate this Bill at length! Hon. members will see that Clause 1 deals with administrative matters only. Then there are further clauses which are entirely consequential upon our withdrawal from the Commonwealth and the fact that we became a Republic. Hon. members will observe, amongst other things, that in the future the police will no longer receive &#x201C;pay&#x201D; but &#x201C;salaries&#x201D; and &#x201C;wages&#x201D;, because in the rest of the Public Service officials receive &#x201C;&#x2018;salaries and wages&#x201D; and not &#x201C;pay&#x201D;. Hon. members will also notice that in the future the official designation of recruits will be &#x201C;students&#x201D;. That is already the position in practice and this Bill merely confirms the existing practice.</p>

<p>There is practically only one new principle in this Bill and that is the principle contained in Clause 21, which provides for the establishment of a reserve list of officers. Unlike the army, which has a reserve list of officers, the Police Force has never had a reserve list of officers. Hon. members will realize of course that it can serve a very useful purpose in times of danger, when the police are called up for service, if one has a reserve of manpower in the form of retired police officers, men whose services can be put to very good use because of their experience. This Bill now makes provision for the establishment of a reserve list of officers.</p>

<p>For the rest I want to refer hon. members to the clauses which deal with the reserve Police Force and which bring them under the various regulations. Protection is also being given to the reservist who, without salary, serves as a policeman. In the future he will be dealt with for all practical purposes as though he is a policeman.</p>

<p>During the Committee Stage I intend to give notice of one amendment which will deal with the medical treatment of police who have already retired. This is a matter about which there have been arguments for years, and hon. members will be able to discuss it further in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister can rest assured that we also regard this as an uncontentious measure. I can also assure him that despite that fact we shall not detain him very long with the second reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has pointed to the only real principle in this Bill and that is the principle contained in Clause 21. It deals with the police reserve force of officers and the remuneration to be paid to members of the reserve. It is in regard to this remuneration that I should like to bring one matter to the notice of the hon. the Minister. These reservists have, of course, normal life assurance cover. Most of them have motor cars, that is one of their assets. As the hon. Minister knows they are required to use their motor cars for police reserve duty. This is the only way in which it operates efficiently as an emergency force, giving them immediate mobility. It has been brought to my attention that a number of insurance companies load these persons on their life assurance cover to the extent of about 10 per cent. And they are also loaded about 10 per cent in respect of their comprehensive car insurance cover if they use their motor cars for police reserve duty, which, as I have indicated, they have to do. I bring this to the notice of the hon. the Minister in the hope that in fixing the remuneration that will be paid to these persons in terms of Clause 21, this will be taken into account.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This is largely a measure designed to bring terminology up to date with the constitutional change of status of South Africa and also to place in statutory order various administrative changes that have been found necessary to introduce in the police department. I am particularly pleased that the hon. the Minister and the Police Force are reverting to the arrangement of dividing the country into divisional areas. I said at the time that I thought it was a retrograde step to adopt a change in terminology and to call sub-regions &#x201C;police-controlled&#x201D; areas. I was one of the persons who expressed regret at that change in the 1961 legislation and I am pleased to see that the conventional arrangement is to be restored.</p>

<p>There is a second provision in the Bill in respect of which I should like some information <span class="col_6431-6432" refersTo="page_549"/>from the hon. the Minister and that is in regard to Clause 20. In this clause arbitrary powers are being conferred upon the Commissioner of Police in the new sub-sections (4) of Section 34 of the Police Act. Sub-section (4) of Clause 20 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commissioner or any commissioned officer acting under his authority may at any time dismiss from the force any special constable or member of the Reserve Police Force.</block>

<p>I appreciate that the power is not a general one affecting all members of the force and that it is confined to the dismissal of either a special constable or a member of the Police Reserve Force. The point at issue, however, is the summary dismissal of an employee of the State. I think we should remember that in this situation the State is functioning in the capacity of an employer. In that capacity I do not believe it is either entitled or justified to assume to itself powers which are fairly and rightly denied to ordinary employers, the contractual employers. Whatever the terms of the agreement may be between the State and the special constable or the member of the police reserve it is basically an agreement of employment and in my view we should regard it as such. Just as I cannot justify a summary dismissal of a contractual employee without good and sufficient reason, so I cannot justify the summary dismissal of a State employee under some arbitrary powers granted by Parliament to a particular official. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that, whether in this case the special constable or the member of the reserve force is a contractual servant or a statutory servant, his rights and his tenure of office must, in the interests of good Government, be protected against arbitrary and even capricious dismissal.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister will know a State employee generally is safeguarded against dismissal by the provisions of the law under which he operates. Usually the grounds on which dismissal or discharge may be made are prescribed by law or there is prescribed by law the setting up of some suitable body to carry out a disciplinary trial or inquiry at which the official concerned may be heard or may be represented. In this instance there seems to be a complete departure from that salutory principle accepted throughout public administration. I cannot see why the provisions of Section 17 should not be applied in a case such as we are dealing with here. As the Minister knows in that case there is either a trial or a disciplinary form of inquiry which resolves the issue on which the official concerned acts. I hope the hon. the Minister will explain why there is this departure from what I consider to be a sound principle. Perhaps he can deal with this better in the Committee Stage, but I would like to ask the hon. Minister to go into this matter because as the clause now reads it simply amounts to what I have said is a summary dismissal, which introduces something entirely foreign into the Public Service Administration.</p>

<p>I thank hon. members for the brief and succinct way in which they conducted this debate and for the support which they have given this Bill. I must say in all honesty that I was perturbed by the disclosure made here by the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell), and I am very grateful for the fact that he raised the matter here. I was not aware of the fact that insurance companies acted in that way. Let me say at once that I regard it as very unfair in the first instance to load the premium which is payable on the personal life insurance of people and also to load the premium payable by them in respect of their motor insurance. I do hope that now that the hon. member for Durban (North) has raised the matter here, this practice will come to an end. I want to associate myself with him in making an appeal to the insurance companies, and I do so in all seriousness. They ought not to do this. Let us be perfectly clear on this point: These people do not do this work in their own interests; they do not do it because they have nothing else to do; they do it purely out of a sense of duty and love of their country; they want to render a service to their country. They do not do it in their own interests; they do it in the interests of all of us, including the insurance companies, and I honestly do not think that that is a fair approach; it may be a business approach but the attitude which they adopt with regard to this matter is not a fair approach. The consequences of this practice, which the hon. member has brought to my notice, will be gone into immediately, and I shall do whatever I can in this matter.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) is concerned, the hon. member knows that there are two types of retired people who may be re-employed. In the first place, there are those people who do not have commissioned rank and, secondly, those who do have commissioned rank. This Bill now provides that people holding commissioned rank may also be employed in the reserve force of police officers. The hon. member will understand that it is not so much a question of employing the man; it is more a question of engaging him temporarily to take the place of an officer who is temporarily absent. If you first have to convene a council meeting every time you want to get rid of such a person&#x2019;s services, it will take so long to get rid of him when his services are no longer required that it will not be worthwhile employing him.</p>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the half-hour?</p>

<p>The failure of the hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to prevent the South African Broadcasting Corporation from becoming a medium of propaganda for the Government and also of the Broederbond, has probably obscured the fact that he is also responsible for two large Government Departments, viz., the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Health. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is under discussion this evening. I do not wish the hon. Minister to deduct from my words that we are not going to deal with the S.A.B.C. Indeed we will do so later. But I do feel that we should first of all deal with certain very important matters and call him to account for things he has done or failed to do in regard to the Post Office itself. Many of the things that have happened, not only in regard to the S.A.B.C., but also in regard to the Post Office and his administration, and I am sorry to say his inefficiency in regard to that administration, are so glaringly obvious, that I am sure hon. members will not be surprised to hear that I am moving the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To reduce the amount by R5,000 from the Item &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of that if accepted, and I am sure it will be accepted by this House, would be to halve the hon. Minister&#x2019;s salary. We are indeed being extremely generous to the hon. the Minister. Last year, we moved that the amount should be reduced by R3,000. The fact that we are now increasing the amount to R5,000 is an indication that the hon. Minister has not added lustre to his name as a Minister during the past year. Indeed we regard his views on everything, whether it be television, the S.A.B.C., or be it his role in respect of lotteries, as so outdated that I believe that the only appropriate thing the hon. Minister did during the past year was that when he addressed a meeting at Naboomspruit in the Transvaal, he entered the township on an oxwagon. And indeed the pace of the hon. Minister and the mind of the hon. the Minister is the pace of the ox and the mind of the ox.</p>

<p>The Post Office is a mighty and a great organization. It is asking us for no less than R75,000,000 on the Estimates on Revenue and R30,000,000 on Loan Account. It has an establishment of more than 36,000 able staff, well and truly represented by staff organizations which have indeed done a great deal for the Post Office employees. They deserve the gratitude of all interested in the Post Office.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) seems to be occupied only with the question whether we are winning votes or not. Sir, he is so irrelevant in the remarks that he is making that I think I shall refer to him in future as the hon. member for Ventersdorp, Mr. Cassius &#x201C;Kleitrap&#x201D;. During the past year these associations asked for certain important improvements in staff conditions in the Post Office. Though some of these were granted, I believe that not enough was done in regard to these very important requests which were made by the staff associations to the hon. Minister. Indeed many of the concessions were only made after there had been long and sometimes apparently fruitless negotiations by desperate people trying to do their best to help the staff in the Post Office. There have been meetings of protest throughout the country and very often there were frustrating delays while the matter was discussed and went from Post Office Staff Board to the Public Service Commission, to the Minister to the Postmaster-General&#x2014;back and forth all the time. I believe that we in this country owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the Post Office staff, and I believe that the hon. Minister should give a more tangible sign of that gratitude. I think particularly of the hardworking people in the lowest grades in the Post Office. I think of the postmen and the post office clerks when they enter the Post Office service first of all, on those very low salary and other conditions which very often amount to real hardship for these young men. They deserve a better beginning in life in the Post Office. Mr. Chairman, resignations are to-day still on a high level, albeit that they have been decreasing slightly during the past year. Why have they been decreasing, even to this small extent? The reply is to be <span class="col_6435-6436" refersTo="page_551"/>found in certain methods that have been adopted by the Post Office that I cannot deplore too much. Sir, actually a sword is being held over the heads of the post office employees, forcing them to remain in the post office, when the real thing that should have been done was to have kept them in the post office through improved conditions. Do you know, Sir, that the post office has gone and made a special arrangement with, <i>inter alia,</i> the S.A.B.C. and also a large bank in South Africa that neither would hire the others&#x2019; employees before six months have elapsed after that employee has resigned?</p>

<p>Quite right. I have done the same.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Minister of Transport&#x2019;s agreement is not nearly as bad as the one made with Volkskas and with the S.A.B.C. He does not know about these other agreements. Why force these employees who want to change their jobs to be without work, unemployed, for at least six months? That is not the way to keep staff. The way to keep staff is to improve conditions. Sir, we are particularly concerned about the difficulties which the technical staff in the Post Office undergo at the present moment. We know that they have been desperate during the past months, how they were promised a commission, how that commission sat (the Rive Commission), and how it reported. Sir, if ever there was a case where a matter was badly and foolishly handled at ministerial and Cabinet level, it was the implementation of those aspects of the Rive Report that were acceptable to the Post Office people. Let us say first of all that many of those recommendations were unacceptable, but in so far as they did provide some form of improvement for the technical and engineering staff, much more could have been done to see that they were more efficiently implemented, that there was not this long delay, nor this uncertainty in the statements which were issued, statements so uncertain and so contradictory that a protest meeting was held at which certain rather dire and sometimes even irresponsible threats were made against the hon. Minister himself. Sir, when do we start to realize that the technical and engineering man is a specialist and that a specialist must be paid according to his merits, according to his talents and according to his worth. Why, Sir, in Great Britain there are at least five members in the Post Office Department who receive much more than the actual Minister in Britain himself. The Minister receives &#x00A3;5,000, but there are people receiving &#x00A3;8,000 a year in the Post Office Department in Britain. Unless we look after our technical people in the Post Office and elsewhere then indeed we are going to have the continual difficulties we have experienced in the past as regards lack of staff.</p>

<p>If there is one indication of how the chances in the Post Office are less favourable for the ordinary Post Office staff member than in any other Government Department, the following statistics prove it. Do you know, Sir, that the higher posts among the 36,000 posts in the Post Office Department number less than 2 per cent? It is the lowest by far of any State Department. The chances for advancement are the worst in the Post Office to-day. I know there have been some small so-called improvements for one can actually call them improvements when the percentage of higher posts, according to the Estimates on the Table, amounts to less than 2 per cent of the total of the staff? The percentage of higher posts in other State Departments is very much higher. They go from 8 per cent, 10 per cent, 13 per cent to 18 per cent in the case of the Department of Agriculture and to 33 per cent in the case of the Department of Information. So we have this difficulty in regard to the technical staff with the ordinary man in the Post Office looking for better chances of advancement. It is high time that there were better opportunities along the lines that I have suggested. Coming to conditions in the Post Office, Sir, the lack of accommodation apparently is growing worse instead of better throughout the length and breadth of South Africa. One need only look at the amounts which have been made available on Loan Account for Post Office buildings to see that year after year in the past four years these amounts from Capital Account have been decreasing. In an expanding Post Office with more staff the amount made available for expansion of capital works and buildings has actually been decreasing. I am referring to building and not to the general Capital Account.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, following on what the hon. member has said, does he wish to propose that the salary of the Chairman of the South African Broadcasting Corporation be increased?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I have no idea what that has to do with what I am saying now. My reply is quite obvious. I see no reason why the salary of the Chairman of the South African Broadcasting Corporation should be increased. I find very many reasons why it could be decreased, but the trouble of course is that we in this House, we who pay the licence fees, are not allowed to hear what the salary of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C. is.</p>

<p>To return to staff matters, I think the time has come again to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not reconsider his decision in regard to Post Office employees in the Transkei, who have been asking politely but firmly for a special Transkei allowance, which is granted to people in other Departments. Indeed, Sir, the position is so bad that the President of the Post and Telegraphs Association had this to say a few days ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is tragies dat dit so is. Beamptes ontvang tot R50 meer as Poskantoor-beamptes, maar desondanks word laaasgenoemde se huise summier onder hulle uitverkoop en aan daardie bevoorregte groep mense toegeken. Ek weet nie of die Posmeester-generaal of die Staatsdienskommissie vir hierdie onreg verantwoordelik is nie, maar as dit die Posmeester-generaal is, dan is ons jammer dat ons horn by hierdie geleentheid openlik moet aanval.</block>

<p>The responsible person is not the Postmaster-General. The responsible person is the hon. the Minister himself. Regarding the Postmaster-General, I should like to say in passing that we understand he is going to Vienna for a very important postal conference. I am sure that he has the support of everyone on this side in any steps that he may take to strengthen our position in that international organization. I should also, however, like to ask the hon. the Minister to give us a statement what the position is at present in regard to the other countries in Africa and the African Postal Organization, because there have been complaints that parcels to other states in Africa have been returned unopened and that the postal authorities in some other African states have refused to accept postal articles from South Africa.</p>

<p>Coming to the Post Office finances itself, we see that it has a surplus, and a splendid one, of R13,000,000. With a surplus such as that I think we can really claim that services should in many respects be improved. May I ask, for instance, why it was necessary to increase postal box rentals during the last year? Why was it necessary to increase them by R2, namely, from R3 to R5, bringing an additional increase of R260,000 to the Post Office&#x2014;a quarter of a million rand&#x2014;extra when there already is a surplus of R13,000,000? I say it was utterly unnecessary. That decision should be reconsidered. We should go back to the old Post Office box rental we had in the past. We should also like to have an assurance that when the proposed new coins are minted and when the tickey disappears&#x2014;and it might happen&#x2014;it will not be used as an excuse by the Post Office to increase the price of calls at ordinary call boxes.</p>

<p>There is another important matter which I feel I should raise. I have raised it by means of questions in this House. This is in regard to the naming of the Post Office to be erected in Rissik Street in Johannesburg. Apparently it has become a sort of tradition in South Africa for edifices, tunnels, dams, etc., to be named after prominent persons. Here, however, was a special instance of a name being given to a Post Office in Johannesburg against the wishes of the majority of the inhabitants of the city. I asked that the hon. the Minister tells me which great organizations representing Johannesburg approached him to rename the Rissik Street Post Office the Hendrik Verwoerd Post Office. What he did was to give me a long list of names, namely, the A.T.K.V., the F.A.K., and other organizations, including, as he said, the three Afrikaans Churches, which are affiliated to the Federale Raad van Sakekomitees in Johannesburg. He gave me those names. One had the impression from his answer that they all approached him directly. I continued with my questions, and what did I discover some time later? I discovered that not a single one of those organizations had approached him directly to rename the Post Office, but that the request had actually come from one body only, namely, the Federale Raad van Skakelkomitees in Johannesburg itself. I am quite sure that that organization had not approached all the other bodies and had also not been approached by all the Churches in this matter. Who is behind this? The hon. the Minister said Johannesburg asked him. Let me tell him: Johannesburg did not ask for that name for this Post Office. The City Council of Johannesburg rejected it. The representatives of the largest political party in the whole of Johannesburg rejected it firmly and out of hand. The demand came from an organization which, together with the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings, bears the same post office box number and the same address and the same telephone number as the person who is also the General Secretary of the Broederbond. If you look at the address of his organization, you will see that it is Simmonds Street 95. You will notice that the post office box number is 8711&#x2014;not to be confused with 4711. You will find that that is the post office box number of the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings and also the post box number of the Secretary of the Broederbond, who actually are behind this changing of the name. I am indeed surprised that a post office organization such as the Afrikaanse <span class="col_6439-6440" refersTo="page_553"/>Taal-en Kultuurbond should be affiliated to this body and should, as a Post Office body have asked that the name of the Prime Minister should be given to this particular Post Office. It is entirely wrong that it was done. I believe that it was wrong too that the Chairman of the A.T.K.V., who is the Postmaster-General, should have been associated with a request of this nature. I, therefore, appeal to the hon. the Minister. We do not intend any personal slight to the hon. the Prime Minister, but I believe that, through the information the hon. the Minister has given to this House, he has embarrassed the Prime Minister, that he has given information to the Prime Minister which was not correct but which was untrue, and that on that account, he should avoid embarrassment to the Prime Minister by deciding that he will no longer give that particular name to the Post Office in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words&#x2014;I am sure I shall have the hon. member for Vereeniging on my side in this matter&#x2014;about the confiscation of lottery tickets. I am sure that I have the support of many hon. members on the other side of the House in what I am going to say now. It will be in regard to the confiscation of the lottery tickets and the keeping back of the money in the envelopes containing those tickets by the hon. the Minister himself. I am saying what I have to say without going into the question of whether lotteries are advisable or not. I trust that we shall not have a moral lecture from the hon. the Minister as we had last year on the Broederbond and on television. The fact is that 42,080 letters were kept back and that those letters contained R133,000 of the public&#x2019;s money. Up to the present moment that issue has not been finalized, and tens of thousands of rand are being kept by the post office. They are refusing to pay back the money in hundreds of instances. They have changed their policy in regard to it. I have correspondence here from all over South Africa. I have cases where people applying for the money had to fill in special forms, and had to give the numbers of the counterfoils, and go before a Commissioner of Oaths. I have letters from other people indicating that they had written months ago and that they had received a reply from the post office that nothing had been done about the matter to finalize it yet. I have a telegram which was brought to my notice today from someone in Johannesburg who said that he had received a letter signed by the Postmaster-General which stated that the whole question of participation in lotteries was still under consideration and despite Press reports to the contrary that the orders could be returned at that stage. Some people have had their postal orders returned. Others have not. I have correspondence here on one case in which a first application was made on 27 January for the return of the money. On February 17 a form was filled in. On February 19 another form, giving all the particulars necessary, was filled in and then, after a wait of weeks, a letter arrived from the Postmaster-General regretting the delay and saying that no decision had yet been taken. The latest is a letter of 28 April, also from the Postmaster-General saying: &#x201C;The whole question is still under consideration and I am afraid that it will be necessary to retain your postal order until a decision has been reached, when I shall write to you again.&#x201D; Has there ever been a Minister so incapable of reaching a decision as this Minister? These postal orders and these letters were kept back four, five and six months ago and he is probably continuing to do so. He has not yet reached a decision on what to do about it. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of rand of the public&#x2019;s money is being held by the post office and tens of thousands of people, among them widows and poor people, are wondering what has happened to the money. [Interjections.] I know this is a matter of small concern to members on the other side, but among the letters held back, there was an important letter containing a vital contract worth tens of thousands of rand which had nothing whatsoever to do with lotteries. It was held back and that contract with a Rhodesian firm was nearly wrecked. I know it is of no concern to members on the other side of the House that a certain home for retarded children lost R13,000 in income through the action of the hon. the Minister. I know it is of no concern to him. We can hear the laughter on the other side when they hear these things, yet these matters are of concern to poor people&#x2014;to the sick and to the needy. I say that of all the petty deeds of the hon. the Minister, I regard this as the pettiest and of all his childish actions I regard this as the most puerile of them all. We adults do not need the hon. the Minister to look after our morals in regard to taking a ticket in a lottery. We do not need him to give us a lottery lecture. I wonder whether there is a single hon. member on the other side who in his own life, whether it be at a church lottery, a picnic or any type of lottery, has not taken out a lottery ticket. Is there one? I ask them through you, Sir. Not a single one. Are the 105 hon. members on the other side all guilty in the eyes of the hon. the Minister? Another point is that these postal orders do not remain valid for always. They become stale after a period of three months, I believe. What is going to happen to them? Is the post office going to confiscate them? Do not let the Minister come and tell us that he can do nothing in regard to this matter, because Section 35 of the Act empowers the Postmaster-General to return even such postal orders and such letters. We demand that the hon. the Minister should stop this nonsense and that he should return the money. The money is not his. Let him return the tickets. He has no right to them whatsoever. Indeed, speaking of tickets, I think it is time that the hon. the Minister got his ticket of leave, a permanent ticket of leave. We know that there are important Cabinet changes in the offing, and it may well be that this is the last opportunity that the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs will have in representing <span class="col_6441-6442" refersTo="page_554"/>the post office in the rather inefficient way he has done in the past. I only hope he will not take the post office with him, too. In a Cabinet which does not contain many talents, he has shown a lack of talent in administration, a lack of consideration for the people under him, a preoccupation with matters utterly foreign to the post office and akin more to television and other evils, imaginary or otherwise, which the hon. the Minister sees. I hope that when the time comes the hon. the Prime Minister will see to it that we have another Minister of Posts and Telegraphs next year, and instead of having to ask for a reduction of R5,000 in the salary of the hon. the Minister, it will not even be necessary to pay him anything at all.</p>

He asked who had made that request. I do not know whether his information is correct or not but I want to tell him that it was the Federale Raad van die Afrikaanse Skakelkomitees in Johannesburg which made that request and that this Federale Raad covers the city of Johannesburg and all its suburbs. That Federale Raad has liaison with numbers of other associations.

I want to point out to the hon. member that there are thousands of railway officials, Afrikaans-speaking people, on the Rand. If he inquires he will find that they are all, almost without exception, members of the A.T.K.V.

<p>I want to help the hon. member to wake up to reality. He always reports to the <i>Sunday Times</i> simply in order to have his photograph published. For example, he let fall these pearls of wisdom&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Johannesburg is predominantly an English-speaking city and overwhelmingly behind the United Party.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that is not so. The whole of the Rand is at present divided up into 36 constituencies, including Vereeniging, Vanderbijlpark, Kempton Park and so forth.</p>

<p>But is it a Rand post office or a Johannesburg post office?</p>

<speech by="#knobel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am speaking of the Rand because it is a central post office for the Rand. The hon. member used the same argument in connection with the Johannesburg Advisory Committee on the S.A.B.C. I have it here in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> It was actually on that occasion that he said that Johannesburg was predominantly an English-speaking city.</p>

<speech by="#knobel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will have the opportunity to state his own case. I just want to point out to the hon. member that of the 36 constituencies on the Rand, 18 are National Party seats. I want to give the hon. <span class="col_6443-6444" refersTo="page_555"/>member the assurance that after the next general election the picture there will be completely different. I want, once and for all, to deny here this afternoon that Johannesburg is overwhelmingly English speaking; that is not true. There may be small spots in Johannesburg like Houghton and a few other suburbs which are predominantly English speaking, but this is not true of Johannesburg as a whole.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Orange Grove that he has not insulted the hon. the Minister here by objecting to the fact that that post office will be called the Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd Post Office; nor has he insulted the hon. the Prime Minister. He has not insulted himself either because I do not think he can be insulted. Let me tell the House whom he has insulted. He has insulted the Afrikaans-speaking intelligentsia on the Rand. Those are the people whom he has insulted here. What is wrong with that post office bearing the name of Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd? This is not the first time something of this nature has happened in the Republic of South Africa. There are numbers and numbers of examples that I can mention in this regard to-day. I want to mention, for example, the Jan Smuts Airport. What is wrong with that?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>General Smuts was a great man, an historical figure, and we do not begrudge his family the fact that his name is perpetuated in this way. We also have the Louis Botha Airport; we have the D. F. Malan Airport. Perhaps the hon. member will say that all these people are now dead; he does sometimes argue in that stupid way, but I just want to tell him that when the Jan Smuts Airport was put into operation, General Smuts was still alive. When the D. F. Malan Airport was opened, Dr. Malan was still alive. We also have the Strijdom Airport. We have also the Duncan Dock and the Sturrock Dock. What is wrong with that? There is another fact I want to mention for the hon. member&#x2019;s edification. On 1 April 1955 the great bridge over the railway lines in Johannesburg was opened, the bridge at the lower end of Sauer Street, and the City Council of Johannesburg called that bridge the Queen Elizabeth bridge.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>Whom did they consult? They did not consult the Johannesburg public. But I ask again, what is wrong with that? I do not object to the fact that the Johannesburg City Council of their own volition decided that that over-bridge should be called the Queen Elizabeth over-bridge. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) has devoted the whole of his speech to a defence of the naming of the Hendrik Verwoerd Post Office, and in doing so he has completely missed the whole point. Nobody has ever objected to the Strydom Tunnel or the Hendrik Verwoerd dam. The objection is that at the request of a politically orientated sectional organization&#x2026;[Interjections.] It is sectional. It represents only a section of a section of the people of South Africa. On a sectional demand the name of a living political figure is attached to the post office of the largest city of South Africa, Johannesburg. It is usual to name airports, dams and bridges after people but it is so ridiculous for people to give their address as p/o Hendrik Verwoerd. Johannesburg is known throughout the world. To most people it is synonymous with South Africa. People will now have to give their address as p/o Hendrik Verwoerd. People will say: &#x201C;What is this? Is this the new capital of South Africa?&#x201D; [Interjections.] Sir, the objection is firstly that a controversial political figure, whilst in office, is having his name attached to a postal address of a commercial centre, world known, and an area which, despite what that hon. member may have to say, does not want it and has not asked for it. This is not the Vereeniging Post Office or the Krugersdorp Post Office. The hon. member talks if the Witwatersrand asked for it: he says that more than 50 per cent of the Witwatersrand asked for it. That is not even true. Does he claim that the A.T.K.V. is the only intelligentsia. [Interjections.] I repeat this, Sir, so that it may be recorded. The hon. member for Brakpan says they are the only intelligentsia.</p>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>Some of the intelligentsia, I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>He said they were the intelligentsia. I place that on record so that the rest of South Africa will know that this Nationalist Party, officially through a spokesman in Parliament, claimed to themselves the intelligentsia of South Africa. The other objection of the hon. member for Bethlehem was that we attacked the Minister. If ever a Minister deserved to be attacked, if ever a Minister deserved to have his salary reduced then this is the Minister who deserves it; this Minister of notorious assegai fame; this Minister whose thinking follows that direction in that he believes South Africa&#x2019;s communications should be by tom-tom; this Minister who is holding back the communications of South Africa deserves the censure of this House, and I shall tell you why, Sir. Because he has not got the willingness or the ability to bring South Africa in line with the modern needs of a modern country. Anywhere you go in the world you feel ashamed of your own country when you compare its communications with others. We cannot have television because it is a little bioscope. What they are really afraid of is that on television the viewers will see the shame on the faces of the readers of the slanted news that is being put over the radio to-day.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This hon. member has apparently never left Ventersdorp&#x2019;s backyard. He says it is the best in the world! Compare our telephone system with that in any modern country, even with under-developed countries and see how it compares. It is a disgrace that South Africa, with all our wealth, with all our modern ideas in the sphere of commerce and industry, should have to live and struggle with the system we have to-day. There have been advances such as automatic exchanges in rural areas but that is completely negatived by the fact that there is no staff to man those exchanges. You can ring for 20 or 30 minutes before you can raise a rural exchange which is now connected with so-called automatic telephones. Take a city like Durban. You find that commerce and industry, the very life of Durban, is subjected to a telephone system truly in keeping with what I call the tom-tom ideas of the Minister. [Interjections.] The Durban City Council has the one telephone service where you can get service. If you apply to the Durban City Council for a telephone you can get it installed in a couple of days. But if you ask for one in Cape Town you are told the exchanges are over-loaded. Just try to get a telephone in Newlands if you are not a Member of Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I asked questions of the Minister in regard to the trunk service in Durban. He admitted in his reply that the delays from Durban to Johannesburg were sometimes from 60 to 120 minutes&#x2014;longer than it takes to fly there. You can book a telephone call in Durban and be in Johannesburg before the call comes through. That is the position in which we find ourselves today. You can fly to a city 400 miles away and beat your own telephone call. But then you have to spend anything up to half an hour in getting the exchange first. It is all very well to say the delay is 60 or 120 minutes but what about the time you have to spend in getting the exchange? Sir, we are not all living on Government benefits; our time is not worthless. People in business place a value on their time. To-day you cannot conduct essential urgent business by telephone because you do not know how long you will have to wait for the call &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member does not know what he is talking about himself. Anybody who wants to use the trunk-call system from Durban to-day is afraid to book a call because, even if he has been told there is an hour&#x2019;s delay, it may come through in half an hour or it may come through in an hour and a half. He is tied to his desk waiting for the call. You may have to wait for 24 hours for a trunk call. I had an example of this over the Easter recess of a person who was waiting for a call until the next morning. There was a 24 hours&#x2019; delay to get through to Louren&#x00E7;o Marques.</p>

<p>Order! Before I called upon the hon. member for Venters-dorp (Mr. Greyling) to address the Committee I want to revert to the point of order raised by the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell). I find that, in similar circumstances, Mr. Speaker Conradie in a ruling pointed out that it was a privilege for an hon. member to get up and to ask the hon. member addressing the House a question and if the request was turned down by the hon. member addressing the House he should not be accused of being scared. I therefore consider myself bound by the ruling of Mr. Speaker Conradie.</p>
