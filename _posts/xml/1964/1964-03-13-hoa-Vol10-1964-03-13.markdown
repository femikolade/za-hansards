<heading>Protection Against Ionizing Radiation</heading>

<p>The MINISTER OF MINES replied to Question No. *IV, by Mr. Wood, standing over from 10 March.</p>

<question by="#wood" to="#minister_of_mines">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he has received any reports of a threat of ill-effects to health or property arising from ionizing radiations or contamination by radio-activity from nuclear fuel or from any nuclear waste from the combustion of nuclear fuel in or outside the Republic; if so, from what source does the threat arise; and</li>

<li>(2) whether steps have been taken to investigate the matter; if so, what steps.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_mines" to="#wood">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. The threat to health as a result of over-exposure to ionizing radiation or excessive radio-activity is known ever since the discovery of ionizing radiation and nuclear fission. Protection against over-exposure to such radiation and radio-activity has been the subject of investigation in a large number of countries overseas as well as in the Republic. The threat arises from the <span class="col_2973-2974" refersTo="page_0179"/>process of nuclear fission as well as from the radio-activity emitted by radio-active isotopes resulting from such nuclear fission.</li>

<li>(2) Investigations in and outside the Republic are continuously being undertaken in order to discover even better and more efficient methods than are known at present of protecting both workers employed in the use of radioactive isotopes and nuclear installations as well as the general public. I may add for the hon. member&#x2019;s information that the South African Atomic Energy Board has a special division entrusted with the control over the use of radioactive isotopes and the protection of workers and the public against ionizing radiation.</li>

<from>Mr. DURRANT:</from>

<p>Arising out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply, may I ask whether any of the temporary employees are likely to be appointed to the permanent staff after five years&#x2019; service&#x003F;</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#durrant">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<p>To avoid any misunderstanding I can say that Coloured persons regularly employed in the service have been regarded as permanent and casuals as temporary servants. The daily average of 367 intermittent casual labourers employed at the harbours have not been included in the replies to parts (1) (b) and (2) of the question.</p>

<from>*The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<p>As I have already explained, the Coloured labourers are not on the permanent staff as is the case with the Europeans. They are temporary, but they are regarded as permanent because they are regularly employed. The others are casual labourers. They do not have the same privileges as the Europeans appointed to the permanent staff.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is the last stage of the passage of the Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill through this House and the last opportunity many of us will have of exchanging a few words with the hon. the Minister in connection with matters concerning his Department. The interesting thing we had during the course of the debate was the attempt on the part of the hon. the Minister not to state what his attitude was in regard to the Van Zyl Commission before some of his supporters had first tried to draw us on this side of the House to state our attitude. Of course that was a very obvious political manoeuvre and I am surprised that the hon. the Minister could have thought it would succeed, because it was obvious right from the beginning. But what is interesting is that after the hon. the Minister had stated his attitude an attempt was made to tag the majority report on to the Opposition, which also failed, as did the attempt of the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) who made a furious speech in which he discussed an attitude which nobody in this House had adopted. That kind of manoeuvre will not succeed, Sir. We think the supporters of the hon. the Minister should not so obviously try to play politics with these important matters. It is very clear what our attitude is. The Van Zyl Commission was appointed by the Minister to advise him in connection with a problem which was obviously giving him trouble. It was the Minister&#x2019;s commission; they reported to him and it was for the Minister to decide what he was going to do with that report. As far as we were concerned we were interested onlookers at this attempt of the hon. the Minister to get himself out of the difficulty. And what happened&#x003F; The commission reported and did not assist the Minister greatly because in the first place the report was a divided report. There was no unanimity. <span class="col_2983-2984" refersTo="page_0184"/>The minority report advanced very pertinent and strong arguments against the majority. On the other hand the majority consisted of people whose authority cannot easily be ignored, prominent businessmen and prominent railway officials. But the end of the matter was that the Minister practically ended where he had begun, namely, that he had to decide for himself what attitude to adopt in regard to the question of railway workshops. He was in that position before the appointment of the commission. It was always necessary, also before the commission was appointed, for the hon. the Minister to approach the problem on the basis that it was a question of principle, just as we on this side of the House have from the outset approached this problem on the basis that it was a matter of principle, a basis which we explained to the Minister in a preceding debate, a debate in which we stated our attitude clearly. Where we approach this matter on the basis that it is a matter of principle I do not think it is necessary for us to go into the question of whether the minority or the majority report should be accepted. There was never any necessity for such a commission. The Minister is the person who needed the advice, not us. We believe&#x2014;and I repeat this&#x2014;that South Africa is a State which is based on private initiative and that is why we believe that wherever possible private initiative should do the work of the State. We cannot accept that private undertakings generally are less efficient than Government undertakings. There may be exceptions which I shall deal with later. We cannot accept that because experience throughout the world has shown that the tendency is for private undertakings to be more efficient than Government undertakings. We have experience of that in all spheres in South Africa. We had the classic example in the Transvaal where it cost the State as much as &#x00A3;11,000 to construct one mile of road but when the road construction contract was handed out to a private undertaking, the costs dropped to &#x00A3;4,000 and so I can give you endless examples, Sir. Our attitude is that generally speaking private undertakings are more efficient than Government or public undertakings. The commission also found to that effect but then the hon. the Minister wanted to quarrel with us because we refused to accept this general statement.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it may be true in regard to specific tenders but the only point I want to make is that it does not follow that we accept as a general statement that private undertakings are of necessity less efficient than Government undertakings nor do I think the hon. the Minister accepts that. There are so many instances where that has not been proved that I do not think the hon. the Minister can judge without investigating the matter in further detail. For example, it is not clear from the commission&#x2019;s report whether they took into consideration the fact that the Railways transport their raw materials to the workshops free of charge whereas private undertakings have to pay the Railways for such transportation. But what is particularly not clear is whether the profits which the Railways make from transporting the raw materials required by private undertakings were taken into account. That is one example where there is no clarity; there are many others. But let us leave the details at this stage and confine ourselves to the principle, and that is that we believe that in principle it is more sound for a country like South Africa to encourage private initiative where possible. However, one does not want to be dogmatic in these matters. Of course there are exceptions and we on this side of the House have stated those exceptions and they were also stated the other day by the Minister when he made his final recommendations for the future; point No. 8 of his heads of arguments that where it was necessary to perform a certain service in the public interest and where there was no private undertaking who wanted or could do it&#x2014;and when I talk about &#x201C;could do&#x201D; I not only mean whether they are physically able to do it but also whether they can do it economically&#x2014;it was the duty of the State to step into the breach and to provide that service. That was also how the Minister put it. If I remember correctly the hon. the Minister said that where private initiative could not continually and efficiently provide in the needs of the Railways he would let the railway workshops do the work. There we agree with him. But what I find interesting is this that after the appointment of the commission the members of which the Minister himself selected, the Minister does not accept their report but he draws certain conclusions as to the principle, conclusions which are based on sound United Party policy. That is what is so clear. If the hon. the Minister were to pay more attention to the attitude of this Opposition he will spare himself many commissions and a <span class="col_2985-2986" refersTo="page_0185"/>great deal of embarrassment. Hon. members opposite wanted to make out the case that we were opposed to the railway workshops and that we wanted the people who work there, particularly the artisans, to be dismissed; that we wanted to take the bread out of their mouths. That is really going too far politically. The United Party has and can have no such idea. Those railway workshops were established in terms of United Party policy because they had to do work which private initiative did not or could not do. During the war years, as the Minister correctly stated, they rendered invaluable services to South Africa. We are living in difficult times, Sir, and we may need them again. It would be short-sighted to do anything to make them less efficient or to do away with them. Not only that. Those people, particularly the artisans who work in the railway workshops, are the most alert, the most independent workers, in the employ of the South African Railways. They were the people who, since this Government took over, had to take the lead on numerous occasions, had to make themselves unpopular, had to stick out their necks, to force the Minister to improve the conditions of service of the whole staff. How could we possibly wish to see such valuable people, such independent people, people who are a credit to the independent spirit of our South African nation, people who have the courage to stand up to the Minister, not get their fair share&#x003F; Every railwayman in South Africa ought to be grateful for the fact that there are such men like the artisans who work in the railway workshops to-day. This sort of argument will bring us nowhere, Sir.</p>

<p>What we wish to reiterate is that we agree with what the Minister has done. We agree with him that in future he will as far as possible limit the work done by these workshops to maintenance and repair jobs. We agree that they will not unnecessarily undertake new manufacturing processes. But we take it that where that is necessary, it will be done where private initiative is not available to do it or does not want to do it. We agree with all that.</p>

<p>With what do you not agree&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has been asleep so far. We do not agree that in principle public undertakings should be given preference. We say that in principle preference should be given to private initiative. When you do ask public undertakings to do anything you do so by way of exception on certain fixed bases, namely, that it is in the public interest that the work be done and that private initiative cannot do it or does not want to do it.</p>

<p>I just want to repeat. The statements made by the Minister are all very well, but it depends on how they can be interpreted in practice. The Minister knows to-day what principles we shall apply when we judge the manner in which he applies that statement of policy of his in practice. If that application does not comply with the principles laid down by us we shall criticize him and call him to order before the nation. But it does not follow that the wild political allegations made by the other side of the House are of any value whatsoever.</p>

<p>As far as incentive bonuses are concerned I think certain aspects in that regard should be discussed at a later stage. I personally am at the present moment trying to ascertain with great interest how this bonus system works. I hope we shall have an opportunity at a later stage of discussing it. One aspect in particular has come to my notice which I very much want to raise with the Minister immediately. The artisans in the employ of the Railways who are connected with the building industry have a complaint which seems to be justified. Their complaint is that where they are placed in charge of Native workers the achievements of that span are taken into account in determining whether they comply with the norm on which the artisans&#x2019; bonus is calculated. But the span of Natives themselves do not get a bonus. The artisan in charge of the span of Natives has to qualify for the bonus but the span of Natives, whose work makes it possible for him thus to qualify, do not get a bonus. It works this way in practice: Say, for example, a plasterer has to peg the foundations of a building, dig them and fill them with concrete. He has to build the initial foundation walls; he has to do everything which forms part of one process for the purposes of calculating the norm. The digging is done by a span of Natives. If that work is not finished within a certain period of time he is debited and he has to make up that time on the rest of the foundation work before he qualifies for the bonus. He &#x201C;gets into debt&#x201D;, to use their own term, in respect of his bonus. The Natives say to him: &#x201C;Why should we work harder; why should we exert ourselves more for the sake of your bonus&#x003F; We do not get it.&#x201D; He on his part tries to egg those Natives on to work harder because his bonus is at stake, his earnings are at stake. The result is that there is friction between the White artisans and the span of Natives under his supervision. I think that is unreasonable and I think the Minister ought to give attention to that. I think it is unfair that a person&#x2019;s bonus should depend on the extent to which people exert themselves, people who themselves do not fall under that bonus system. It is interesting to note that when that same span of Natives do other work, where a building artisan is not in charge but an ordinary foreman, they work on a daily paid basis and not under the bonus system. That is a source, and I think a justified source, of grievance on the part of building workers who have to do the kind of work where they are dependent for their production on the co-operation of Natives and the Natives themselves do not share in the bonus system. I think the Minister must either let the Natives share in the bonus system as well or he must not include that work in <span class="col_2987-2988" refersTo="page_0186"/>the norm which must be complied with in order to qualify for the bonus.</p>

<p>There are other points too which have been raised in this debate that have not been disposed of. One of the matters about which I am sorry we have not had greater clarity is that of railway pensioners. We have made some progress. The Minister said he was having discussions with the Minister of Finance. I got the impression that the Minister meant he was discussing the question of additional allowances to the pensioners with the Minister of Finance. But that was not quite clear, however. It is a sound principle, as far as allowances to statutory pensioners are concerned, to have uniformity in the Railway and other Government Departments. I came to the conclusion that that was what the Minister meant. I take it that that is right. But, Mr. Speaker, that is not enough. The complaint, the justified complaint of the pensioners is not that they want increased allowances which are subject to a means test. They think their basic pension is insufficient. They think it is unfair that where they are healthy and sufficiently keen to augment their income by doing private work, they should be penalized the moment their incomes exceed R150 per month. If you give them an allowance which is subject to a means test that allowance becomes a charity payment which the Railways makes to its pensioners. I do not think it is the duty of the Railways to make charity payments. It is the duty of the Railways to see to it that those people who have given a lifetime of good service to the Railways are properly rewarded in their old age. That is a responsibility which is unrelated to charity. That is why we are unhappy about the long-standing recommendation of the Superannuation Fund, supported by the actuaries as required by the regulations, that those pensioners should be given a 10 per cent increase, a recommendation which the Minister would perhaps have accepted under different circumstances but which he refused to accept at the time. The Minister took it upon himself to refuse that recommendation of the board, supported by the actuaries. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) tries to find an excuse by saying that the responsibility for pensions rests, in the first instance, with the board. During the course of the debate the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) said it was the responsibility not of the Minister but of the Superannuation Fund to make recommendations. Well, they have made the recommendation; it was supported by the actuaries as required by the regulations.</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F; Could the hon. member tell me when that recommendation was made&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>If I remember correctly, two years ago. And the Minister refused it. But the recommendation still stands. The Minister took the responsibility upon himself of refusing it. Our argument is that circumstances have changed. The Railways are enjoying unprecedented prosperity at the moment. But that is not all. There is an inflationary tendency. People are finding it hard to make ends meet. The State and the Government, of which the Minister forms part, must assume some of the responsibility for the fact that an inflationary tendency is creeping over South Africa and that it is permanent. The important point is that the Government can, if it wishes, follow a deflationary policy. Why do they not do so&#x003F; No Government in the world is doing that to-day. Throughout, a slow inflationary tendency is creeping over the world; there is a gradual decline in the value of money. Government pensioners have fixed incomes, incomes which are declining in value year by year for which the Government must as least be partly to blame. There rests a duty on the State to see to it that where that happens to its own pensioners, as a result of its own policy and its own attitude towards the value of money, those people are compensated, permanently compensated, compensation that will be incorporated in their basic pension and that will not be regarded as an allowance subject to a means test. Why should the person who is healthy, strong and willing to make a further contribution to the State in these days of a manpower shortage, be penalized for making a contribution in the shape of the manual work he performs by the sweat of his brow&#x003F; I trust the consultations of the Minister with the Minister of Finance are not only based on the question of how to increase the temporary allowances which can be stopped any moment, but also on what can be done to increase the basic income of the pensioners.</p>

<p>Another question which I think has not been disposed of is the very interesting question raised by the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood). He made out a very well-argued case in connection with the position of the Bantu workers on the South African Railways. The Minister repulsed those representations by saying that no representations had been made to him in that regard,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>What did the Minister say&#x003F; I am sorry if I misunderstood him, but I understood him to say that. The hon. member for Berea specifically raised the question of the Native workers on the Railways. Apparently the Minister did not specifically reply to that. I think the Minister owes the House an answer. It is a very important matter. The question of how we treat these Native workers is one which is becoming of increasing importance to South Africa. Not only in their interests but in the interests of the White man&#x2019;s position in South Africa. Unless we can build up an irrefutable moral case that our treatment of the Natives of South Africa is such that it is beyond any criticism our position in the world will become increasingly difficult. The Minister of Railways can play a very important role in that. The hon. member for Durban <span class="col_2989-2990" refersTo="page_0187"/>(Berea) has rendered a service to South Africa and to White South Africa when he raised that matter. I trust we shall get a clear statement from the Minister. I trust we shall get a clear reply from him on the question raised by the hon. member for Berea.</p>

<p>Nor do we have clarity in regard to the attitude the Railways are going to adopt as to how future transportation work is to be divided between the Railways and private undertakings. The Minister is deliberately vague about that. Two pertinent questions have been put to him to which I hope he will reply. What does it mean when there are rumours throughout the country that the Railways are hardening in their opposition to applications to the road transportation boards for permits to convey certain goods over a distance exceeding 300 miles; permits which were granted in the past in certain circumstances are now more strenuously opposed by the Railways. We are informed that the transportation boards are not giving in to the Railways but the Minister tells us that an increasing share of the increased traffic that will have to be conveyed in South Africa is available to private undertakings. Then we hear reports which are in direct conflict with that. The Minister owes us an explanation. As head of our Railways the Minister must tell us what his attitude is towards the question which is raised time and again that private hauliers ask that the same conditions should be granted to them as those granted to auxiliary hauliers. I do not want to go into that again; I raised it in a previous speech and the Minister did not react.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker we have raised a number of matters during the various stages of this Budget debate to which the Minister has not reacted. I admit that many of them are matters of minor importance, but others are policy matters of fundamental importance such as what planning the Railway Administration is doing in regard to the future of our country in view of changing economic conditions. We have not had an adequate reply to that. I do not wish to repeat all the arguments but I want to say this: Where the Minister has omitted to reply to some questions in detail, some of which I have mentioned, where he has omitted to make broad statements of policy, which we have every right to expect of him, we only want him not to say again that too much time for the Railway Budget is allowed under the new Rules. Had he had enough time, Mr. Speaker, the Minister could have replied to all the questions. The only excuse I can make for him is that his time was perhaps too limited to give the necessary attention to all the points raised. That is why we forgive him provided he does not make that reproach again.</p>

If the hon. member for Yeoville wants to be consistent, according to the statements he has made, then surely he must plead for the acceptance of the majority report of the Van Zyl Commission. [Interjections.] Wait a minute; the hon. member must listen. If the hon. member adopts the attitude that private undertakings are more efficient than public undertakings then he also adopts the attitude, which he did yesterday, that the requirements of the Railways can be manufactured cheaper by private undertakings than by the Railways. If he follows that line further and says he believes that private undertakings should be encouraged, then surely he must, if he wants to be at all consistent, be pleading for Railway requirements to be manufactured by private initiative. [Interjections.] What attitude does the hon. member adopt then&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member holds it against the hon. the Minister and myself for having misunderstood him yesterday. What did the hon. member say yesterday&#x003F; He carried on like a cat on hot bricks in connection with this matter. He says: &#x201C;We are neither happy nor satisfied with the approach the Minister and his Department adopt as to the role the Railways should play as a State organization in respect of the principle of private initiative.&#x201D; What does the hon. member mean by that&#x003F; He is neither happy nor satisfied. Then he says: &#x201C;We of the United Party are bound to the principle of private enterprise.&#x201D; Then he also says he agrees with the Minister to a very great extent &#x2026;</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Yeoville says he agrees with the Minister that capital has been invested in the manufacturing industry of the Railways that cannot be left unproductive. He agrees that proper use should be made of the manpower. Then he says there is a socialistic outlook which worries him. What can the hon. member for Yeoville mean&#x003F; What else can the hon. the Minister deduce from that but that the hon. member is worried about the fact that the Railways want to continue to manufacture departmentally&#x003F; In spite of the clear statement by the hon. the Minister in regard to the attitude of the Railway Administration to this question of manufacturing departmentally the hon. member says they want an assurance that the Railways will not expand their manufacturing section. He concludes by saying that in connection with this matter the Railways should not develop a monopolistic outlook.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is trying to please both sides. The hon. member is soft-soaping industry and at the same time&#x2014;and this is the hon. member&#x2019;s difficulty&#x2014;he is also soft-soaping the artisans of the S.A. Railways. That is the difficulty in which the hon. member finds himself. That is the difficulty in which that party mostly finds itself. They are always sitting between two stools. They always want to soft-soap conflicting interests. I think the hon. member should rather have left this matter alone than to have performed that egg-dance in connection with the Van Zyl Commission&#x2019;s Report.</p>

<p>The hon. member is very concerned about private enterprise. Had the hon. member read the Van Zyl Commission&#x2019;s Report properly he would have realized that he need not be worried about the development of private enterprise in South Africa. Had he read it properly he would have seen the comparison Mr. Bestbier makes in the minority report between the growth of public industries on the one hand and the growth of private industries on the other hand, he would have realized that the gross value of the turnover in respect of private industries had increased from R267,000,000 in 1935-6 to R2,557,000,000 in 1954-5, i.e., by 858 per cent. As against that the growth in the public sector, over the same period was from R28,000,000 to R194,000,000, an increase of 593 per cent. That clearly proves that private industries have expanded at a faster rate than public industries.</p>

<p>I say the trouble with the hon. member for Yeoville unfortunately is that he wants to soft-soap the Railways&#x2019; artisans at the same time as he soft-soaps large industrial interests.</p>

<p>In this particular instance, they do. It was interesting to note that the hon. member for Yeoville was much clearer in the attitude he adopted to-day than he was yesterday after the hon. Minister had read a telegram to him which he had received from the Artisans&#x2019; Staff Association. That made the hon. member think seriously during the intervening night. He then decided: &#x201C;No, come what may, we dare not throw the artisans overboard; I shall have to state this matter more clearly so that we do not find ourselves in an embarrassing position as far as they are concerned.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member said there were certain matters which were not clear to him. What more must the Minister do to satisfy the hon. member as far as pensions are concerned&#x003F; The hon. the Minister assured him that he was particularly well-disposed towards the Railway pensioner. We on this side gave him the same assurance. But, unlike the hon. member for Yeoville, we on this side are not prepared to make a political football of the Railway pensioners. We show our sympathy towards the Railway pensioner&#x2014;as the hon. Minister has proved it over the years&#x2014;without trying to make political capital out of it. What more must the hon. the Minister do in the eyes of the hon. member for Yeoville than he has already done in connection with this matter&#x003F; I wish the hon. member for Yeoville will show me the courtesy of not talking when I am addressing him. I don&#x2019;t do that to him.</p>

<p>What further assurance does the hon. member for Yeoville want from the hon. the Minister&#x003F; The hon. the Minister has assured him of his sympathy. Surely the hon. member for Yeoville knows that the Minister has in the past proved his sympathy for the pensioners in a tangible way. He assured the hon. member that he had certain improvements in mind but that he was still having consultations in that connection. Why is the hon. member for Yeoville always harping on this subject&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, I shall tell you why he does it. He wants to make a political football of the railway pensioner. He wants to go outside this House and tell the pensioners that it was because he had continually pleaded with the Minister that the Minister had eventually agreed to make certain improvements to their pensions. That is the object of the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>The hon. member complained and said the hon. the Minister had not replied to certain points. The hon. member for Yeoville must really not hold this against me. I think the Opposition have raised certain matters about which they were so uninformed that it was not worth while replying to them. If they want to acquaint themselves with what is happening in the Railway Administration everything is at their disposal. They only have to study it. Nor do I think it is necessary for the hon. the Minister to reply to the stupidities of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville that I think there are a few matters in connection with which we too need clarity, such as what the attitude of the Opposition is in connection <span class="col_2993-2994" refersTo="page_0189"/>with certain aspects of Railway policy. As far as the railway funds are concerned do they want the funds to be in a sound financial position&#x003F; Must adequate provision be made in the Renewals Fund for the replacement of certain capital assets&#x003F; Must provision be made in the Betterment Fund for improvements and additions to existing assets&#x003F; Must the Rates Equalization Fund be improved. They must state their attitude in connection with these matters in clear terms. They will place their hands on their hearts and say they are in favour of railway funds being strengthened. But if they say that, they must stop criticizing the Minister and saying that he has taken far too much money out of the pockets of the railway users than he required to run the Railways, as the hon. member for Yeoville said. Then they must stop complaining about the tariff increase which was made in 1962. Let us just see what the position is in connection with the funds since the tariff increase of 1962&#x2014;and I admit also as a result of the increased traffic that was offered because of the increase in the economic development of the country and also as a result of the greater efficiency the Railways have attained. All that has resulted in a surplus of R12,000,000 in 1963 and a surplus of R18,500,000 in 1964 and an estimated surplus of R10,000,000 for 1965, a total of R40,500,000. Let us see what has been done with these surpluses. If the estimated surplus of 1965 is added, or transferred to the Rates Equalization Fund at the end of the financial year, the Rates Equalization Fund will have been strengthened by the three Budgets, since 1963, by nearly R25,000,000. I want to know from the hon. member for Yeoville whether he is against that fund being approximately R50,000,000 strong at the moment&#x003F; No, he is not against it, but he would not reply. If they are against it why did they not tell the previous hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) that he was talking nonsense when he said time and again in this House that the Rates Equalization Fund should be at least R60,000,000 strong&#x003F;</p>

<p>But they object to the tariff increase, they object to the big surpluses the Minister produces, but those surpluses are used to strengthen these essential funds of the Railways. Take the Betterment Fund. As a result of the surpluses it was possible to pour R15,600,000 into the Betterment Fund. Are they against that&#x003F; The hon. member does not want to reply. If they are against it why did they criticize the Minister when he used the Loan Fund to enable the Betterment Fund to cover the costs of improvements and additions to existing assets&#x003F; Did the hon. members agree with the previous hon. member for Wynberg when he said two years ago that the Betterment Fund was insolvent&#x003F; Let the hon. member for Turffontein tell me because he apparently has more courage than the hon. member for Yeoville.

<p>I come to the Renewals Fund. As a result of the surpluses R6,000,000 could be paid into the Renewals Fund. Do the Opposition object to that&#x003F; The hon. member for Orange Grove referred to the Superannuation Fund. A special amount of R3,200,000 has been earmarked to reduce the shortage in the Pension Fund. Do the Opposition object to that&#x003F; No, they do not, because the hon. member for Orange Grove complains about the shortage in the Pension Fund. But the hon. member for Orange Grove has not got the vaguest notion why there is a shortage in the Pension Fund, yet he complains about it. You see, Sir, if we close this financial year with a surplus of R10,000,000 there will have been a total surplus of R40,500,000 over the three financial years and as a result of those surpluses it was possible to contribute R50,000,000 to the Railway funds. I challenge hon. members opposite to get up and to state that they are opposed to the Railway funds being strengthened. If they are against it they must tell us. Then we shall at least know where they stand in connection with this matter and then the country will also know and the railway workers will know where the United Party stand. If they are against those funds being strengthened the country and the railway workers will know that the Opposition do not wish the Railways to be administered on a sound financial basis. If, however, they accept that it is necessary to strengthen the funds, and I maintain that they do accept it &#x2026;</p>

<p>If they accept it, and they will of course get up and say they do, then the hon. member for Yeoville must not accuse the Minister of having placed an unnecessary burden on the shoulders of the railway users by having taken more out of their pockets than was necessary to administer the Railways. The Opposition cannot blow hot and cold at the same time. They cannot object to the surpluses on the one hand and say on the other hand it is essential that the Railway funds be strengthened. We need a good Opposition and for that reason it is essential for the Opposition to have clarity in their own minds on this important matter and not always argue in a roundabout way during a railway debate. They make a farce of the Railway Budget debate, Sir. Yesterday I put certain questions to the courteous and polite hon. member for Yeoville who is always talking to members behind him and as can be expected from a <span class="col_2995-2996" refersTo="page_0190"/>courteous and polite gentleman he assured me he would reply to me. He had the opportunity to-day of replying but he did not do so. I asked him certain questions in connection with the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude in respect of private road transportation undertakings and their competition with the Railways.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows I put certain questions to him and that he did not reply to them. That is another matter in regard to which the Opposition have failed to tell the country and the Minister precisely what their attitude is. We can continue in this way but I want to accuse the Opposition to-day that they are making a farce of the Railway Budget debate in this House because they are not clear in their own minds as to what their own Railway policy is. There is no such thing. The hon. member for Turffontein may laugh but it is a very embarrassing little laugh. He knows they have no policy in connection with the most important Railway matters. The catastrophe has now befallen them that South Africa is so fortunate as to have the services of an outstanding and efficient Minister of Railways. They may perhaps still have succeeded in hiding the fact that they have no policy had we had a poor Minister on this side but we have an outstanding Minister. I want to tell you to-day, Sir, that there are many countries in the world who envy South Africa, countries which are faced with great financial problems and with tremendous financial shortages as far as their railways are concerned, countries which are envious of us because we have a Minister of Railways who, in the times in which we are living, is administering the Railways so well and so efficiently.</p>

<p>If one single factor has become clear in the course of these debates, it is that it is clear that as far as the Government benches are concerned, they must look for a new chairman of their transport group. That fact is clear and it has been revealed again in the speech of the hon. member that we have just had to listen to, a member who professes to be chairman of the Railway group of the party opposite, chairman of the Select Committee on Railways. What was the speech we had to listen to&#x003F; On the motion to go into Committee of Supply he made a speech which was a form of recitation from the General-Manager&#x2019;s Report; on the second reading of this Bill he makes a speech dealing with points which were never even raised in the course of this debate, because he was caught on the wrong leg in the motion to go into Committee of Supply. Let me take one or two facts. He asks: What is the Opposition&#x2019;s policy in regard to the established Railway funds&#x003F; He poses the question: Do we want to see those funds in a healthy position&#x003F; In the same breath, a couple of paragraphs later in his speech, he says that the former member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) wanted to see the Rates Equalization Fund brought up to a figure as high as R60,000,000. What is the hon. member arguing about&#x003F; Does the hon. member not know what has happened during these debates for the past few years&#x003F; He should know that one of the legs of the amendments moved by the Opposition in former years dealt with the strengthening of the funds. But who raised the Rates Equalization Fund three or four years ago when it was bankrupt&#x003F; Who brought the Betterment Fund to the low level that it had never reached before&#x003F; The present Minister with his policy. The hon. member forgets that and presents an atmosphere of political purity here in respect of Railway matters.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, the hon. member comes along and attempts to raise political issues in the course of these discussions. He was bitterly disappointed that the question of the Van Zyl Commission was not raised by this side of the House and not touched on by his Minister in his Budget Speech. Obviously it was not mentioned by the Minister in his Budget Speech as a political trap, because he had to get the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) to raise the issue, thinking of one thing only, the votes of the 14,000 artisans employed in the Railway Workshops. But the hon. member was bitterly disappointed that there was no statement from this side of the House that we accept the majority report.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville put the question to me and I then responded.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Why was an important matter such as the Van Zyl Commission Report not dealt with by the Minister in the course of his speech&#x003F; The hon. member should have told us why it was never raised by the hon. Minister. It is a very important matter and industry wanted to know what was the Minister&#x2019;s policy in regard to the findings of the Van Zyl Commission, the majority report and the minority report. If there was a responsible approach to the matter and not a political approach, one would have expected the Minister to deal with the matter in his Budget Speech, after which an objective debate could have followed on the issues at stake. It was only after we put these things to the Minister that he then got up and gave his reasons for rejecting the majority report. Now the hon. gentleman comes along and attempts again to make political capital out of it and to gain the sympathy of the artisans by creating the impression that this side of the House wants the artisans to be put out of their job in the Railway Workshops by revolving his argument around, a statement made by my hon. colleague that he cannot accept that private initiative is less efficient than a state undertaking. That is a sound approach, and <span class="col_2997-2998" refersTo="page_0191"/>the Minister accepts it, because if the hon. the Minister did not accept the principle, he would say: I am not going to let private initiative manufacture my railway coaches, I am not going to let private initiative manufacture my electric locomotives because I can do it more efficiently in my own workshops and I can do it cheaper. But will the Minister say that&#x003F; Of course he does not say that, because he recognizes that private initiative can play a very important part in these matters as far as the Railway Workshops are concerned. That is the issue, but the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) attempts to make a bit of political capital out of an issue after he was bitterly disappointed that he could not do so in the second-reading debate.</p>

<p>But now let us come to the question of the railway pensioners. We have had nothing constructive, or a word of sympathy from the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) about the railway pensioners. The only consolation that the Railway pensioners got out of this debate is the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) saying that they have got the sympathy of the Minister. They had the sympathy of the Minister three years ago. Since he has been Minister of Railways, he has always claimed that he is looking after the interests of the staff and that he is sympathetically inclined towards the pensioners. But the blunt fact of the matter is that that sympathy never is displayed in a practical fashion until the Opposition presses and forces him to do something about it. I remember last year&#x2019;s second-reading debate when the Minister denied that he could give the railwaymen an increase and he said that it was against the interests of the country, and only after the debates and the motions moved by this side of the House, four months later he did give them an increase because he had no other alternative. I want to remind the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) of what the Minister said in this House about the interests of Railway pensioners, because I think the Minister still owes an answer to the railway pensioners and to the House in regard to a statement that he made here on 20 March 1962. Perhaps the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) has forgotten this. Let us read what the Minister said two years ago when replying to the debate on 20 March 1962. I am going to read it in full because I do not want the Minister to say that I am quoting out of context. He said this&#x2014;(Col. 2920).</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted some explanation as to why I had refused to accept the majority recommendation of the Superannuation Fund Committee. I can only say that there was very strong opposition from certain staff organizations when those recommendations were made. Instead of causing general dissatisfaction&#x2014;there would have been considerable dissatisfaction had those recommendations been adopted. I decided not to adopt them. Those recommendations were in regard to the 10 per cent increase in pensions and also in connection with the question as to whether servants should be allowed to pay enhanced contributions to make up for the seven years of their retirement. But there was no unanimity. There was considerable opposition from certain staff organizations &#x2026;</p>

<p>In spite of the majority report, so the opposition was based on a minority opinion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I refused to accept the recommendations.</block>

<p>And then the Minister made this important statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the matter is being referred back to the Superannuation Fund Committee and they will probably deal with the whole matter again <i>de novo.</i></block>

<p>The point is that they dealt with it, and having dealt with it, have they made any recommendations, and having made a further recommendation, has the Minister been prepared to accept it&#x003F; Because whether or not the pensioner gets his relief does not rest on the sympathy of the hon. Minister. They do not want sympathy, they want practical help in order that they can maintain a decent standard of living. That is what they are looking for. I am surprised that the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) has not the courage in the House even advocating that relief should be given to the Railway pensioners. All he can say is that the Minister has got sympathy.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to one or two other matters of practical interest in respect of the commercial services of the Railway Administration. The first question I want to refer to is the question of the advertising services conducted by the Railways. There was a statement in the General Manager&#x2019;s Report that a new policy is now being followed and where it comes to advertisers making application to the Administration for advertising space on hoardings, there is a change in the policy. It is well known that most of the hoardings of the railway administration are in a very dilapidated condition, but the principle is now being followed that where advertisers are prepared to replace those hoardings at their own expense, not at Railway expense, the administration will permit them to do so. What disturbs me is the extension of this policy as opposed to the principles of the Ribbon Development Act. We now find along all these express ways, all the railway property, the erection of vast hoarding signs which are in fact defeating the very object of the Roads and Ribbon Development Act. and it looks like a form of tickey-grabbing for revenue purposes by the Railway Administration. I would like to ask the hon. Minister whether he can give a clear indication in this debate to-day as to what is his attitude and what is the policy being followed of granting, apparently with no limitation whatsoever, a wide licence for the erection of these hoardings provided that the advertisers themselves are prepared to pay for the hoardings.</p>

<p><span class="col_2999-3000" refersTo="page_0192"/>There is another important matter which also falls under the question of commercial development, and I refer to the promotion work that is being done by the Railway Administration&#x2019;s Department of Tourism. Very important aspects arise now since the appointment of a special Ministry of Tourism. I find, e.g., that there is a clash of information between the information given by the General Manager&#x2019;s Report in respect of the number of tourists coming to South Africa for holiday purposes as opposed to the figures for example supplied by the Department of Tourism, the Tourist Corporation. There is no relation at all, and they give two independent figures, because the General Manager&#x2019;s Report quotes a figure of 158,000 tourists and 183,000 visitors to the Republic, not handled entirely by the Administration (I understand it is a globular figure) whereas in the Tourist Corporation&#x2019;s Report the figure is given at 210,000 approximately. There is a very large difference between the figures quoted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the Minister can clarify the issue. My point is that it is known that in the past the tourist services of the Railway Administration worked very closely with the Tourist Corporation, and the Minister knows that in a Bill now before the House large numbers of functions of the Tourist Corporation are taken over by the Department of Tourism, particularly as far as the overseas offices of the Tourist Department are concerned. What is going to be the relationship now and how is it going to operate&#x003F; It is clear that the tourist services conducted by the Administration itself form a large percentage of the tourist attractions offered to any potential visitor from overseas who wishes to come to the Republic for holiday purposes. We have also the aspect of the inquiry into the hotel industry. I want to ask the hon. Minister now whether the time has not arrived where good United Party policy should again be applied, and that is the development of terminal hotels by the Railway Administration itself. The Minister will remember that that was thrown overboard. That was the great vision of a former United Party Minister of Railways who foresaw the possibilities of tourism in the postwar period, and plans were made in that respect. Now with all the surpluses we have and all the capital development, this matter should receive serious consideration. The General Manager himself stresses the potential business of tourism as far as railway finances are concerned, and I want to put it specifically to the Minister: Has the time not arrived when consideration should be given to the construction of first-class tourist terminal hotels by the Railway Administration, to be conducted and managed by them&#x003F; I put that thought to the Minister because I do believe that it is an interesting one.</p>

<p>There is another matter. During the course of the debate it has already been referred to by the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan), but year after year we in the Select Committee are faced with the issue of the losses shown by Railway book-stalls. There has been a shift of management of these bookstalls from time to time; different systems have been applied. But I want to ask the hon. Minister if this is not a case where the whole question of facilities to the public, offered at stations in the way of book-stalls, should be handed entirely to private enterprise. There are companies which would be prepared to do it, and instead of having the dirty little barbwire windows that one looks at at the Railway stations with a few James Bond soft-backs and a couple of other things, so that one has to struggle to find any decent reading matter (which is virtually unobtainable at the Railway stations) as opposed to the tendency one sees in the book trade in private initiative to-day where there are beautiful displays made of books with easy accessibility so that one can exercise one&#x2019;s judgment and purchase a book. Because the potential must be quite considerable if properly exploited, I would like to ask the hon. Minister as a matter of policy: Has the time not arrived when the whole question of the management of the book-stalls should be given over to private contract and be placed in the hands of private enterprise and then exploited to the fullest benefit on a licence basis in a similar way as is being done now in respect of certain catering establishments&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is yet another matter I want to put to the hon. Minister. It has been brought to his notice on former occasions by this side of the House, and that is the question of air freight as far as the internal services are concerned. Mr. Speaker, when one looks at the figures and the expansion of the volume of traffic and the manner in which it could be exploited, one feels that this also should receive attention. The parcel services as far as the Railways are concerned, are now becoming profitable, highly profitable. Has the time not arrived that we should have in a sense an around-the-Republic air-freight service for quick delivery of articles, not only in the way of light stuff but also heavy stuff. The ton-miles now shown and the increases which on the last book year are over 50 per cent as far as the internal services are concerned, the freight-ton-mileage, seem to indicate that by the exploitation and the opening up of such a service, even a greater volume of traffic would be offered. I would like to ask the hon. Minister if he could give some consideration to this matter, because I believe that such a proposition is well supported by industry and commerce.</p>

<p>Whilst discussing airways, there is the other important matter and that is the over-border services and travel along the West Coast route. The Minister will recall that earlier in the Session, I put a question on the Order Paper in regard to the pooling arrangements, and he <span class="col_3001-3002" refersTo="page_0193"/>stated in reply to me where I asked him whether he was making any new pool arrangements with any other airlines, that that was under consideration but that no agreement had been arrived at. I want to direct the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a report which appeared in <i>The Star</i> in November of last year, a report to the effect that a pool arrangement had in fact been arrived at with the Portuguese Airlines and that under that arrangement the Portuguese Airlines would be entitled to uplift traffic and put down traffic and so will the South African Airways at Lisbon. It is an important issue in the light of developments in Africa and the threat now to stop foreign airlines en route to South Africa from using the intermediate traffic that is offered. I think the question is such a broad one, with such important ramifications to the future of our overseas traffic as far as the South African Airways are concerned, that I hope that the hon. Minister will be in a position to make some statement in that regard.</p>

<p>There is one other matter to which I want to refer. I listened attentively to the Minister&#x2019;s reply on the question of dieselization yesterday, and as I understand it he said that the introduction of dieselization to East London and the proposed purchase of a further R30,000,000 of diesel traction, and it is not likely to stop at that; we know these figures are only estimates and inevitably an additional amount is added&#x2014;is of a temporary nature.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Minister said that it was envisaged that in future the line would be electrified. I would like clarity about it.</p>

<p>I want to quote to the Minister the statements made by the General Manager in regard to dieselization which was investigated by a committee appointed in 1954, because I think what he said here is most important in the light of what we are asked to approve here in regard to this extension of dieselization. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the favourable position that parts of South Africa enjoy as the result of large coal deposits which can be mined at relatively low cost, and the scope thus afforded for the generation of electric current at reasonable rates, it has hitherto not been possible to find economic justification for substituting diesel traction for steam or electric haulage, particularly in view of the relatively high initial cost of the diesel locomotive and the fact that imported fuel would have to be used.</block>

<p>The Minister has asked for approval in this Budget for the amount of R30,000,000 to purchase diesel locomotives, and for R840,000 for the establishment of maintenance workshops in East London, but where is it going to end&#x003F; I understood the Minister to say yesterday that this was of a temporary nature.

<p>We know it has not been the general policy to use diesels for train haulage on all systems in the Republic. This is now called an interim step. The Minister should have said yesterday that it is now his policy to introduce diesel traction over and above steam traction, but that is not what he said yesterday. The impression he created was that this was merely a transitional measure, until the Railways were fully electrified. That brings me back to my point. The Minister agreed with me. He said it made our transport system more vulnerable. What I am trying to get from him is what in fact is his policy in this regard&#x003F; Is this merely a temporary measure&#x003F; Can the Minister clarify it for us so that we know what the position will be in future, because certainly there is no clear statement of policy in this regard.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that my impression of these debates is that it has revealed a complete lack of vision. We have attempted in the <span class="col_3003-3004" refersTo="page_0194"/>course of these discussions to come with an objective approach. I know that the Minister is a bit of a romanticist. He would not be Minister of Railways if he were not. I know that the Minister gets a thrill when he sees railway lines streaking into the distance, but he must also think of the human material and the results on future generations in South Africa. He must think of these things as well and they cannot be thought of unless there is proper and adequate planning in the Railways. We try to make substantive and objective suggestions, and it is a matter for regret that hon. members opposite prefer to play politics rather than to take an objective approach to the transport problems of the country.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) took 15 minutes to tell the House that he was in complete agreement with me regarding the report of the Van Zyl Committee. I do not know why it was necessary for him to deal with this matter at such length. Apparently he was rather afraid he had created the impression yesterday that his party was in sympathy with the majority report, but if he agreed with me then it was only necessary for him to say one or two words in this regard, and not to discuss the matter for 15 minutes. He said that the commission had made certain general statements and that the United Party could not accept the general statement that private entrepreneurs might be less efficient than a State undertaking. But that was never the point at issue. Nobody ever mentioned the efficiency of private enterprise in comparison with that of the railway workshops. The entire investigation dealt with the question of costs and whether it would be more advantageous to the Railways to buy these articles from private industries or to manufacture those articles themselves. That was the point at issue. The finding of the committee was actually that the Railways could manufacture goods more cheaply than the private industrialist could deliver&#x2014;not manufacture&#x2014;those goods to the Railways, because the private industrialist has to make provision for his profit. The inquiry dealt with the cost of the article and not with efficiency. I have never contended, and neither has my Department contended, that a State undertaking is far more efficient than private industry. That has nothing to do with the matter at all. The hon. member said that it was healthier for a State like South Africa to encourage private enterprise. We agree. We have never differed in that regard. I tried to show yesterday how the Railways are encouraging private enterprise and that the result of this encouragement has been the number of industries that have come into being. I said that the Railways were responsible for the fact that we to-day have industries in South Africa manufacturing 90 per cent of our Railway requirements, whereas under the Government of hon. members opposite 90 per cent of these requirements had to be imported. But that encouragement has taken place under this Government.</p>

<p>We have given even more preference than that laid down by the Government. Hon. members know that it is laid down that a 10 per cent preference must be given in respect of articles manufactured in South Africa. I went out of my way in some cases to give local industries 20 per cent preference in order to encourage them and so that South Africa could supply her own requirements. So we do not differ in this regard. The hon. member should actually be very grateful that the Minister and the Administration have given so much encouragement to private enterprise. He said that my conclusion was based on sound United Party policy, but their policy was to import and not manufacture in South Africa. They gave very little encouragement to the establishment of private industries for the manufacture of Railway requirements. My conclusion, therefore, was not based on their policy but on sound National Party policy. They do not agree that in principle, preference should be given to State undertakings. I do not know what they mean by that and I do not know what sort of preference this is. I say that certain preferences must be given to State undertakings, for example in connection with Road Transport, to protect State undertakings. But besides this the hon. member must remember that the Railways have invested more than R24,000,000 in capital in their workshops. As I have already said, thousands of workers are dependent upon the Railways for their daily bread. I said that we would not expand our manufacturing activities unnecessarily. On the contrary, we are trying to encourage private industry to manufacture these requirements, but then it must be done economically and private industry must not exploit us, something which unfortunately has happened in the past. Where a certain industry has had a monopoly, it has already tried to exploit the Railways, and that will not be tolerated. That is the general policy with which apparently the hon. member agrees.</p>

<p>As far as the artisan in the building industry who has a complaint in connection with the system of bonus payments is concerned, I just want to say that the bonus schemes are always drawn up in consultation with and with the approval of the trade unions. If the artisans want any change to be brought about, they must contact their trade unions. This is never done onesidedly but in co-operation and after consultation with the trade union concerned.</p>

<p>As far as pensioners are concerned, the hon. member has said that basic pensions are inadequate and he wants them to be increased. I have stated repeatedly over the years that the Superannuation Fund is a contributory fund and must be actuarially sound. This fund is controlled by the staff themselves. They have an equal number of representatives on the Superannuation Fund Board as the Administration has. This fund is controlled by the staff themselves; it is their fund. One cannot impose burdens on a fund which that fund cannot bear. It would be improper of the Minister to instruct the body controlling that fund to increase pensions by 10 or 20 per cent.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>No, they do not want to do so. The hon. member should have listened to my reply. I have said that he has not studied his subject. Three years ago I gave my reply in connection with the recommendation in regard to the 10 per cent. The recommendation was made in 1961 and I gave my decision in 1962. Good reasons existed for my not accepting it. Firstly, there were different suggestions. Two of the trade unions objected to these recommendations which did not deal only with a 10 per cent increase. There was the question of conflicting interests. Besides this it would have meant the fund being considerably weakened. This took place just before the consolidation of the cost of living allowances in basic salaries and would have imposed an additional burden on the fund. I took the right decision at that time in not accepting that recommendation. But since that time great changes have taken place. Consolidation and rationalization have been introduced. This has placed additional burdens on the fund because pensions have been increased. Why must the hon. member go back to 1961&#x003F; That I cannot understand.</p>

<p>I have the right to decide, but it is the workers&#x2019; fund. It is their contributory fund and they control it. but I take the responsibility for any decision that is arrived at, and that is also the way it should be. I want to prove that the hon. member has not studied his subject. He said that the compensation, in other words these allowances, should be incorporated in basic pensions. If he had given a little attention to this matter he would have realized that this is quite impracticable. This allowance is paid out of revenue; the pension is paid out of the Superannuation Fund which is a contributory fund. How can one consolidate the two&#x003F; Who will then be responsible&#x003F;</p>

<p>The means test is applied to people earning more than R1,800 a year. The idea of the allowance was chiefly to assist people receiving small pensions. If the means test is abolished it will mean that even an official receiving a pension of R3,000 a year should also receive that allowance. Then the hon. member must also argue that the means test should be abolished in regard to old age pensions because the principle in that regard is the same. [Interjection.] The means test is applied according to a person&#x2019;s income, so the hon. member must then use the same argument in connection with old age pensions. The hon. member has already said that the means test must be abolished.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>No, because after this the cost of living allowance was consolidated and this changed the picture completely. The Board itself decided not to reconsider the matter because the position changed completely on consolidation. The Board was at liberty to reconsider the whole matter. It was not necessary to give them terms of reference of this nature, but as a result of consolidation and other circumstances they decided not to reconsider the matter.</p>

<p>Bantu wages were improved on rationalization. It is not my intention generally to increase wages at this stage, whether they be wages for Bantu or for Whites. I cannot increase wages every year. A certain period of time first has to elapse.</p>

<p>I have dealt with the points raised by the hon. member for Turffontein, in reply to the hon. member for Yeoville. In regard to the advertising hoardings which the Railways display on the national roads, the Railways are also subject to the provisions of the Ribbon Development Act and where they contravene the provisions of that Act they will have to remove the hoardings. Those instructions have been given.</p>

<p>There is no overlapping between the Railways Tourist Department and the Tourist Corporation. The Railways Tourist Department is merely concerned with advertising the services <span class="col_3007-3008" refersTo="page_0196"/>that the Railways can render to the public; they do not advertise S.A.&#x2019;s attractions. An inquiry was made a few years ago. A Committee was appointed to see whether there was any overlapping, and they found that there was none. There is a clear demarcation between the activities of the two bodies. I will certainly not embark on a scheme to build tourist hotels. That matter was thoroughly thrashed out when my colleague was Minister of Railways. The Railways are not hotelkeepers. To run hotels at a loss would certainly not be in accordance with business principles.</p>

<p>Because there are very few luxury hotels to-day that are not run at a loss.</p>

<p>It is the policy that bookstalls should be handed over to private enterprise, but we have to look after the staff working in those bookstalls, and consequently it is a gradual process. In regard to the air freight services, I can give the hon. member the assurance that where freight is offered we will extend the service.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about the pool arrangement. There is a difference between a pool arrangement and an air agreement. There is no pool arrangement with the Portuguese. Pools are arranged on an operational basis between the operators. That is in regard to the pooling of revenue and expenditure, but it is quite a different thing from an air agreement, which provides for traffic rights. There is an air agreement with Portugal whereby they give S.A. Airways certain traffic rights and we give the Portuguese Airways certain traffic rights, but there is no pool arrangement.</p>

<p>In regard to diesels, I have stated my policy clearly in the past. The hon. member should listen when I talk, or try to understand what I say. I try to speak as clearly as I can. I have told him repeatedly that the policy is that diesels would be used in the transitional period from steam to electricity. I said that fully in my reply yesterday. I do not know what more he wants to know. In the transitional period we will use diesels, and we might even use more diesels in future, on any system and on any line. It is the general policy of the Railways. Where steam locomotives cannot cope with the traffic any more and where electrification is not justified, diesels will be used during the transitional period until such time as electrification is justified. Now is that quite clear&#x003F; Diesel traction has been in operation in the Republic since 1957. In 1957 57 diesels were purchased. They have been running on the Witbank line, and for several years on the Volksrus-Union section, and they are running from Noupoort to De Aar. Did the hon. member not even know that&#x003F; He said this is the first time diesels will be used in the Republic. Why does he make such foolish statements&#x003F; The hon. member talks and talks, and half the time he does not know himself what he is talking about.</p>

<p>Steam locomotives are not being built any more. Did not the hon. member listen when I told him that yesterday&#x003F; Only diesels and electric units are being built to-day. The North British Locomotive Company has gone into liquidation, and the other locomotive manufacturing companies have switched over to diesels and electric units. So consequently we are compelled to buy either diesel or electric units, and where it is absolutely essential for diesels to be purchased during the transitional period we will have to do so. Is that quite clear to the hon. member now&#x003F; I hope he will not make the same speech again next year. If he does I will just refer him to Hansard. Sir, I may say that there is one thing which always amuses me and that is that the hon. member on behalf of his party always takes the credit for the good things done by this Government. He says that as a result of their pressure on the Government wages have been increased and concessions have been made to pensioners. If they can evolve such wonderful schemes, how is it that they are steadily becoming weaker in South Africa&#x003F; Why is it that the U.P. becomes steadily weaker, and that they even have less hope of coming into power now than they had 15 years ago&#x003F; I can only say that when an Opposition claims the credit for the good things done by a Government, it merely indicates how bankrupt they are.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that the Government should be less wasteful with the money of the country and should utilize the riches of South Africa for an imaginative plan of national reconstruction which will, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) immediately bring free and adequate education within the reach of, and make it compulsory for, all the children of South Africa;</li>

<li>(2) afford all children having special ability and merit and whose parents cannot afford to send them to higher institutions, an opportunity of receiving, by means of Government aid, suitable higher education or training; and</li>

<li>(c) creating a positive spirit of friendship and co-operation amongst the various races and population groups in the country.</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to read out the motion. All I want to do at this stage is to draw attention to the fact that this is not a motion which is confined to education only, but that I am asking for a comprehensive plan of national reconstruction which will cover the entire field of our human problems in South Africa.</p>

<p>We Whites in South Africa find ourselves in a position to-day where we are seeking a solution for our difficulties with a greater sense of urgency than we have ever done before. In this process a large variety of plans has been put forward in recent years, plans which are offered to the public as &#x201C;solutions&#x201D;. In moving this motion it is not my intention to examine and to judge the merits of any of these plans. After examining all the various directions and the various plans offered as solutions, one is still faced with one unalterable fact, and that is that whatever policy we follow and whatever constitutional adjustments we make, in whichever areas Whites live in South Africa, there will at least be as many non-Whites living in the same areas for all time to come. And if, as a result of some partitioning plan or other, the non-Whites living in those areas are not Blacks, they will be Brown people or people of Indian origin. However small or however big we may make South Africa, we can never get away from the fundamental fact that wherever the White man lives, other races will also continue to live there. In other words, however much the numerical ratio may change of be changed, Whites and non-Whites are destined to remain interwoven here in a relationship of permanent interdependence. If therefore there are such things as logic and common sense in politics at all, then logic and common sense demand that none of these interdependent groups should labour under the delusion that it will be able to maintain itself as the only privileged aristocracy, dispensing favours to itself which it withholds from others by legislation or other means. If it should try to do so, there can be no doubt at all as to what the outcome of any such attempt would be. There is nobody who is more outspoken on this matter than the well-known historian, Dr. G. D. Scholtz, who is also the editor-in-chief of the <i>Transvaler.</i> In his book, &#x201C;Het die Afrikaanse Volk &#x2019;n Toekoms&#x201D; (Has the Afrikaans Nation a Future), he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">History teaches us a very clear lesson in connection with the aim of a minority group to maintain for itself a privileged position as against a majority group by means of legislation.</block>

<p>He then refers to a series of examples from history, and, <i>inter alia,</i> he says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In France a revolution by the unprivileged classes simply wiped away, in a bloody fashion, all legal enactments behind which the privileged nobility had sought to entrench their position.</block>

<p>The same thing happened in Russia. &#x201C;In 1830 and in 1848,&#x201D; Dr. Scholtz says, &#x201C;there were revolutions in most Western European countries, the object of which was to wipe out the differences between the privileged and the unprivileged groups &#x2026;&#x201D; In order to avoid a conflagration in this country sooner or later, all Whites in the Republic must learn the lesson which past history teaches us! At any rate there is this ray of light in history: &#x201C;It was only the great political reformation of 1832 which probably saved Britain from a revolution.&#x201D; The aristocracy in Britain made the necessary adjustments timeously. That is why the British Royal House stands out to-day above all others in the word; that is why the British aristocracy finds itself in the unique position of occupying a position of accepted leadership in Britain and of being the pivot on which British political stability rests.</p>

<p>As we know, it is largely due to history that the Whites of South Africa find themselves in the position of an aristocracy as against the non-White population groups. Up to World War II this position was accepted more or less naturally. The Western European White dominated the whole of the Coloured world. In the last two decades, as Dr. Scholtz says, the position has changed radically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A revolution&#x2014;the biggest and most far-reaching of all&#x2014;is sweeping over mankind at the present time.</block>

<p>This affects the destinies of the whole of mankind and that it will sweep over every part of the earth, including South Africa. In the light of this I believe that the whole future of our own nation is going to depend on the way in which we cope with these new circumstances. This is the time when we, as a White aristocracy in South Africa, should make adjustments on our own interests. The longer we wait the more likelihood there is of a changed set-up in which we will no longer retain a leading role. I honestly believe that out of fear we refuse to face the political implications of the adjustments that we will <span class="col_3011-3012" refersTo="page_0198"/>have to make, to such an extent that we entirely overlook the crux of this problem. It has been proved over and over again that the demand for political rights only becomes the dominant demand when justifiable demands for economic and social improvements are not met. Because the only means whereby social and economic advancement can then be obtained is by trying to obtain political supremacy. In 1961 Dr. J. C. de Ridder published a study entitled, &#x201C;The Personality of the Urban African in South Africa&#x201D;, in which he made an analysis of what he called &#x201C;The frequency of demands submitted to the National Action Council&#x201D; of the Congress of the People, which was held in June 1955, under the leadership of the A.N.C. at Kliptown. According to his analysis &#x201C;the frequency of demands&#x201D; was as follows: Demands in connection with the pass laws, 79; demands in connection with wages, 79; demands with regard to education, 25; demands with regard to employment, 14; in connection with land ownership, 12; in connection with beer-brewing 10; and demands in connection with the franchise, 9. Nine demands with regard to the franchise as against 79 in connection with wages! Studies of the same subject made by other people have similarly proved that there are fewer political demands than demands in connection with wages and economic improvements and improvements in the educational sphere. A very interesting fact is that the most successful mass movement amongst non-Whites that there has ever been in South Africa was not a political movement but the I.C.U. (Industrial and Commercial Union), which strove to bring about higher wages and better economic opportunities for its people. As against that a political movement like the A.N.C. had a following which has been given by various people as ranging between 28,000 and 100,000, at its best! Dr. de Ridder finds that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The quest for more money has become almost an obsession with urban Africans; increased financial status is their primary ambition in life.</block>

<p>Other students, like Dr. de Ridder, have also found that the main concern of the Native is his economic position; he is concerned mainly about things such as wages and the pass laws, which are interrelated. The next demand, in order of importance, concerns education, while political and social demands in fact figure amongst the lowest on the list. It was only when their economic demands were not met that the non-Whites pushed aside the more moderate leaders and began to place greater emphasis on the demand for political supremacy as a means of achieving their other aims. That is why I have come here to-day to ask for things which I believe to be much more urgent and, at this stage, more important than any political programme. I believe that we ought to take steps, as the motion puts it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To afford all the peoples of our country a share in the highest possible Western and modern standards of living and comfort as soon as possible,</block>

<p>and</p>

<block name="quote">To eliminate as soon and as far as possible the wide and dangerous gap existing in the country between the rich and the poor and between the privileged and the unprivileged.</block>

<p>Sir, the extension of economic opportunities and the improvement of wages are matters which we have dealt with in this House over and over again and which have already been brought to the notice of the Government. I do not want to cover the same field again. Broadly I can say that we agree with Dr. Anton Rupert who said this in London&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we do not take the Black African by the hand and raise him up, he can and will pull us down with him.</block>

<p>It is in the sphere of education that I believe we must have a new dispensation in South Africa, and that is why we ask in this motion, firstly, for a plan of national reconstruction which will&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Immediately bring free and adequate education within the reach of, and make it compulsory for, all the children of South Africa.</block>

<p>I deliberately framed this request in immediate terms, not because I do not know that there are certain practical difficulties which will have to be overcome; not because I do not know that there are certain things which cannot be done overnight, but because I believe that there is an important principle involved here which is of such a nature that it ought to be accepted immediately so that a start can be made in this direction. I trust therefore that the Government side will not come here today with the old story, the story that we often hear, about lack of teachers, lack of buildings and lack of money when in actual fact what is lacking is the will on the part of the Government to tackle this matter. The simple fact is that there is nothing to-day which ought to receive higher priority in our country than adequate education for everybody in South Africa. I cannot think of one single difficulty which cannot be overcome through courage. In New Zealand, for example, children who live in isolated places are taught through the medium of television and lessons over the radio, and where they have to contend with the problem of a shortage of teachers they solve it by the simple expedient of placing the children of all classes in the school under the care of one teacher and by teaching them with the aid of television. Moreover, in a country which is as rich as ours there is no excuse for any struggle. We constantly talk about &#x201C;White civilization&#x201D; and we express our concern about the future and the survival of our &#x201C;civilization&#x201D;. Civilization is by no means something which is limited to the White man; what we mean, of course, is that we in South Africa are anxious to retain the standards of living and the standards of behaviour to which <span class="col_3013-3014" refersTo="page_0199"/>we as Westerners have become accustomed. On that point we are all agreed, and the aim to seek to retain one&#x2019;s Western values is quite permissible. But where can we find a better way, a surer way, of retaining and safeguarding our Western values and standards than by ensuring that all persons in South Africa will share it as soon as possible and help us to defend it&#x003F; Any Government therefore which refuses to do everything in its power to get our Western values generally accepted in South Africa has no right to complain that &#x201C;our civilization is in danger&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, this motion goes further than the question of education. In paragraph (2) we ask that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All children having special ability and merit and whose parents cannot afford to send them to higher institutions should be afforded an opportunity of receiving, by means of Government aid, suitable higher education or training.</block>

<p>State aid may assume various forms, but I think the least the State can do at once is to make loans available to deserving children. Here I am thinking particularly of the White child, because even in the case of the White child there is a tremendous leeway to be made up as far as higher training is concerned. I had a conversation a few years ago with a woman ambassador of Costa Rica at the Organization of American States in Washington, and I was astonished to learn from her that Costa Rica had entirely abolished her army and had instituted free university training for all children who attain a certain standard, irrespective of whether they are rich or poor. Sir, we are in the habit of looking down upon certain South American states, but here we are, one of the richest countries in the world, and our whole system of higher education in South Africa is still based on the apochryphal idea that if your father is rich then all the doors are wide open to you, however untalented you may be, but if your father is poor there is nothing but a struggle ahead of you, however talented you are and however much your talents may be needed for the progress of the country. I say that in South Africa that is an unforgivable position, and as long as it is your father&#x2019;s money that counts and not your ability and merits when it comes to selection for higher training, we shall not be able to call this State of ours a modern and enlightened State. One really becomes despondent when one sees how the sons of poor parents have to run around looking for two sureties to obtain a loan and then frequently give up in despair and resign themselves to their lot. We shall have to be wide awake and take notice of what is happening behind the Iron Curtain. Statistics that I have seen indicate that a country like Russia, comparatively speaking, spends considerably more on higher training for its people than the leading countries of the West and almost three times as much as we spend here in prosperous South Africa. [Interjections.!</p>

<p>I mean on the basis of our population ratio. It is no wonder that in the scientific sphere the Russians are ahead of us in so many fields. I believe that we will have to put an end to the position in South Africa where the rich child and the poor child are not given an equal opportunity when it comes to the question of higher training. I hope that hon. members on the other side will not come along with the hackneyed story that we do not have enough money for all these improvements. My motion opens with the request that the Government should be less extravagant than it is; that it should stop spending huge amounts on measures and undertakings which have no future. One could make a whole speech on this subject alone&#x2014;time does not permit me to do so&#x2014;but I am thinking particularly of the unnecessary legislation which we put through in this House and which gives rise to the building up of a bureaucracy which must be one of the biggest to be found anywhere in the world to-day. We are being over-governed! If my figures are correct then one-quarter of the working people in South Africa are connected in some way or other with one of our public services. I think of all the commissions which produce Blue Books which have scarcely been laid on the Table of this House before they become museum pieces. I think of all the jobs for pals. So many commissionerships and high posts have been created in recent years that every second member sitting on the other side can look forward to promotion sooner or later if he does not blot his copybook. I think of all the apartheid notices, all the partitions, all the double entrances and all the bridges which come into being under the policy of apartheid and which have no earthly future. One need only go down to the centre of the city to see how many thousands of Rand are being spent on the building of crossovers at the station so that Whites on their way to the train will not come into contact with Coloureds. Within a decade we are going to have in this country the biggest collection of structural white elephants that the world has ever seen. I could go on giving numerous examples. Sir, in these circumstances nobody on that side must come here and tell us that there is not enough money for education. Mr. Speaker, I have been in this House for 14 years and if there is one thing which has struck me more than anything else in these 14 years it is this: In all the years that I have been here I have never once heard anybody on the Government benches ask where the money is to come from when apartheid measures are put through in this House or when boards are established, when commissions are appointed or when all sorts of mock Parliaments are called into being.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member must confine himself to his motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>My motion starts by referring to the wastage of public <span class="col_3015-3016" refersTo="page_0200"/>moneys. But when it comes to welfare measures or better provisions for education then the question is invariably raised where the money is to come from. I reject the approach once and for all that the money is not available. In a rich country like South Africa the money is available and the training of the people of South Africa should receive absolute priority.</p>

<p>Lastly, my motion asks for an imaginative plan of national reconstruction. So far I have dealt with the younger generation because that is where our greatest hope lies. But one of the biggest problems in South Africa today is the Tack of contact between the various population groups, and the ignorance, the prejudice and the lack of understanding and mutual sympathy which flow from this lack of contact. Herein lies our greatest danger for the future, and the people who are going to pay the price for this are not we so much perhaps as our children. It is true that a certain amount of this prejudice owes its origin to our history and to the great disparity between the standard of living of the various sections of the population. We have therefore inherited a certain amount of this prejudice&#x2014;and that is understandable. But what is unforgivable is that in the past decade and a half this prejudice has been artifically fed and strengthened and encouraged for party political purposes. Contacts have been broken down everywhere; alienation has become the official policy and, figuratively speaking, barriers have been built up everywhere between people with the result that while people in our country can see one another they cannot understand one another. In the light of these facts we are the last people in the world who dare talk about the political wall in Berlin as something outrageous. And we have reached the stage where we make the serious blunder of believing that people of different races cannot successfully co-operate with one another. To bolster this belief of theirs hon. members opposite continually talk about events in Africa, and they interpret those events as it pleases them to interpret them. We refuse to believe that what is taking place and what has been taking place in Africa is a struggle for political freedom in which most Whites have allowed themselves to be caught on the side of colonialism. But let us look at another Continent of the world where different races are living together just as we do in South Africa; let us look at the multi-racial Continent of South America where this factor of colonialism is not present and where there is as great a variety of colours and races as we have here in South Africa. One very often hears the story from the Government side that &#x201C;there is not a single example elsewhere in the world where different races co-operate within the same State&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, when the South Americans hear that proposition they not only laugh at it but they feel hurt. Take the example of a country like Brazil where White and Brown and Black and Yellow live together. In Brazil the Whites, according to our idea of who is White, form only one-third of the population. They have strong class differences there, but without entrenching themselves behind laws the Whites in Brazil are in control of the country. Brazil also has her problems, of course, but she does not have the industrial problems that we have nor does she have our race problems. A few years ago Professor P. Serton of the University of Stellenbosch made a comparative study of South Africa and Brazil, the results of which he incorporated in a book entitled &#x201C;South Africa and Brazil&#x201D;. On pages 116 and 202 he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While the political life of this country (i.e. Brazil) is fairly turbulent, in comparison with South Africa, the social conditions are noticeably stable &#x2026; Brazil&#x2019;s strong national sentiment, which transcends all race and language barriers, is a practical political fact of the utmost importance &#x2026; Their common flag which flies, from Para to Rio Grande do Sul, over 60,000,000 people, is one which nobody&#x2014;White, Brown, Yellow or Black&#x2014; views with a feeling of indifference. When will South Africa be able to say the same thing&#x003F; (Page 202).</block>

<p>Professor Serton then comes to this conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the psychological handling of race relationships we (i.e. South Africa) are undoubtedly behind Brazil. (Page 205).</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not suggesting that the structure and the customs of one country can be superimposed on those of another country; that is not what I am proposing, nor do I maintain that we can follow the example of Brazil in everything. There is too great a difference between our history and that of Brazil. But what I object to is that we are beginning to convince ourselves for political reasons that different races cannot co-operate and that there is no country in the world in which they do co-operate. That is why we are not only extending restrictive legislation in these dangerous times but, as Professor Serton puts it, we are discriminating &#x201C;along the wrong lines.&#x201D; That is why my final point in this motion is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That we should create a positive spirit of friendship and co-operation amongst the various races and population groups in the country.</block>

<p>One of the methods which I suggest whereby blind prejudice and misunderstanding between the various races and ignorance can be lessened is, as we propose here, &#x201C;a huge campaign for adult education&#x201D; with the aid of the radio, with the aid of educational television services, and by establishing a radio network over the whole of South Africa. Sir, with the modern means that we have at our disposal in South Africa and in the world we can achieve miracles in bringing about a better understanding between the different races. And nothing would be more helpful in this regard than for our statesmen, our political leaders, to set a <span class="col_3017-3018" refersTo="page_0201"/>practical example. When I was a youngster I was very deeply impressed with the way in which a man like Mustafa Kemal in Turkey Westernized his country almost overnight by combating backward customs, and by the way in which he changed the whole mentality of the Turkish nation, their old ideas, their old customs and even their dress. I mention this merely as an example of what can be done&#x2014; and all the more so to-day when we have such modern methods at our disposal&#x2014;if a Government has the will to guide its country towards a programme of positive reconstruction and towards better relationships between the various racial groups. What I ask is that we should stop being afraid of civilized contacts between people. I have more than ample faith in the character of the White man to believe that civilized contacts will in no way detract from his determination to preserve his identity. On the contrary, the necessary adjustments now, along the lines I have indicated, represent the only guarantee that the future of the White man in South Africa will really be safe and assured.</p>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>I have been listening now for a whole half-hour to the speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson), and I am still faced with the same question which I jotted down on my notes yesterday, and that is this: What does the hon. member really want&#x003F; We have been listening here to a whole lot of generalities. The hon. member says that we must have contacts; he says that the White aristocracy must make certain adjustments, but we did not hear a single word from him as to how this is to be done and what the basic reason is why we should do so. I was interested to hear the hon. member refer to the states of Southern America and to Brazil specifically. He was careful to say that we could not follow the example of Brazil in everything. But as far as education is concerned, what can we learn from Brazil&#x003F; What one does get in Brazil is integrated education, and I wonder whether the whole idea underlying the hon. member&#x2019;s speech is not that he wants us to have integrated education in South Africa. He says that wherever Whites live there will always be non-Whites, but he does not go on to tell us how education is to be provided there. He does not subscribe to the proposition that we should have different schools for Whites and for non-Whites. I want to put this question to the hon. member, because the idea worries me: Is the position that the only adjustment which the hon. member really wants is that we should introduce integrated education&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member says that this is not a motion dealing with education, but two-thirds of the points which he mentioned here clearly deal with education only.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to the educational aspect of it because he says we must build up a new kind of person in South Africa, and that can only be done through education. If he does not want to follow the pattern that we are following to-day, then the only alternative is to introduce integration in our schools and to re-introduce integration in our universities.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to move the following amendment to the hon. member&#x2019;s motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House thanks the Government for the educational facilities it has created at all levels for the various race groups in the Republic and congratulates it on the fact that the standard of literacy of all race groups is so much higher than in most countries of the world.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I want to proceed, in the limited time at my disposal, to prove this statement. I am not going to deal with White education and adult education. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will probably come back to it. I want to confine myself mainly to non-White education. I do not want to deal with what the Government has done already. The hon. member says that he cannot accept the proposition that the necessary money is not available. But look what the Government has already done in respect of Coloured education. In 1940 there were 972 schools in the Cape with 124,137 pupils, and by 1950 there were 1,143 schools with 179,866 pupils and 5,353 teachers. By 1955 the number of teachers had grown to 6,500. In 1960 there were 1,422 schools with 267,909 pupils, and in 1962 there were 1,619 schools, in the Cape only, with 297,919 pupils and 9,063 teachers. In the Transvaal there were 55 schools in 1940 with 10,210 pupils. In 1962 there were 80 schools with 31,659 pupils, and the number of teachers rose from 663 in 1955 to 1,086 in 1962. In the Free State there were 28 schools in 1950 with 2,674 pupils and 96 teachers. In 1960 there were 34 schools with 3,280 pupils and 133 teachers. In 1962 there were 39 schools with 4,594 pupils and 164 teachers. In Natal the number of schools increased from 33 in 1950 to 45 in 1962; the number of pupils rose from 6,520 to 13,568; the number of teachers increased from 256 to 489. We have the same pattern in Bantu education. Sir, my time is so limited that I cannot go into detail, but I just want to point out as far as Bantu education is concerned that in the year 1950 there were 5,338 schools with 747,026 pupils and 18,530 teachers. In 1955 the number of schools increased to 5,810 with 1,500,774 pupils and 21,974 teachers. In 1962 the figure stood at 8,249 schools with 1,684,426 pupils and 28,849 teachers. We have made tremendous strides in this sphere. Just think of all the money spent on Bantu education. It has been calculated that 80 per cent of the Bantu children of school-going age are at school to-day.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member want us to introduce compulsory education for the Bantu&#x003F; If we were to do so we would have the revolution to which the hon. member over there referred. Apart from the question as to how long this 80 per cent remains at school, they do at any rate learn to write and to read and to do arithmetic. They can no longer be classified as illiterate. If we take the whole of our Bantu population, including even the older Bantu who were never at school, it is estimated that between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of them are literate, whilst in the rest of Africa, according to the figures given by Unesco itself, only between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the Blacks are literate.</p>

<p>Then I should like to deal with higher education. I want to mention just one example and that is the case of the University College of Fort Hare. What is being done there is being done at all the university colleges, it is done at the University College of the Western Cape, at the University College in Zululand and at the University College of the North. The State established these university institutions at State expense for the non-Whites. The State purchased the buildings and made additions or erected new buildings; the State pays the salaries of the teaching staff. Mr. Speaker, if you want to know what is being done for these people, I can only reply by making a comparison between these university colleges and the universities for Whites. At the University of Fort Hare the class fees and the fees for board and lodging only amount to R180 per annum per student, whereas at a university like Rhodes the class fees and the fees for board and lodging amount to approximately R394 per annum. The hon. member says that the children of rich parents are able to study but that the children of poor parents are unable to do so. Here we are making it possible for the poorest section in the country, the Bantu, to receive university training at a total cost of R180 per annum, whereas a White student at Rhodes has to pay R394. In other words, at the University College of Fort Hare they only pay 45.6 per cent of the fees paid by White students at Rhodes. At the University of Cape Town, where there used to be non-White students and where it seems to me the hon. member wants them back again, class fees and fees for boarding and lodging amount to as much as about R480 per annum. At the University of the Witwatersrand, even though the Bantu students who are accommodated in their Bantu residence pay more than R100 per annum less than White students, class fees and fees for boarding and lodging still amount to about R400 per annum. What becomes now of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument that we are not taking care of the poor and that all we do is to erect barriers&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to point out now what results we have achieved at Fort Hare. I have said on a previous occasion, and I want to say it again, that in the whole of its history the University College of Fort Hare has never had the teaching staff that it has to-day, a teaching staff of which any White university could be proud. It has never offered so many courses; it has never taught so many subjects. In addition to that, as far as facilities are concerned in the form of bursaries and loans granted to students, the position is that bursaries and loans are granted to more than half the students. The average bursary, together with the loan, amounts to R103 per annum, while the students only pay R180. Most of them receive a loan and a bursary which average more than R100.</p>

<p>At Fort Hare&#x2014;and I think this pattern also applies to the other university colleges&#x2014;our achievements are as follows: Last year 24 students enrolled for the B.A. degree; 23 passed, that is to say, 95 per cent. Ten students enrolled for the B.Sc. degree; seven passed, that is to say, 70 per cent. Eleven students enrolled for B.A. and B.Sc. (Honours) and ten passed, i.e. 90 per cent. Five enrolled for the U.E.D. and three passed, i.e. 60 per cent. That is the lowest percentage of passes we had. For the S.A.T.D. ten enrolled and nine passed, i.e. 90 per cent. One enrolled for the theological course and one passed, that is to say, 100 per cent success. In agriculture six enrolled and five passed, in other words 83 per cent passed. One enrolled for the diploma in commercial subjects and one passed, that is to say, 100 per cent success.</p>

<p>On the strength of these results a newspaper in the Eastern Cape said that this must be due to one of two things, that either these students were the most wonderful students that we had ever had in South Africa or that the standard must have been lowered. Sir, that is the old story that we always get from the Opposition. Those examinations are prescribed by the University of South Africa; the degrees are awarded by the University of South Africa, the oldest university in this country, the university which set the standard for all university colleges which were formerly colleges attached to the S.A. University. The standard at those universities therefore is the same as the standard at any White university. The difference in the results is due to the fact that Fort Hare has a better teaching staff to-day than it has ever had, hence these good results. I cannot see therefore how the hon. member can still complain that we are not doing enough, particularly for the poorer sections of our population.</p>

<p>In view of this non-controversial subject of education in this motion put forward by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) I am surprised indeed that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) who has just sat down has decided to criticize it in the way we have just heard. Evidently, even in respect of education, <span class="col_3021-3022" refersTo="page_0203"/>hon. members on the Government side cannot get away from the party line. They concentrate on minor issues, and they stay away from the main issue of this motion. They draw the old red herrings across the trail. This is not an education motion entirely, Sir, it is a motion that through education advocates the positive spirit of friendship and co-operation should be created amongst the races. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort has just quoted reams of figures to prove the advancement in education over the past decade for all Natives. Of course, the number of schools and pupils have increased; so has the population and so have the riches of South Africa. What this motion asks for is an imaginative plan of national reconstruction to bring education within the reach of all.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout deals with two basic problems. The first of those is educational. It deals with compulsory education at lower levels and the selection and financial support of youth with special ability and also the introduction of more radio programmes and educational television services for adult education. The second part of this motion deals with the raising of the standards of living and increased productivity which again, through education, can play an important part in the economic integration and co-operation of all races in our country. Compulsory education is a <i>sine quo non</i> which all political parties should aim at as a principle. In any civilized country that should not be open to any argument whatsoever. But the problem of providing sufficient teachers has yet to be solved. Later on, when dealing with adult education by way of radio television, I want to come back to that subject.</p>

<p>In August last year, that great educationist, Sir Eric Ashby, when addressing the presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, advocated investment in man. &#x201C;Investment in man, the most valuable of all capital,&#x201D; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Investment in man covers all kinds of education from primary school to the training of research workers.</block>

<p>Investment in man in our country with its huge natural resources requires a larger proportion of educated men and women than most other countries in Africa, men and women of all races. We have a tremendous annual university wastage among the White students. I should like to quote from the <i>Transvaler</i> of as recently as September last year. They refer to a survey that was made by the University of Stellenbosch on the progress of 54,500 children born in 1941. Of these children only 30.9 per cent reached matric. The figures shrink to 18.1 per cent who progressed to university and of the 18.1 per cent only 6.7 per cent got their degree. So there was a 60 per cent loss in those three years at university. Even the <i>Transvaler</i> is worried about this. It is not only those talents that are lost but also those children with special ability and talent whose parents cannot afford to send them to university or a higher institute. They should receive aid for suitable higher education and training. The talent of the youth of South Africa is one of the greatest assets and all children should be able to continue their education as far as their ability permits it. The present number of White university students is 45,705. In proportion to the population we are producing four times as many students as Germany, Britain the U.S.A. and the Netherlands, yet the wastage is about 50 per cent. Only 50 per cent reach the end of university courses. In Russia 95 per cent of entrants reach the end of a five-year course; there is only a 5 per cent wastage. In Britain the wastage is 17.2 per cent in respect of university students.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was stressing the acute need to bring adequate compulsory education within reach of all children in South Africa. This motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout asks for an opportunity to be given, through State-assistance, to talented students who have not got the means for higher, university and technical education. In the amendment moved by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort I do not see this point mentioned. It would be interesting to hear what the hon. the Deputy Minister may have to say about this. As far as the non-Europeans are concerned there again their large numbers demand the establishment of professional and technological services for their own races. In fact the Bantustan policy of the Government cannot possibly succeed unless an educated class of non-European can be brought up and brought into practical experience.</p>

<p>Sir, it is nought for our comfort to read that Bantu education is progressing, that more <i>per capita</i> is being spent on Bantu children in South Africa than anywhere else in Africa. South Africa is a highly developed industrial country and consequently the standards to which the Bantu population have to be raised are much higher than in any other part of Africa. The trickle of funds available to-day for Bantu education is totally inadequate to develop the Bantu to serve their own people.</p>

<p>I would like to quote from the &#x201C;Council of Education&#x201D; of the Witwatersrand. At the end of last year the chairman referred to the &#x201C;complete inadequacy of our quantitative achievements in the higher education of non-Whites&#x201D;. It is in this respect, in respect of the numbers, that we have to improve our methods when we realize that 1.4 per cent of our White population students go to university out of a population of 3,250,000, whereas in the case of the Bantu out of a population of 11,000,000 it is only one-hundredth of the percentage of the White population&#x2019;s educated youth.</p>

<p><span class="col_3023-3024" refersTo="page_0204"/>In this age of automation we have also to achieve an annual growth in industry. It will be necessary, by the year 1968, to have far more skilled workers. We see that the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs in November last year spoke at Bloemfontein about the shortage of skilled Whites. That shortage will be 30,000 by 1968, he said. If we are to provide more adequate education so that the whole of our working population has its standards raised and if this is done through education, then we shall have the extra skilled manpower we need and the present unskilled workers will have been trained sufficiently. It may be said that it is impossible to educate all the youth of a population of some 18,000,000 people, but technological advances in this age have provided the means in radio and television. This generation has by far the most competent single medium of instruction devised by man, which has vast potentialities as a medium of adult education, as stressed by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in his motion before the House.</p>

<p>In the United States of America alone today educational courses on television and on the radio are available to 100,000,000 American listeners through 84 non-commercial channels. They are at the disposal of almost every school in America. In adult education more than 100,000,000 pupils of all ages were enrolled in these classes last year. In adult education the courses stretch from mathematics to physical education, from geography to reading, from literature to languages and also instruction to immigrants in the home language of their country. In America last year more than 3,000 teacher training courses were organized through television. In adult education in Chicago alone there were 70,000 people who had been brought to university level through the adult education courses and 30,000 of them reached a credit level at university; two-thirds of the audience for these courses were women in their middle 30s because this is one of the chief sources of prospective teachers. This is another aspect in which the Government could save expenditure by utilizing this method to train people. In Britain, besides the regular school courses on radio there is a great advance in adult education to-day through the new course &#x201C;Dawn University&#x201D;, the university of the air. &#x201C;Desks at Dawn&#x201D; at 7.15 a.m. when courses are put forward by six of the top speakers in the country organized by Cambridge University on six different fields of study which range right through from languages to mathematics and science to history and literature.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Italian men and women who were illiterate have learnt to read and write. They have learnt these basic skills through learning given on the little black box, television. This is where South Africa should use television to supplement the radio programme. We need a radio /television &#x201C;war&#x201D; on Bantu illiteracy. Radio and television are being used all around us in the great drive in adult education against illiteracy in Africa. Educational broadcasters are being trained by the United Nations for the countries in Africa. In Kenya they are putting forward half-hour adult education courses in Swahili, which are for older people, for women and for the younger illiterate. We in South Africa must harness television to educate the Africans through a properly constituted South African Broadcasting Corporation. We must educate them in the ways of Western civilization so that we may bring adult education to the illiterate to counter Communism. Screen education to-day, Sir, is the modern and more forceful equivalent of the blackboard. Its impact is far more powerful than chalk. We must use television as the blackboard for the Black man. South Africa needs these massive education programmes in the radio and in television, which must reach the Bantu community; they must reach the Bantu in the location squares and in the Bantu schools to train them. We must bring universal literacy to the illiterate in our population.</p>

<p>We live to-day in a world of scientific revolution. It is only if our educational progress becomes part of this giant scheme of national planning that we can go forward into the challenge of the age prepared as a country to develop along a programme of realistic-expansion with school and university education and with adequate training facilities for all. In this, Mr. Speaker, in giving full support to the motion put forward by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout we must feel that there are only 36 years left between now and the end of the century and in that, if we are to compete effectively with other countries overseas, then nothing less than this motion will be sufficient for investment in man.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) has moved a motion here this afternoon which is as long as and even wider than the Namib Desert. It is a motion which is full of generalities and flights of imagination, a motion which has an object which I can only describe as savouring very much of Communism. To plead for the raising of the standard of living in this country or in any country in the world, without coupling that with a plea for increased productivity; to plead not only for the raising of the standard of living, but a standard of living coupled with comfort (as this motion does); to plead in a motion such as this that the dangerous gap which exists in the country between rich and poor should be eliminated without saying that that should be accompanied by hard work, is nothing else than the Utopia which the communist holds out in prospect to the uninformed masses in the world. But I shall return to that in a moment.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the motion which has been moved. The hon. member refers in this motion to a very imaginative plan that has to be tackled. In this connection I can only say that I think the hon. member is really a Ripvan <span class="col_3025-3026" refersTo="page_0205"/>Winkle who does not know what has been happening around him in this country over the past decade in the field of education. The hon. member has interspersed this plea of his for a plan of reconstruction with a series of generalities which reminded me very much of what Mr. Stanley Osier, the head of the Kearnsly College in Natal said recently. He is a member of the National Education Board who is an authority on educational matters. He is respected in English-speaking circles and he recently said the following in an article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Generalities in connection with education in South Africa are readily published in the Press but for myself I find it difficult to find anything to justify vague and condemnatory generalities relating to the nature and the standard of our education. I think our educational system is to-day relatively sound and modern. In a big country with large geographical, social and economical differences, as we have in the Republic, we must expect to find differences in the amount and in the standard.</block>

<p>My impression is that generally good results are obtained by our best schools and that the standard of education is fairly sound. Of course, it can always be improved upon and we must not stop aiming at that.</p>

<p>That is precisely what the Government of our country is doing. We are always aiming at improving our educational system. We realize that there may be shortcomings, that there may be certain defects, but that is nothing to feel disturbed about. As a matter of fact education is not static, it is dynamic, and it is to be expected, therefore, that a Government must continually adapt itself to new trends of thought and new developments. That is also why this hon. member can be assured of the fact that this Government is fully aware of the duty and responsibility which rest upon it in this connection because if we want to maintain ourselves in future we must only be satisfied with the best educational system. We realize that the tempo of industrial development is fast and in order to keep pace with that development it is necessary for us to develop our available human material to the utmost. The National Education Board which has now been established will undertake that task. That board must to a great extent assist in eliminating the wastage of manpower by bringing about greater co-ordination. And I do not doubt that this educational board will make a very important contribution in this sphere. Where the hon. mover says in his motion that South Africa needs an imaginative plan I want to tell him that it is unnecessary for him to plead for an imaginative plan. As a matter of fact for the past decade or more South Africa has been carrying out an imaginative educational plan. We are carrying it out to such an extent that the educational facilities offered in South Africa our standard of education have to-day reached that stage where they can be compared with the best in the world. They can be compared because of the observations made by our educational experts who from time to time visit educational institutions overseas and who are in a position to make a comparison. When I say that the standard of our educational system can be compared with the best in the world, when I say that we in this country are keeping pace with developments, I am not only referring to the educational facilities for Whites. South Africa provides educational facilities of which we need not be ashamed to all her national groups.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with the motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout point by point. Where the hon. member asks in point No. 1 that free and adequate education should be brought within the reach of all the children of South Africa I can assure the hon. member that that is precisely what is being done in South Africa. As far as the White children for whom we have compulsory education are concerned, the position is that thanks to the educational facilities we have for White children, coupled with ever-increasing university facilities, South Africa is to-day in this fortunate position that, apart from America, we have the largest percentage of students in proportion to our White population at university in the whole world and if that is not significant and if that is not an indication of the educational facilities and the opportunities there are in South Africa I do not know what will indicate that. Sir, when you think of the tremendous development that has taken place over the past decade in the sphere of vocational training in our country, vocational training which includes technical education, commercial education and other technical education, when you think of it that the Government intends spending R34,000,000 over the next few years on the erection and expansion of technical schools, commercial colleges, trade schools and other vocational schools in the country, I think we have an indication of the tremendous field covered by this imaginative plan which the Government is carrying out to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. member and his seconder are however, mainly concerned about the facilities provided to non-Whites. Let me start by referring to what is being done for the Bantu in this connection. As far as Bantu education is concerned the position to-day is that we have made such progress in the Republic that lower and primary schools are within the reach of every Bantu child; that as many higher and primary and secondary schools are being established as possible. Apart from this the House is aware of the fact that greater university facilities are being provided to the Bantu. It is also well to mention that the attendance at Bantu schools has more than doubled over the past ten years with the result that 83 per cent of the Bantu children of school-going age attend school. When you take into account the fact that in any nation in the world there is a certain percentage of children who, because of mental or physical defects cannot be educated, and that that percentage <span class="col_3027-3028" refersTo="page_0206"/>is sometimes reckoned at 15 per cent, we can only conclude that with this 83 per cent who attend school to-day for a shorter or longer period, we have really reached a stage which is tantamount to compulsory education. But where the hon. mover and his seconder plead for free education for the Bantu children I think the Opposition must ask themselves the serious question where the money for that purpose has to come from. Does the Opposition think the White taxpayer will be prepared to contribute increasingly more to this service&#x003F; As a matter of fact to-day the Bantu themselves pay no more than one-quarter of the expenditure connected with their education by way of the general tax which is paid into the Bantu Education Fund. In any case as far as compulsory education for the Bantu child is concerned the Bantu authorities which are now being established, such as the Transkeian Authority, can, if they wish, decide to introduce free and compulsory education in the area over which they have jurisdiction; we shall not stand in their way.</p>

<p>However, it is not only Bantu education that has progressed at a suprising rate in recent times. When you think of what has been done in the way of Coloured education it is something spectacular. It is spectacular to think that already in 1963 there were 368,000 Coloured children at school in the Republic and it is spectacular to think of the tremendous school contruction programme which has been embarked upon in the Republic. You need only travel as far as the D. F. Malan Airport to see the building programme which is being carried out at Bonteheuwel. When you see that you realize that the Republic has reached the stage where we practically have enough schools for all the Coloured children in the country who want to attend school. From a practical point of view the school facilities which are provided to the Coloureds have reached the stage where in the foreseeable future every Coloured child who wishes to attend school will have the opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>But it is not only in respect of the Coloureds that greater facilities are being provided. Our country can be proud of the university facilities which are provided to the Coloureds and the Indians. When I was in Durban last Tuesday I had the privilege of visiting the Indian University College and I was very favourably impressed with the facilities that university college offers. The laboratories provided there, whether it is the psychological laboratory or the scientific laboratory, are of the most modern any university in this country has. As a matter of fact some of the laboratories at that Indian University College in Durban are more modern than those at the University of Natal at the moment. Those are not achievements that should continually be belittled by motions of this nature. When you visit the Cape Western University College for Coloureds you are equally impressed by the most modern equipment and facilities provided there. It is something of which any country can be proud.</p>

<p>This motion also refers to bursaries that should be granted. I wonder whether the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and his seconder are aware of the fact that the Government spend nearly R500,000 per annum on bursaries for post-matriculation study and those are not the only bursaries available in the country; municipalities and industries make bursaries available for post-matriculation study; the university itself does so and so do the Provincial Administrations for the training of teachers. We also find that the State assist technical colleges in this connection. In spite of this huge amount of R500,000 which is spent on bursaries from State funds the State is at the moment considering extending these bursary facilities considerably in future.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The loan facilities are also improved all along, these facilities are not available to Whites only. Non-Whites also share, according to their due, in these bursaries. When you bear in mind. Sir, that about 100 per cent of the Bantu students at Bantu universities in this country receive State assistance in the form of bursaries or loans you appreciate the tremendous scope of this assistance and that is done because we realize these people will in future be required to serve their own people in their own areas in administrative and executive capacities.</p>

<p>The motion also refers to radio and television services. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) also pleaded for that. I think the attitude of the Government in respect of television is well-known and it is unnecessary for me, therefore, to deal with that. But as far as the extremely important medium of the radio is concerned it is well to know that this adult education for which the hon. member, for which Rip van Winkle, pleads is already being undertaken on a very large scale in South Africa. All the hon. member has to do is to tune in and he will realize that a large portion of the radio programmes consists of lectures and talks of an educational character which are intended to educate the adult. When we talk about adult education, you must remember that last year, under the supervision of the Department of Education, Arts and Science, the opportunity of attending its adult educational courses was given to 118,000 people, by means of youth camps, scientific exhibitions and so forth. Nor do these services remain static. They are being expanded and I may say that the Department of Education, Arts and Science and the Broadcasting Corporation have just recently agreed to introduce an evening programme on a national basis so as to expand the facilities offered by the adult education section of the Department. In future there will be talks in order to make this section of the State&#x2019;s activities, this section which provides facilities for <span class="col_3029-3030" refersTo="page_0207"/>adult education, better known. There will be lectures relating to youth activities, literature and the activities of women&#x2019;s organizations. Apart from this we enlist the services of Radio Bantu in the Bantu schools. They are given F.M. sets free of charge for this education and the school radio service for Bantu will be in full operation from April this year. Nor is there anything to prevent this service which we have to-day for the Bantu child from being extended in due course to the Bantu adult. As a matter of fact, as far as its radio educational services to the Bantu themselves are concerned, I think South Africa is ahead of any other country in Africa.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to deal with the objects envisaged by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I know the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has travelled extensively and he knows what the standard of living is in many countries of the world. Because he has travelled so extensively, Mr. Speaker, he ought to admit that the standard of living in South Africa is comparable with the best in the world. But that is not only the position in the case of the Whites. The non-Whites too have a high standard of living. Let me rather quote somebody in this connection to whose words the hon. member probably attaches more importance than to mine. I have in mind, Mr. Clarence Randall, the well-known American chairman of the State Advisory Committee, who recently wrote the following in respect of the Bantu in a journal with a world-wide circulation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">First of all he has to-day beyond question the highest <i>per capita</i> income of all the Black races in Africa, an income that exceeds that of the citizens of Ghana or Nigeria, for example.</block>

<p>Four out of every five Bantu children go to school and there are more than 2,000 university graduates as compared with fewer than a dozen in each of the new African states which now vote in the United Nations.</p>

<p>In respect of the urban Bantu this same American person of learning writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The urban Bantu is much better off in many ways than Africans residing in cities elsewhere on the Continent.</block>

<p>The hon. member who has also travelled in America will probably subscribe to the following view expressed by Mr. Randall&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Minority groups in the United States often live under less favourable circumstances.</block>

<p>I think South Africa has every reason to be proud of what she has achieved here.</p>

<p>The hon. member talks about racial tension. We do not have racial tension in South Africa. South Africa enjoys greater racial peace than any country in Africa. Not only do we enjoy greater racial peace than any country in Africa but we have far less tension in our country than any country in the world where various cultures and colour groups have been grouped together within the same territorial boundaries. That is due to the positive steps we take in our country. The hon. member now pleads that we should change the Western outlook on life and that comfort should be added to that. Yes, Mr. Speaker, in this motion of his he talks about increasing the Western and modern standards of living and comfort. The hon. member is pleading for the conditions which appertain in the land of the lotus-eaters. The hon. member is apparently under the impression that you obtain a higher standard of living in the form of a gift from Father Christmas No, Sir. never yet has a higher standard of living been obtained in the form of a gift from Father Christmas. You only obtain that by working hard. That is why I regret that no reference is made to work in the motion of the hon. member, that there is no appeal to people to work harder so as to raise their standard of living. No, he talks about the comfort they must enjoy. You can only raise your standard of living in this country, as in any country in the world, if you are willing to sweat for it and our task in this House, as the representatives of the voters, is continually to encourage the people to realize that and not to talk about a comfort which only has an Utopian and a semi-communistic flavour.</p>

<p>Reference is made in this motion to a dangerous gap between those people who are Door and those who are rich. If you wish to eliminate that gap you must not do so by way of legislation, it must be eliminated by the willingness of the people to work in order to eliminate it. The hon. member can consider himself lucky to be living in a country like this where we have this measure of racial peace. To use his terminology, the hon. member talks about South Africa having to undergo a national reconstruction. It is a fact that we are at the moment experiencing a national reconstruction in the country. We are experiencing it at the moment in the sphere of race relations in South Africa. South Africa is beginning to develop a new conception of the relationship between White and non-White; there is a new spirit, a spirit which will in future be one of our main sources of strength to ensure our safety. The hon. member accused the Government of not being well-disposed towards the advance of the non-White groups. This peace we are enjoying in South Africa, this inflow of non-Whites to this country to come and work here that continually has to be curbed is because the Government of this country is well-disposed towards the cultural and economic advance of every racial group in the country and to the extent to which the positive steps which are taken in this connection begin to take shape to that extent the non-Whites will become more well-disposed towards the Whites in this country because of what is being done for them and for the country.</p>

<p><i>Budget Speech, 1964</i></p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House go into Committee of Supply on the Estimates of Expenditure to be defrayed from the Consolidated Revenue Fund during the year ending 31 March 1965 and into Committee of Ways and Means on taxation proposals.</block>

<p>Growth and stability are the two main economic objectives of budgetary policy. The prudent Minister of Finance will never neglect either of these two objectives, but, as economic conditions change, it may be wise for him to lay more stress on the one or the other.</p>

<p>Last year the emphasis of my Budget was on growth. Growth we have achieved, in what rich measure I shall presently show. If we can maintain this economic growth and at the same time preserve financial stability then we shall have gained a glittering prize indeed&#x2014;in piscatorial terms, a catch worthy of even the most distinguished fisherman.</p>

<p>But to land this elusive quarry of sustainable economic growth is no easy task. It requires a seaworthy political craft with a competent crew. The fiscal tackle must be adequate and in good condition. The bait must be the right type for the prevailing economic conditions and for our particular quarry&#x2014; sometimes the artificial lure of State expenditure, at other times the natural lure of private enterprise, or again a controlled measure of both. A sound knowledge of the economic weather and financial currents is essential.</p>

<p>The angler should not become impatient or over-hasty to land the big fish of prosperity and stability. His hand on the fiscal line should be light, sometimes guiding, sometimes restraining, but always purposeful. He must beware of the sharks of inflation that infest the economic seas to snatch away the prosperity and stability that is on the hook. He must be wary of the undercurrents of boycotts and sanctions that threaten to carry his prize away. He should be able to sense the jagged underwater rocks that endanger his reserves and balance of payments&#x2014;that may entangle and even cut his line and so let the big one get away. Indeed, it is after the fish has been hooked that the skill, strength and artistry of the fisherman are tested to the utmost.</p>

<p>Before setting out on our expedition, let us first take a look at the present and prospective economic weather conditions on our fishing grounds. I shall start with the&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Internal Economic Position</i></p>

<p>The gross national product rose from R6,068,000,000 in 1962 to R6,679,000,000 in 1963, an increase of no less than 10 per cent. After allowing for changes in the price level, the increase in the real gross national product was approximately 9 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in the previous year. Per head of population, this means a growth rate of over 6&#x00BD; per cent per annum.</p>

<p>In my Budget speech last year I said that personal consumption, while increasing, might still need some further stimulation. I am glad to say that the treatment has been successful and this fish is much bigger and fatter than last year. Personal consumption expenditure in 1963 rose to R4,300,000,000&#x2014;10&#x00BD; per cent above the 1962 figure. Increased purchases of durable goods were mainly responsible for this steep rise.</p>

<p>Current expenditure by public authorities, which helped so much to stimulate the economic revival in 1962, continued to expand in 1963, but at a slightly lower rate.</p>

<p>Despite the increase in consumption, inventories continued to rise throughout 1963, so that the country is well stocked with most types of goods.</p>

<p>Fixed capital investment was another category of expenditure about which I did not feel entirely satisfied last year. During the second half of 1963, however, there was a marked rise in fixed investment, both public and private. As regards the former, the Railways Administration was the main contributor, though the public corporations also increased their fixed capital investment substantially. In the private sector, large increases occurred in residential building and in fixed investment in industry and commerce. Over the year 1963 as a whole, total fixed investment rose by 17 per cent and this increase has played, and will continue to play, an important part in sustaining the growth of the economy.</p>

<p>Most of the principal sectors of economic activity shared in the rapid expansion of the economy. The index of the physical volume of manufacturing production showed an increase of 12.9 per cent in 1963 as compared with 1962; there was a particularly sharp rise in the production of electrical machinery, metal products, petroleum products and paper. Employment in manufacturing industry rose by 6.8 per cent over the same period.</p>

<p>The expansion of the building and construction industry was one of the major features of the economic upsurge in 1963. Although employment in this industry was only 5.4 per cent higher than in 1962, the value of buildings completed increased by nearly 17 per cent and of building plans passed by no less than 64 per cent.</p>

<p>Gold production again reached record levels, though the increase was not so great in 1963 as in 1962. Production and sales of other minerals were, in general, well maintained, <span class="col_3033-3034" refersTo="page_0209"/>though the sale of uranium oxide was again reduced as a result of the stretch-out agreement.</p>

<p>Except for the last quarter of 1963, agriculture was not favoured by good weather, and drought conditions are now again prevalent in certain areas. As a result of improved farming methods, however, agricultural production in general showed a slight increase in 1963 as compared with the previous year; in value, it rose from R874,000,000 to R892,000,000. Prices showed a marked improvement, especially in export markets; in the second half of 1963, for example, the wool price was about 22 per cent higher than a year earlier. Moreover, the present trend of export prices is still upward. Prices of farming requirements, on the other hand, have risen very little if at all. The consumption of agricultural products, which in recent years has scarcely kept pace with the growth of population, is now showing welcome signs of more rapid expansion.</p>

<p>All the other principal economic indices confirm the impression of vigorous growth. Unemployment continued to decline, while retail sales, railway revenue, real estate transactions, company profits and share prices all increased substantially in 1963. One index, I am glad to say, showed only a slight rise over the year; that is the index of consumer prices, which in December 1963 was only about 1 per cent higher than a year earlier. I shall return to this point later.</p>

<p>Closer analysis indicates that the economic upsurge proceeded at a somewhat slower rate during the fourth quarter of 1963 than in earlier months; this trend is evident in industrial production, in employment, in private consumption, and in the gross national product itself. This tendency was inevitable as the slack in the economy was progressively taken up, i.e. as unemployed labour and unused industrial capacity were drawn into the productive process and as the economy approached a state of full employment. It seems likely, therefore, that the exceptionally high rate of growth experienced in early and middle 1963 will not be repeated in 1964, but that a more normal rate of expansion will ensue.</p>

<p>Before giving further attention to the prospects for 1964, however, I should like to say something about&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>The Balance of Payments</i></p>

<p>The most striking feature of the balance of payments in 1963 was the steep rise in imports, which increased to R1,296,000,000 nearly 24 per cent above the 1962 level. This increase, which was made possible by some relaxation of import control, was a natural consequence of the general expansion of the economy, and was also an important factor in restraining inflationary pressures.</p>

<p>The volume of merchandise exports maintained a satisfactory level and as the prices of several of the principal products improved during the year, the total value of exports (excluding gold) increased to a record figure of R1,014,000,000. Wool, maize, sugar, copper and diamonds were mainly responsible for the increase.</p>

<p>Gold production, as I have already mentioned, attained a new record level, viz. R688,000,000.</p>

<p>As a result of increased freight and insurance payments associated with higher imports, net invisible imports in 1963 were about R30,000,000 above the 1962 level.</p>

<p>The net result of all these changes in the current account of the balance of payments was that the surplus declined from R307,000,000 in 1962 to R143,000,000 in 1963. During the last quarter of 1963, after allowing for seasonal movements, the surplus was actually running at an annual rate of only R56,000,000, and it seems clear that&#x2014;as was to be expected with the rapid growth in the economy&#x2014;the era of large surpluses on current account is coming to an end.</p>

<p>On capital account there was a net inflow of R12,000,000 in official capital in 1963, resulting mainly from trade credits and from investment in non-resident bonds. The total identified net outflow of private capital over the year amounted to about R95,000,000. This is a high figure, but R87,000,000 of this was due to purchases by South Africans of South African securities held by foreigners, mainly through the so-called &#x201C;permit&#x201D; and &#x201C;arbitrage&#x201D; schemes. During the last quarter of 1963, despite the fact that the amount of foreign exchange made available under these schemes was increased, the net private capital outflow was only R4,000,000, indicating that there was a substantial net inflow of private capital in other forms.</p>

<p>All these various movements in the balance of payments resulted in an increase of R87,000,000 in our reserves of gold and foreign exchange during 1963. As I predicted last year, this is considerably less than the exceptional increase in 1962 (R188,000,000), but is still a most satisfactory figure. Since the beginning of 1964&#x2014;in fact since the end of the third quarter of 1963&#x2014;the reserves have shown little change, indicating that the balance of payments is now approximately in equilibrium.</p>

<p>The balance of payments has continued to exercise an important influence on&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Monetary and Financial Developments</i></p>

<p>The continuance of the external surplus enabled relatively easy conditions in the money and capital markets to be maintained throughout 1963. This has facilitated the expansion of economic activity and particularly of investment.</p>

<p>The discounts and advances of the commercial banks (seasonally adjusted, and excluding advances to the Land Bank) increased fairly steeply in the first part of 1963, but tended to level off in the last quarter. The banks&#x2019; liquid asset ratio, after declining to 42.8 per <span class="col_3035-3036" refersTo="page_0210"/>cent in September, rose to 44.4 per cent at the end of the year. The Reserve Bank&#x2019;s discounts, advances and investments remained fairly low, while its legal reserve ratio at the end of December was still at the high level of 84.5 per cent. All this indicates that there is still very considerable credit-creating potential in the banking system.</p>

<p>Conditions in the money market&#x2014;despite record credit facilities extended to the private sector by the merchant banks&#x2014;remained liquid throughout 1963. The pressure of liquid funds was, however, reduced by the so-called &#x201C;swop arrangements&#x201D; whereby the commercial banks were allowed to invest limited amounts abroad, by increased allocations under the &#x201C;arbitrage&#x201D; scheme for share purchases abroad, and by the continuation of the Treasury&#x2019;s policy of borrowing more than was required to meet Government expenditure. Short-term interest rates nevertheless remained low in 1963. Since the beginning of 1964, however, these rates have hardened, probably as a result of increased tax collections, the continued expansion of economic activity and the levelling-off of the reserves.</p>

<p>In the capital market, despite appreciable new issues of securities, ample supplies of funds continued to be available. Share prices remained generally high and the average yield on industrial and commercial shares at the close of the year was only about 4&#x00A3; per cent; on long-life gold-mining shares it was just over 6 per cent.</p>

<p>These low yields reveal the growing attraction of equities for institutional and private investors but, at the same time, they probably also reflect the presence of speculative expectations in a rising market. I would earnestly appeal to banks and other financial institutions not to allow this latter tendency to derive support from easy credit conditions, as this may mar the picture of our healthy economy as presented by a buoyant stock exchange.</p>

<p>Mortgage advances by building societies and other financial institutions rose appreciably, but mortgage rates remained steady.</p>

<p>I think, Mr. Speaker, that we have now analysed the prevailing economic weather conditions in sufficient detail to enable us to draw some general conclusions regarding the economic prospects and fiscal policy.</p>

<p>But before doing so I would like to recall something I said three years ago, almost to a day. On the day that South Africa was forced to make its exit from the Commonwealth on 15 March 1961, and against the judgment of many financial pundits, I dared to make the following declaration of faith:</p>

<block name="quote">We can hardly expect that our new Republic will always sail in calm financial waters. But we dare trust that with the guidance of Providence, it will always ride the financial waves on an even keel and weather every financial storm.</block>

<p>The financial picture I have just painted is the finest vindication of the faith I expressed on that fateful Ides of March. I will surely have wider support in reaffirming, three years later, our faith in the future of our economy and our country!</p>

<p>I now return to&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Economic Prospects and Fiscal Policy</i></p>

<p>The growth of the economy during the past year has been spectacular, but the slack has now largely been taken up, resources are almost fully employed, and the rate of expansion has settled down in recent months to more sustainable levels. So far there has been no sign of general demand inflation; indeed the steadiness of the price level, both wholesale and retail, has been remarkable.</p>

<p>In certain industries, however, particularly the construction industry, bottlenecks have developed and prices and costs have risen. A shortage of skilled labour is likely to present difficulties in these industries, though the magnitude of these difficulties should not be exaggerated. Up to the present, these bottlenecks have not caused any significant diffusion of inflationary tendencies in the economy. At worst, they have tended to weaken anti-inflationary forces.</p>

<p>In general, conditions are favourable for continued economic growth. Both consumption and investment are running at high levels, while financially there is still adequate liquidity to provide for further economic expansion. This expansion is likely to continue on its own momentum without requiring any special stimulation.</p>

<p>While it is important that nothing should be done to check this expansion, it is clear that the emphasis of economic and fiscal policy should shift slightly from the stimulation of growth to the preservation of stability. Broadly speaking, growth can now be left to take care of itself, but stability may need the attention of the authorities.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are many favourable factors on the side of stability. I have already mentioned that adequate stocks of most types of goods are available, and although the economy is almost at a full employment level, the production of South African industry is doubtless still capable of further expansion, especially as new capacity now being installed comes into use and as immigration continues to supplement the local supply of skilled labour.</p>

<p>From the balance of payments side, there are also grounds for optimism. Gold production is likely to increase slightly, while economic conditions in our overseas markets are favourable for the maintenance of exports at a high level. It should therefore be possible to import sufficient goods to relieve any shortages of imported goods and so contain inflationary pressures. My colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, has already stated that import control will be directed to this end.</p>

<p><span class="col_3037-3038" refersTo="page_0211"/>It is true that, with the continued decline of the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments, we may not be able to permit the repatriation of South African securities at the pace prevailing in recent months and at the same time maintain our reserves at an adequate level. Our reserves are relatively satisfactory, and a moderate decline would cause me no disquiet, but obviously we shall have to watch the position carefully.</p>

<p>To return to the internal economic situation, the problem of bottlenecks will certainly require attention. As regards skilled labour, the Government is doing and will continue to do its best, through training and through immigration, to alleviate the shortage. But employers can also do much through the more efficient use of the existing labour force, through organized systems of in-service training, and through greater use of those types of labour which are not yet fully employed, such as the older workers and the partially disabled.</p>

<p>The public sector can also help to relieve the pressure in the construction industry by postponing, where possible, capital construction projects or by spreading the work over a longer period of time. This, however, is not always so easily done. Many projects are in fact essential to continued economic expansion in the private sector and cannot be postponed without seriously retarding that expansion. For social as well as economic reasons others, such as schools and hospitals, cannot be unduly delayed. But so far as it is possible, it is the duty of the Government, the Provincial Administrations and the Local Authorities to curb their capital construction programmes at the present time.</p>

<p>There is no immediate danger of general demand inflation, and a stern anti-inflationary budget would at present be altogether out of place. But it would clearly be equally inappropriate to apply any general stimulation to the economy. Government expenditure will have to be held in check as far as possible&#x2014;though here considerations of national defence must take precedence. It would likewise be unreasonable for the taxpayer, who is now enjoying the fruits of last year&#x2019;s expansionary budget and the country&#x2019;s prosperity, to expect a repetition of last year&#x2019;s largesse. However, it may be possible to find a few choice morsels for deserving cases.</p>

<p>I turn now to the Government&#x2019;s accounts for&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>The Financial Year,</i> 1963-4</p>

<p>I mentioned last year that the introduction of P.A.Y.E. made an accurate estimate of revenue most difficult. For this reason, and also because the growth of the economy exceeded even my expectations, it is not surprising that the surplus on Revenue Account for the current year will be about R88,000,000. Of this amount, R82,000,000 is attributable to an under-estimate of Inland Revenue. Customs and Excise receipts have also been well above the original estimates, but this was nearly off-set by increased expenditure&#x2014;notably the R10,000,000 voted for Defence in the Additional Estimates.</p>

<p>On Loan Account, where it is always difficult to estimate in advance the expenditure on large capital projects during the year, expenditure will probably be some R10,000,000 less than originally estimated; this includes savings of R7,000,000 on Housing and R4,500,000 on Community Development. At 31 March 1964 the Loan Account should show a small credit balance of R3,000,000.</p>

<p>Next I shall deal with&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>The Loan Account,</i> 1964-5</p>

<p>The Estimates of Expenditure on Loan Account which I shall Table amount to R315,000,000, or R16,000,000 more than the Main Estimates for 1963-4.</p>

<p>The expanding economy has led to increasing demands upon the Railways, and a total of R89,500,000 has been provided for the Railway Administration under Loan Vote A&#x2014; R19,500,000 more than in the current year. For similar reasons it has been necessary to step up the Post Office&#x2019;s Loan Vote by R4,600,000.</p>

<p>Under Loan Vote E&#x2014;Water Affairs&#x2014;an amount of R31,600,000 is requested, or R11,300,000 more than in the current year. This increase is almost entirely due to increased provision for the Orange River Project, construction on which is expected to get under way during 1964-5. Provision for all other Government water schemes amounts to R14,000,000, which is not far in excess of the amount provided in the current year.</p>

<p>Since the Department of Coloured Affairs is now responsible for school building, Loan Vote P shows an increase of about R6,000,000.</p>

<p>On Loan Vote N&#x2014;Bantu Administration and Development&#x2014;an amount of R32,000,000 is provided for the South African Native Trust. Together with an anticipated carry-over of R4,500,000 from the 1963-4 grant-in-aid, this will enable no less than R36,500,000 to be spent by the Trust in the Bantu Areas during the next financial year.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Vote &#x201C;Commerce and Industries&#x201D; has been reduced by R13,300,000 principally because of the disappearance of the R16,000,000 provision for the synthetic rubber project.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that for the current year an amount of R26,000,000 was provided for Defence on Loan Account. In the changed economic circumstances now prevailing, I think it advisable to revert to our former practice of providing all our Defence requirements on the Revenue Vote; the Defence Loan Vote therefore falls away.</p>

<p><i>Assistance to Marginal Gold Mines</i></p>

<p>Apart from the amount shown on the printed Estimates, I propose to ask the House to vote an amount on the Loan Vote for assistance <span class="col_3039-3040" refersTo="page_0212"/>to the marginal gold mines. Last year the Government announced a scheme to assist certain vulnerable gold mines which were threatened with premature closure because of the heavy cost of pumping water flowing into them from adjoining mines which had already closed down. I propose that this scheme be continued and under the Revenue Vote I shall ask for an additional R600,000 in 1964-5 for this purpose. There are, however, other marginal mines where other types of assistance seem to be justified, and after close study of the problem the Government proposes to grant loans to such mines to assist them to keep going. My colleague the Minister of Mines will give details of the scheme in due course, but broadly speaking the idea is to grant loans to approved mines to cover working losses (up to 10 per cent of revenue) and to meet approved capital expenditure; such loans would be repayable out of profits as and when they arise and would be written off when the mines concerned are forced to cease underground operations. Interest charged would be 5 per cent, of which 3 per cent would be capitalized. The amount required in 1964-5 would be R3,000,000.</p>

<p>The principal object of both schemes is to lengthen the lives of the mines concerned. This will not only help the mine employees but also give more time to the communities serving these mines to adapt themselves to changing conditions. It will permit a considerable quantity of gold to be mined which would otherwise be lost to the country, and will enable the relative mines to resume full and profitable production if and when the price of gold is increased.</p>

<p><i>South West Africa</i></p>

<p>The Report of the Odendaal Commission still has to be considered by the South West African Legislative Assembly, and I do not wish to anticipate in any way the decisions of that body. I think it would be prudent, however, to make some provision for assistance to the Territory in terms of the Report, and I propose to set aside R20,000,000 provisionally for this purpose.</p>

<p>The expenditure which may have to be met from Loan Account therefore amounts to R338,000,000. In addition, provision has to be made for the following:</p>

<table>

</table>

<p>The total sum required is therefore R500,000,000.</p>

<p>Holders of the maturing local stock will be offered conversion into new stocks, and in view of the prevailing liquidity I am confident that a large proportion will be reinvested.</p>

<p>Similarly, holders of maturing tax-free Treasury Bonds will be able to convert into the present issue of 4&#x00BD; per cent seven-year bonds, and I expect that a large number will take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

<p>The repayment of such a considerable amount of Loan Levy has disturbing inflationary implications if the money should pass into general circulation, and I hope that those who receive this repayment will exercise restraint and reinvest a substantial portion. I shall consider, at a later stage, whether some special inducement should be given for such reinvestment.</p>

<p>The 3&#x00BC; per cent Three Year Non-Resident Bonds have proved extremely popular and sales during the past seven months have exceeded R25,000,000. While I do not wish to close this door to the genuine foreign investor who wishes to withdraw his capital, I think the terms of the present issue are too favourable. The present issue will therefore be closed forthwith and a new issue of Non-Resident Bonds will be made available on more realistic terms to be announced in due course.</p>

<p>The Government is not at present drawing against its revolving credits with American and German banks, and these credits, totalling R35,700,000, are available when required. In addition, I think it would be possible to raise new external loans to an amount of R15,000,000.</p>

<p><i>Estate Duty</i></p>

<p>I have one tax change to propose which affects the Loan Account, and that is in respect of Estate Duty. The various deductions allowed in assessing this duty were fixed in 1955 and I think some concession is now justified. The rebate for a child will therefore be raised from R10,000 to R12,500, while the maximum amount of insurance policies, Government Stocks and Land Bank debentures exempted from inclusion in the estate will be raised from R10,000 to R15,000. This concession will take effect immediately and will cost R700,000.</p>

<p>To sum up, the following funds should be available for the Loan Account&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_3041-3042" refersTo="page_0213"/>I propose to transfer to Loan Account R16,000,000 out of the surplus on Revenue Account for 1963-4. This will then leave a balance of R60,000,000 still to be found. I intend to raise this within South Africa by the issue of stock or Treasury Bills.</p>

<p>I shall next deal with the&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Estimates of Expenditure on Revenue Account,</i> 1964-5</p>

<p>The printed Estimates, which I shall Table, provide for expenditure of R1,013,800,000&#x2014; R161,000,000 more than the Main Estimates for the current year.</p>

<p>As was the case during the past two years, Defence is responsible for the lion&#x2019;s share of this increase, namely R88,000,000. I must point out, however, that the contribution to the Defence Special Equipment Account, R36,000,000, is included in this figure, whereas in 1963-4 this item was voted on Loan Account. The provision for Defence for 1964-5, namely R40,000,000, is actually R52,000,000 higher than the total provision for 1963-4 in the main and additional Estimates on both Loan and Revenue Accounts. This is still a large increase, but I am sure that this House will have no hesitation in furnishing the wherewithal to discourage foreign aggression. I need not enlarge upon the threats which have been hurled at our country&#x2014;threats which, at another time, would have called down the condemnation of the civilized world. If I do not believe that these threats will be translated into action, it is only because I know&#x2014;and those who threaten us know&#x2014; that our defences are strong and getting stronger by the day.</p>

<p>There is also a substantial increase&#x2014; R17,900,000&#x2014;in the provision for Coloured Affairs. Of this amount, R16,500,000 is due to the taking over and expansion of Coloured Education by the Department.</p>

<p>On the Vote of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, R13,000,000 is provided as a grant to the Transkei.</p>

<p>If these exceptional increases are excluded, the increase on the current year&#x2019;s main Estimates amounts to about 5 per cent or R43,000,000, which is very close to the figure for the normal average expansion of departmental activities during the past few years.</p>

<p>In the Supplementary Estimates I propose to ask the House for additional provision for certain services.</p>

<p>There is one group which has perhaps shared less than any other in the general prosperity of the country; I refer to the pensioners. I feel that some concession here is justified even if the effect should tend to be mildly inflationary.</p>

<p><i>Social Pensions</i></p>

<p>Last year, as hon. members will recall, additional relief was granted to the neediest categories of social pensioners&#x2014;those who had no assets of their own and only a very limited casual income. While this concession brought relief where it was most needed, it has given rise to some dissatisfaction among those who just failed to qualify for the additional allowance, and has also caused some administrative difficulties to the Department. I propose, therefore, to extend to other social pensioners and beneficiaries the relief which last year was granted only to the neediest. A White old-age pensioner, for example, will now receive a pension of R324 per annum provided his property and income do not exceed the usual limits, and proportionate relief will be granted to non-White pensioners. I shall Table a White Paper giving details of the concessions. The cost will be R3,450,000.</p>

<p>I propose also to grant further concessions in respect of&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Military Pensions</i></p>

<p>War pensioners are in receipt of a bonus equal to 45 per cent of their basic pensions and allowances. I propose now to grant a bonus also in respect of supplementary and alternative war pensions, on a basis set out in the White Paper which I shall Table. A White war pensioner in receipt of a supplementary pension, for example, will receive a bonus equal to 45 per cent of such pension.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the attendant&#x2019;s allowances granted to certain disabled war pensioners will be increased by 20 per cent.</p>

<p>These concessions will cost R300,000.</p>

<p>I have also great sympathy with the position of&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Civil Pensioners</i></p>

<p>I propose that civil pensions should be so adjusted as to ensure to every married White pensioner a minimum income of R54 per month, and to every unmarried White pensioner a minimum income of R27 per month. Details of this concession are set out in the White Paper.</p>

<p>Similar supplementary allowances will be granted to railway pensioners, but the Railways Administration will bear the cost of these allowances only for male pensioners under 65 years and female pensioners under 60 years of age; thereafter the cost will be borne by the Central Government.</p>

<p>These concessions will benefit those drawing very low pensions, but I feel that something should also be done for other groups of civil pensioners. Here it is necessary to bear in mind that pensioners who retired after 1958, and to a lesser extent those who retired after 1953, receive the benefit of the consolidation of public service salaries which took place in those years. The relief will therefore take the form of an allowance which will taper off gradually for those who retired after 1953. This will be additional to the allowance already granted, but subject to the same means test. For example, a married <span class="col_3043-3044" refersTo="page_0214"/>White pensioner who qualifies for the additional allowance may receive an additional RIO per month if he retired before 1 October 1953, but only R1 per month if he retired in 1961-2. Full details will be found in the White Paper.</p>

<p>The cost of all these concessions to civil pensioners will be R1,350,000.</p>

<p>I may add that it is the sincere hope of the Government that the Provincial Administrations will follow our example and extend similar relief to their pensioners, and especially the retired teachers. In terms of the existing financial arrangements, the Central Government will bear one-half of the cost.</p>

<p>All these concessions to social, military and civil pensioners will take effect from 1 April 1964.</p>

<p><i>Marginal Gold Mines</i></p>

<p>As mentioned in the discussion of the Loan Account, I propose to ask for a further sum of R600,000 on Revenue Account in order to continue the scheme for assisting certain gold mines with the pumping of water.</p>

<p>Including this R600,000 and the R5,100,000 required for concessions to pensioners, total expenditure on Revenue Account is accordingly estimated at R1,019,500,000. In order to determine how this expenditure is to be met, I must now deal with the&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Estimates of Revenue for</i> 1964-5</p>

<p>I have assumed that the gross national product will continue to grow but&#x2014;for reasons which I have explained earlier&#x2014;at a slightly slower rate than in 1963. I have taken per cent per annum as a likely rate. This does not mean, of course, that all items of revenue can simply be increased by per cent. In the case of income-tax on individuals, for instance, allowance must be made for the progressive rates of tax, for delayed assessments of tax due in respect of previous years, and for over- and under-payments of tax under the P.A.Y.E. system during 1963-4 which will be adjusted during 1964-5.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into consideration, I estimate the revenue for 1964-5 on the existing basis of taxation at R955,300,000, or R19,000,000 above the revised figure for 1963-4. Customs and excise receipts are expected to increase by R17,000,000 and Post Office receipts by R7,000,000, but inland revenue is estimated to decrease by R4,500,000 &#x2014;mainly owing to the fact that assessments for arrear taxation in respect of the pre P.A.Y.E. period will naturally be much lower next year.</p>

<p>The surplus of R88,000,000 on revenue account for 1963-4, less the R16,000,000 to be transferred to Loan Account, must also be added to give a total of R1,027,300,000 available for 1964-5. This gives me a limited scope for manoeuvre.</p>

<p>I have already said that I do not consider that any general stimulation of demand is necessary or desirable at the present juncture. It will be better, in my view, to use the available funds selectively to grant relief in cases where this seems justified and to remove certain anomalies in our tax system.</p>

<p>My first proposal relates to&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Excise Duty on Yeast</i></p>

<p>This duty was never intended as a revenue measure but was used for control purposes to check the brewing of illicit liquor. I am assured by the police that this control is no longer necessary.</p>

<p>The administration of the duty, especially in respect of the rebates granted to bakeries, is also troublesome and expensive. I propose that it be abolished forthwith. The loss of revenue will be R450,000.</p>

<p>I have considered some means of encouraging home ownership for the small householder, and I think this can best be done by some reduction in&#x2014;</p>

<p><i>Transfer Duty</i></p>

<p>This duty at present amounts to 3 per cent on the first R10,000 of the value of the property transferred and 4 per cent on the amount above R10,000. Although these rates are not high, they may still represent a substantial addition to the cash resources required by, for example, a young man setting up house for the first time. I therefore propose to grant a rebate on the existing duty, for properties up to R15,000, on the following basis:</p>

<block name="quote">For properties up to R5,000&#x2014;a rebate of two-thirds of the duty.</block>

<p>For properties between R5,000 and R10,000&#x2014;a rebate of one-half of the duty.</p>

<p>For properties between R10,000 and R15,000&#x2014;a rebate of one-third of the duty.</p>

<p>These concessions will come into force immediately. The loss of revenue is estimated at R3,700,000 per annum.</p>

<p>I have a further proposal to make in connection with transfer duty. It is a source of gratification to the Government that so many foreign companies which previously operated in South Africa through branches of the parent concerns, should now be establishing South African subsidiary companies with their own boards of directors. This is a trend which I wish to encourage. Where a considerable amount of fixed property has to be transferred from the branch to the new subsidiary company, the transfer duty involved may be substantial and may even inhibit the change. I therefore propose to grant exemption from transfer duty, with immediate effect, in cases where all the assets in South Africa of a branch of a foreign company are taken over by a South African subsidiary of that foreign company. The annual cost to the Exchequer should normally not exceed R100,000.</p>

<p><span class="col_3045-3046" refersTo="page_0215"/><i>Gold Mines</i></p>

<p>It will be remembered that last year I extended to all new gold mines the capital allowance of 5 per cent calculated on the unredeemed capital expenditure. It is important to the country that new gold mines should be established to take the place of those which will close down in due course, and in order to encourage their establishment I propose to increase the capital allowance from 5 per cent to 6 per cent for all gold mines started after 20 March 1963. There will be no loss of revenue in 1964-5.</p>

<p><i>Undistributed Profits Tax</i></p>

<p>The Undistributed Profits Tax is designed to give a strong inducement to private companies to distribute in dividends at least 30 per cent of their profits before tax. In other words, they may plough back up to 40 per cent of their income (other than dividends, and before deducting company income-tax) without becoming liable for the Undistributed Profits Tax. The average proportion ploughed back is considerably less than this, but circumstances may arise, especially at a time of rapid expansion such as the present, when a slightly higher proportion would be desirable. I propose, therefore, to alter the formula so as to permit a company to plough back 45 per cent of its income (other than dividends, and before deducting tax) without incurring liability for undistributed profits tax. The relief will be granted in respect of all assessments for a tax year ending during the calendar year 1964. The loss of revenue will be about R750,000.</p>

<p><i>Income Tax on Individuals</i></p>

<p>The present is not the appropriate time for any general reduction of income-tax, even if the budgetary position had made this possible. The 5 per cent discount on individual income-tax will, however, be continued. There is one further adjustment which I wish to propose. The present rates of income-tax on individuals rise rather steeply after the R4,600 mark. This is a relic of the old super-tax scale and, although the progression was smoothed out to some extent in 1960, I think some further adjustment is called for. I propose, therefore, to reduce the tax rates in the income brackets above R4,600 so that the rate rises more slowly than at present up to R6,000 (for a married person), and thereafter gradually approaches the existing rate again. Details of the proposal will be tabled, but the effect will be that a married man with an income of R5,000 will pay about per cent less tax than at present, one with an income of R6,000, 12 per cent less, and one with an income of R8,000, 3&#x00BD; per cent less. The concession will apply with effect from the year of assessment ending on either 28 February or 30 June 1965, as the case may be. New P.A.Y.E. tax deduction tables will be issued in due course, and the loss of revenue in 1964-5 is estimated at R2,000,000.</p>

<p><i>Donations to Loan and Bursary Fund</i></p>

<p>Last year I pointed out that the concession granted to companies in respect of donations to universities was intended to meet an exceptional problem, namely, the provision of costly facilities in the vitally important field of technological training and research. I still do not think that any general extension of this concession is justified. In view of the shortage of trained manpower, however, I am prepared to make some concession to help solve this special problem. What is required here is not the provision of additional university facilities &#x2014;which are generally adequate&#x2014;but rather additional assistance to students who lack the means to continue their education. I propose, therefore, that companies be allowed to deduct from their taxable incomes, up to a maximum of 1 per cent of such incomes, any donations made to a national loan and bursary fund for students in need of assistance to complete their studies at a university, university college, technical or training college. Details of the scheme will be worked out in consultation with the Department of Education, Arts and Science. This concession, which will be additional to the existing concession for donations for technological training, will apply to the financial year of any company ending on or after to-day. The cost to the Exchequer is estimated at R500,000 for the year 1964-5.</p>

<p><span class="col_3047-3048" refersTo="page_0216"/>The estimated surplus at the close of the financial year is therefore R300,000.</p>

<p>In this Budget my problem was easy to define: to reconcile continued rapid growth with a high degree of financial stability. But it was not so easy to translate this precept into practice. It is true that the forces making for stability are substantial. The balance of payments is satisfactory, the reserves are relatively strong, the country is well stocked with goods, and the productive power of the economy has often in the past proved equal to the demands imposed upon it. On the other hand, there are warning signs of possible bottlenecks, especially in skilled labour, and particularly in the building trade.</p>

<p>The not inconsiderable surplus from the current year can therefore not be utilized for indiscriminate tax or other reliefs, but must be deployed cautiously in such a way as not to weaken materially the forces making for stability. But again there are certain categories of persons who do not share to the same extent in the current prosperity and are deserving of some relief. And there are also some anomalies in our tax system which require rectification.</p>

<p>In the end I devised a formula which attempts to take all these factors into consideration. Of the surplus of R88,000,000, I transferred R16,000,000 to the Loan Account, which has to bear the cost of prolonging the life of certain marginal gold mines as well as some relief from estate duty. The balance of R72,000,000 I carried forward to the Revenue Account for 1964-5 to be utilized as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">R52,000,000 for the additional cost of Defence;</block>

<block name="quote">R5,100,000 for the relief of social, military and civil pensioners;</block>

<block name="quote">R3,700,000 to assist the small householder to acquire his own home;</block>

<block name="quote">R500,000 to encourage donations to a National Bursary and Loan Fund to assist needy and deserving students;</block>

<block name="quote">R2,000,000 for the adjustment of anomalies in the income-tax curve;</block>

<block name="quote">R750,000 to permit private companies to plough back a higher proportion of their profits;</block>

<block name="quote">R8,000,000 for general Government services.</block>

<p>It is an indication of the inherent strength of our economy and the buoyancy of our revenue that we are able to finance next year&#x2019;s share of the cost of the Orange River project (R 13,800,000), of a possible expenditure on the implementation of the Odendaal Commission Report on South West Africa (R20,000,000), additional provision for Defence (R52,000,000), a grant-in-aid to the new Government of the Transkei (R13,000,000), an additional R7,000,000 to the South African Native Trust, together with tax and other relief amounting to about R17,000,000. What is most heartening is that we can do all this and much more practically without resorting to new overseas borrowing, with little new money from internal loans and without levying any fresh taxation.</p>

<p>I think it is clear to all of us that but for the soundness and strength of our economy, we would have been hard put to maintain ourselves, to protect the integrity of our land and the independence of our people, against the openly expressed aggressive designs of certain States.</p>

<p>Our economy is one of the main bulwarks of our national survival. But its continued growth is also the condition for higher living standards for all sections of the population. It behoves us, therefore, to take every possible care to maintain the soundness and increase the strength of our economy in this troubled world. In pursuit of this high purpose, I shall spare no effort and if necessary shall not hesitate to take the required steps to protect this priceless possession of the Republic. I trust, nay, I feel sure, that in whatever steps may be necessary for this purpose, I will be able to rely on the ready co-operation of this House and of the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>We have listened to a very remarkable statement this afternoon. I think, possibly with one exception, it has been the most remarkable Budget statement to which I have ever listened. The hon. the Minister has confessed to having a surplus of some R88,000,000. Sir, if you take into account the way in which he blew up his Additional Estimates plus the fact that it is quite clear that his final revenue will be larger than he has stated to-day, one will not be far wrong, I think, in saying that he will have a surplus altogether of about R100,000,000. He told us this time last year that he was budgeting for a surplus of R100,000. So, in effect, the hon. the Minister has told us to-day that there has been a slight error in his calculations of about 1,000 per cent.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister to-day has changed his clothes for this year, in his usual Walter Mitty-like fashion: He is a fisherman this year. He tells us that he is now acting as a fisherman. I must say that when he talked about that everybody in the House looked up and expected him to land at least a tunny as large as that landed by the hon. the Prime Minister not so long ago. I cannot say, however, that the hon. the Minister has succeeded in doing that. In fact he is looking rather worried than pleased; he looks more like a man who has lost the biggest fish of the year. In fact, he reminds me of the man who has been putting coins in a slot machine for many years and who has suddenly hit the jackpot and the &#x201C;one-armed bandit&#x201D; (which in this case is apparently the Inland Revenue Department) has deposited a large fortune in his lap and stunned him; he does not really know what to do with it I have no doubt, Sir, that in the course of the next few <span class="col_3057-3058" refersTo="page_0221"/>days there will be plenty of people ready to give the hon. the Minister good advice as to what to do with the fortune that has fallen into his lap. I must say that the first impressions one got when listening to the hon. the Minister were, first of all, that he was still underestimating the final surplus with which he would close the year both in respect of Loan Account and Revenue Account; secondly, that he had not succeeded, in fact that he had failed, to take advantage of what seems to me to be a very great opportunity which good fortune and the taxpayers of this country had placed within his grasp.</p>

<p>In the comparatively short time which the hon. the Minister in his wisdom is allowing us to study his statement it will be our duty to examine it closely in order to commend what we feel to be right. There is no question about it that there are features in it that we shall support wholeheartedly. When we have examined his statement and the figures he has put before us we shall suggest to the House the manner in which we believe the present favourable financial position of the country should be exploited for the benefit of the people of the country. At this stage, Sir, I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<heading>BANTU LAWS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Resumption of Committee Stage,&#x2014;Bantu Laws Amendment Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>[Progress reported on 12 March, when Clause 25 was under consideration.]</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Committee is dealing at the moment with Clause 25, a clause which defines the duties and functions of labour tenant control boards and of Bantu labour control boards. It is particularly in the latter context that I shall deal with this clause, that is to say, as far as it affects the Bantu labour control boards. This clause together with the regulations with which we shall deal at a later stage deals with the manner in which the Bantu labour control board is to carry out an inquiry into and order a reduction of the Bantu labour force at the instance of a farm inspector, i.e. of a Bantu labour officer. It is quite clear from the existing provisions of the Trust and Land Act that this power of an investigation and this power to order a reduction in the number of the employees of a farmer or an individual is not required to get rid of excess Bantu living or residing on the land of the farmer or of the individual. Those people who are in excess of the requirements of the individual concerned are squatters. They are defined in the existing legislation as those Bantu who are neither labour tenants nor servants. Those Bantu fall into the category of squatters and they can be dealt with under Section 33 of the Trust and Land Act as it stands to-day.</p>

<p>We have the position where in terms of this clause, the what one might call the bogus Bantu employee, the Bantu who is residing on land but not properly employed, can be dealt with under existing legislation, i.e. the legislation dealing with squatters. One wonders why it is necessary to create a labour control board with the powers which are referred to in this clause and which will be elaborated upon when we come to the clause dealing with regulations. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will give us an indication of what is intended in that regard when he replies to the questions raised under this clause. I repeat what I said previously, namely, that the only conclusion to which one can come, in the absence of an explanation, is that it is to use it as an instrument to carry out Government policy. We have already heard what results will flow if it is to be used for that purpose.</p>

<p>One is concerned about this clause not merely because of what appears in it but because of what will be dealt with later on in this Bill. I do not propose to go into that at this stage, but we are concerned about this clause because of what appears in Clause 35 where the powers and the functions of these boards are increased, which adds to those factors an additional factor namely the availability of labour other than Bantu labour. That is however not a matter which I can discuss now. There is another difficulty which arises from the powers given in this clause and that is the position which will arise in the farming community when, a determination having been made as to the number of employees a farmer can have on his land, he requires a large-scale increase in his farm labour on a temporary basis due to seasonal fluctuations. Take harvesting time on those farms where cotton is grown and where a great number of temporary labourers, usually women, are employed. They have to reside on the farmer&#x2019;s land during the week if not over the week-end. In that type of case this is purely a seasonal increase in the amount of labour the farmer requires but it might double or even treble the supply of labour which is normally resident on that farm and which is normally required in order to keep the farming operations going. A determination having been made in respect of that farm, how is that farmer to cope, short of going back to the board, prior to the harvesting season, getting a redetermination for a temporary period and then falling back to the original determination&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Cotton is a yearly crop, Sir. It is very much dependent upon the weather and a farmer&#x2019;s requirements in that regard will vary greatly and very considerably from year to year if not from month to <span class="col_3059-3060" refersTo="page_0222"/>month. Let us have some indication as to what is to take place here. Are we to have the Bantu labour control board sitting and making determinations on a monthly basis&#x003F; Or is it to be half-yearly&#x003F; Or is it to be on a yearly basis&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister must tell us how this is going to work because unless some indication is given I foresee very great difficulties coming up as far as those farmers are concerned who have tremendous seasonal fluctuations in the number of Bantu labourers they have to employ. There are so many variable factors, the weather being not the least of them. It will be interesting to hear from the hon. the Deputy Minister, in his reply, how this is going to work.</p>

<p>When you look at sub-section (3) (b) on page 37 you see that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A labour tenants control board may make any investigation, hold any inquiry or make any determination &#x2026; notwithstanding the fact that it may previously have made an investigation, held an inquiry or made any determination or order in respect of the same land.</block>

<p>That applies only in respect of a labour tenants control board. One wonders why the same thing should not apply to a Bantu labour control board if there is to be some alleviation of the position in the case of the farmer who has vast seasonal increases and changes in his labour supply. These are some of the difficulties which seem to arise out of this clause as far as the duties and functions of Bantu labour control boards are concerned. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move an amendment. I regret that owing to circumstances this amendment could not be prepared in time to be printed on the Order Paper for the information of the hon. members. It is a very simple amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 37, page 35, and line 21, page 37, respectively, after &#x201C;tenants&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or Bantu labour&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I move this amendment to bring these two sub-sections into line with other sub-sections of this clause. The words &#x201C;labour control board&#x201D; should really not have been omitted. Thereby I think I shall also be dispelling certain doubts voiced in connection with the regulation aspect of sub-section (4) and the previous sub-section we have already disposed of. I think it will now be quite clear to hon. members that the squatter tenants control board and/or the Bantu labour control board can fulfil these functions in terms of the regulation applicable to one or other of these bodies.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet I should just like to refer to a few other aspects. The other day hon. members also referred to the difference in the treatment of Bantu labourers on farms who do agricultural work and others who do work which cannot be described as agricultural work, in other words those who are not <i>bona fide</i> farm workers. One hon. member mentioned the example of sawmills, and another hon. member mentioned the example of a slate quarry. Bantu who do that work are of course not agricultural labourers. They do not fall under the determination of the labour control board; they are really a type of industrial worker and that brings them in line with the position of the ordinary Bantu workers in industry. Industries are usually established in the urban areas. There other measures exist indirectly by means of which the presence of Bantu can be controlled. Let me mention the most obvious example, namely housing conditions. We know that in terms of the Urban Areas Act the setting aside of residential areas is very effective. It may be said that if a person employs so many Bantu in his industry, they should live in certain areas set aside for the purpose, separate residential areas or compounds or hostels. As hon. members will remember, last year we introduced legislation dealing even with the accommodation of domestic servants. We said that if a person had three or four domestic servants they could not all live on the premises; only one could live on the premises and the rest would have to live in the urban Bantu residential area, as soon as that Act was implemented. In an indirect manner that affords a measure of control over the presence of Bantu there. But on the farms that sort of control is impracticable because we cannot provide residential areas on all the farms. The Bantu who work there live on the farm. Therefore this method was evolved to apply control on the farms in terms of the labour itself. The labour which has been approved then lives there. It is a shifting of emphasis in regard to the control which is required there.</p>

<p>In a later clause, which I cannot discuss now, the question of too many Bantu on farms is dealt with. That is the new Section 38<i>quin</i> which is proposed. I think that also answers the objection of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), who asked the other day why domestic servants should also be taken into consideration and why a determination can be made in their case also. It ought to be clear that in the case of domestic servants irregularities may take place on a farm. The farmer may say: &#x201C;It is only a coincidence that you see him here in the house looking after the children; he is really an agricultural worker.&#x201D; I do not want to dilate on such examples, but such irregularities may take place, and therefore we felt that these provisions should include the phrase &#x201C;taking into consideration the number of domestic servants there&#x201D;. I think what I have just said is also the reply to the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman), who asked why a labour control board should be established. I have explained that in urban areas industrial <span class="col_3061-3062" refersTo="page_0223"/>workers have to live in a separate residential area, but that this is not possible on farms.</p>

<speech by="#warren">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>I am particularly concerned about this clause in regard to the responsibility that must arise in sub-section (3). The Minister may decree that there must be a reduction in the number of labour tenants on the farm. The Minister may terminate the contracts completely. In terms of Clause 31 which I cannot discuss now he can reduce the duration of that contract to three years after which it must terminate. I wish to direct the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that enormous numbers of Natives are going to be displaced from those properties, both legal and illegal labour tenants and both legal and illegal squatters. Will the Minister give me some idea of the responsibility the Government is going to undertake towards the absorption of those Natives into some kind of employment or perhaps in camps until such time as they can be placed in suitable employment&#x003F; It is most important to the safe conduct of this legislation that the Minister makes the necessary provision for such accommodation. I would like to know from the Minister what responsibility the Government is going to take for accommodating these displaced Natives which are now to be moved from the farms on which they have lived as labour tenants and squatters.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this is a very far-reaching clause indeed. To my mind this clause has very bad provisions indeed. In line 47 on page 35 I read for instance &#x201C;or if it is requested in writing by an owner of land in such area or by a labour liaison officer &#x2026; an investigation into the number of labour tenants or Bantu employees &#x2026;&#x201D; shall be made on that particular farm. In terms of sub-section (3) an investigation may be made in regard to labour tenants or Bantu employees, because it deals with both, even if the owner does not so appear. They may hold an inquiry or make a determination in his absence. It makes no provision for the case where the owner does not appear because he cannot appear for any reason. The owner, or the farmer, may be in hospital or he may not have received the notice because the notice has to be in writing. It may happen that the notice gets lost in the post and the farmer does not receive it. He will therefore be unaware of the investigation that is to take place. In that case the investigation can still take place.</p>

<p>What also disturbs me is the fact that at the request of one owner of land an investigation can be made. The position used to be that five persons had to make such a request. It has now been changed to one owner or to a labour liaison officer. This opens the door wide to abuse. A farmer may be jealous of his neighbour and he may ask for an investigation. The other farmer will have to go to the trouble of appearing or of not appearing depending on whether he had received the notice or not. This once again gives the Minister and the officials working under him complete power because after they have held this inquiry they can make any determination or issue any order in respect of that land and that need not be for the first time. This can be a recurring event, as the hon. member for Zululand has pointed out. Sub-section (7) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No owner in respect of whose land any determination has been made as aforesaid and is in force shall at any time allow a greater number of labour tenants or Bantu employees, as the case may be, to reside on such land. &#x2026; Provided that the board may from time to time and on the application of such owner, after inquiry, rescind or vary its order for good cause shown.</block>

<p>I get the impression that the people who have drawn up this Bill, including the hon. Deputy Minister, really know nothing about farming operations. The hon. member for Zululand put the case of a cotton farmer who occasionally has to go and pick cotton and who then needs large numbers of Bantu labourers, or labourers of some kind, to pick that cotton. Now this owner of land cannot tell to the day when his cotton will be ready to be picked. That depends on what the climate is like, what the weather is like, whether rain falls, etc. But what in regard to the reaping of mealies&#x003F; What in regard to the farmer who usually does not use hand labour to clean his mealie lands&#x003F; The position may arise where as a result of too much rain he cannot get into his lands with his machinery and the only way of doing it is to use hand labour for cleaning up the mealie lands, and then he has to use large numbers of people, and he will not have time to put in an application. I am thinking at the present moment of a case in Tulbagh where there are also seasonal labourers. Most of the prunes that are grown in South Africa are grown in that particular area, and this particular farmer put in an application for 12 extra persons to help him when the prunes had to be picked. He was told that these people would be supplied. He put in an application a very long time ahead of the time when he would require them and he deposited the necessary amount, I believe R7.50 per person. When the time came they could not supply these people to him, and he was told to deposit a further sum of money. In the end he got four labourers that he could use, with the result that instead of picking four tons of prunes a day he was only able to pick two tons of prunes a day. Mr. Chairman, will you tell me how people can tell to a date when they will need certain people&#x003F; How can they forecast when it is going to rain, or when a drought is going to hit them&#x003F; Because it may be too dry also to get the machinery into the land, and he may have to wait until it rains and then to use hand labour. This Government is taking complete control under <span class="col_3063-3064" refersTo="page_0224"/>these clauses of the economy of the White farmer in South Africa. And it is not the Minister of Agriculture who is taking these powers, but the Minister of Bantu Administration. At the behest of a Minister such as this these things will be regulated and from that the prosperity of the farmer in this country will depend.</p>

<p>The hon. member is quite right, this is indeed a day of darkness for South Africa, a day of regimentation, a day when everybody is to be told what to do, and a day on which this Government makes provision in clauses of this nature not only to control the Bantu&#x2019;s lot in this country but also to control the White man&#x2019;s lot.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I did not know that I had to give an explanation here in connection with what is called the seasonal workers, because actually that is covered by the regulation-making powers we will discuss when Clause 35 (c) comes to be debated. But in order to prevent unnecessary scaremongering in connection with this matter, I should just like to point out that this matter is covered by Clause 35. There hon. members will find in paragraph (c), or the new paragraph (u), what the procedure is that has to be followed in regard to the appointment and the proceedings of the labour tenants control boards and Bantu labour control boards, the powers, functions and duties of such boards, the principles to be followed or the matters to be considered (which may include the availability of labour other than Bantu labour) by such boards when granting consent for registration. There the regulation-making powers are expressly provided, and in terms of those regulations we shall be able to provide that a labour control board, when making determinations, should do so according to specific procedures and principles. It is the intention, for example, to say that when the labour control board makes its determination in regard to labour, it can at the same time, if in the meantime an additional need arises for seasonal workers, for temporary workers for a month or a few weeks, say what should be done to obtain these additional workers, and for that we have the district and regional labour bureaux which will be able to give assistance. Therefore the regulation-making powers completely dispose of those doubts, because in this way provision can be made and the hon. member for Drakensberg can sleep peacefully in so far as this matter is concerned. It is not our intention at all to disrupt the economy of the agricultural community. Far be it from us to do that. But I do want to point to one thing which has not yet been sufficiently emphasized, namely that the determinations will be made by the Bantu labour control board.</p>

<p>And who are the members of this board&#x003F; It consists of farmers. Three farmers will serve on it and the chairman, who is a departmental official, has no vote in ordinary procedural matters. He has only a deciding vote in the event of a dispute arising. In other words, it is in the hands of the farmers themselves to make those determinations, and if the hon. member thinks that we in the Department know nothing at all about what happens on farms I want to tell her that she is missing the ball completely, and I further want to ask her whether the farmers will not know enough about their own vicinity and the requirements of the farmers in their vicinity&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid the hon. Deputy Minister has not satisfied us at all. In fact he has us more worried than ever before. The hon. Deputy Minister admits that all the hon. member for Drakensberg fears may happen, but he says &#x201C;Do not be worried; by regulations which are published I can tell the boards how to act&#x201D;. He says that he can place restrictions on them and he can decide what labour is required. He can tell them what procedure is to be followed. That can all be done by regulation, and you must trust me, the Minister, to do the best for the farmers. Then he goes further and says that we must not worry because on the board there will be farmer representatives. But who will appoint those farmers&#x003F; Those members will not be elected by the farmers in the area. They will probably be political appointments, appointed by this Minister. Sir, it has been the complaint of all sides of the House that the rent boards do not act as efficiently as they should because the best members do not sit on those boards. The same thing will apply here. It is quite wrong for the hon. Minister to ask us to pass an Act giving these boards powers which are contained in these clauses, and at the same time to say &#x201C;I will restrict their actions by regulation&#x201D;. We cannot just rely on regulations. When we pass this Act we must know what powers are going to be given to these boards, and how they are going to apply those powers. I am particularly worried after the speech made by the hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) last week who in justification of this measure said that certain farmers had no labour at all whereas other farmers had more labour than they require, and that therefore we must have a measure of this kind to regulate the supply of labour. Now there is some reason why one farmer has got no labour and the other farmer has more labour than he requires. There is some reason for that, and I can see in this clause how a farmer who has no labour is going to harass a farmer who has all the labour he requires. Because if you read the clause you find that the labour tenant board or the Bantu labour board must call upon the farmer to account for his labour if it receives a request in writing by an owner of land in the area. Any owner of land in that area can write to the board, complaining that <span class="col_3065-3066" refersTo="page_0225"/>his neighbour has too much labour and then the board must (it is given no option) require this farmer who has all the labour to come and appear before it and to account for his labour. It is then for that board to decide whether that particular farmer has too much labour. I can just imagine what will happen if the members of the board are in the same position as the farmer who lays the complaint and if they also have not enough labour and they see how their neighbours who treat their Natives decently have all the labour they require. The members of the board will then decide whether a certain farmer has too much labour, and if they so decide, he must get rid of that labour. And where is that labour to go to&#x003F; Those farmers who lay the charge will hope that that labour will have to go to them, otherwise it may have to go back to the reserves. Sir, this clause is one of the most dangerous in this Bill and we shall certainly oppose it.</p>

<p>Before I come to this illogical and insignificant argument of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes), I just want to deal with the questions of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren), which he had already asked before and to which the hon. the Deputy Minister has already replied. His main question was what the responsibility of the Minister was in regard to the so-called or alleged surplus of Bantu labour. The Minister dealt with that a few days ago and it links up with the story which the hon. member is now telling again, namely that there will be a surplus in the one case and a shortage in the other. The Deputy Minister pointed out that the Bantu about whom the hon. member is now concerned will be able to be absorbed on the farms where the labour is required, or they can go elsewhere.</p>

<p>Just listen to that stupid interjection. It is as the very result of this control that one will be able to dispose of the surplus labourers and to place them where they are required, through the control boards. Cannot the hon. member understand that&#x003F; But what is the actual plea of the hon. member for Drakensberg&#x003F; She is not concerned with whether the available labour will be placed where it is needed, through the proper channels. No, she pleads only for those who want to have surplus labour, where they need only press a button in the event of their needing labour for a month or even less than a month. But what happens to that Bantu labour during the rest of the year does not concern her at all. She is not concerned whether for the rest of the year they will be unemployed and go hungry and deteriorate. She is concerned about the type of farmer, and it is a very peculiar type of farmer (if there are such people) who always has superfluous labour on his farm who can be employed to-morrow if rain falls tonight; then they need only press a button and the labour must be there. Sir, when one considers the interests of these people as a whole one cannot advocate something like this. We cannot take into account just one specific type of human interest alone. Labour must be properly distributed, also in the interests of that labour itself. But that is not what the hon. member for Drakensberg wants. She does not want there to be any wise and reasonable distribution of labour. She wants certain people to have the right to press a button at any time and expect a surplus of labour to be available to them. That is just what will cause suspicion and jealousy and dissatisfaction, if one farmer sees that he has no labour, whereas another has a surplus of labour on his farm which he uses only when he suddenly has work for them. The hon. member has said that this is a terrible clause. Let them attack it. I challenge the hon. member who has attacked this clause to go to the rural areas, to any farming community, and to justify the attitude adopted to-day by the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories hit the nail on the head. In the first instance, the hon. member for Krugersdorp talks about surplus labour, but who is going to decide who has got the surplus labour&#x003F; That is the first thing. The man who is such a bad employer that Bantu do not want to work for him is going to make a complaint against the man who has got as much labour as he wants. He goes and complains against the man who has in his opinion surplus labour, and if the Government&#x2019;s friends are all to be on these boards, they will say &#x201C;Yes, you have got surplus labour there&#x201D;. And what is going to happen&#x003F; That person is going to have labour taken away from him because he is a good master who pays his men well and who houses them properly, and therefore he has as much labour as he requires. But the board is going to come along and say to him: You have got a surplus there, and you have got to give some of that labour to someone else who cannot keep labour because he is a bad employer. It is a most unfair thing from that point of view. That is the whole point. It can be the biggest wangle that has ever taken place, and this is a very dangerous clause. If it goes through, who is going to have any right at all&#x003F; In other words, if you are not popular with the other employers there, you are going to be imposed upon, and you are going to be forced to give up labour which you really require.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point has severely criticized these boards which will be appointed. But this is a board consisting of farmers. The hon. member has expressed a great lack of confidence in the farmers. Hon. members opposite have <span class="col_3067-3068" refersTo="page_0226"/>gone even farther and said that the boards would now consist of Nationalists only and that the United Party supporters would be left without labour. What a ridiculous argument! I cannot see intelligent farmers making a determination without taking all the factors into consideration, and giving such stupid decisions as hon. members here wish to intimate. This is just a smokescreen. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories talked about the powers to make regulations. That is not really relevant to this clause; it is only relevant under Clause 35. There the powers to make regulations are clearly defined and no Minister may exceed them. It even mentions the &#x201C;availability of labour&#x201D;, and therefore the regulations will have to bear in mind what labour is available. Therefore that argument of his also falls away. This particular clause refers to the board and not to the labour bureau. The hon. member for Drakensberg seems to think that it is this board which will have to supply the labour. That is nonsensical. The board has only one duty, and that is to determine how many labour tenants there will be and how many labourers should be allowed on a farm. It is not for that board to say: &#x201C;Give the prune-grower in Tulbagh the labour which we found on the other farm.&#x201D; The labour bureau must make the labour available. This whole argument of the hon. member for Drakensberg is wrong.</p>

<p>I cannot allow the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) to get away with that. If he has replied on behalf of the Minister, then I am disappointed. He seems to confirm the idea that was expressed by the hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) who said that this would bring about an automatic adjustment of labour, that labour would be taken from one farm or expelled from one farm under the Act, and that that labour would be naturally absorbed by people who could not get labour. If it were as easy as all that, we would not be putting this legislation through the House this afternoon. I want to tell the hon. member for Krugersdorp that he does not know what is going on on farms.

They have got to accommodate such labour in camps, or in another way.

What contribution is the Government going to make towards dealing with this matter when it arises&#x003F; The hon. member for Krugersdorp knows nothing about it.

<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, I am well acquainted with the circumstances of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and the conditions in the area in which he farms. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town objects to the thousands of superfluous Bantu on the farms. Where do those who are in his specific area come from&#x003F; They come from the Ciskei and from the Transkei. The same applies to the Northern Cape area. We have these superfluous Bantu on the farms. They come from the Transkei and from the Ciskei. They simply stay there. Many farmers on the farms do not even know that they are there, and so it goes on.</p>

<p>I should like to object strongly to what the hon. member for Drakensberg has said. She said here that almost all the farmers in South Africa have superfluous Bantu on their farms. That does not apply to all farmers. It is only a very small percentage of our White farmers who keep superfluous Bantu on their farms. We have made use of migratory labour for all these years and we still do so to-day, such as, e.g. sheep-shearers, as well as seasonal workers who come and go. Why should that type of worker be kept on the farms year in and year out&#x003F; The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town asked what would become of these Bantu&#x003F; They will return whence they came and we will not tolerate them on the White farms in South Africa any longer.

<p>I do not think that it is necessary to pursue the question of the squatter or the illegal farm-labour tenant, because the surplus of these people is provided for under other clauses of this Bill. Here we have a simple concept. It is in respect of the ordinary farmer in respect of whom a complaint is made that he has too much labour. The labour may be other than farm-tenant labour, or it may be farm-tenant labour or a combination of both. But in the aggregate this clause provides that if it is reported that there is too much labour, then certain machinery is set into motion. So far as the superfluity of farm-tenant labour is concerned, it is already dealt with in a clause which we have passed, Clause 22. There the Minister has got full powers to deal adequately with that form of labour, and when we were debating that clause we pointed out that when we would come to this clause we would find that it was unnecessary to have the provisions in this <span class="col_3069-3070" refersTo="page_0227"/>clause because Clause 22 deals adequately with that type of labour. As I said on a previous occasion, I have yet to find the farmer who keeps a lot of surplus labour on his farm, employed for 12 months in the year, and paying those Natives when he does not need them.</p>

<p>We are dealing with Bantu labour, but it does not matter whether it is Bantu labour or Coloured labour or White labour. No farmer keeps paid labour on his farm full-time when he is not employing that labour and does not want it. What we are concerned with here is the labour that an ordinary farmer carrying on his ordinary farming avocation may require from time to time, and the point has been made by the hon. member for Drakensberg that you have seasonal labour, and she has given an example of where seasonal labour was required and the present machinery failed completely to provide that labour. You see, Mr. Chairman,</p>

<p>I want to raise this point at once, that this clause strikes at the root of the whole basis of what we believe should be the fundamental relationship between your Black labour and your White employer and that is that the labourer freely offers his service to the White employer, and if that employer is satisfied he takes that labour. We believe that to be fundamental: A free offer of labour by the labourer and the free acceptance by the employer.

<p>I think the hon. member said that it went through the labour bureaux. Very well, I will come back to that presently. I did not suggest that you will come along with a bucket and pick it up and take it from one farm to the other. I said &#x201C;through the machinery established in this Bill&#x201D;. The position then is that if that concept is accepted as the dominating factor in the policy which the Government is adopting, then you are going to completely ruin the whole concept of a labourer freely offering his labour to an employer who freely accepts it. That is basic. So we are in the position that with a huge organization, now added to by means of these Bantu labour control boards as well as the tenant-labour control boards, dealing with this mass of Bantu labour, up to some 6,000,000 or 7,000,000 Bantu altogether, who come within the ambit of this particular Bill, once it is being applied, everything is under Government control. The ordinary farmer who uses seasonal labour will naturally be in a disadvantageous position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> a farmer who uses his labour, a limited number of labourers, right through the whole year. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) will get his Bantu labour through the bureau. That is the basis of this principle, and we are utterly opposed to it on the grounds of basic morality and principle, quite apart from the deleterious effect it will have on our farming operations.</p>

<p>A personal attack has been made on me here in regard to my Bantu labourers. I have Bantu on my farm who grew up there, but there are some people in Natal who are &#x201C;Kaffir farmers&#x201D;. They just want to have cheap labour and do not want to allow those Bantu to live a decent life. That is where the Minister wants to intervene, to deal with these superfluous Bantu who cause so much trouble to the farmers in the vicinity. They slaughter the cattle and the sheep, and the Government now says that those superfluous Bantu must be employed properly. There are certain farmers who want to keep these Bantu there just to have cheap labour, and we feel that they are not being fair towards the Bantu. Hon. members opposite pretend that they are well disposed towards the Bantu and intimate that we are not, but they can come to my farm and see how I treat my labourers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) evidently does not know what this is about. He talks about people who farm with Kaffirs. Let me first of all tell the hon. member that there is no such thing as a &#x201C;Kaffir&#x201D;; he is a Bantu. The closest I can come to using that word is to call the hon. member &#x2019;n &#x201C;Kafferboetie&#x201D;. But what farmer is going to keep more labour on his farm than is necessary&#x003F; Only a person like the hon. member for Cradock, and I saw his farm last week. It is no use talking about exploiting Bantu labour. It is all rubbish. At present Bantu labour is allowed to move where it wants to go, and it is not controlled in any way, and if the farm tenant does not like the man with whom he lives he gives three months&#x2019; notice and moves immediately, leaving only one person in the service of that farmer, and he goes where he likes. So what is all this talk about cheap Native labour about&#x003F; The Minister was very <span class="col_3071-3072" refersTo="page_0228"/>quiet about this particular point that if one landowner puts in a request then an inspection must be made and an inquiry must be held.</p>

<p>That hon. member does not know what he is talking about. The position is that in terms of this clause farming can be made impossible. These are unnecessary restrictions on our farming community. Where there has been a good relationship between the farmer and the employee, and where in the past the employees had the greatest freedom of movement and could move from one farm to another if they did not like the farmer with whom they stayed, this will bring about exactly the opposite position. Now the poor labourer will have to stay with a farmer who is treating him badly. If he does not, he will be sent back to the Native reserves. Here the farmer is put at the mercy of people who do not look after their own farms and have nothing to do but to pry into the business of their neighbours, trying to find out whether they have not got one labourer too many. Then they go to lay complaints and call in the liaison officer, and I am most intrigued to know where the Minister is going to find all the liaison officers who will be necessary to run all these labour bureaux. Complete power is put into the hands of the Minister. He can terminate existing contracts and through the control board he can determine the number of labour tenants, and he can make it impossible for a farmer to remain on his land.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) tried to create the impression that the relation between the farmer and his employee is an ideal one here in South Africa and that there is no such thing as a man having too much labour or even having idle Bantu on his farm. [Interjection.] I want to tell the hon. member immediately that she need not think that if a farmer employs 12 Bantu there will be only 12 on his farm&#x2014;and then the rest are not even labour tenants. There may be quite a number of other Bantu also, and as the position is to-day nobody can do anything about it. They remain there as long as the farmers allow them to. That hon. member who now pretends to know everything in regard to Bantu workers is not the only one who has experience of it. There are many farmers on this side who also have experience. It is nonsensical for hon. members opposite to say that we are in favour of this clause because we cannot keep our workers, and therefore we want this control. [Interjections.] Allow me to complete my statement. What we need is control in these cases where there are abuses. I think we all agree about that.</p>

<p>Now I just want to say this for the information of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). He says that in Clause 22 we dealt fully with labour tenants. That is quite correct; we did deal with them. Therefore the Minister can now declare that there may no longer be any labour tenants in an area which has been declared to be free of them, but the hon. member should remember that it is a lengthy process, and we will still have labour tenants for many years. As I know the hon. member, he is also someone who wants to see the evil of labour tenants eliminated. But I do not wish to deal with that now. What I want to say is that with the labour tenant system which may still exist for many years and with a system where any person can freely employ labourers, it is unfortunately a fact that we must admit that cases do exist where labour is kept on farms which constitutes a nuisance and causes harm to neighbouring farmers, and I challenge any hon. member opposite to deny that he is aware of this sort of thing, because if he says he does not know about it I can only accept that he knows nothing about our whole system of labour in South Africa.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to something else. The hon. member for Drakensberg has said that people who want to prosecute others and to report that there is superfluous labour on a farm will cause the poor Bantu to be sent <span class="col_3073-3074" refersTo="page_0229"/>away to the Bantu areas. On the other hand, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) has just the opposite difficulty. He agrees with me that superfluous labour does exist, but his difficulty is that he does not know what is to become of it. He wants to have control, and I do not blame him because his experience is similar to ours, that control is indeed necessary. But his difficulty is that we will be landed with a lot of superfluous labour for whom there is no work and he does not know what will happen to them. But the hon. member for Drakensberg says they will all be sent back to Bantu areas. I think if the two of them discuss the matter with each other, they may be able to reach agreement as to whether there is a superfluity or a shortage of labour.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Drakensberg this. She objected to the hon. member for Cradock talking about &#x201C;Kaffir farmers&#x201D;. She said there was no such thing. I think she is quite correct. We have sot away from the stage of talking about &#x201C;Kaffirs&#x201D;, but I just want to say that if she objects to &#x201C;Kaffir farmers&#x201D; she should also stop her stories about &#x201C;Kafferboeties&#x201D; which she so dearly likes to tell on the platteland. I just want to say that the S.A. Agricultural Union did not ask that the system of labour tenants should eventually disappear completely without having good reason for doing so.</p>

<p>Because it is a gradual process.

The S.A. Agricultural Union is just as aware as we on this side of the House, who have no political motives, that there should be control in certain respects, and not only control by the Department of Bantu Administration, but control by farmers in the area who know the conditions in that area and who know how much labour is required, and who will not set to work recklessly to deprive people of their labour.</p>

Now, that has been in force for many years. Is it still necessary to have it&#x003F; How does the country stand to-day after the many years this has been in operation&#x003F; Is not every registered squatter already paying a licence fee of R32&#x003F; If that is to continue, I want to ask the Minister whether he now intends to include the Government itself in regard to the Bantu on the Government-controlled properties&#x003F; We have the Forest Department, which is a major offender in this respect, in that they employ <i>bona fide</i> labour but also allow hundreds and hundreds of squatters to live on their land. Then there is also State-owned land controlled by the divisional <span class="col_3075-3076" refersTo="page_0230"/>councils. I think the Minister must know that many of the divisional councils have allowed up to 400 or 450 squatters to live on that land. What does he intend to do about it&#x003F; Will those Bantu be registered as squatters&#x003F; Will the Government undertake the responsibility either of removing them or else registering them&#x003F; Another important factor is that you have mission lands sandwiched in between farmers who are carrying on <i>bona fide</i> farming operations. That has become what you might call squatter country. These lands were originally designed for the building of a church, etc., and particularly in the border area there are as many as 200 of these illegal squatters on such land, and I want to ask the Minister what he intends doing about them.</p>

<p>I particularly want to know what the Minister is going to do in regard to land controlled by the divisional councils, the Railways and the Forestry Department, who at present are accommodating literally thousands of squatters.

<p>The position in connection with re-registration according to the tariffs laid down in this Bill is that it is not necessary to start with it afresh; this is an existing system which is being proceeded with while there are still squatters. The position is not that all those who are already registered will have to register again. But once the period of registration expires, then a new registration has to be applied for. The hon. member must remember that the table which is given here is not something new that we are introducing; it is simply a continuation of the existing position.</p>

<p>The hon. member has also asked me to what extent these provisions in connection with squatters and their control are applicable to State-owned land. They are applicable to divisional council land but not to State-owned land.

<p>We have a considerable amount of difficulty with this clause. Here we find that in sub-section (1) of the new Section 35 provision is made for the Bantu Affairs Commissioner, or the chairman of the labour tenants control board, or the Bantu labour control board, or the chairman of the divisional council, to do certain things. Here it is perfectly clear that we have the four authorities who are either constituted as control boards, or in the Cape of Good Hope they are divisional councils, or in their absence a Bantu Affairs Commissioner. Under this section therefore I think it is fair to say that control in respect of the matters referred to in this section is over the whole of the Republic outside of prescribed areas. Outside of prescribed areas, on the passing of this Bill, this clause becomes absolute in its control in respect of the matters provided for here. The hon. the Deputy Minister has told us that it is his intention to establish Bantu labour control boards in certain areas where to-day you only have Bantu Affairs Commissioners, but that is progressive and it is not what is before us at the moment. What is here then is this complete coverage, and notwithstanding the powers of these four authorities&#x2014;I will refer to them as the &#x201C;four authorities&#x201D;&#x2014;to have an investigation entirely on their own responsibility, acting on information which has come to them from whatever source it may be, or as the result of information conveyed to them under the clause which we passed a few moments ago, Clause 25, where the matter can be reported by one owner of any land or by a labour liaison officer&#x2014;in spite of all that, in this particular clause the Minister now takes the authority to give instructions to one or other of these four authorities and thereupon they shall require an owner or any person in the service or acting for the owner to render such a return and to give particulars and so forth, and then in fact virtually an investigation takes place. Again we say that if the power has been conferred upon the four authorities concerned to exercise their own discretion in holding an investigation and to call for this information, which I think is more or less what can already be called for under the existing law, and if upon a complaint being made to them they can hold an investigation, then, Sir, why does the Minister find it necessary to come and superimpose his power of direction in respect of this particular matter&#x003F; From whence does he get his information&#x003F; Here you have farmers living happily together; nobody is quarreling about his labour supply; the whole scene is quite happy, everybody is contented; now a liaison officer appointed in terms of this Act comes along and makes a report to one of the authorities to say that there is surplus labour anywhere, and into that happy scene the Minister now comes and he says to the authority controlling the position in that particular area, &#x201C;You must now hold an inquiry; I direct you to do it&#x201D;, and then forthwith they have to do it whether they like it or not. Sir, we would like the Deputy Minister to tell us why he seeks that particular authority. Why does he not leave it to these particular people. What becomes of the whole of the story and the argument that we have been hearing in discussing the preceding clause that these are farmers themselves who will know what the position is; that they are not going to act unreasonably&#x003F; What happens to that argument now&#x003F; The whole of that argument that we have heard up to now simply falls to the <span class="col_3077-3078" refersTo="page_0231"/>ground shattered in pieces, because whatever the farmers think of each other and whether they are satisfied or not, the Minister can now direct that board or Bantu Affairs Commissioner to hold an inquiry.</p>

<p>The Bantu labour control board and the labour tenants control board are constituted of three farmers with the Bantu Affairs Commissioner as chairman. But under this clause they are entirely bereft of their powers to take the initial steps in regard to investigating the labour supply on any particular farm.</p>

<p>But they must investigate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>They have the power to investigate, and in the preceding clause they are given that authority and they are told what they can do. But here they have to do what the Minister tells them, even if they are satisfied in their own minds that it is not necessary. It does not matter how satisfied they are. That is why I say that the argument of hon. members opposite simply falls to the ground, because the whole concept of farmers knowing what their brother farmers will require in the way of labour and that sort of thing goes by the board because the Minister can now take arbitrary action without reference to anybody.</p>

<p>In addition to this there is the point that I should like to put to the Minister for information. In sub-section (2) reference is made again to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner the chairman of the labour tenants or Bantu control board or the chairman of the divisional council in the Cape, as the case may be. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will tell us whether it is his intention that the chairmen of the divisional councils in the Cape shall gradually fall away. We are finding it a little difficult, as we go forward clause by clause with this Bill, to find any position ultimately preserved in the Cape for the chairman of the divisional council, and if the Minister has in mind that the chairman of the divisional council shall finally drop out, then we would like to know that because it must naturally, to some extent, qualify what we have to say hereafter. Because as the thing stands at present there are only divisional councils in the Cape, and it is specially provided here that in the Cape it shall be the chairmen of the divisional councils who shall have the powers to call for certain returns and to carry out certain investigations.</p>

<p>I would also like some information in regard to a provision which I know is in the existing law, but it seems to have been brought in here in a manner which perhaps calls for some explanation. In sub-section (4) (page 43), an owner or agent appears before one or other of these authorities; an oath or affirmation can be administered to him and he can be questioned in regard to any Bantu residing on or using his land or any matter relating to such residence or use, and it says that the Bantu Affairs Commissioner or chairman of those other bodies may consult any member of the S.A. Police or any officer in the Public Service. The picture presented here is that the farmer can be put on oath to give his evidence; the chairman of the board and, in the Cape, the chairman of the divisional council, or the Bantu Affairs Commissioner where there is none of the other three bodies, having put the farmer on oath, can consult any member of the S.A. Police or any officer in the Public Service. What form does the consultation take&#x003F; We must bear in mind that this investigation may have been initiated by the Minister, not by the authority concerned, not by the control board but by the Minister. Sir, I say with the greatest sense of responsibility that we must realize that where you are dealing with Bantu Affairs Commissioners in this Bill you are dealing with people who are civil servants; they are not in the true sense of the word people who are there objectively as judicial officers; they are servants of the Department. They are State servants carrying out a policy of the State, and the situation which is developing under these particular circumstances is that the Minister can say to a Bantu Affairs Commissioner, &#x201C;I now direct you to carry out an investigation into the labour of such and such a farmer&#x201D;. When the Bantu Affairs Commissioner institutes an inquiry of this sort and he puts the farmer on oath, he is not just a judicial officer. I repeat: He is simply a civil servant in the employ of the Department of Bantu Administration. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>I was told what had been said here. The hon. member for Natal South Coast now comes along and does the same sort of thing in connection with this clause. He wants to suggest that everything in the garden is fine and lovely as far as the squatter and the White landowner are concerned. The hon. member knows as well as I do that that is simply not true, hence this provision in the Bill. The attitude of the Opposition in connection with this matter is completely beyond my comprehension. I simply cannot understand what impression hon. members opposite seek to create, and I cannot <span class="col_3079-3080" refersTo="page_0232"/>understand why they wish to do so. The hon. member, as a farmer in Natal, is just as aware as I am of the fact that we do find cases on our farms where steps will have to be taken under this measure if we wish to rectify the position in the agricultural industry. The position to-day is that the agricultural unions of all four provinces are begging the authorities to do away with certain old arrangements which existed between the labourer and the landowner. All those who have anything to do with this matter, including those hon. members who represent Natal, are familiar with the evils of that system, and yet they come along this afternoon and tell us that everything in the garden is fine and lovely and that the Minister wants to throw a spanner in the works. That is simply not correct. Sir, I am going to repeat the same words which I used the other day and which the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) wanted to twist; I repeat that a serious attempt is being made in this Bill&#x2014;and this is something which we as agriculturists ought to welcome &#x2014;to place the relationship between the Bantu employee and the White farm owner on a sound footing. We find that on one farm there is practically a location; the farmer has more labour than he can use; and what happens next door to the farmer who has no labour&#x003F; I ask the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes): What happens to that farmer&#x003F; Everything that he possesses is stolen from him. Is the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) not aware of that&#x003F; No, these are facts which cannot be argued away. What little the one farmer has is still taken away from him. It is for this reason that the plea is constantly put forward at every agricultural union congress that there should be a bigger buffer strip between the Native Trust areas and the farms owned by Whites. One simply cannot farm where this state of affairs prevails. Here a serious attempt is being made now to rectify the position, and it looks as though the hon. member is going out of his way to find arguments that he can advance against this clause. I simply cannot understand why we should quarrel about a measure which is in the interests of every White farmer. Mr. Chairman, I want to say something now to the lawyers on the other side. I am quite prepared to sit and listen while they unravel the intricacies of an Act and while they split hairs, but when we come to legislation which affects me as a farmer they ought to have a little respect for my opinion and they must not come here and try to twist words which I never used. We gain nothing by it; all we do is to create the wrong impression outside.</p>

<p>With regard to what I said the other day, the hon. member cannot complain that I twisted his words because the hon. the Deputy Minister in charge of this Bill agreed when I differed from the hon. member who has just spoken.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) dealt again with squatters and the gratifying results which, as he saw it, would flow from this clause. Sir, cannot one make it sufficiently clear that Section 33 of the existing Trust Act deals with squatters and gives powers of investigation and inquiry; it gives full powers of investigation so far as squatters are concerned; so let us leave aside squatters for the moment. Clause 25 of this Bill gives full powers of investigation and inquiry to labour control boards and labour tenant control boards. Why then is it necessary, as the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has said, again in Clause 29 to give a Bantu Affairs Commissioner or the chairman of a control board or the chairman of the divisional council, on the instructions of the Minister, powers to make yet further investigations&#x003F; You already have three separate authorities&#x2014;in the case of squatters, the Bantu Affairs Commissioner himself, on the instructions of the Minister. You have three sets of authorities each with powers of investigation, inquiry and the questioning of the owner or the agent of the owner of land. Why in those circumstances must such a power be given in addition in Clause 29 so far as the rendering of returns is concerned&#x003F; There is power under the existing Section 35 of the Trust Act, which we now seek to amend in this clause, to require the rendering of returns, but there is no power under the existing law for further inquiry and investigation so far as labour employed by a farmer is concerned, and I have yet to hear an explanation why it is necessary on four separate occasions&#x2014;this is the fourth&#x2014;for that power to be taken by the officials concerned, but, more importantly why it should be taken by those officials on instructions from the Minister. As I say, on the case put up by the Government so far these powers seem to be quite redundant to the powers already provided for in the existing law and already taken in terms of Clause 25. I hope that before this clause is finally passed we will get an explanation why it is necessary additionally and again to provide for powers of investigation which so far, on the arguments we have had, seem to be quite redundant.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to reply to the first few points made by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). He wants to know why provision has to be made for these returns in the Bill. I must point out to the <span class="col_3081-3082" refersTo="page_0233"/>hon. member that what we have in this clause is a combination and a limited extension of provisions which are contained already in two existing pieces of legislation. Section 35 of the Trust Act of 1936 contains provisions which are practically the same as the provision to which the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) has just referred. It is already provided in Section 35 of the Trust Act that as often as he may from time to time deem it necessary the Bantu Affairs Commissioner may, and upon instructions from the Minister shall, require any owner to transmit to him within a period specified a return showing (a) the names, (b) the particulars of the licence, etc. That is already provided for in the Trust Act. With that provision we are now combining other provisions which are contained in Section 8 of the Service Contract Act, Act 24 of 1932, an Act which Clause 14 of this Bill repealed. The existing provisions in those two Acts, one of which is being repealed, are therefore being combined here and the necessary adjustments are being made to conform with present-day practice. I think that is a full reply to the hon. member for South Coast and at the same time also to the hon. member for Zululand. But I am still dealing with the hon. member for South Coast who wants to know why reference is again made here to the chairman of the divisional council. This is the same old argument which was advanced here a few days ago. The hon. member knows perfectly well that reference is made in this provision to labour tenant control boards and to Bantu labour control boards. The clause provides who is entitled to call for these returns. The hon. member knows that the work of the labour tenant control board is done in the Cape by the divisional councils, and that is why the divisional councils are mentioned here.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>No. We said so the other day. The labour tenant system is to disappear gradually, and in the Cape therefore the work which is being done by the divisional council under the labour tenant system must also disappear and labour control boards are to be instituted. That will take place in all the various provinces. Since the labour tenant system is to disappear the time must come when the divisional councils in the Cape will no longer do the work they are doing to-day under the labour tenant system because the system will have disappeared. That is perfectly clear.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to this question of consultation by the official concerned with an officer in the Public Service or with a member of the S.A. Police. Here again this is a provision which is already contained in the Act of 1932 to which I referred a moment ago and which is being repealed.</p>

<p>This is an existing provision; what is wrong with it&#x003F; The hon. member and I are not lawyers, but he ought to be able to understand that easily if I tell him that this is a compromise; it is on a par with the system of appointing assessors. When an inquiry is instituted, the public servant dealing with the matter, without having to put an assessor on the bench, will now be able to consult another officer in the Public Service. He may require certain details; why should he not have the power to ask an officer of the Public Service or a police official for those details&#x003F; There are no sinister motives behind this provision. The hon. member has gone out of his way really to try to find sinister motives here. Having said this, I think I have also replied to the hon. member for Zululand.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not explained this clause. The point which the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) put to him was that here the chairman of the labour bureau or the chairman of the labour tenants control board or the Bantu Affairs Commissioner has the right to call for certain things. He has the right to call for certain returns, for the names of Bantu residing on such land and for other information. Then the clause goes on to say that if in his opinion the information obtained is insufficient or unsatisfactory, he may direct such owner or agent by a notice in writing under his hand to appear before such Bantu Affairs Commissioner or chairman at a place and on a date and hour stated in such notice. It then goes on to say that such Bantu Affairs Commissioner or chairman may administer an oath or an affirmation. He may then question the owner or agent and he may also call in the police to give certain information. Then, when he has done all these things and is satisfied that the returns furnished to him are not correct or that the information furnished to him is insufficient or unsatisfactory, then the farmer or person giving those returns or making those statements shall be guilty of an offence. Sir, I do not know what on earth the hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) was talking about. The speech which he made on this clause is one which he should have made at the second reading in dealing with the principle of the Bill. This has nothing to do with the question as to whether there should be labour tenants or not. because this clause deals with the specific things which I have mentioned here. Our point is that the Bantu Affairs Commissioner or the chairman concerned is not a legal person. He is a civil servant and yet he is going to be called upon to sit as though he constitutes a court. He will be able to act as a magistrate or as a Judge and he will be able to find that particular person guilty of an offence. That is our point.</p>

<p>Read the clause. A Bantu Affairs Commissioner or the chairman of the body concerned may administer an oath to the person appearing before him, and after having done that he may consult with a police officer. In other words, he is acting as a magistrate in this case. Let me tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that this clause provides nowhere that the matter shall then go to a properly constituted court and heard by a person with legal training. Here a civil servant is going to decide that an offence has been committed, and he will find the person who in his opinion furnished insufficient or unsatisfactory information guilty of an offence. Our whole argument is that this clause places bureaucratic powers into the hands of ordinary people who have not been trained for this work. Sir, I come back to what I have said before: We will find that our farmers are hedged in; that their lives are going to be regimented by people appointed by the Minister and who have not been trained properly for the job.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has repeatedly given us the assurance that the divisional councils in the Cape function only on behalf of the labour tenant control boards and not on behalf of the Bantu labour control boards. He threw up his hands in despair a moment ago as though it was simply impossible for him to explain the position to us, but I shall be glad if he will explain it to us once again. Until such time as Bantu labour control boards are instituted in the Cape will there be no control over Bantu labour, whether it is squatter labour or ordinary hired labour&#x003F; There is simply going to be no control, or is control going to be exercised by the divisional councils&#x003F; If the chairman of the divisional council is not going to exercise control, as provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 35 (1), who is going to carry out that function while there are no labour tenant control boards and no Bantu labour control boards&#x003F; We have repeatedly made the statement here that in areas where there are smallholdings and congregations of labourers, there must be control of that labour. If in a particular area there is neither a labour tenant control board nor a Bantu labour control board, is the chairman of the divisional council then going to function or is he not going to function&#x003F; If he is not going to function and no Bantu labour control board has been established yet, who is going to function, or will there be no control at all over those Bantu&#x003F; I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will go into this point once again so that we can have clarity once and for all on this question as to whether the chairman of the divisional council is going to function, either voluntarily or on the instructions of the Minister, until such time as a Bantu labour control board has been established.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows me well enough not to resent the remark which I am about to make, and I do so in pursuance of a remark which the hon. member himself made on one occasion when he said that he was going to lift the lid off the pot. The hon. member asks me to lift the lid off the pot but he himself must lift the lid off his pot so that I can understand him better. That is the trouble. It is not only a question of lifting the lid off the pot when it comes to replying to questions; it is also a question of lifting the lid off the pot when questions are put to me so that I can understand those questions. We have already disposed of the clause dealing with the establishment of labour tenant control boards and labour control boards. The hon. member will see that in terms of that clause a discretionary power is given to the Minister to establish these bodies where it is deemed desirable to do so. It is possible that in the Cape Province, where in any event there are far fewer labour tenants and where much less labour tenant control work has to be done by the divisional councils, the Minister may be able to establish labour control boards very much sooner than in other areas. It depends on whether it is desirable to establish them. The hon. member need not be afraid of the interim period. It is for the Minister to decide whether those bodies should be established on the ground that there is still work, formerly done by the old type of body, for the labour tenant control board to undertake. In the Cape that work is done by the divisional councils instead of by labour tenant control boards. When there is no longer such work, if there is only work for a labour control board, then the latter body will be established, and in the Cape it cannot be the divisional council; it will be a new body as we have already explained.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, by virtue of Section 35, as it will be, an owner is obliged to furnish a return of all Bantu residing on his land. That form will be one of the pieces of information used in deciding whether there is too much labour on a particular farmer&#x2019;s land. The result of that may be an inquiry, and the farmer concerned can be required to send some of his labour away. In view of the fact that a farmer can be, as it were, investigated as far as his labour is concerned, I shall be very glad to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister whether in fact it is intended to consult the farmer before labour is taken from the towns and from other parts and placed upon his farm. There are various provisions in this Bill which make it possible for various officers to return a labourer to what is often called his &#x201C;home&#x201D;. For example in Clause 12 we find that provision. There are several similar clauses. Perhaps I should rather refer to Clause 9 on page 17 where under (g) there will be power under the regulations for the &#x201C;treatment and disposal or return to their homes or to a scheduled Native area or released area &#x2026;&#x201D; So sub-section (g), amongst others, makes it possible for labourers from the towns <span class="col_3085-3086" refersTo="page_0235"/>to be sent to what are called their &#x201C;homes&#x201D;. Very often those people originated on a farm and because there was surplus labour there they found their way to the towns. They can now apparently be sent back to those farms. My question to the hon. the Deputy Minister is this: Will the farmers concerned be consulted before these people are returned to their farms&#x003F; Will they be consulted by the labour bureau concerned before they are sent back&#x003F;</p>

<p>I think this is a most important point because at the present time farmers are finding that people are being sent to them from other places, notably from the towns, and are creating a considerable problem. The farmer has an increasing interest in the position now because he can be brought before various inquiries to inquire whether he has surplus labour on his farm. I trust the hon. the Deputy Minister will enlighten us in that regard.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It is really shocking to think that the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) can come here with the suggestion that this clause has something to do with the possibility of sending Bantu out of the urban areas to a farm and that he should base that suggestion on his mistaken notion that somewhere in this legislation there is a provision in terms of which a Bantu can be sent out of the urban areas to privately owned farms in the Republic. Not even the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) talked such nonsense here this afternoon.</p>

<p>I should like to try to reply to the points of substance which were made here this afternoon, and in doing so I shall have to repeat, to a certain extent, what the hon. the Deputy Minister said. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has made the statement here that adequate provision is made under Sections 33 and 39 of the Native Trust and Land Act to initiate an investigation into the number of Bantu on a particular farm. He wants to know why additional power is being given to the Minister here. There are two reasons for that. The powers to initiate investigations under Sections 33 and 39 are practically confined to investigations on the merits, to investigations which are initiated to determine how many Bantu there are; whether the number is adequate or whether the number is excessive, having regard to the labour requirements of the farmer concerned. The investigation under this clause is merely an investigation for the purpose of obtaining statistical data. This is not an investigation on the merits; it does not form part of the machinery to decide whether a certain number of Bantu should be allowed on the piece of land in question. The second reason why this power is being given to the Minister is that the Minister may wish to obtain statistics with a view to planning on a larger scale; it is not simply a repetition of the old power which existed under the United Party Government, a power which was given to the Minister in the 1936 Act, and in the 1932 Act to the magistrates as officials of the Minister. We may find that some hon. member opposite may come along to the Minister and complain that this measure is not being applied strictly in his district, that there are excessive numbers of Bantu in his district (which the hon. member for Pinelands says is the position in certain places) and that they are causing difficulties there. This machinery will then be available to the Minister to cause an inquiry to be instituted and to obtain information.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast then went on to take exception to the provision that there may be consultation with a member of the S.A. Police. May I just quote to him the wording of the relevant provision in the 1932 Act. The words are precisely the same&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When such owner or agent appears before the magistrate in compliance with a notice issued under sub-section so-and-so, the magistrate may question him in regard to any Native residing on or using land owned or occupied by him or his principal or on any matter relating to such residence or use and in doing so the magistrate may consult any member of the Police Force or any officer in the public service.</block>

<p>The wording is precisely the same.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg tried to build up a certain point here. Sir, she misinterpreted the position. She says that an offence is being created here; that a person who fails to react in the right way has to appear before an official who is not a judicial officer. The fact that he is not a judicial officer makes no difference at all. The offence is created under sub-section (5); it is an offence if the person refuses to furnish a written return, if he refuses to heed the notice to appear and, if he does appear, refuses to reply to the questions put to him. Surely the fact that he refuses or neglects to do a particular thing has nothing to do with the judicial character of the officer. If the person concerned neglects to do what is required of him, then some other judicial officer will hold a judicial inquiry on some other occasion to ascertain whether an offence has been committed and whether the person concerned in fact neglected to do what the Act prescribes. The offences which are created here can reasonably be compared with the various offences which are created under our census legislation. Under the Census Act it is an offence to refuse or to fail to notify the authorities how many people slept on your premises during the night in question. Then again, under our agricultural census legislation it is an offence to refuse to say how many head of cattle you have on your farm. That return is rendered to a non-judicial enumerator. Surely that has nothing to do with the matter. I want to make an appeal to hon. members either to remain silent or to talk about this clause; I should prefer them, however, to remain silent.</p>

<p>What I have to say really, to a certain extent, follows on what the hon. the Deputy Minister has just moved. One notices at page 47, Section 38<i>quat</i> (2) that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A labour liaison officer shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as may be prescribed.</block>

<p>I want to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister what sort of powers, functions and duties it is intended to prescribe for these labour liaison officers or farm inspectors, as they are referred to in the White Paper&#x003F; I ask that, Sir, because in the Bill which appeared last year the powers, functions and duties of these inspectors were set out in the text at page 52. In order to give the House an idea of what was then contemplated I shall read what those powers and functions and duties were. First of all, an inspector could &#x201C;enter upon land and make such investigations and inquiries as he may deem necessary&#x201D;. That is, he could enter upon land at all reasonable times. I may say that the consent of the owner to such inspection was not necessary. The inspector could &#x201C;make extracts from and examine the books, records and documents found by him or require persons who had custody of the books or documents or records to make available&#x201D; such books or to seize any such book or record as evidence of the commission of an offence. The inspector could question either alone or in the presence of another person, as he thought fit, any person found on the land, which would include the owner himself or his servant or his agent or a member of his family and he could require any person whom he had reasonable ground to believe could give information in regard to the suspected commission of an offence under the chapter to appear before him and answer questions in that regard. Those were far-reaching powers to be given to an official in respect of any land to which this clause of that Bill applies. One wonders why those powers have been omitted from the present Bill and why the powers to be conferred upon these officials should merely be set out in regulations which are to follow hereafter&#x003F; The powers given in the Bill last year were in every way distasteful and repugnant. I shall be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister will give the House an indication as to what powers it is proposed to set out by way of regulations in terms of sub-section (2) of the clause we are discussing at the moment.</p>

<p>I refer to 38<i>quin</i> on page 47 of the Bill. Why does it say &#x201C;&#x2026; or direct that no further Bantu be accommodated &#x2026;&#x201D;&#x003F; I think the words &#x201C;no further&#x201D; require some clarification. One realizes that the tenor of this whole Bill establishes that the term &#x201C;further Bantu&#x201D; represent, in the mind of the Government, the ideal Bantu, the &#x201C;further Bantu&#x201D;,&#x2014; in fact, the further the better! But one does want to know what happens after a certain situation has arisen, when the Minister, having had reason to believe that any farm or portion thereof is used extensively or primarily for the accommodation of Bantu and not for <i>bona fide</i> farming operations, may by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> etc. direct such owner to reduce within a stated period etc. That, of course, means that the order may be to reduce the number to zero&#x2014;in other words, that all the Bantu must be done away with. This is born out by the description of this clause in the margin: &#x201C;Abolition of labour farms&#x201D;. Further down it reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the number of Bantu accommodated or housed on such farm to a number determined by the labour tenants or Bantu labour control board or direct that no further Bantu be accommodated &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>What I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister is this, Sir: At this stage, after consideration, say, by the board, can the determination be that not a single Bantu can be accommodated <span class="col_3089-3090" refersTo="page_0237"/>on that particular farm, regardless of the question of the so-called superfluity of the Bantu on that farm&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) and I are always having words because he does not read things correctly. I am not going to give judgment on that, Sir. The hon. member should read what 38<i>quin</i> says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wherever the Minister has reason to believe that any farm or any portion thereof is used exclusively or primarily for the accommodation or housing of Bantu and not for <i>bona fide</i> farming operations &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is very clear that that clause has been inserted with the object that it should refer to what are called labour farms, labour farms which are kept by people and on which a number of Bantu live, not to work on those farms but who are kept there to form a pool; Bantu who go and work elsewhere. It relates to that position. In other words the objective of Section 38<i>quin</i> is, as time goes on, to put an end to this type of labour farm. I hope its objective is now clear to the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands is unfortunately not here but I shall nevertheless reply to his question. He referred to the appointment of the labour liaison officers. I can assure him that we do not intend appointing all sorts of evil inquisitors. The labour liaison officers will, as the clause clearly indicates, be appointed in general terms to supervise, give advice and to tackle undertakings in connection with the application of Chapter IV as it is generally called, that is to say, the labour control board system as is now provided for here. As the name clearly implies he will be a liaison officer. He has to serve as a link between the employer and the Department as controlling authority, and I want to go so far as to say, also between us and the Bantu as employee. Certain procedures will be laid down according to which that officer will have to work. We shall draw up those regulations with due consideration to the powers which the regulations give us. We shall not prescribe just any procedure for him to follow. We have to frame them within the provisions of these regulations. If at all possible, I should also like to give hon. members the assurance that those officers will have to perform their tasks with the intention of eliminating those things which may perhaps cause difficulty to both the farmers and the employees.</p>

<p>This is another example of the placing of enormous powers in the hands of the Minister, powers which are subject to no control. The Minister is given the power not even to give the owner of the farm an opportunity of making representations to show that the Minister&#x2019;s belief in regard to the matter is incorrect. Without the owner having been drawn into it, if the Minister has reason to believe, he can make a determination in terms of this clause. Sir, this is a type of legislation which, I believe, is becoming all too common in this country. I believe we should not lightly place provisions of this nature on our Statute Book.

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has not answered the question put by the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel). The provision under Section 38<i>quin</i> provides for two alternatives. The Minister may direct the owner to reduce the number. That is quite clear. On the assumption that there are 40 Bantu living on the farm the Minister can order the number to be reduced to 20 or 10 or five. If he reduces the number to five then the position is clear. But the other alternative is to direct that no further Bantu &#x2026; Now, if the word &#x201C;further&#x201D; were removed I would understand it. Because he would then direct that no Bantu be kept, not even the five. But when the word &#x201C;further&#x201D; appears in the English text and the word &#x201C;verdere&#x201D; in the Afrikaans text, I fail to see what it means.

Does that mean that the 40 can remain, but that there can be no increase in that number&#x003F; This is the point. What does this mean&#x2014;&#x201C;direct that no further Bantu be accommodated or housed on such farm&#x201D;&#x003F; Does it means that no Bantu whatsoever may be accommodated on that farm&#x003F; While I thank the hon.

The order the Minister will issue will depend on circumstances. If the Minister thinks there is reason that it should be done gradually he may perhaps say to him: &#x201C;You have many Bantu here, reduce the number to so many.&#x201D; If the Minister is of the opinion there is no valid reason for that he may say to him: &#x201C;Reduce the number to zero.&#x201D; If the Minister, in his most merciful frame of mind, thinks the number he has at the moment is justified, he can say to him: &#x201C;Very well, retain those you have at the moment, but you may not add to their numbers.&#x201D; In other words, you start from the very top and you go down to zero.

<p>The hon. Minister gives us the assurance that he will not appoint a Bantu as labour liaison officer, but as the law stands he could do so. The law has been altered. I want to suggest to the Minister that he alters it again to make that quite clear, because as the matter stands there is no argument about it. The reference to the Public Service is merely another way of saying that the person concerned shall occupy a classified post in the Civil Service, and there are such Bantu, as I understand the position, quite a number of them, and there is nothing whatever to prevent the Minister from appointing a Bantu as a labour liaison officer. If the hon. Minister will go back to Clause 35 in line 48, he will find that a person can raise this matter in writing&#x2014;here it was a case of a labour liaison officer reporting to the labour tenants control board or to a Bantu labour control board that in his opinion there was surplus labour on a certain farm, etc. At that time I raised the point, but it was not replied to and the clause we are dealing with now is the one that specifically provides the authority for the appointment of these officers. I therefore would like to ask the hon. the Minister to make it abundantly clear that he does not intend to appoint Bantu to this particular post, so that we have got it on the record that that is the position. The law as it stands leaves it open.</p>

It is not a question of an existing post that can be filled. There are no such posts for Bantu or for Europeans at the present moment, and it is definitely not the intention to appoint Bantu in these posts. One practical reason for that the hon. member will find in this very same clause. The hon. member will see that it says in subsection (b)&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has once again given us the assurance that this Section 38<i>quin</i> relates to labour farms. Although we should like to accept that, we must take it that the hon. the Deputy Minister will certainly not always be there to carry out the law. Nowhere is it stated that it relates to labour farms. On the contrary it states &#x201C;a farm or a portion of a farm used exclusively or primarily for the accommodation or housing of Bantu&#x201D;. Say 20 morgen are set aside to-morrow for a labour camp, primarily or exclusively for the housing of Bantu. An official then gets the idea, or it is reported by a friendly or unfriendly fellow-farmer of the owner of that land, that there are too many labourers on that portion of the farmer&#x2019;s farm, whether it is 10 morgen or 20 morgen which have been set aside mainly for the housing of Bantu. A report is sent in that in the opinion of somebody or in the opinion of the farmers&#x2019; association there are too many Bantu on that piece of land. It can then be ordered that the number of labourers should be reduced or reduced to zero. If the hon. the Minister, through his legal draftsmen, wants to pass a law to relate to labour farms he should instruct them to draft it more clearly.</p>

<p>The hon. member, because he talked about a portion of a farmer&#x2019;s farm. This only refers to portions of the farm which have been set aside. For the hon. member&#x2019;s information I just want to give him a few figures so that he will realize the scope of the evil we are faced with. I want to mention one district in Natal where there are 164 owners and the district consists of an area of 180,000 acres. According to the evidence there are only seven owners or managers on those farms&#x2014;seven out of the 164. In the case of 157 the owners live elsewhere. I want to give the following further data: Thirteen of those farms are 3,000 or more acres in size. They are economic units; 23 are between 2,000 and 3,000 acres and they are quast-economic units; 53 farms are between 1,000 and 2,000 acres and I shall call them doubtful economic units; then there are 34 between 500 and 1,000 acres and the balance are under 500 acres and uneconomic. But all of them are occupied by Bantu, not to work there, because those 157 farms are lying there. Not one of them is being farmed by a White farmer. Only Bantu live there and they go from there to work elsewhere. That is the evil we are faced with there. To maintain that the smaller portions of 200 and 300 acres are farms would make the position quite untenable. Then somebody may say: &#x201C;I only have a portion of a farm and this does not apply to me.&#x201D; That is why specific reference is made to &#x201C;portions of farms&#x201D;, because farms have been sub-divided with the specific object of placing a number of Natives there to serve as a source of labour. That was the only reason why the land was sub-divided, not to farm, because they are all uneconomic units; it was specifically sub-divided to place a number of Bantu on them to form a source of labour. I cannot understand why the hon. member objects to this.</p>

<p>I also want to reply to the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel). The hon. member is very worried about the word &#x201C;further&#x201D;. The clause refers to a labour pool and if a farm is used for that purpose, it is provided that &#x201C;there will be no further Bantu&#x201D;. But if the farmer says: &#x201C;No, I am now going to use the labour farm for <i>bona fide</i> farming operations,&#x201D; he may be told that five or ten of the number of Bantu who had formed the labour reservoir can remain on the farm after the labour board has decided how many he will require for his actual <i>bona fide</i> farming operations on the farm.</p>

<p>I still want to deal with the other objections raised by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) who said that we were again taking certain powers under the proposed regulations with the result that the Minister would have greater and greater power. I want to emphasize that the power to make regulations is always subject to the approval of this House. All the regulations are Tabled and studied by the select committee and the report of the select committee is submitted to this House and if the Minister has taken certain powers this House can discuss them in detail. He is limited to act within the framework of the law and the powers which the law confers upon him and if he acts beyond those the courts may rule that he has acted <i>ultra vires</i> and if he has acted <i>ultra vires</i> hon. <span class="col_3095-3096" refersTo="page_0240"/>members discuss them in this House after they have been Tabled and check to see whether the regulations were lawful or not.</p>

<p>I want to move for a moment to another point and that is in connection with sub-paragraph (b) of 38-<i>quat.</i> It provides that members of a labour tenants or Bantu labour control board shall so long as they hold office as such be deemed to have been appointed as labour liaison officers for the purposes of this Chapter. That is quite clear and I take it that it incorporates in the Cape the divisional councils, because for all the purposes of a labour tenants control board, a divisional council is deemed to be the same. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting when you go back to Clause 25 to find that one of the two people named who may make a complaint regarding surplus labour on a farm is &#x201C;an owner of land in such area, or a labour liaison officer appointed under 38<i>quat&#x201D;.</i> They can make a complaint to the Bantu labour control board or the labour tenant control board that there is surplus labour on a particular farm and then the machinery established for the purpose of holding an inquiry is set into motion. It is interesting to see what the White Paper has to say about this. It says this on page 13&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under this section inspectors of farms (to be known as labour liaison officers) may be appointed, whose duty it will be to ensure that the provisions of Chapter IV of Act No. 18 of 1936 and the determination by labour tenants and Bantu labour control boards are observed.</block>

<p>This man who is an official can report on surplus labour on a farm and start the machinery for an investigation, but he himself is a member of the Bantu labour control board or of the labour tenant control board as the case may be. So that you have the situation that a man who is a member of such a board acts as in plain language, a snooper for the board itself. When once he is satisfied that in a certain area there is surplus labour he makes an official report to a body of which he is himself a member. Or three members may do so, or even four, because there is a chairman and three farmer members, and this member here presumably is a farmer member, but it does not say so; it says &#x201C;a member of the control board&#x201D;, and that can be the chairman as well. All four of them are in the position to act as official informers with their powers and duties to be prescribed by regulation. The White Paper says what their duties are, namely, the carrying out of the determinations of their own board. Surely we cannot possibly agree to a provision like this where official informers, appointed as inspectors of farms are themselves sitting as members of the body to which they themselves report. Supposing that all four of them report in regard to a farm that there is surplus labour on that farm. Those reports come in and have to be dealt with by these four members of the Board. Sir, this is not a Jack Ruby trial; this is a case where there is no argument as to where the accused is going to stand; the moment he comes before that board to answer an inquiry in regard to the surplus labour on his farm, he is sunk really before he starts. What a curious provision for the Minister to actually put into his Bill that the people who are to act as official informers in regard to these matters and to start the machinery rolling which is to bring this man before the Board of which they are themselves members&#x2014;are the judges, and only in certain circumstances is there an appeal allowed to some other body outside of these people. I think it is a most extraordinary provision and we can never possibly agree to that kind of provision in our laws.</p>

<p>On Clause 33,</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This clause places an onus on an accused person to show that the land in question, whether the accused person is a landowner (that is to say a farmer) or a Bantu on the land, that the land is not subject to the provisions of Chapter IV of the Trust Act. Now Chapter IV is made applicable to land of this kind by a notice in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and I do not think that even the hon. Minister for Bantu Administration and Development will allege that in the remote parts of the country districts there is a wide sale of the <i>Government Gazette.</i> Why, Sir, when it is so easy for a government official, such as a prosecutor in a court of law, to have access to the <i>Government Gazette</i> and the Government records and to readily produce such a record to show that the land is subject to the provisions of Chapter IV of the Act, why in those circumstances put the onus of disproof on the accused person (that is to say, the farmer who may be charged under this Chapter for having Bantu wrongfully living on his land, or on the Bantu himself who may be charged with wrongfully living on that land), that Chapter IV of the Trust Act applies to that piece of land&#x003F; Nothing is more difficult for the ordinary man to do than that. The hon. member for Heilbron says that that is far-fetched. He is a lawyer, but why should such an onus be placed on an accused person in a court of law, who, if he cannot disprove that Chapter IV is applicable to that land, is subject to a fine or a term of imprisonment&#x003F; He may not have the advantage of the services of the hon. member for Heilbron to defend him. Why should that onus be placed on an accused person, whether he be a Bantu or a White land-owner&#x003F; Why should he be subject to that burden, when it is the easiest thing in the world for the prosecutor to get that information and to produce proof in court that the man is so subject to the provisions of Chapter IV&#x003F; Unless the hon. Deputy Minister can show that there is an insuperable difficulty in enabling a prosecutor to prove that point by the mere production of a <i>Gazette,</i> there is no reason why such a heavy onus should be put on an accused person.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down objects to the accused in this case having to prove that the land with which we are concerned here is land to which this Chapter applies. The position is not that he has to prove his guilt or his innocence but merely the fact, which now becomes a suspicion, and if he is charged and it has to do with this land, that it is land to which this Chapter applies. Which land is it&#x003F; It is stated in Clause 25. It is land situated in a separate Native area. I do not know whether the hon. member objects to it. &#x201C;Any land within a prescribed area, any land of which the Native Trust is the registered owner &#x2026;&#x201D; The hon. member now advances the peculiar argument that there are so few subscribers to the <i>Government Gazette</i> in those distant little towns. How are the poor people in those distant towns to know from the <i>Government Gazette</i> what laws this House has passed&#x003F; Although they are not subscribers they are supposed to know the law because it has been published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> Let me give an example. Some years ago we passed legislation in this House relating to the Bushmen in the North Western and North Eastern parts of South West Africa. According to the hon. member we should not place the onus on those Bushmen because they do not get the <i>Government Gazette</i> and they do not know what appears in it. That is the stupid kind of argument we get, Sir. I think it is far-reaching to say that because people do not get the <i>Government Gazette</i> the on us should not be on them to show that the land is not subject to the Act. Surely we have to show some common sense and not advance such stupid arguments.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron has complained about the charge made by the hon. member for Zululand and he calls it ridiculous, but I must admit that I have never heard a more ridiculous reply than that given by the hon. member for Heilbron, bringing the Bushmen into it. I certainly hope that before the Bushmen are prosecuted for any offence under the Act, the Department will hold meetings to explain to them what the offence is, and not rely on the Bushmen to read the <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>

<p>Sir, there is no reason why the State should not prove that a property falls under Chapter IV. As the hon. member for Zululand has said it is the easiest thing for the prosecutor to do. He must know whether an offence has been committed or not, and he can prove that the property falls under the Chapter. All he has to do is to produce the <i>Gazette.</i> How must the poor farmer prove that his farm does not fall under the operation of the law&#x003F; We are making it easier and easier in every law that we pass for the State to get a conviction and more and more the onus is being cast on the accused these days.

<p>Let me correct the hon. member for <span class="col_3099-3100" refersTo="page_0242"/>Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) on the question of the <i>Government Gazette</i> which can be submitted as evidence in a court. I am informed that there have been court cases where the <i>Government Gazette</i> has been used as evidence and where the court has refused to accept it. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) thinks I am saying something terrible but I am not to blame if the court refuses to accept that procedure and that it does not regard the <i>Government Gazette</i> in those cases as being conclusive evidence. Hon. members must realize what is at stake here. It is alleged that a certain piece of land is the land on which the offence has been committed. It must then be determined exactly whether that piece of land falls within or without the area defined in Clause 18. Who is the person who can produce the most conclusive proof in regard to the situation and the identity of that farm&#x003F; It is the person in whose name the deed of transfer is registered and who knows exactly where his farm is situated from beacon to beacon. If it is suspected that a certain piece of land belongs to a certain owner and that an offence has been committed the charge is made against him. That is far from finding him guilty. The complainant cannot prove exactly that that is the piece of land concerned and that it does indeed fall within the area defined in Chapter IV. In that case it is the simplest thing in the world for the person who has conclusive proof in his possession as to where that land is situated, namely the registered owner, to produce the proof that his farm lies outside the defined area in which case the charge falls away. By shifting the onus on the owner we are simplifying the procedure. If the onus rested on the complainant the case may drag on for years to the detriment of everybody concerned. I cannot understand how the hon. member can object to that. The principle that the onus should rest on the accused has recently been introduced in legislation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I really think it is a shocking state of affairs that hon. members can place that interpretation on these words. What is the position&#x003F; Let us start with subsection (2) which talks about &#x201C;any land in a scheduled Native area&#x201D;. The State has to prove that that particular farm falls within that particular area. How can it do so&#x003F; It can only do so by getting an official, the Surveyor-General or somebody else to identify that piece of land and to say that it falls within that area. It must particularly be proved that it is a scheduled area. The land has to be identified as being land referred to in the Act. Let us come to (b) &#x201C;and other land which the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> excludes from the operation of this Chapter&#x201D;. That piece of land has to be identified. You cannot simply hand in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and say it refers to that piece of land because it does not identify the land. It only proves that something has been announced in the <i>Government Gazette</i> but this particular land has to be identified as being land referred to in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> Hon. members now wish to saddle the State, in the case of a minor matter with the costs of getting an official from Pretoria or from Cape Town, where the Surveyor General has his offices, to prove where the farm is situated, while the farmer has all the knowledge. He knows he is the registered owner of that land and he can produce his deed of transfer. That is sufficient proof because if the deed of transfer shows that it is land mentioned by the Minister in the <i>Government Gazette</i> he is guilty because in that case it is land concerned in the matter. But if he hands it in and it proves that that is not the position the whole case falls away. Let me just tell hon. members what our rules of evidence say, namely, that he who alleges must prove. That is according to the rules of evidence except for the two exceptions made in the Criminal law. The one exception is where something is within the peculiar knowledge of the accused and this is a case where it is in the peculiar knowledge of the accused and that is why he falls under this exception. If the hon. member would only study his rules of evidence he would know that that is one of the exceptions in the existing law of evidence.</p>

<p>I have the greatest difficulty in following the argument of the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). Let us assume for a moment that he is entirely correct, that it is very difficult to prove whether or not a particular property falls within a prescribed area, which is (b), or other land which the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> excludes from the operation of the Act.

<p>Very well I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. He says that you have to <span class="col_3101-3102" refersTo="page_0243"/>get surveyors from Pretoria and people from the Deeds office. Sir, is that something which the State with all its might and wealth can do with less ease than the private individual&#x003F; Surely if there is all this difficulty and expense involved in proving a point of this kind, then that is a burden which should be borne by the State. Why put this tremendous onus of proof on the private individual, when, as we now gather, it may amount to nothing more than a mere fishing expedition. Surely these inquiries should be made by the Department of State concerned, by the Attorney-General&#x2019;s office or by the Department of Bantu Administration before such a charge is made. If there is all this great difficulty there is a very easy method whereby the hon. the Minister can overcome it. All he requires to do is to insert a provision in this Bill to the effect that upon production of an affidavit by the relevant Official, either in the Surveyor-General&#x2019;s office or in the Deeds office, that such a piece of land falls within the prescribed area concerned, it shall be accepted in the courts of law as <i>prima facie</i> proof of what it contains. All these difficulties will then disappear. But if we put a burden of this kind on the accused, particularly when proof of the facts concerned involves the tremendous expense and difficulty referred to by the hon. member for Heilbron, then this clause becomes a great deal more burdensome and objectionable than we at first thought.</p>

<p>Clause accordingly agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 35,</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to deal particularly with sub-section (c) which inserts a new sub-section (u)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">prescribing the procedure to be followed in the appointment and the conduct of the proceedings of labour tenant control boards and Bantu labour control boards.</block>

<p>This clause includes the power, by regulation to specify the functions and duties of these boards and the principles to be followed or the matters to be taken into consideration by these boards in approving of the registration of labour tenants or Bantu employees or in the making of any determination or order under this Act. First, I should like to deal with words I have not read thus far and those are the words in parenthesis namely (which may include the availability of non-Bantu labour).</p>

<p>Let us deal, to begin with, with the power of labour tenant control boards. I think it is well known that the labour tenant system is largely used in those areas of the country where there is no Coloured labour and no Asiatic labour. That broadly speaking, Sir, is the position even in Natal. What I am trying to say is this: In the farming districts where the labour tenant system is working there are not quantities of Coloured labour or quantities of Asiatic labour available. [Interjections.] I think the answer has probably been given me by the interjection of the hon. member for Heilbron. By the use of these words &#x201C;which may include the availability of non-Bantu labour&#x201D; is the intention that that is one of the factors that must be taken into consideration&#x003F; For example, is it intended to convey that the control board must take into account the availability of non-Bantu labour in the area over whose jurisdiction the board is presiding or the availability of unemployed non-Bantu <span class="col_3103-3104" refersTo="page_0244"/>labour in other parts&#x003F; For example, it is well known that there are in the big towns quantities of unemployed Asiatics. Now, this is where the interjection by the hon. member for Heilbron is pertinent. Did he intend, by his interjection, to convey that in those parts of Northern Natal where the labour tenant system operates the labour tenant control boards in making their determinations there can have regard to the availability of non-Bantu labour in Durban or Pietermaritzburg, i.e. the availability of unemployed Asiatics in Durban&#x003F; Is that what is intended&#x003F; If not, Sir, what is the purport of these words &#x201C;which may include the availability of non-Bantu labour&#x201D; so far as labour tenant control boards are concerned&#x003F; Because, as I say, they will operate largely in those parts of the country where there is no labour other than Bantu labour. That is the first point.</p>

<p>Secondly, why is the reference in this subsection to the availability of non-Bantu labour and why is the reference not to suitable non-Bantu labour&#x003F; If the reference were to suitable non-Bantu labour it might make some sense, although one did not agree with it. But these control boards are to have regard merely to unemployed non-Bantu, whether or not they may be suitable for the type of farming work the existing labour is doing.</p>

<p>I have only dealt with the powers of labour tenant control board but it goes much further. The Bantu labour control boards will function similarly. They will function under regulations where they too will have to have regard to the availability of non-Bantu labour. I hope we will be told during the course of this debate precisely what is intended so far as the making of regulations is concerned, which will include these words &#x201C;the availability of non-Bantu labour&#x201D;&#x003F; And particularly in regard to those areas in Natal where the only other labour which is available is, broadly speaking, either Asiatic or White. When we come down to the level of Bantu labourers on farms the Whites are out of the question because there are very few labourers amongst the Whites who belong to that category. I hope we shall be given some explanation as to what this means and what it is intended to convey in regulations which are to be gazetted in terms of this clause. It is worded in a most unusual manner. It says that the powers and functions which are to be set out will have regard to an additional factor which we have so far come across in this legislation, i.e. the part in brackets (the availability of non-Bantu labour).</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to explain briefly why it is necessary to put it this way. I want to take the constituency of the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) himself as example. There are 30,000 Pondos from Pondoland working in the constituency of the hon. member for Zululand. They mainly work in the sugar plantations there. At the same time there is a large measure of unemployment amongst the Indians in Zululand. That is the position we are dealing with. At the moment where the sugar farmers of Zululand are importing Bantu labour there is a large unemployed Indian population on their doorstep. That is one situation we have to take into account. There are many similar situations. We have the position in the Western Cape, for example, where we have unemployed Coloureds but where farmers, in spite of that, import Bantu labour. One of the factors which these boards will have to take into account is, <i>inter alia,</i> the availability of non-Bantu labour. I now come to the question of the hon. member whether the availability of non-Bantu labour means the availability of such labour throughout the country. I would not go as far as that. That will depend on the regulations.</p>
