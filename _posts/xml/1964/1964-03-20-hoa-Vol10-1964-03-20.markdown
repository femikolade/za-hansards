<from>Mr. M. L. MITCHELL</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs:</p>

<block name="quote">Whether any complaints have been received in regard to delay in (a) the making of trunk calls and (b) the delivery of mail in the Durban area; and, if so, (i) from whom and (ii) what steps are being taken to remedy the position.</block>

<answer by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs" to="#mitchell">

<from>The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<p>Yes; (a) and (b) from the local Chambers of Commerce and a few members of the public. The delay in the switching of trunk telephone calls is primarily due to staff difficulties and the increase in the trunk telephone traffic. Special steps have already been taken to solve the staff problems, while four additional trunk telephone lines will be taken into service shortly. There will then be 59 trunk lines and it is expected that further large-scale trunk relief will be provided during 1965 when the proposed microwave system between Johannesburg and Durban becomes available.</p>

<p>The difficulties with the mail delivery service are also due to the unsatisfactory staff position and senior officers of the Department are at present carrying out an intensive investigation of the whole matter <i>in loco.</i> In the meantime, greater use is being made of the services of females.</p>

<heading>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FROM CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FUND</heading>

<p>First Order read: Resumption of debate on motion for House to go into Committee of Supply and into Committee of Ways and Means (on taxation proposals).</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Finance, upon which an amendment had been moved by Mr. Waterson, adjourned on 19 March, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned last night, I was dealing with the way in which the hon. the Minister of Finance was handling this surplus of R88,000,000, and I was saying that the financial speakers of the Opposition were pleading like petty politicians that it should be distributed to the taxpayers. The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) says it is conscience money which must now be repaid to the taxpayer. The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) poses the question on behalf of the taxpayers: What is there in this Budget for me&#x003F; The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) also asks the question, how many people benefit from this Budget&#x003F; That is typical of their petty politicking. One would say that this was election year. But at the same time the Opposition, as usual, is inconsistent when the hon. member for Constantia on the one hand wants the Minister to give this money back to the taxpayers and on the other hand he is concerned that the Government will not have the money for its great projects like the Orange River scheme, the implementation of the report of the Odendaal Commission and the development of the Bantu homelands. No, the hon. member for Constantia need not be concerned. His prophecy of doom will also be given the lie this time, just as happened in 1961, as was so effectively shown by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever). It is exactly because the Government is now using surplus funds from revenue for capital works, for the great national undertakings, that it will be able to tackle those works, because by making funds available from Revenue Account for that purpose in times of economic prosperity, we are really making our capital burden for the future so much lighter. In the final result it is just like the financing of the private individual who in times of prosperity pays off his capital debt, or like the farmer who in times of prosperity pays off his mortgage bond or tackles new capital works from surplus revenue. In a young developing country like ours it is the patriotic duty of every individual to save, because in the final result that constitutes capital formation. It is not only financially wise for his own sake, but it is an expression of true patriotism; it is a symbol of responsible citizenship. In the same way it is financially sound for the Minister of Finance now to utilize his surpluses from Revenue Account for capital requirements.</p>

<p>The methods he applies are rather interesting. Nothing can be said about that R52,000,000 for the additional defence costs; we all agree with it. The placing of R16,000,000 to Loan Account is also another form of financing capital expenditure from surplus revenue. A very sound step here is the R3,600,000 which the hon. the Minister is using to extend the life of the marginal gold mines. If that were being done only to take a little more gold out of those mines, one might have questioned the wisdom of this step, but surely we are all living in hopes that eventually there will be an increase in the price of gold, and therefore it is a very sound capital investment to keep those mines going in order that they, when the price of gold is increased, will be able again to produce economically and once more become a great asset to the finances of the country.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the R3,700,000 set aside for the small householder. I regard that as a capital investment also because a happy worker with a happy domestic background is a very definite capital asset. Here I just want to ask that the hon. the Minister should also extend this scheme to farms, because when a young farmer buys a farm a house is also included in the purchase price. Why should we not treat the young man who begins farming just as favourably as the young couple who want to acquire a house&#x003F; I want to plead seriously with the Minister that he should extend this scheme to farms also, so that the young farmers who begin farming operations may derive the benefit of this concession in regard to transfer duties.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to the R5,100,000 granted to pensioners by way of relief. This relief is of course not in the same category; it has nothing to do with capital investment, but it is a charitable gesture which will also have an influence on our economy. But here I want to ask that the Minister should use his initiative to remove another anomaly. It is generally admitted that our pensioners cannot come out on the pensions they have been receiving hitherto, and therefore in this Budget the pension is being increased to R27 per month, or R324 per annum in the case of an unmarried person. A pensioner cannot manage on less than R324 per annum, and therefore his pension is now being increased to that figure. In fact, last year already it was so increased. The Pensions of the next group of pensioners who have a private income of up to R180 per annum are also now being increased to R324 per annum. But now there is a group of people who have a <span class="col_3363-3364" refersTo="page_0374"/>private income of R312 per annum, and those people are still expected to manage on R312. Ever since the early 1950s they have been expected to manage on R312 per annum. When we admit that a pensioner cannot come out on less than R324 per annum, I cannot see how we can expect this poor man who has a private income to live on R312. Of course I know very well what the objection is to opening the umbrella wider. One does not know how many people will be able to shelter under that umbrella if one does that. But I have enough confidence in the initiative of the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Pensions to know that they will find a solution for this anomaly which compels one man to live on R312, whereas another pensioner may receive anything from R324 to over R500.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) will forgive me if I do not follow his line of argument. I have another theme entirely that I want to develop. Sir, it seems to me that the speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance was much more remarkable for what it omitted to say rather than for what in fact it did say. The most pressing problem which faces the country at the present stage is, of course, the danger of inflation, caused largely by the pressure of demand and the fact that production is not keeping up with this demand. This inhibited production or bottleneck, as it may be called, is, of course, caused largely by the serious shortage of skilled and semi-skilled labour in all spheres of industry, apart, of course, from the dearth of professional and technically trained men. In the building industry alone we have seen figures which indicate that in the urban areas there is a shortage of about 4,000 artisans. The steel and engineering industry are handicapped by a shortage of nearly 3,000 skilled workers in the various branches. According to the labour adviser of the Federated Chamber of Industry, Mr. Barkley, the metal and coachbuilding trade, the chemical industry, the furniture and clothing manufacturers throughout the country are feeling the pinch. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In some fields the situation has become quite critical and artisans will have to be found or our industrial progress will be handicapped considerably.</block>

<p>The secretary of the Motor Industries Federation described the shortage of skilled workers in the motor industry as quite critical. Sir, what did our piscatorial Minister of Finance have to suggest to overcome the pressing problem of labour shortages&#x003F; He said in passing that: &#x201C;The problem of bottlenecks will certainly require attention and as regard skilled labour the Government is doing and will continue to do its best through training and through immigration to alleviate the shortage. But employers can also do much more through the more efficient use of the existing labour force through organized systems of in-service training and through greater use of those types of labour which are not yet fully employed, such as the old workers and the partially disabled.&#x201D; To me that is like trying to hook the shark of inflation with a lady&#x2019;s hat-pin.</p>

<p>Far more far-reaching steps will have to be taken if the inflationary tendencies of excessive demand in relation to underproduction are in fact to be coped with. Certainly immigration is not going to do it. For all the efforts of the Minister of Labour and of Immigration we are not going to be able to get the thousands upon thousands of skilled immigrants that we require, because people are simply not leaving the older countries in their tens of thousands in the way they did in the ten years immediately following the end of World War II. Quite obviously too, in heavy industry and other industries the use of partially disabled people or old people is not the answer to the problem of labour shortage. It is true that the hon. the Minister of Finance did mention the training of skilled workers, and this is, of course, the obvious weapon that we must use. Unfortunately, though, I know that when the hon. the Minister talks about training skilled workers he is by and large thinking only of the training of White workers, who themselves are in short supply and in fact, according to the statement made by the Minister of Labour in the Other Place, are in full employment. I think he mentioned a figure of 1 per cent unemployment amongst such workers, and as one knows the international figure of unemployment is 2&#x00BD; per cent to 3 per cent, which technically speaking means that the country is fully employed. But this, of course, applies only to White workers and registered Coloured and Indian workers. It does not apply to unemployed African workers who in fact do not have to register. I agree that from the ranks of semi-skilled White workers it is certainly possible to train people to take on jobs requiring higher skill, and indeed this should be one of the crash programmes which the Government should go in for; it should take semi-skilled White workers and retrain them for jobs requiring higher skill, and indeed both the Government and the employer should subsidize this period of retraining since it would pay them in the long run. There is also another way in which we can overcome the shortage and that is by reclassifying semiskilled jobs which at present are classified as skilled jobs and which are being done in fact by skilled artisans. We should be reclassifying such jobs down to the level of the semi-skilled job and training other workers to take them over and allowing those skilled artisans to do the work for which they are trained and that is a properly classified skilled job. The real key, though, lies in the full utilization of all our labour resources in South Africa and particularly our vast African labour force which is by no means fully employed in South Africa. According to the report of the Froneman Commission, there are at present 500,000 unemployed Black workers in South Africa. This is apart from the thousands of workers who <span class="col_3365-3366" refersTo="page_0375"/>are locked up in what I call uneconomic activities, either in the Native reserves or working on farms for marginal farmers, which themselves in fact are uneconomic activities. Sir, what are the ways in which we can utilize this labour; what are the factors which are inhibiting the proper use of non-White labour and particularly of Black labour in South Africa&#x003F; One of the factors, though by no means the only one&#x2014;and there is a tendency to over-emphasize this factor although it is by no means the only one, but nevertheless an important one&#x2014;is job reservation. I will say in a moment why I think it is over-emphasized. The Minister of Labour told the Other Place that none of the prophecies of doom which had been made in 1956 about the disruption of our economy if job reservation were to be introduced had come true. He then went on to say that in fact of the 13 existing work reservations, eight were purely of local origin and therefore cannot affect the national economy as a whole; that two applied to small sections of the engineering industry and in fact have been suspended, and that the clothing industry reservation is mainly to maintain the <i>status quo</i> percentage of White and Coloured workers. The remaining two determinations, he told us, reserved certain occupations in the building industry for Whites in the urban areas in the Transvaal and the Free State, and for Whites and Coloureds in part of the Cape and Natal, and he said that exemptions were granted in certain cases. Well, Sir, no wonder the dread forebodings of 1956 about job reservation wrecking the economy have not come true. It is not because job reservation <i>per se</i> is not bad in itself; the real answer is that job reservation has never been properly implemented in this country, and therefore naturally the effect that everybody predicted, had it been fully implemented, has not come to pass, and thank heaven for that! One can at least thank heaven that this policy of job reservation has not in fact been fully implemented, because just as many other aspects of apartheid are incapable of implementation, so in fact we are going to find that the policy of job reservation is incapable of proper implementation. But what job reservation has done nevertheless&#x2014;and it has created a bottleneck for this reason&#x2014;is that it has stopped people from entering occupations which they otherwise might have entered, particularly Coloured workers, because they fear that job reservation is going to be imposed in that particular industry or occupation. The hon. the Minister of Labour has told us that the main reason for job reservation is to prevent employees, irrespective of race or colour, from being ousted from their traditional spheres of employment by employees of another race.</p>

<p>Sir. what on earth he means by the &#x201C;traditional spheres of employment&#x201D; in this day and age heaven only knows. One would really think that we were still living in the days of the seventeenth century, in the days of the old craft guild system where the master craftsman passed on the secrets of his craft to his son and so on, instead of living, as we do, in an age of rapid technological change, where all the processes of industrial development and industrial production are changing almost day by day. There is no such thing any more as a traditional pattern of labour, be it in South Africa or any other country of the world. If he meant to say that in South Africa it has always just been accepted that all the highly skilled jobs are reserved for the Whites, because they are well-paid jobs, and that all the low-paid unskilled jobs are reserved for non-Whites, then at least we would know what he was talking about, although one does not by any means accept that this is sound economically or that it is defensible in any other way. I must say though that I find it absurd that the hon. the Minister still goes on using these old arguments about the preservation of traditional spheres of labour&#x2014;he really means for White workers against encroachments by non-White workers. One would think also that we were still struggling with the problem of poor Whiteism in this country and that we needed to adopt what was adopted in the &#x2019;thirties, namely, the so-called civilized labour policy, which in fact did nothing to solve the poor White problem. It may have supplied a few jobs for a few White workers on the Railways but it did not begin to touch the real problem of poor Whiteism in South Africa in the &#x2019;twenties and the &#x2019;thirties. What solved the poor White problem was, of course, industrialization, the absorption of those thousands of Whites into the industrial set-up in this country. Hon. members should stop being haunted by the spectre of poor Whiteism. It does not exist. What they should really be facing is the real problem of non-White poverty and non-White unemployment. That is the real problem in this country. The only people indeed who benefit by job reservation are the inefficient White workers. The efficient White worker does not require job reservation to protect his standards.</p>

<p>Sir, I have said before that there is a tendency to over-emphasize job reservation as being the main factor that inhibits the full utilization of our non-White labour force. I say this because (a) it has not been properly implemented and therefore is not such an overriding force, which is the reason, as I said before, why the dread forebodings about job reservation have not come to pass, and (b) there are also other much more important factors which inhibit the use of our labour force to its fullest potential. The first is influx control because it locks people up in these uneconomic activities in the rural areas and keeps them from selling their labour in the best markets. I want to say at once that influx control as far as I am concerned should not be used as job reservation for the urban African any more than I believe that job reservation is of any use in protecting the standards of White workers against encroachment by Coloured and African workers. To use influx control as a job reservation for urban Africans is equally stupid. Their standards should be protected by <span class="col_3367-3368" refersTo="page_0376"/>the rate for the job just as the White worker&#x2019;s standards can be protected, and, Sir, if you fix decent minimum wages there is no reason why there should be any drop in the wages of urban Africans. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) in an article which he wrote the other day said that the United Party supported influx control for sociological reasons, unlike the Government which supported it for ideological reasons. Neither is a good foundation for influx control. He mentioned that the sociological reasons were that the poor Africans who come into the White areas undercut the existing urban African&#x2019;s wage standards and, of course, that we would have squatter townships and a high mortality rate. Because he did not want these poor Africans to suffer these dread consequences of the removal of influx control, he was in favour of maintaining it. Well, I must point out to him that (a) the job reservation argument falls away; it is no more valid in the case than it is in any other case; minimum wages can protect the standards, and (b) there is nothing to stop anybody from building houses if enough money is voted and indeed the Government has shown us that, and (c) as far as the question of poor Africans dying in the towns is concerned, as far as the question of high mortality rates is concerned, I would like to point out to the hon. member that the mortality rate in the reserves through malnutrition and starvation is tremendously high. Whether a man starves in the reserves or starves in the town is not going to make any difference to him. The only difference is that in the reserves he starves out of sight.</p>

<p>The other factor which, of course, inhibits the proper use of our labour force is this whole question of trade union recognition for Africans and the change of the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D;. In terms of the existing industrial legislation an African is not recognized as an employee. This means that he cannot join a legally recognized trade union; it means that all closed-shop occupations are denied to him and that he cannot really be admitted as an apprentice.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is now talking about the collective bargaining machinery and I am talking about the admission of Africans into skilled trades, which they cannot enter by virtue of being denied the right to join recognized trade unions. The little works committees, or whatever they are, which have been set up instead of trade unions I do not for a moment think replace the effective bargaining machinery of trade unions. But the main reason, as I say, is that the system stops Africans from being trained in skilled and semi-skilled occupations. What we really should be doing is to reinvest some of this vast budgetary profit which the hon. the Minister presented to us in training and educating the African and non-White section of our community to play their part in the labour set-up of this country. Not only White managerial skill and capital but also African labour has contributed to the building up of our economy, and it would be wise for us to reinvest some of that money in the training and education of African workers. Sir, it has been said that this is a stingy Budget in many respects, and the stingiest aspect of all, of course, is the miserable amount, the pegged amount, which is set aside for the education of Africans&#x2014;the R13,000,000 plus a certain additional amount for university education&#x2014;and even that has been cut in this Budget. Sir, it would pay this country handsomely to go in for a crash programme of educating the non-Whites in this country. What is to become of the thousands of non-White children who passed Std. VI and Std. VIII and even Matriculation&#x003F; Is their future for ever to be that of the drawers of water and the hewers of wood, or are they to be allowed to enter into the higher ranks of workers with some hope of a better earning potential in South Africa&#x003F; I believe that this would not only pay us economically but politically. We would have political peace in South Africa and we would not have to spend this tremendous amount of R212,000,000 on defence. Sir, nobody has yet criticized this expenditure. I do criticize it. I criticize it because there is a choice; it is not as though we have no choice. If we change our racial policy so to allow economic and other opportunities for our non-Whites, we would not be facing the hostility of the outside world on the one hand and, of course, the growing problem of internal trouble on the other. I might say that strangely enough the one thing which could bring about outside intervention in this country would be if this R212,000,000 of defence expenditure were ever actually used against the internal population of this country. If we faced another Sharpeville we will never recover from it. The hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) quoted a UNO report here yesterday saying that we had recovered from the effects of Sharpeville. The one thing that we dare not face again is another tragic occurrence like Sharpeville. and therefore the building up of a huge Defence Budget is as far as I am concerned tackling the problem from the wrong end. Let us ensure racial peace in this country and then we would not have to stand this astronomical expenditure on defence.</p>

<p>I do not want to react to the speech of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) because she always sounds only one note; she drags the Bantu into every debate in this House. She would like to send this debate in a different direction, but I do not want it to go in the direction in which she would like to send it.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the policy of the United Party as announced here yesterday by the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman), their agricultural expert. The hon. member said yesterday that only a very <span class="col_3369-3370" refersTo="page_0377"/>poor Government would have been able to prevent this economic prosperity, because he says South Africa is rich in minerals and other natural resources. I want to say that if the Opposition had been in power then, in spite of all our riches and all our natural resources, South Africa would not have reached the stage of development it has in fact reached. We know that the Opposition, both in the distant past and recently, tried to hamper all development in the country. Just remember what happened in regard to the establishment of Iscor, Sasol and Phalaborwa. As soon as we want to establish industries in this country, we find that the Opposition either tries to put a stop to it or to hamper it. They have always adopted the attitude that our country is not able itself to exploit those riches, and now that the Government has gone out of its way during the past 15 years to utilize and to develop the nautral resources of the country, with the result that to-day we are a prosperous country, they come along with this story that this is a weak Government. I should like my hon. friends just to listen to what the <i>Economist</i> says. It says that South Africa is on the eve of a second industrial revolution. This is what it says about South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the same time a group of foreign journalists now visiting the Republic expressed their surprise in Cape Town this week at the tremendous development in South Africa. They expect even greater &#x2022;development, which will make South Africa one of the great manufacturing countries of the world. If one considers all the great industrial projects, in South Africa, the <i>Economist</i> writes in its latest issue, one cannot but come to the conclusion that the Republic is now on the eve of a second industrial revolution.</block>

<p>The <i>Economist</i> then refers to large new undertakings like the new copper exploitation at Phalaborwa, new gold mines, new diamond exploitations; the plan to establish new steel works, the tremendous expansion of the provision of power, and also great possibilities for the fishing industry as the result of our linking up with Spanish interests.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if people from abroad say this about South Africa, it just proves once again that the Opposition wants to belittle the Government, because they try to create the impression that all these things happen by themselves. If we had not had a Government as far-sighted as this one. we would not have experienced the present flourishing conditions. We find that the countries overseas recognize that we are making fast progress, but what does the Opposition do&#x003F; The one hon. member says that we are progressing too fast and that we should even delay the Orange River scheme a little, but then the next Opposition member says only an hour later this country could have developed much faster. The one member of the Opposition walks to the left, the other walks to the right, and the next one walks backwards.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) referred last night to agricultural products which are being exported and which are subsidized. He emphasized the question of maize which is exported and subsidized. I am surprised that the hon. member did not first go and ascertain how the export losses are covered. Maize which is exported is not subsidized by the Government, as the hon. member wanted to intimate here.</p>

<p>I said the farmers subsidize it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#keyter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KEYTER</person>:</from>

<p>The levies paid by the farmers must subsidize those export losses. We also find that the Government subsidizes the consumer of maize in this country to such an extent that it pays a subsidy of 35 cents per bag on white mealies. It subsidizes yellow maize by 50 cents per bag. Then the consumer in the country still gets 37&#x00BD; cents per bag in the form of a railway rebate. If all this is added, Sir, you will see that the Government subsidizes the consumer to an amount of between R10,000,000 and R13,000,000 per annum, just on the consumption of maize.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for East London (City) says this R4,000,000 and the R12,000,000 to which he referred, and which represent the loss on the export of maize, should also be used further to subsidize the inland consumer. In other words, he wants the mealie-grower who pays that levy into the Stabilization Fund to use that levy to subsidize farmers in other branches of agriculture. Will the hon. member suggest that the wool levy paid by the wool-growers should be used to subsidize the maizegrower&#x003F; It amounts to the same thing. [Interjections.] Yes, the hon. member wants the levy paid by the maize farmer to be used to subsidize the wool-grower and the producer of meat. The hon. member said yesterday that this R4,000,000 and the R12,000,000 should be used to subsidize certain consumers in the country.</p>

<speech by="#keyter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KEYTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says we want to subsidize Japan. Mr. Speaker, this idea that foreign purchasers are being subsidized is quite wrong. During the past year we received for white mealies and for yellow mealies respectively 350 and 360 cents per bag at the coast. The foreign consumer must then still pay the loading costs, insurance, shipping freight, offloading costs and railage costs. The maize costs them anything from R4.25 to R5 per bag, depending on the world market price. It is therefore wrong to say that they are being subsidized. In fact, it means that the Government of this country does not subsidize <span class="col_3371-3372" refersTo="page_0378"/>the railage on import maize in the country, nor does it pay the handling and storage costs on export maize, costs which the Government has to pay in the case of maize for inland consumption. In other words, if the export maize is subsidized, as some people sometimes think in this House, it would not have been necessary to impose a levy on the maize-grower. If we also get the railway rebate and the subsidy which the Government pays the consumer in the country, we will have no losses. In other words, the export maize saves the Government those extra costs of storage, railage, etc.</p>

<p>The hon. member had much to say about the eggs which are exported. He said those eggs should be sold here more cheaply. Does the hon. member want the maize-grower also to subsidize the loss suffered on the export of eggs&#x003F; Because those subsidies of R4,000,000 and R12,000,000 paid to those people have the result that he suffers less loss on what he has to export. The cheaper the poultry farmer can buy his maize, the more eggs he will produce and the larger will be the exports of that product which is exported at a loss. It will increase the losses. Now the hon. member for East London (City) wants the maize-grower to subsidize those losses also.</p>

<p>For the information of the hon. member for East London (City) I want to say that the Mealie Control Board and the Wool Board are already conducting experiments in the grass areas of the Transvaal and the Free State to see how the consumption of maize in the country can be increased by giving the sheep maize as a supplementary feed. By doing that, the wool clip will be increased; it will increase the lamb crop and will result in a better quality of meat being marketed. That money is being well spent. We cannot just give money for an experiment when we do not even know how it will work out. Experiments will probably also be made in regard to the feeding of cattle and to see whether it is economic to feed maize to cattle, and whether it will pay the farmer to do so. We make use of the Government&#x2019;s Department for those experiments from beginning to end. The maizegrowers provide the maize, the cattle farmers provide the cattle, and the sheep farmers provide the sheep. By that means they pay for those experiments to a certain extent, but we make use of the Department of Technical Services to make these experiments for us.</p>

<p>We cannot do other than to say that we should be very grateful for having a Government which throughout all these years has been prepared to make money available in the interest of the farmers of South Africa. I therefore want to congratulate the Minister on this budget. It is evidence of a sound policy. Had we not had such a good Government, we would not have had such a good policy. The Opposition has always hoped that something would go wrong in the country so that they would be able to say that it was due to the policy of the Nationalist Government. They said many things with the intention of vilifying South Africa so much overseas that we would eventually lose our markets. When we became a Republic and held the referendum, the Opposition said that the products of the farmer would lie and rot because there would be no markets. Now that the country has become so prosperous since we became a Republic, they do not like it. They now want us to curtail our expanding trade and our exports.</p>

<p>I remember the prediction they made during the referendum. They now realize that those predictions were quite wrong, so much so that one of their own front-benchers is now saying that he is beginning to doubt whether he voted in the right way in the referendum, because he now realizes what would have happened to us if we had remained in the Commonwealth and had not become a Republic. We would have been much worse off than we are to-day. We would have had to dance to the tune of other countries in Africa if we were not a Republic.</p>

<p>We live in a country where the consumer can buy his requirements more cheaply than in any other country in the world. No other country has such a low cost of living as South Africa. In no other country in the world is income-tax as low as it is here, no other country in the world, not even the United States and Britain, has made as rapid progress as we have made in South Africa during the last ten years. In the financial sphere the outside world to-day says that South Africa is the giant of Africa and that the prospects in South Africa are very promising. America itself says that they must maintain good relations with us because they have the prospect of trading with us on a large scale. All the countries of the world to-day compete to expand their trade with South Africa. We are in this sound position to-day thanks to this good Government and the sound policy which is being followed. Once again we must thank the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Keyter) was a little confused about the history of the referendum. He seems to think that the referendum was on the question of whether we should remain in the Commonwealth or not. Does he not remember that his Prime Minister sent a letter to each of us assuring us that we would remain in the Commonwealth&#x003F; If voting for the referendum meant that we voted to remain in the Commonwealth, then he also voted for remaining in the Commonwealth. So what is this nonsense about saying that one of the front-benchers has doubts whether he should have voted against the Republic or not&#x003F; The hon. member also made the categorical statement that under the United Party Government the country would not have developed to the extent to which it had developed under the Nationalist Party Government. I do not want to go into a detailed discussion on that but I just want to put one point to the hon. member: I think the horn member will agree that under the United Party Government we would have had a far bigger White population to-day than we have under <span class="col_3373-3374" refersTo="page_0379"/>this Government. We would probably have had a million people extra. If he is honest he will admit that because they have killed the immigration programme. He spoke about agricultural matters; with an extra million people, which is without any doubt the extra population we would have had, does he think we would have been faced with all the agricultural surpluses we have to-day&#x003F; With the single exception of mealies, I should like to suggest to him that we would not have had any agricultural surpluses at all. I shall deal with the other points raised by the hon. member in the course of my speech.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance began his Budget speech by saying &#x201C;Growth and stability are the two main objectives of budgetry policy&#x201D;. But surely the hon. the Minister of Finance left out something vital. Surely he should have gone on and said: &#x201C;Of course, with the peculiar policy of separate development of my Government the Budget is the most important instrument of bringing about that separate development, if we are in earnest about it, even at the cost of growth and stability.&#x201D; He should have added that, Sir. Instead of saying that the Minister went on to say: &#x201C;Growth we have achieved, in what rich measure I shall presently show.&#x201D; The Minister did show an impressive growth rate in the national income of about 10 per cent and about 12.9 per cent in the case of manufacturing factories and industries. But there is something very important which the Minister did not show and that is that this very growth was made possible by the further rapid integration of non-White labour, particularly Bantu labour, in the economic activities controlled and directed by the White man. I should like to give those figures to the hon. the Minister seeing that he left them out. He cited manufacturing industries as industries that have grown very rapidly. What happened in the employment position of manufacturing industries between December 1962 and December 1963&#x003F; Employment in the manufacturing industry increased by 48,000. Of those 48,000 Whites only accounted for 10,000. In other words, there you have had further rapid economic integration. This economic miracle of which the Minister is justly proud was only made possible because his policy of separation failed in that particular year, failed rather more drastically than normally. Another industry the Minister singled out where there had been rapid growth was the construction industry. What happened in the construction industry&#x003F; Employment increased there by 15,000 of which Whites accounted for only 2,000. Here again we have had one of the most rapid periods of integration that this country has ever witnessed. How can it be otherwise with our population facts as they are&#x003F; The Minister is fully aware of the calculations made, for instance, by Professor Sadie, namely that the number of White workers that became available every year through natural growth was only 14,000. If we mant to continue to grow at the rate at which we have grown over the past ten years we cannot do so just on the basis of White labour; we can only do it on the basis of very rapid economic integration and that is precisely what has happened.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is that hon. members opposite who sing the praises of this Budget do not seem to realize that what they are really singing praise to is rapid integration and not apartheid. They claim that this rapid development over the past year was made possible because of Government policy. Surely it was made possible because the Government policy of apartheid had broken down completely. One of the amazing contradictions in South Africa to-day is that when there is a boom in our economy the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid breaks down and if the apartheid policy has some measure of success as it did have between 1959 and 1960 and between 1961 and 1962 when the non-White labour force in the manufacturing industry only increased by 1,000 instead of 38,000 as it did in the past year, then, of course, they have some success with their apartheid policy. Surely this is one of the most contradictory Governments in the world. I can now already tell the Minister that if he lands his big fish of rapid economic growth he will find that the species he has caught will not be the specie apartheid but &#x201C;Swart integrasie&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The White Paper shows that in 1963 the gross domestic capital formation amounted to R1,408,000,000 of which public authorities and public corporations, largely under the control of the Government, accounted for about R562,000,000. Sir, it is this vast capital formation that has made possible the economic growth of which we are all proud in this House and which made increasing employment possible. But if we look at this Budget we will find that more than 90 per cent of the capital formation controlled by the Government itself is invested in the White homelands, not to mention the private capital formation. Surely, Sir, as long as this type of Budget continues it is inevitable that the Natives from the reserves and rural areas must come to the so-called White homelands, no matter how their citizenship rights in the White homelands are restricted and no matter how they are extended in the Bantu homelands even to the extent of one man one vote. Apartheid legislation can constitute them legal foreigners but they will be foreigners living permanently in the midst if the Whites in the so-called White homelands. If the great flow-back to the Bantu homelands as envisaged by the Prime Minister is to start 15 years hence, i.e. 1978, one would have expected a totally different Budget over the past 15 years. Surely the pattern should then have been to divert more and more capital investment to the Black homelands, because it is a fact that the flow-back cannot occur until more money is actually invested in the Black homelands than in the White homelands for the simple reason that until you create more jobs in the Black homelands than there are in the White homelands you cannot have a flow-back; because the Blacks are increasing <span class="col_3375-3376" refersTo="page_0380"/>far more rapidly than all the other population groups put together. I therefore say that until the Government follows a policy that brings this about apartheid will remain nothing more than a myth and a very dangerous myth. We have seen how it has isolated us in the international sphere. We see how it is causing instability in our midst. For the sake of that myth which the Government is not really making any effort to carry out, we have to endanger our whole future. They hang on to that myth just because it keeps them in power and for no other reason whatsoever. If the Government is in earnest about separate development they should surely have budgeted and planned a development programme of the order of that proposed by the Odendaal Commission for South West Africa. The population of South West Africa is over 500,000 of which about 420,000 are indigenous. When we look at the other facts about South West Africa we find that it is a territory that has not nearly reached the stage of economic integration that we have reached in South Africa nor are the Native reserves there as over-crowded as they are here. To make apartheid a reality there the Odendaal Commission recommends a capital expenditure of R115,000,000 over the next five years. Our population is nearly 30 times as large as that of South West Africa so surely if we want to make a reality of apartheid here our expenditure will have to be at least 30 times as great. One would therefore expect a capital expenditure over a period of five years of at least R3,500,000,000 or about R700,000,000 per annum. Or does the Minister want to tell the House that apartheid can be bought cheaper in South Africa than in South West Africa&#x003F; Of course, any expenditure of this order for South Africa is so unrealistic economically and politically that the Minister does not even make an attempt to do it. For unlike South West Africa we have no fairy godmother to underwrite us. The Minister therefore contents himself with a Vote of R36,500,000 for capital development in the Bantu homelands this year.</p>

<p>Under the United Party Government, just to stop soil erosion and to develop the Native reserves as part of the Union of South Africa we would probably have been spending considerably more than that amount of money to-day without the myth of apartheid; but purely for economic and social reasons we would probably have been spending an amount of money far in excess of that.</p>

<p>Under-developed countries cannot develop by means of capital expenditure alone either. They need a vast administrative and technological programme. I am sure the hon. the Minister is aware of that. Again, before the trek back to the Black homelands can take place the Bantu community will have to produce more technicians and administrators from amongst their own ranks than the White community is doing at present for the same reasons that I advanced in the case of capital investment. Only then will the rate of economic growth in the Bantu homelands be able to exceed that of the White homelands, which is an absolute pre-requisite if apartheid is ever to become a practical policy in this country. What is the position, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; In reply to a question by the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) the following information was given in this House recently: Number of students at all South African universities: White: 45,705; Black: 1,471; Coloured: 783; Indians: 1,428. We see that there are nearly 30 times as many White students as Black students at university at the moment. With these proportions how is the Government going to start separating the races so that they will be separated by 1978&#x003F; Does the Government not realize that for true separate development the educational level of the Blacks will have to equal that of the Whites&#x003F; After all, the bulk of the Bantu can only live in their homelands if these homelands are highly developed industrially; if they have achieved the industrial development of, say, Belgium. Surely it is quite clear that only on the basis of advanced industrial civilization can the so-called Bantu homelands ever carry the bulk of the Bantu population.</p>

<p>Like any other budget of this Government, this Budget shows no awareness of the necessity of that educational development of the Bantu if apartheid is to become a reality. In fact, Sir, one of the most static statistics under this Minister has been that of Bantu education. If we look at the budgets for the past 15 years we will see how slowly the expenditure on Bantu education has increased. As long as this disparity between the educational levels of Blacks and Whites remains they cannot simply be separated. In other words, as long as we retain the present formula of financing Bantu education the Government has no hope of ever in future achieving its so-called policy of separating the races, a policy which they claim presents the only way in which the White man can maintain himself in this country.</p>

<p>To sum up, Mr. Speaker, this Budget, like every other Nationalist Party Budget so far, does not even attempt to translate the theory of apartheid into practice. Every year we have more and more blue prints and plans for apartheid from the Minister of Bantu Administration, restricting his citizenship rights, all based on the assumption that the Bantu will soon start moving back. But when it comes to the master builder, the Minister of Finance, to find the money for this beautiful plan, he is so appalled by the cost to the taxpayer of the venture that he just makes a few token provisions to satisfy his Cabinet colleagues for another year. Hon. members opposite are always ready in this House to tell us about the wonders of apartheid, how it will save the White man. But when it comes to voting money they forget all about it and what do they do&#x003F; They sing the praises of integration. That is what they do when it comes to every Budget.</p>

<p>We on this side, of course, understand the dilemma in which the hon. the Minister of Finance finds himself. He is the Minister of <span class="col_3377-3378" refersTo="page_0381"/>Finance of a Government which has such an impossible policy that when he starts dealing with the real thing like Government income and Government expenditure he just has to ignore that impractical policy. We quite understand that; we don&#x2019;t blame him for it either. We are rather disappointed that he did not do anything positive to cure grave defects in our society. I suggest that those grave defects are outlined in our amendment. I am sure most hon. members opposite will agree that those defects exist i.e. the shortage of skilled workers, technicians and scientists. I don&#x2019;t have to elaborate on that; I think it is common cause that that is one of the gravest defects in our society at the present. The other is the fact that many of our aged and infirm are not getting their fair share of our increasing prosperity. Again I don&#x2019;t think many hon. members opposite will deny that. Then we have the last anomaly that in a country with agricultural surpluses so many of our citizens live on the bread line or slightly below it. If we cured these defects we would be a fairer, richer and happier society. Never has a Minister of Finance had the room to manoeuvre to cure these basic weaknesses in our society as the hon. the Minister has on this occasion, because he finds himself with a fortuitous, unbudgeted, unexpected surplus of R88,000,000 which may grow still further. Of course the excuse of the hon. Minister and of the other side for not doing these things in respect of which I am sure in their heart of hearts they agree, is of course that thanks to the vast increase in military expenditure, if we go on increasing expenditure on social welfare, it might lead to inflation. Mr. Speaker, as far as the educational part of our amendment is concerned, it directly tackles the bottle-neck of the shortage of skilled and technological manpower, which the Minister himself realizes is the most immediate inflationary threat. So he cannot object to that. He should really welcome it. It is a far more positive approach than his own approach in his Budget Speech. In any event I would just like to remind him of what was said by Prof. Van Zyl of the Stellenbosch University Medical School two nights ago, when he pointed out that the vast expenditure on the military machine does not help much if you don&#x2019;t have the qualified manpower for it. He was speaking on salaries for medical professors and in support is reported to have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If South Africa needs to defend her borders and we mean it, it is necessary that these people are kept here.</block>

<p>He was referring to doctors in particular, but he emphasized that he was not just talking about the loss of doctors but of scientists in general.</p>

<p>But I want to speak more specifically on the question of agricultural surpluses on the one hand and malnutrition on the other. Now in the annual report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing, he says this on page 1&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most outstanding developments in the agricultural field, which are becoming increasingly more important, are:</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) gradual increase in food production;</li>

<li>(b) a relatively static position in the <i>per capita</i> food consumption, resulting in an ever-increasing gap between production and internal consumption; and</li>

<li>(c) an ever-increasing dependence on overseas markets for disposal of agricultural products.</li>

</ol>

<p>He points out that these are the three most outstanding developments and I want the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Keyter) to listen to this because he attacked the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman). Then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The increase in the total consumption of food over the past number of years barely kept pace with the rate of increase in the population. This means that the <i>per capita</i> consumption of food remained more or less static.</block>

<p>Because of this widening gap between production and domestic consumption, the farmers have had to export an increasing percentage of their production, but as the report points out at declining prices because of the fact that international prices have declined in the past decade. Thus the export value of South African agricultural produce rose only 37 per cent in the ten year period from 1952 to 1962 whereas the volume increased 149 per cent. The farmers had to export 149 per cent more of agricultural produce and they only got 37 per cent extra for that. What is more, the Secretary for Agriculture points out that there is a danger that this declining tendency might continue because he points out that the developments now taking place in European countries do not augur well for the future. The fact is that agricultural production is increasing very rapidly in these temperate climate countries to which we export most of our products, and despite all the talk of the European community about free trade, so far they have not shown a great desire for free trade as far as agricultural products are concerned. From all this it is quite clear that for stability in agriculture an expanding internal market is absolutely essential. The Secretary for Agriculture makes that point himself, when he says on page 2 of his report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is generally realized that the main emphasis has shifted from production to marketing, better distribution publicity and extension with a view to promoting higher internal consumption; the reason for this being that an expanding internal market is, and after all will remain, the greatest stabilising factor in the agricultural economy of any country.</block>

<p>He contrasts the gap between production and consumption in South Africa and says that it is gradually widening, so that our farmers have <span class="col_3379-3380" refersTo="page_0382"/>to export overseas to a market where the Secretary himself pointed out that the chances are that agricultural prices certainly won&#x2019;t increase very much in future. We have the other anomaly in our society that a vast number of people do not have sufficient to eat. I would like to quote to hon. members from what Dr. M. D. Marais said as reported in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> on this question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The purchasing power of the non-Whites must be increased if there was to be a greater turnover of the country&#x2019;s agricultural products&#x2014;particularly in a time of growing surpluses.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About 80 per cent of our population has an exceptionally low purchasing power which limits the amount of food they can purchase.</block>

<p>As Dr. Marais points out, of course the answer on the long-term is to increase their wages gradually, but this is a long-term process. For a very long time if we want drastically to improve the nutritional levels of this country, there is only one possible policy to follow. As the Secretary points out the consumption level is low in South Africa and it has remained static, although the Minister has pointed out that there has been a welcome increase in the last year. But there is little doubt that if we want to get an even rise in the future, it will be impossible to do it simply by increasing wages. We have had wages increased in the past ten years, and yet consumption has remained static. There is only one way and that surely is by considerably increasing the subsidies on food and making food cheaper for the lower income groups.</p>

<p>I think the Government should admit categorically, just as they have in the case of immigration, that they took the wrong step when they reduced the school-feeding scheme. A country that has reached South Africa&#x2019;s level of development should be able to afford schoolfeeding schemes in view of the extensive malnutrition in South Africa. Just recently for instance, in reply to a question in this House, the Minister of Health gave a figure of 15,000 notified cases of kwashiorkor and we know that because this system of notifying kwashiorkor has only been instituted recently, that is probably an understatement of the real position. Apart from re-introducing school-feeding schemes, the Government should greatly increase the subsidies on certain basic foods, particularly those in surplus supply. In the second place the Government should greatly increase, as I have said, subsidies in respect of basic foods. The Government presently spends about R33,000,000 on food subsidies per annum. It seems a large sum, but it must be seen against the national income figure of R5,000,000,000 to see it in its proper perspective. If these subsidies were to be doubled, it could hardly have any inflationary effect on the present situation in South Africa. I see the hon.</p>

<p>Minister is smiling, but I will tell him why I do not think he has thought this out logically. The bulk of this expenditure, the increase in pensions for instance, will be spent on agricultural products. Now that is the one industry that despite the droughts in recent years, still has a surplus capacity, as is clear from what I have read from the Secretary for Agriculture&#x2019;s report. Now surely an increase in your expenditure on food, on a commodity that is in surplus supply overall&#x2014;I am not talking about the temporary drought conditions at the moment&#x2014; cannot possibly lead to inflation, particularly if it is confined largely to those fodstuffs that are in surplus supply. The Minister must realize that if you increase your demand among your poorer sections of the people, your social pensioners, your lowest income groups, the effect of such extra expenditure is not nearly as inflationary as for instance an increase in expenditure as far as the higher income groups are concerned, because they go for the basic things in life, they go for food in the first instance, and that we had in surplus supply. Therefore this also will not embarrass the hon. Minister as far as his balance of payments is concerned.</p>

<p>The extra expenditure we recommend will therefore be a movement towards curing that weakness in our economy, it will be a beginning of a movement towards curing some of the most glaring ills in our society, because a large part of it will be spent on food and in training our youth. There again, surely an extension of our educational programme cannot nearly be as inflationary as other types of expenditure might very well be.</p>

<p>What we are in effect trying to say to the hon. Minister is: You can have your guns, but you can also have considerably improved social welfare without inflation or balance of payments problems. That is what we are saying to the hon. the Minister. We say it will make South Africa a much better educated country and lead to a fairer society, and may I suggest in conclusion to the Minister that making South Africa a fairer and more equitable society is as important a defence against external aggression or internal trouble than any amount of guns that we can ever afford to buy.</p>

<p>The main theme of the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) was what had constituted an essential part of United Party propaganda during the past years. In brief it amounts to this: The greater the prosperity in South Africa, the greater the integration. This political untruth has assumed new balloon-like dimensions with the publication of the first part of the 1960 census figures. The Chief Whip of the United Party said the following about the results of the census: &#x201C;The picture presented in this report gives the complete lie to the apartheid policy. It shows that economic laws are operating despite and in opposition to the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville untimely with his &#x201C;hear, hear.&#x201D; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised the same cry, and when the hon. member for Jeppes raised the same cry I thought we were going to get a factual and economic argument in support of this propaganda story. What did he produce&#x003F; He referred to the variation in the number of Bantu employees in industry during the last few months of 1963 in comparison with 1959, 1960 and 1961 and he said there was a slight decline from 1959 to 1961 and a resultant decline in the number of Bantu employees and that there was an increase of over 30,000 in 1963. I want to deal with all the facts of this silly story and if time permits me I shall towards the end of my speech return to the few other arguments advanced by the hon. member for Jeppes.</p>

<p>I want to make seven submissions in connection with this propaganda lie of the United Party and I shall prove them one after the other. The first one is this: There is no correlation whatsoever between the growth of the Bantu male population (those are mainly the industrial workers) in our urban areas from 1921 to 1960 and the corresponding growth of our industrial production. These two factors cannot be correlated in any way.</p>

<p>The second submission which I shall prove is that there is no direct correlation between the metropolitan Bantu population and the employment figures in industry. The metropolitan Bantu population figures to which the census refers has no relation with the employment in our industries.</p>

<p>The third submission which I shall prove is that there is indeed an absolutely direct correlation between the female Bantu population of the metropolitan areas and the resultant growth in the total population and that that is the key to the 1960 census.</p>

<p>Then I shall show how under the National Party regime the Bantu labour force in industry has been pegged and that there has even been a decline relative to production during a period of enormous industrial growth.</p>

<p>My fifth submission will be that the industrial growth in South Africa has been primarily due to an intensification of capital in industry and that that in turn has been made possible by capital formation, obviously backed by overseas capital, particularly the simultaneous growth of all sectors of our economy, and that our industrial growth is not primarily based on the presence or employment of Bantu labour. In the sixth place I shall show that the present pattern of metropolitan industrial development does not offer a solution to the problem of finding employment for the growing Bantu population and that the vacancies which are created for the Bantu by our industrial growth in the metropolitan areas do not meet the needs of the growth in population. Lastly I shall show that the policy of the National Party is the only solution to the problem of employment, namely by developing industries which call for an intensification of labour in the Border areas and in the reserves and by developing a diversity of economies in the Bantu&#x2019;s own areas and by developing all sectors in the Bantu&#x2019;s own area.</p>

<p>I shall start with my first submission that there is no correlation between the growth of the Bantu male population in our urban metropolitan areas between 1921 to 1960 and the growth in our industrial production. The metropolitan areas I have chosen are those of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Germiston and Benoni because over a long period they have been our oldest and most highly industrialized areas. In 1921 there were 242,300 Bantu males in those areas and in 1921 private factories produced goods to the value of R53,200,000. The Bantu male population then increased to 398,800 over a period of 15 years up to 1936. That was a growth in respect of the Bantu male population of 64.7 per cent. The production of private factories grew to R105,600,000, which is a growth of 99 per cent. The production of the private factories therefore grew at a faster rate than the Bantu male population. In 1951 the Bantu male population increased further to 658,800 in those areas, again a growth of 66.6 per cent. The tempo of growth was therefore practically constant over a further period of 15 years, but the production of private factories shot up to R555,800,000, a 429 per cent growth. Up to 1960, over a period of nine years, the Bantu male population again increased to 821,500 which was a 25 per cent increase in numbers and the production of private factories increased to R1,125,000,000, a growth of 102 per cent. My submission here is simply this: There is no direct relation between the growth of our industrial production with the growth of the Bantu male population in the metropolitan areas. The industrial growth is due to other factors.</p>

<p>What these facts indicate further is that there was a period in our industrial development from 1936 to 1951 when there was capital intensification because their production increased six times as fast as the Bantu population and that capital was further intensified after 1951 because industrial production increased four times as fast as the Bantu population over that period.</p>

<p>I now come to the second submission that there is no direct correlation either between the metropolitan Bantu population and the employment figure in industry.</p>

<p>Nobody can be convinced if he lacks the ability to be convinced. In 1921 there was a Bantu male population of 242,300 in those metropolitan areas and in that same year 61,000 Bantu were employed in those industries. I had to make that calculation. Only &#x201C;non-Whites&#x201D; are given. By 1936 the number of Bantu had grown to 398,000, as I have already indicated, which was a 64 per <span class="col_3383-3384" refersTo="page_0384"/>cent growth in the Bantu male population, whereas the employment figure had increased much more up to 1936, namely by 90 per cent.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>If I still have time at the end of my speech I shall allow the hon. member to put a question. The further growth, which I have already mentioned, then took place, up to 658,000 Bantu, a 66 per cent growth, but in 1951 the employment figure rose to 375,000; a 215 per cent increase. The employment figure increased much higher over that period than the Bantu population, as I have already indicated; up to 1960 the Bantu male population increased by 25.5 per cent up to 821,000 whereas up to 1960 the employment figure decreased to 357,500, a 4.4 per cent decrease over those nine years, in spite of the 25 per cent increase in the male population figure. Once again the figures show that the number of Bantu males in those metropolitan areas had no bearing whatsoever on or was in no direct relation with the industrial employment figure. There was a period when Bantu were absorbed much faster in industries and then a period followed in which their employment in industry declined.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>&#x201C;What are they doing there&#x003F;&#x201D; That is a broad sociological question which we can discuss on another occasion, but their presence in the metropolitan areas is unrelated to their employment in industry. The most important aspect of these figures is, and I shall return to this in a moment, that from 1951 to 1960 there was a tremendous increase in industrial production without any increase in the number of Bantu employed, there was actually a 4.4 per cent decrease in the number of Bantu employed. I want to give the relevant figures in this respect: In 1951 our industrial production was R558,000,000 and by 1960 it had grown to R1,125,000,000, practically a 100 per cent growth in production against a 4.4 per cent decrease in the number of Bantu workers in those industries over the same period. That is the most significant statistical fact which, this has practically become traditional, gives the lie to the United Party statement that growing prosperity leads to greater and greater integration. That phenomenal growth in production over a period of nine years when there was a decline in the number of Bantu employed in industry was simply due to capital intensification in those industries. They mechanized more, more opportunities to produce were created for the human hand, and secondly it was brought about by the National Party policy. The third conclusion which I want to draw from this is that the solution of the Bantu employment problem does not lie in the industries with large capitals in our existing metropolitan areas. I think even the hon. member for Pinelands will be able to understand that if over a period of nine years your industrial production has doubled but there has been a decline in the number of Bantu workers in those industries, you cannot look in that direction for a solution to the problem of providing employment for the growing masses of Bantu which are already in our metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>I come to my third submission that there is an absolute and direct correlation between the presence of female Bantu in the metropolitan areas and the growth in the total number of Native population. We already find in 1951 that some of these metropolitan centres had a large number of Bantu women and the highest figure was in respect of Pretoria and Port Elizabeth. In 1951 already there were 53,000 Bantu women in Pretoria out of a total Bantu population of 122,000; 43 per cent of the total Bantu population therefore were women. Port Elizabeth had 34,500 out of 70,000, i.e., in 1951 49 per cent of Port Elizabeth&#x2019;s Bantu population were women. The total national growth in these two cities which had a high percentage of women in 1951 were 63.3 per cent in Pretoria and 75.8 per cent in Port Elizabeth. That was the result of the presence of a high percentage of Bantu women. Cape Town had the lowest percentage of women in 1951, namely, 32 per cent of its total Bantu population. In Durban it was also 32 per cent and 33 per cent in Benoni; and the total population growth up to 1960 was 25 per cent, 36 per cent and 28 per cent. Where there has already been a high percentage of women present nine years previously you immediately find this dramatic general increase in the population and a relatively modest increase in the population where the percentage of women has been low. In 1951 the average female population in all those metropolitan areas constituted 38 per cent of the population and the average national growth up to 1960 was 39 per cent which once again supports my statement that the presence of female Bantu in big metropolitan areas was responsible for the growth factor. It was not our economical development which caused the urban Bantu population to increase. That growth and the economic prosperity have nothing to do with each other, as most people with an elementary knowledge of nature study will guess. The breach in connection with this matter was made before 1951. From 1921 to 1936 the Bantu female population increased by 242 per cent and from 1936 to 1951 they increased by 171 per cent. It is of interest to mention that under the National Party regime, although the growth was still far too rapid, it was at least controlled and brought down to 63 per cent during the nine year period concerned. Had the United Party wished to serve the Bantu in any way in regard to their employment problem, the United "Party would have been one of the most ardent supporters of the National Party in the recent debate when the National Party wanted to take steps and did take steps to combat the influx of Bantu women to our metropolitan areas.</p>

<p><span class="col_3385-3386" refersTo="page_0385"/>I shall at least still have time to deal with my fourth submission, namely, that under the National Party regime the number of Bantu was pegged during a period of industrial growth. I shall deal with that in conjunction with the following point, namely, the growth of capital and the affect of that on the use of Bantu labour. In 1951&#x2014;and here I have taken the figures given in the White Paper&#x2014; the industrial production was R168,000,000 and according to Table G.6 of Union Statistics over 50 years 345,900 Bantu were employed in private industry. The Bantu then constituted 54 per cent of the total industrial labour force. Up to 1960 the production increased to R1,051,000,000 and the number of Bantu workers remained at 357,400. There was an enormous increase in industrial production of over R400,000,000 and there was an insignificant increase of 12,000 in the number of Bantu workers. But what is even more significant is that there was a steady decline in the percentage of Bantu industrial workers from year to year. In 1951 they constituted 54 per cent of the total number of industrial workers. In 1961 it had dropped to 51.8 per cent. In 1961 our industrial production increased to R1,125,000,000 but the number of Bantu workers actually declined and in 1962 there was a slight increase in the number of Bantu workers with a further increase in industrial production. In July, 1963, we attained an industrial production of R1,399,000,000 with 383,000 Bantu workers according to Table (B) of the aforesaid bulletin. I have already mentioned these figures but I want to mention them again. From 1951 to 1963 our industrial production increased from R618,000,000 to R1,399,000,000 and the number of Bantu workers increased from 375,000 to 383,000 over that period of nine years&#x2014;38,000 more Bantu, or a ten per cent increase against more than a 100 per cent increase in production. What has now become of the argument of hon. members&#x003F;</p>

<p>The whole situation is explained by the fact that we have developed an industrial structure of intensified capital in our cities. Unfortunately I cannot give the House the capital investment figures for the year 1951; the closest figure I can give is that for 1948. In 1948 capital investment in industry amounted to R296,000,000 and our annual production was R364,000,000, or 123 per cent of the investment. That capital investment rose to R913,000,000 in 1960 and eventually to an estimated R1,083,000,000 in 1962. What is significant is that as our capital investment increased there was a relatively slight decline in the value of production. In 1948 our production was 123 per cent of the capital investment because we had little machinery and many hands, but in 1962 our production was only 113 per cent of the capital investment because we had more machinery and fewer hands. In other words, the present pattern of our metropolitan industrial growth is not based on the employment of more Bantu labour, but on the more intensive use of capital by the acquisition of equipment and by using a more efficient labour force.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring briefly to what I really wanted to make the crux of the whole matter, namely, that the policy of the National Party offers the only solution to the problem of Bantu employment, namely, industries which use labour intensively, industries where they use little machinery but many hands and those must be established in the border areas and in the reserves. The Bantu must develop diverse economies. His agriculture must be expanded. How many prominent writers have not emphasized the fact that agriculture was the cheapest method and the method which absorbed the most human force to develop any under-developed country; to mention one, Bauer and Yamey in their &#x201C;Development of Under-Developed Countries&#x201D;. The Bantu must take up employment in his own business which form a very important employment factor in our White economy, and the public sector which is responsible for about 35 per cent of the employment in our White society, must develop alongside of him, and also his mining. The road which the National Party follows, therefore, offers the possibility of solving the problem of finding employment for the Bantu but the history of the past years has proved that that problem cannot be met by our metropolitan industrial development. Our industrial development has not led to greater integration but to a relative decrease in the number of Bantu employed and this country has prospered because the policy of the Nationalist Party has been carried out.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow him. I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that not being a member of the &#x201C;Gelukwensklub&#x201D;, which is the preserve of members opposite, I cannot congratulate him on his budget, but I can congratulate him on catching this fish, particularly since I understand that since we have had the 90-day detention clause even the fish are afraid to open their mouths.</p>

<p>The fish which the hon. the Minister caught is a very substantial one, but the Coloured people got very little. They only got some of the bones with a little flesh on them. Despite the pleas I have always made to this House to grant pensions not on the basis of colour but on the basis of need, this has not yet been done as I had hoped would be done in these days of prosperity. Nor do I see any change in what I must denounce very strongly as the starvation wages still being paid to the Coloureds in South Africa. I must point out to the hon. the Minister, as I said to the hon. the Minister of Transport, that to talk of the prosperity of this country is a misnomer as far as the Coloureds are concerned, particularly those who are working in the Government service, because they are not benefiting from this prosperity. I want to show the hon. the Minister of Finance to-day that Coloured people in the employ of the Government are receiving wages <span class="col_3387-3388" refersTo="page_0386"/>which are completely below the bread-line, on the basis of proper civilized standards. I was hoping that with this vast surplus which the Minister has he would not give largesse or charity to the Coloureds, but that he would give them what is their due. I have before me a note about the wages paid to some of the people in the canning industry, amounting to R7.66 a week, including cost of living. The Minister heard to-day some of the answers given by the Minister of Labour about the extra hours these people have to work; it is 46 hours a week plus 32 hours of overtime. It is true that they get paid for the overtime, but these people have to work almost 78 hours a week, and what are their wages&#x003F; R7.66, R6.50 and less.</p>

<p>The Government is a party to these wages, because these wages are fixed by Wage Board determinations. The Minister of Finance is <i>particeps criminis</i> to these low wages paid to the Coloureds. If the hon. member wants me to quote Government Departments I will do so. Take the Post Office, which is a Government Department. A Coloured youth starts there and after ten or twelve years&#x2019; service he gets R40 a month. He starts as a messenger and becomes a postman, and after ten or twelve years&#x2019; service he only earns R40 a month. Is that the wage which should be paid&#x003F; I was told yesterday that many of the Coloured men who earn R40 a month are men of 26 who want to get married, and they do not get cost of living allowance. Is this the standard that you want the Coloured man to live on&#x003F; Is it not a shame and a disgrace to the Government which has brought forward this big surplus, that the Coloured people should still be earning these miserable starvation wages&#x003F; When will you try to improve that standard&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then I come to this important question which has already been raised by some hon. members in regard to the importation into this country of skilled workers. Which other country in the world imports skilled workers when they have a reservoir of manpower sufficient to fill all the skilled posts required&#x003F; It is no use telling me that the Coloured man is incapable, because here in a Government publication there is the photograph of a young Coloured man who is so brilliant that he got his B.Sc. degree in science with honours and he is now studying nuclear physics, and there is not only this one. If they had the opportunities you would find thousands, but you still want to import labour without giving these Coloureds a chance, the chance that they deserve in their own country. No, you would rather have the imported article.</p>

I ask the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo)&#x2014;I know he is sympathetic to the Coloureds&#x2014;where will the Coloured boy go when he is educated&#x003F; I say there are to-day thousands of Coloured youths walking about looking for jobs, any jobs, but the Government imports people from overseas instead of training these Coloured youths in the technical services. They overlook them. We educate them, but that is all. Where can this Coloured youth with his B.Sc. degree go&#x003F; We have lost some of our most brilliant Coloured men. There is a Coloured youth who became a brilliant medical man and he is now a professor of medicine in America. We lost his services here because of colour prejudice. I say the time has come for the Government to throw off this Hottentot mentality that they have. That is a thing of the past.

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has raised important matters. He expressed the hope that his pleas would not fall upon deaf ears. I think he can take it that his pleas will be treated with the utmost sympathy. This side of the House is not indifferent to the matters raised by him. It is not for me to reply to him. I think the Minister can do so with more authority but I only want to say this to him that he cannot blame this Government solely for a state of affairs which has developed over many years. That was what he did and that was the impression he created and that was the impression the people in the Press gallery got from his speech. He is wrong in doing that and he should not do so again. Then he must also ask himself, seeing that this position had already obtained for many years before this Government came into power, how many professors of medicine there were at our universities at that time and how many of those people had the opportunity then of becoming what he wishes them to become under this Government. If he wants to be fair he should also paint the right picture to the Coloured population otherwise he creates the wrong impression and he will not serve the cause which is near to his heart. I shall leave his plea at that and say a few words about the Budget.</p>

<p>I want to say that this Budget is one which is in accordance with the best tradition of Budgets of the National Party Government. It is a Budget which, like its predecessors, engenders great confidence and which is evidence of a firm hand at the financial helm of this country. While I am talking about the helm let me also talk about the helmsman. On behalf of the country and this House I want to pay tribute to and thank that helmsman who has to stand at the helm and I want to convey to him my appreciation for the manner in which he is doing it. I think in years to come he will be known as one of the outstanding Ministers of Finance of South Africa, together with men like Mr. Havenga and Mr. Hofmeyr. In this financial era&#x2014;and it is an era&#x2014;where he has waved the wand over our finances he has put his stamp on the Budgets and on the financial structure of the country and that is a stamp of security and of great responsibility and prosperity.</p>

<p>This budget has strengthened still further that confidence which the country has in him and in the Government. The more I look at this Budget the more I like it. I would describe this Budget as an excellent, almost perfect, budget adapted to the demands and the circumstances of the period it has to serve. In 1962 the budget was directed at promoting the safety of the State. In 1963 the Budget was directed at promoting prosperity and progress in South Africa. To-day we have a Budget to promote continued growth as well as to consolidate the progress we have already made in the economic sphere and in ensuring the safety of the State.</p>

<p>I listened attentively to the Opposition and it seems to me they really have only one complaint against this Budget and they also wish to make a little political capital out of that which I do not hold against them. They ask: Of what benefit is this Budget to the ordinary man&#x003F; They base that charge on totally wrong arguments and premises. The first argument they advance is that revenue has been under-estimated. Hon. members had the opportunity of discussing the estimates of revenue for the ensuing year but I did not hear them say that the revenue for the year we are just entering has been under-estimated. The hon. the Minister said he had based his estimate for the following year on a 7&#x00BD; per cent growth in national production. Hon. members have not yet said that was wrong. They have not yet said that he was completely wrong in respect of next year, but most probably hon. members will again come next year and say we completely under-estimated the revenue last year as they are saying this year that we underestimated it last year. But what did they really say last year&#x003F; On the 25th of March, in col. 3,300 of Hansard, the hon. members for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) said the following last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We agree with the Minister in his general assessment of the present economic position when he cautiously says that generally the domestic economic conditions present a perceptible picture of economic revival, but that the rate of personal consumption remains subdued and that the rate of gross private investment is nearly static. We agree with the Minister.</block>

<p>Last year the hon. member for Constantia was in complete agreement with the hon. the Minister in his assessment of the economic position in South Africa as it was at the time. He did not tell the Minister at the time that he was under-estimating his revenue. The Minister&#x2019;s budget was directed at promoting growth and prosperity but at that time there was no guarantee yet that it would become a reality although there were signs of it; and the Minister based his Budget on that. Hon. members now come along afterwards and say: You under-estimated your revenue completely. But it is quite clear that they have not the slightest reason for saying that and it also very clear that the revenue has actually not been under-estimated. There has been a normal estimate of a normal expectancy and we are only too grateful that it is more than that but at that stage it was not an under-estimate at all.</p>

<p>Hon. members now go further and couple that with their next argument and that is the argument that we are over-taxing the public. That is actually what they are going to tell the people: You are being over-taxed; look at the surplus of the Minister of R88,000,000. But this surplus of R88,000,000 has nothing whatsoever to do with over-taxation. A portion of it is as a result of the wonderful, strong economic progress the country has made, and a very large portion is arrear taxation of previous years which has been paid. We have always had the <span class="col_3391-3392" refersTo="page_0388"/>position in South Africa and Ministers of Finance have always been in this fortunate position that they have had a nest-egg, tucked away, a nest-egg of arrear taxations of R40,000,000 or R50,000,000 or more. To use an agricultural expression the budgets were always based on the floor price. The Minister always knew that if anything went wrong with his calculations he still had that arrear amount tucked away and if things went all right he could use that to make concessions. But hon. members surely know that that nest-egg is now going to disappear. It is a dwindling asset; that is no longer something normal. This surplus of R88,000,000 of which a large share was due to that, is not something that they can hold out to the people as a normal surplus, something that can be handed out. That is also why their argument about over-taxation is completely wrong. Must we, like the Opposition ask, base our taxation proposals on that this year and make concessions on the strength of that only to find next year that we have not got it&#x003F; What do we do then&#x003F; Must we then tell the people that we are taking those concessions away&#x003F; Surely that would not be right. If we find next year that because of this new financial method and structure of the Minister&#x2019;s we can again show a similarly large surplus and that the growth has even been greater than he budgeted for this year, the Minister may probably consider it in the light of the circumstances which may then prevail. It is possible that relief may be granted later on, if the burden is so heavy, which I do not admit at all. This year, however, the Minister has handled the position correctly by devoting this large surplus to those matters to which he has devoted it, mainly to defence and Loan Account. We on this side of the House say that this careful way of the Minister&#x2019;s of drawing up his Budget has built up a reputation of financial stability and conservatism for South Africa which is of inestimable value to us particularly in overseas financial circles and we are not prepared to sacrifice that great asset of our country simply on the insistence of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I now come to their insistence that the ordinary man should get something. I want to point out that it is actually wrong to play off the ordinary man against other taxpayers in this Budget. It is wrong to argue that way because other people are not really benefited. The taxation curve is being ironed out here. There were people who were over-taxed in comparison with others. The Minister is only putting that right and surely the Opposition cannot object to everybody carrying the same burden relatively.</p>

<p>But I go further. If I understood the hon. member for Constantia correctly he did not plead for concessions in his amendment and in his speech. He knows perfectly well that in future there won&#x2019;t be arrear taxes that can be collected like this year. If I understood him correctly he said: &#x201C;Let us establish a fund; let us do what they did in 1933 when we left the gold standard; we did not give that money away; we established a fund and with the money in that fund we did certain things throughout the years; let us establish a similar fund&#x201D;. But the hon. member did not tell us whether he wanted to devote the entire fund this year to those things mentioned in his amendment; the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) did not tell us how much should be paid out in the form of agricultural subsidies; he did tell us what percentage should be paid out; he only said we should establish a fund. We still want to get clarity on that matter from the Opposition; they must tell us whether it is their intention to spend a portion of that fund this year still or what their plans are in connection with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what benefit does the ordinary man get from this Budget; what do we all get out of it&#x003F;</p>

<p>That hon. member says nothing. Five per cent, is at least being deducted from his income tax and I think he will welcome that; I do not think he will reject it. But he can forward his cheque for the full amount; he need not take that 5 per cent. What do we get out of this Budget&#x003F; What does the middle and the lower income groups in particular get out of this Budget: They get employment facilities out of this Budget; they get the opportunity of earning salaries. This Budget refers to a 68 per cent increase in approved building plans. Is that not fantastic&#x003F; That is what the ordinary man gets out of this Budget. This Budget refers to a 6&#x00BD; per cent increase in the real per capita income. Is that not something which the ordinary man has received&#x003F; This Budget refers to a 10&#x00BD; per cent increase in personal consumption. That is what the ordinary man gets out of this Budget. That is what the ordinary man wants. The ordinary man says: &#x201C;Give me work; give me an opportunity of earning money so as to provide for my wife and children; give me an opportunity of being promoted and of getting a salary increase; give me a Budget which will keep the wolf of inflation away from my door.&#x201D; That is what the ordinary man asks. He wants the money he earns to retain its purchasing power and that is what this Budget ensures for the ordinary man. I say, therefore, that this Budget is pre-eminently a Budget for the ordinary man.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) says the Minister should return certain moneys to the people but that he should just take it back somewhere else to reimburse Loan Account; he will then be spending the same amount of money. The hon. member did not plead for less money to be spent. What difference does it make whether you take the money from Revenue account and spend it or whether you take it out of Loan Account and spend it&#x003F; What difference does that make to inflation. In essence it cannot make any difference to inflation. The one is compulsory and the other is voluntary. If there were a danger of inflation I would imagine that its solution would really be much less effective <span class="col_3393-3394" refersTo="page_0389"/>than this other method adopted by the Minister, namely, the method of compulsory saving, the method of retaining taxation moneys.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to the points raised by the Opposition in connection with Defence. Hon. members agree that it is right that we spend money on defence but they say we should borrow that money. The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) said our defence expenditure was unproductive and that for that reason it would promote inflation. But he did not object to the expenditure on defence as such. If it were unproductive, why would it be less unproductive if you spent it under Loan Account. Surely that won&#x2019;t make it less unproductive. Why will it promote less inflation if you spend it under Loan Account than if you took that money from Revenue Account&#x003F; It remains exactly the same thing. However, I deny that it is unproductive. Of this amount of money a good 60 per cent will probably be spent inside South Africa. That money will be spent on material and stores; it will be spent on wages and it will promote other activities. I want to go further and say that with this defence expenditure we shall create security and stability and confidence in the country; it will attract investment. We have seen during the past years how investment capital has been attracted to South Africa. I cannot accept, therefore, that defence expenditure is completely unproductive. On the contrary I take it that that portion which is spent in your own country actually stimulates the economy of the country; it promotes the economic growth of your country and it sheds other fruits in other sectors of your economic life; as a matter of fact in all sectors of the economy.</p>

<p>The Opposition wants us to do all the things proposed in this Budget because they did not suggest that they should not be done, but they say the money should come from Loan Account. That is precisely the difference between that side and this side to-day and it has always been there. Throughout the years this side of the House has followed a policy, from which the hon. the Minister actually deviated slightly last year, of not increasing the national debt unnecessarily. In this connection I just want to tell hon. members opposite that your budgetry machinery is not inflexible; it is not something which you cannot change. You adapt it yearly to economic and financial circumstances. There is nothing whatsoever to prevent any Minister from defraying certain expenditure from Revenue Account one year and from Loan Account the next year. The difference between this side and that side of the House has always been that this side has said that if possible you should transfer your surplus to Loan Account and that you should then finance certain expenditure from that. That side on the contrary has always said that you should rather borrow that money. Mr. Speaker, we have a national debt to-day of R2,788,000,000 and I wish to point out to hon. members that since 1948, when the National Party came into power, R560,000,000 spent under Loan Account came from Revenue Account. But under the policy of that side of the House we would have had to borrow that money. Over these 15 years, in terms of their policy, we would have paid R214,000,000 interest on the amounts we would have had to borrow from year to year. Had we followed that policy we would have had to make provision for an additional R33,000,000 in our Estimates to cover interest. That is what those hon. gentlemen advocate. We think we are following the right policy and that it can be justified before the country. In 1948 when the Government took over our national debt was practically 77 per cent of our national income and to-day it is approximately 56 per cent. We can pay it off within 7 months from our revenue as the hon. the Minister said on one occasion. In 1948 practically 10 per cent of our expenditure was interest; this year it is only a little over 5 per cent. It is perfectly clear, therefore, that we are very careful with the country&#x2019;s money. We have done very well with the debts we shall be handing over to posterity, posterity who will in any case have many tasks to fulfil. Let us therefore saddle them with as little debt as possible. Of the money we owe to-day, we only owe 6 per cent to countries overseas, thanks to the policy of this Government. The balance we owe in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to make one suggestion to the hon. the Minister. On behalf of many people, I think, particularly on behalf of organized agriculture, I want to thank the hon. the Minister very sincerely for the concession in regard to estate duty. I do not know how my suggestion will affect the hon. Minister&#x2019;s Estimates but I at least want to ask that my suggestion be borne in mind in future. I am only asking for an investigation to be made by the Minister&#x2019;s officials, if possible, before he finalizes his Estimates, to ascertain how it will affect the Estimates if the concession he announced were to be made in respect of the first two children, namely, R12,500 per child and that a concession of R15,000 be made in respect of the third and fourth child and a bigger concession in respect of the fifth and sixth child or further children. I feel that where the father of a large family dies his estate should not be burdened on precisely the same basis as the estate of the man with only one child, because that child will in any case receive a relatively larger legacy. With a view to the promotion of a bigger White population, I think that is a suggestion, which the hon. the Minister may perhaps have investigated.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that the statement by the Opposition that nothing is done for the ordinary man in this Budget is absolutely without foundation. The arguments they advance in support of that statement, namely that revenue is being under-estimated and expenditure overestimated, and that the taxpayer is over-taxed in that way, is absolutely without foundation.</p>

<p>I know the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) will not expect me to follow him in his paean of praise of this Budget of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s. It is obvious <span class="col_3395-3396" refersTo="page_0390"/>that I intend to take the correct line, which is the direct opposite to the line taken by him. The part with which I do agree, however, is the first part of his speech in which he pointed out to us that there can be no question about it that next year we are going to meet much heavier taxation. I would like, however, to deal with some of the extraordinary figures used by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn), and I propose to do so very briefly. The hon. member was correlating human beings with machines. In the Bulletin of Statistics for January of this year the figures show that there was an increase in numbers employed from 1960, in manufacturing, of 18,000 Whites, 19,200 Coloureds and Asiatics and 29,000 Bantu. In the construction industry there was an increase of 2,600 in the number of White employees and an increase of 12,000 odd amongst the Bantu. Sir, to correlate figures of employment with construction and bring apartheid into it is surely an extraordinary mental process; it is completely unrealistic. The apartheid policy must be in poor shape when the Government has to put up its chief sophist to prove that getting blacker really means getting whiter, and I am sure that some time during the debate on the Estimates he will prove to us that black is white. He is a barrister and a very able barrister. He reminds me of George Robey&#x2019;s song on barristers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All day long I am standing at the Bar.</block>

<p>Proving white is black and black is white.</p>

<p>Sir, I now want to proceed with my own speech. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is on his way to Geneva to attend the United Nations Trade and Development Conference. A hard task faces him. I cannot wish him harm, obviously, but the task will be hard. The Afro-Asians are bound to try to get South Africa out of the Conference, and then the question of our relationship with GATT, will arise. Of course, when one sees how this particular Conference is made up one wonders how far they are going to get. I cannot imagine that they are going to get very far, but there is no shadow of doubt that from this Conference matters are going to be referred to GATT., and it will require all our ingenuity if we are not to be adversely affected.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was saying that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs was on his way to Geneva and that I thought that a very hard task faced him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we were forced out of the Commonwealth great fears were expressed about the future of our primary products which were enjoying the benefit of Imperial preference, which might be lost if and when the United Kingdom joined the European Common Market. As things turned out, President de Gaulle prevented the joining of the Market by Britain, but all the other members of the Market are in favour of such admission. These fears of ours in regard to our exports in the future have been lulled somewhat with the passage of time, but what is the true position&#x003F; Many people are certain that political forces added to economic forces are bound to bring Britain into the Common Market, and the fears we held when the Prime Minister took us out of the Commonwealth will then return. Mr. Speaker, at that time Imperial preferences helped something around R100,000,000 worth of our primary products, and the preferences amounted to something around R10,000,000, in many instances representing the difference between a profit and a loss for much of our farming produce, more particularly fruit. Sir, we are facing this danger again. Those in this Government who hope for our present easy position to continue, in which we accept benefits without accepting responsibilities, and who hoped for a final break-up of the Common Market at Brussels last December after General de Gaulle had issued his most recent ultimatum, were disappointed, as a number of compromises were effected and the Common Market is now on sufficient common ground again to give us hope that in the Kennedy round-discussion to be held later in the year positive progress in the cutting of international tariffs will be made.</p>

<p>And where do we stand, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; The U.S. Information Service issued on 6 March 1964 says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United States has asked the world&#x2019;s major trading nations to amend the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to promote the economic growth and trade of developing nations. The amendments are contained in a new draft chapter to the General Agreement. Mr. Evans emphasized that the U.S. proposal would translate into written obligations many practices that are already a part of GATT. The American proposal provides: (a) A statement of objectives that contracting parties should undertake to increase trade of developing nations; (b) a series of commitments to reduce or eliminate as rapidly as possible tariffs and other barriers to imports of developing countries; (c) an amendment to the General Agreement to allow developing nations to restrict trade imports because of balance of payment problems; (d) a proposal that all GATT members take action to stimulate the export potential of developing nations.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are not a developing nation in the sense of this quotation. This Government claims that we are or can be the workshop of Africa. That is true but unfortunately <span class="col_3397-3398" refersTo="page_0391"/>Africa will not take our products. If we are not a developing nation and if GATT accepts the American proposal we will have a lot of competition&#x2014;some in existence already, others to be developed from these so-called developing countries.</p>

<p>If GATT approves these proposals and the United Kingdom does join the Common Market&#x2014;and my own view is that both these things will happen&#x2014;our position is certainly going to be parlous indeed. This Government&#x2019;s policy precludes us from trading with our natural customers in the north, for the products of our factories, and certainly only a very small proportion of our factories can produce goods at a price competitive with that of similar goods from, say, Japan. Mr. Speaker, this may be a gloomy picture I am painting, but I hope the Minister will tell us something of the plans he has laid for Geneva, for GATT and the Common Market and that he will also tell us whether, if the Afro-Asians demand our expulsion from any association with GATT whatever, he will then retreat further into the isolation into which we are so rapidly going. I do hope the hon. the Minister will tell us something on that subject because it is most important.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to turn to the so-called border industries, the industries on the so-called borders of the reserves, with particular reference to the effect of this so-called policy&#x2014;I repeat &#x201C;so-called policy&#x201D;&#x2014;on the Witwatersrand. I must point out at this moment, too, that the question of the marginal gold mines is inextricably interwoven with the question of industries on the borders of the reserves, and I want to ask whether these industries on the so-called borders are to be assisted to compete unfairly with industries on the Reef, or will new industries that wish to establish themselves on the Reef obtain the same assistance&#x003F; Sir, after ten years of pleading from this side of the House the Government has at last agreed to assist marginal mines by a scheme which, in the words of the Minister, is intended to lengthen the life of the mines concerned. The Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principal object of both schemes is to lengthen the life of the mines concerned. This will not only help the mine employees but also give more time to the communities serving those mines to adapt themselves to changing conditions. It will permit a considerable quantity of gold to be mined which would otherwise be lost to the country and will enable the relative mines to resume full, profitable production, if and when the price of gold is increased.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this seemed a sound proposition on Budget day and in my opinion the recent statement of the hon. the Minister of Mines has removed to a considerable degree the fear that shareholders were to be the forgotten men in the proposals. Sir, the scheme is such a simple and obvious one that one cannot help sighing when one realizes that a little competent thought given to this matter in years gone by would have paid the country tremendous dividends. Think of all the gold locked up in mines which have already closed down&#x2014;gold lost to us for ever&#x2014;an enormous price for the country to pay for the incompetence of the various Ministers of Mines in the past. I say &#x201C;in the past&#x201D;; I exclude the present Minister; I must be fair.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to digress for a moment to point out that the present large Government spending on defence and the police, plus the shortage of skilled manpower, which in turn is accentuated by the demand for defence training, provides the classic situation for inflation. This present war situation in which we find ourselves is in our country for ever, while this Government is in power. During the last war we could charge and did charge half of defence costs to Loan Account as we could see an end to the conflict and we knew that it was only fair to leave something over for posterity to carry, but now we can see no end to this expenditure. Can this Government under these circumstances hold the fort against inflation for long if the expenditure under these heads continues on the present scale&#x003F; Sir, the mining industry is a sitting duck, with a fixed price for its product, for inflation, and it will probably be necessary to expand the present scheme to a very considerable degree in the future. The Government must keep a close watch on the situation. Much more assistance will be needed in the future if this much-desired increase in the price of gold does not materialize. Perhaps the Government will soon be forced to devalue unilaterally&#x2014;who knows&#x003F; Judging by the way they are going it may be forced on us. The way they have run the country over the last 15 years, Sir, anything can happen. I have said that the question of the marginal gold mines is inextricably interwoven with the establishment of industries on the borders of the reserves and the establishment of industries on the Reef to replace the mines. The hon. the Minister has said&#x2014;these are his own words&#x2014;&#x201C;this help will give the communities serving those mines more time to adapt themselves to changing conditions&#x201D;. Sir, I want to say again that if this help to the marginal mines is right to-day it was right ten years ago. But that help was not given to them and it has cost the country plenty. I repeat what the Minister has said that this will give those communities more time to adapt themselves to changing conditions. This means, of course, that they will have time to establish or to help to establish industries to replace these marginal mines as they go out of existence. Unfortunately, Sir, this is only lip service. The whole future of the towns on the Witwatersrand really lies in the hands of a Department other than that of the Minister of Economic Affairs and the hon. the Minister of Finance. I must say the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs himself cannot be accused of assisting the establishment of industries on the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p><span class="col_3399-3400" refersTo="page_0392"/>Mr. Speaker, I have no objection, nor can anyone on the Witwatersrand have any objection, to the decentralization of industry provided competition remains fair and that the industrialist who wants to start on the Reef is not faced with extreme pressure from Government Departments when deciding for himself where he will start his factory. Let us look at a few statements by Ministers or officials: The Deputy Minister of Mines said in Alberton that no industry with a proportion of more than one Black to one White would be allowed to start in that area.</p>

<p>I think I have made my point. The hon. Minister of Economic Affairs recently said in Johannesburg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Johannesburg was in danger of becoming a White island encircled by a Black sea because of the over-concentration of industries,&#x201D; said the Minister of Economic Affairs. &#x201C;Only those industries which were predominantly dependent on African labour were encouraged to go to the border areas. Those dependent on White labour were encouraged to remain in White areas. Stories about the immense cost of developing border industries were exaggerated. It was cheaper to establish industries there than in urban areas.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration said recently, when talking to the municipal people on the Reef&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was the responsibility of every municipality to acquaint itself with the factual position of the presence of Africans in its area and to take the necessary steps to stop urbanization. The process of urbanization of the Bantu in European areas must clearly be stopped and you already have the means at your disposal. By applying the relative clause of the Bantu Urban Areas Act, the registration regulations and the labour bureau regulations can at least curtail the process. It may call for adaptations by people who like to have an unlimited labour force at their disposal. That I grant you: We will have to adapt ourselves. He warned that if employers did not co-operate wholeheartedly with the authorities in their efforts to restrict the number of Africans to a minimum, it may be necessary to make provision for more strict action against employers.</block>

<p>What pompous arrogance, Mr. Speaker. Then the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs told us years ago: &#x201C;When it is the question of the survival of the nation, that nation is prepared to bend and to break and to sacrifice economic laws.&#x201D; And how he has succeeded in doing this!</p>

<p>Sir, without sufficient labour a factory cannot continue. How on earth are we going to attract industries to the Reef in the face of these remarks&#x003F; What factories exist in which the proportion of Whites to Blacks is one to one&#x003F; I ask the Minister to give us even one example. The process of killing off industry on the Reef is already in being. In Roodepoort, the constituency of the hon. Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, a cement factory was forced to move a branch to Rosslyn, a so-called border area, because it could not get any more labour locally. Rosslyn is on the border of Pretoria&#x2014;they have more Whites in Pretoria than we have in Johannesburg. Rosslyn is on the border of Pretoria, no further away from that town than Soweto is from Johannesburg.</p>

<p>My further information is that if a factory wishes to open in this country and has to import plant and machinery it is hampered in every direction, and to all intents and purposes it is told it will not get the necessary foreign exchange to pay for that plant unless it opens where the Government wants it to. And that place is not the Reef. What is going to happen to the Reef towns&#x003F; The Minister of Finance says they are being given time to adjust themselves to changing conditions; the Minister of Bantu Administration and the Minister of Economic Affairs say they will not allow them to adjust themselves to these condtions, while the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs says both things. Mr. Speaker, Alice in Wonderland is part of this country.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the costs involved in this crazy scheme of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s to force industry to go where he wants it, to please his racial prejudices and flout economic laws, as the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs has already said he is prepared to do. In Zwelitsha the cost they have invested per Native employee is approximately R2,666. The report of the Permanent Committee for Location of Industry and the Development of Border Areas states that it will cost R5,300,000 to give employment to 1,850 persons. I have worked that out and it comes to an average of R2,865 per person. In Britain in the new towns it costs approximately R2,400 per person. In Rosslyn up to 31 October 1963 R1,159,660 had been spent plus R36,000-odd on railways. Personal inquiries reveal that approximately 165 Natives were employed there.</p>

<p><span class="col_3401-3402" refersTo="page_0393"/>This means a cost of over R7,000 per head. I could go on quoting instance after instance in which cost per Native employed in new industries on the borders of the reserves is brought in.</p>

<p>Dr. du Toit Viljoen, replying to a question at the Convention of the Federated Chamber of Industries, stated that the country&#x2019;s big problem was not raising wages but finding work for 132,000 South Africans per year, of whom 100,000 were Africans, and that the cost, going back to previous figures, would then be R700,000,000 per year to find work for 100,000 Africans. It has been calculated by industrialists on the Reef that it costs &#x00A3;4,500 per White employee, taken that factor as the standard, to establish an industry on the Reef as against &#x00A3;9,000 on the new gold fields. And it will be exactly the same in respect of the new so-called border industries.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I charge this Government, firstly, that the assistance to the marginal mines is very late; it should have been given years ago. Secondly, that far from encouraging industry to come to the Reef, every effort is being made to discourage it. Thirdly, it is allowing Reef municipalities to spend time and money on inviting factories to come there without any scheme to assist them. I understand from the Press that in Randfontein an approach was made to buy an English textile mill, lock, stock and barrel, and set it up there. Textiles employ a large ratio of Black labour, Sir. It is rather extraordinary that this should have been started by the Randfontein Municipality and I would be interested to know whether that particular industry would be allowed to start there. The fourth charge is that the cost relating to these efforts to send industry to the so-called borders of the reserves is beyond the country&#x2019;s resources, to such an extent that it can only be called a bluff, a bluff, however, which is hurting the Reef, every town on the Reef. If I am wrong, I hope the Minister will tell me where.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, can anyone tell me why the Government refuses to allow the Reef to be one influx control or labour area&#x003F; The municipalities want this, industry wants this, commerce wants this, the people want this and the country needs this. I hope I will get a reply to that question too.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place I should like to pay homage to my predecessor, Dr. Carel de Wet, who is to-day occupying the high position of ambassador in Great Britain. I also wish to thank him for the extremely efficient manner in which he represented the Vanderbijlpark constituency during the past 11 years. Dr. de Wet was not only the representative of his constituency but he also did his duty towards his nation and his country and no sacrifice was ever too great for him. On behalf of our constituency I should like to place on record our gratitude for what he has meant to Vanderbijlpark. Being as efficient as he is I also believe he will fulfil his task extremely efficiently and that he will win many friends for the Republic of South Africa. We know the Jeremiahs were very sceptical and cynical after the announcement of his appointment but to judge from the report which appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning he was a big success at his first public appearance. I just wish to read that report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">New Ambassador puts No Foot Wrong: In a special report to me our man in London says Dr. Carel de Wet made an excellent impression when he addressed the Savoy Hotel diners this week. It is already clear that whatever he may have said in the rough and tumble of the South African politics Dr. de Wet does not intend to put a foot wrong in London. There was a large attendance to hear Dr. de Wet and he went down well.</block>

<p>However, I leave it at that.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to the phenomenal industrial development which is taking place to-day in the Vaal triangle and more specifically to the more beneficial use we can make of our labour force in that area. You will forgive me, Sir, when I say that the most rapid industrial development is to-day taking place in the Vaal triangle. The Vaal triangle consists of Sasolburg, Vereeniging and Vanderbijlpark and that area may be regarded as the future heartland of our industrial areas. As you probably know within the next few years R86,000,000 will be spent there on extending Sasol plus/minus R20,000,000 on the Union Steel Corporation, R5,500,000 on extending the Vanderbijl Engineering Works Corporation, better known as Vikor, the biggest and heaviest engineering firm in the southern hemisphere and plus/minus R560,000,000 on extending Iscor, of which the major portion will be spent in Vanderbijlpark.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these extensions will obviously mean a tremendous increase in the production of these industries and an increase in the labour force as well. I think the extension to the steel works at Vanderbijlpark which are to-day producing 1,250,000 tons steel ingots per annum will increase that production to 2,100,000 and eventually, after the second phase of the extension programme has been completed, to 2,700,000 tons steel ingots per annum. As I have already said this will mean that these factories and industries will have to be staffed and that they will have to increase their personnel. That staff will have to be found. Before I continue to try to find a solution I first want to analyse the personnel employed by such an industry. I wish to divide the personnel into two groups. The first is the monthly paid staff which consists of the administrative staff, technicians, scientists, etc. In the second group you find the daily paid worker or the worker who gets paid per hour, and that group in turn may be sub-divided in three further groups, namely, the artisans and they comprise electro-mechanicians, fitters and turners, riggers, plumbers and so forth; <span class="col_3403-3404" refersTo="page_0394"/>the third group consists of the apprentices and the fourth group of the operators to whom I shall return later.</p>

<p>We can meet the demand for manpower which will arise as a result of this extension to our industries by means of (a) immigration, (b) the better utilization of our existing manpower and (c) improving the productivity of the employee. I first want to deal with immigration. The position is, and industrialists in that area do this, that they concentrate on recruiting immigrants, particularly technicians and artisans, on the continent of Europe and in the United Kingdom. But whether the demand can be met in that way is doubtful. I then turn to the next method which is the better utilization of our existing labour force. I, therefore, also welcome the idea expressed by the hon. the Deputy Minister at Durban, namely, that we should make better use of our existing manpower.</p>

<p>I said I would return to the operating group. Who and what is the operating group in industry&#x003F; The operating group consists of the unskilled man, the non-artisan. For one reason or another he has not undergone vocational training. It may have been due to financial reasons that he did not undergo that training when he entered the industry. We find a further group amongs them, the group which consists of those persons who came from the platteland, who did not have any vocational training and who had to seek refuge in industry. If we analyse the Industrial Reconciliation Act we find that 227 posts were created for operators, each one on his own guaranteed scale of pay. We find that only in respect of 21 of those 227 posts is it possible for the operator to earn more than the artisan. When we consider that in most cases the artisan is paid either an incentive bonus or a merit allowance, we find that not in the case of any of those 227 posts can the salary exceed that of an artisan. I think this is particularly the pool from which we can strengthen the ranks of our artisans.</p>

<p>The industrialists have the necessary facilities to train apprentices and I also believe it is the duty of the industrialists to do their duty towards the country in that respect and to avail themselves of those same facilities to give adult training to this group of operators of whom we can make much better use in future. That, however, will give rise to one problem, Mr. Speaker. In most cases you will find that those operators are married men and they will have to be financially assisted during their period of training. But the industrialist must not lose sight of the fact that such an employee who undergoes that adult training will not be totally unproductive during that period. From the second to the third years he will practically be 50 per cent or 60 per cent productive and I go so far as to say that in his final years he will probably be 100 per cent productive as far as the industrialist is concerned.</p>

<p>Then I think there is a group of which we do not make the best possible use and that group consists of those persons over 45 years of age. What happens in practice&#x003F; Persons of that age who apply lor employment to the industrialists is regarded sceptically. He is regarded as old and decrepit. I think the industrialist must be conditioned in this respect to realize that those people can still mean a great deal to industry. The industrialist is only too inclined&#x2014;naturally I am talking about people over the age of 45 who are still physically strong and healthy&#x2014;to consider those people for less important work in industry only or of placing them in sheltered employment. I believe we can supplement our labour force from that source.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the increased productivity of the worker. Here I specially have in mind the person in the lower income group; the person with a big family and who carries a heavy financial burden. If you have such a person in your employ you cannot expect high productivity from him if he has financial worries. I think in particular of the lower paid group in the steel industry. I want to say immediately that it would be a very popular idea if I were to plead for increase salaries; I take it the wages laid down in industrial agreements were arrived at and based on assessment value and the value of the post. If you were to plead for higher wages for the lower paid group you would upset the entire wage structure completely. As I have said here I have in mind in particular the lower paid group in the steel industry. Iscor provides housing for them and we are grateful for that. House rent is also subsidized so that an employee does not pay more than 20 per cent of his gross income in house rent. I earnestly want to plead that industrialists should not base that subsidy on a fixed percentage of income alone but that they should have a sliding scale. An employee with an income of less than R140 per month should not have to pay, say, more than 15 per cent of his gross income in house rent. Then there should be a further concession of, say, &#x00BD; per cent or 1 per cent, for every additional member of the family. In other words, an employee who earns less than R140 per month with five children, and it is calculated on &#x00BD; per cent, will then not pay more than 12&#x00BD; per cent of his income in house rent. I think if that employee could be met in that way we would have a happier employee; the labour turnover in industries will immediately be smaller and the production per employee will increase.</p>

<p>In conclusion I hope you will allow me, Sir, where I have already said that I represented the Vanderbijlpark constituency, Vanderbijlpark with its population of 60,000, White and non-White, and whose existence is directly due to the steel industry of Iscor, to pay tribute to the then Government who had the courage, the daring, the conviction and the confidence to establish our own steel industry. Iscor offers employment to-day to plus/minus 14,500 Whites and 14,000 non-Whites. During <span class="col_3405-3406" refersTo="page_0395"/>the last fiscal year R35,800,000 was paid out in the form of salaries and wages. The consumer had the benefit, in comparison with imported steel, of buying the South African product at plus/minus R27 per ton cheaper; by using our own South African steel there has therefore been a total saving of R44,000,000.</p>

<p>When we consider how costs of production have increased from 1939 to 1963 we find that the percentage increase in respect of all South African products has been 176 per cent. We now come to steel. The production cost of steel has increased by 126 per cent over the period 1939 to 1963. The production cost of steel in the United States of America has increased by 164 per cent; in the United Kingdom by 282 per cent, in Belgium by 305 per cent; in Australia, 313 per cent. I just want to make this further point that had the steel which Iscor placed on the local market been imported the costs in the form of foreign exchange would have amounted to approximately R141,000,000. To this must be added approximately R18,000,000 earned in foreign exchange by exporting steel. That brings the total amount of foreign exchange to approximately R159,000,000 because of the availability of Iscor steel. That has indeed been an achievement and we cannot pay too great a tribute to the then Government for having established our own steel industry in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, it is my pleasant task to congratulate the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Mr. Henning) on his maiden speech and on the manner in which he has delivered it. It is obvious that he is talking as a person with knowledge of the problems of the industries in his constituency. I think from that point of view, his acquisition to this House should be welcomed, especially in view of the need on the Government side for members who can talk with authority on industrial and economic matters. I do hope that all the speeches which the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark delivers in this House in future will be directed on that high plane. I welcome him to this House.</p>

<p>Budget surpluses seem to have become a traditional way of life in South Africa, and this year&#x2019;s Budget has certainly been no exception. The introduction of P.A.Y.E. has blurred the picture considerably, and made it very difficult for members to get a correct assessment of just what is at play in the economy of this country. It cannot be guessed with any accuracy, Sir, how much of the income-tax collections which were estimated at R581,000,000 for 1963-4 will come up to that figure, but it is quite clear that it will be considerably more. In that regard we must take cognizance of what is taking place as far as budgeting for defence is concerned. These increases are going to be a part of our legacy for having a Nationalist Government. We must accept it, Sir, that as long as that party is in power the increase in budgeting for defence will go on and on and on. The average taxpayer, therefore, cannot look forward to any concessions of tax in the future. Over and above that, we have the position as expressed by the horn the Minister of Finance, from which it is evident that he is as afraid of inflation as a cat is of watr. He feels that the public&#x2019;s ability to spend or invest by making any tax concessions to them, will have an inflationary effect. But what is the true position&#x003F; Inflation is invariably brought about when there is a shortage of manpower resulting in too much money chasing too few goods. But in South Africa we have that problem further accentuated by the fact that there is too much money chasing too few men. The Budget has provided millions and millions of rand for guns and bombs for the survival of White South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; but nothing at all to husband the country&#x2019;s White manpower resources. Perhaps the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) will tell me how he is going to improve that position and give a &#x201C;Hear, hear&#x201D; in that regard. It is irresponsible remarks and actions like those of the hon. member for Cradock which are responsible for the wastage of brainpower from this country. The people who are leaving this country are people whom we can ill afford to lose. I should like to make a sincere appeal to the hon. member for Cradock and other members on that side of the House not to introduce any element whatsoever into this House, or outside this House, that will have a frightening effect on South African citizens, and cause them to stop to worry about their security and happiness in this country! We have to spend millions and millions in replacing these emigrants. Is it necessary to do so, when we can retain these people in our country&#x003F; This shortage of skilled labour and management, on the other hand, can lead to nothing else but inflation and the wasteful use of our resources. We can ill afford either of these adverse consequences, especially from a long-term point of view.</p>

<p>Sir, the abundance of capital available at the present time is attributable very largely to the outstanding contribution that gold mining has made to our balance of payments, and I would like to indicate here what has happened in the last six years by giving comparisons of output as far as gold, merchandise exports and industrial exports are concerned. What do we actually find&#x003F; For the last six years the gold output has increased by more than 50 per cent; merchandise exports increased by only 10 per cent in value, and the export of industrial products increased by very little indeed. It is exactly this situation, Sir, that should be receiving priority consideration, priority for the need of an intensive export drive in order to provide for the eventual diminution in the production of gold mining. Sir, there is no industry that can be established in South Africa <span class="col_3407-3408" refersTo="page_0396"/>that can provide the same value of exports as one individual gold mine. In that regard, I would like to bring to the attention of hon. members what the gold-mining industry has really meant to this country over, say, the last six years only. In doing so, I would like hon. members to realize the wonderful nest-egg that the Minister of Finance has got in his hands for the next six or eight years in the form of extra taxation from our gold mines; the newly established and rich gold mines which have come into production and which from now onwards will start paying taxation. What do we find, Sir&#x003F; Taxation for the year ended 31 December 1958 amounted to R40,000,000, taxation for the year ended 31 December 1962 was R109,000,000&#x2014;an increase in four years of 172 per cent! 172 per cent increase in taxation that has accrued to the Minister.</p>

<p>About 38 per cent. What was the position likely to be in approximately 1969&#x003F; According to estimates, approximately between R139,000,000 to R145,000,000 will accrue to the Treasury in taxation. With all that in hand, surely the Government, which has been fully aware of this nest-egg, should have been able five and six years ago to make better provision for declining mines on the Witwatersrand, and should not have waited until they were egged on, forced on, cudgelled from this side of the House, in order to do something for those declining mines. Sir, we remember only too well the expressions of disgust on the face of the Minister of Mines and the hon. Minister of Finance every time when we brought up the question that something must be done for the declining gold mines, and although they had a report way back in 1957, making recommendations as to the manner in which concessions could be made to these declining mines, we had to wait seven years after that report, to see a simple scheme as the one now evolved bearing fruit. I would like to ask the hon. Minister of Finance in his reply to give us some clarity as to which mines&#x2014;not necessarily stating them by name&#x2014;will receive the benefit of this taxation concession. Does it mean that it will only be mines which are already showing a working loss to which this concession will be applied&#x003F; Or will it be a mine which is on the verge of going over to a loss, which will also be given this concession&#x003F; From the wording of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s statement it would appear that a mine has to be showing a loss before this concession will become available. I hope that the hon. Minister of Finance will, however, decide that an approved mine can also mean a mine about to show a loss, because we think that that is necessary for the future.</p>

<p>I was interested, and pleased, to see the relaxation of import control which was given on Thursday, and this no doubt will relieve liquid pressure on our capital in the country. Also it will assist to make our local industry more competitive. And when we refer to a more competitive industrial attitude and approach, one cannot help criticizing the attitude of the Government in the establishment of the Cyril Lord factory at East London. I want to discuss this as one of the incompatibilities of the Government&#x2019;s approach towards industrialization in South Africa. I do not want to discuss whether the Government has &#x201C;been taken for a ride&#x201D;, in the purchase and the valuation of the machinery that is in that factory.</p>

<p>What is your opinion&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>I think that has been discussed in Another Place, with effect. But I would like to discuss the effect it is going to have on the cost of living of the ordinary man in the street. What do we find here&#x003F; We find that whereas it was the intention, or the Cyril Lord people made it known, that they would spin and weave greycloth in this country, and thereby establish another industry, it is now apparent that they are doing nothing of the sort. They are importing the greycloth, the loom-state, from Japan in its raw condition and they are only finishing it off here in South Africa. But in order to finish it off, and to give this factory preference over other factories in South Africa and over the imported article, we find that the rebate which existed before and which is anything from 9c to 15c per yard, has now been withdrawn. The effect of that has been that all cloth has gone up by that amount of rebate. The imported cloth that has to be brought into the country is now practically the same price as the combined price of the cloth that is being manufactured from its unfinished condition. The effect of this Government decision is that it is going to push up the price of an article such as a shirt by anything from 50c to 75c, the price of a blouse by anything from 27c upwards, and the price of a skirt by roughly 22c upwards. All this has been done in order to carry out an ideological policy that the Government has embarked upon as far as establishing industries on the borders is concerned. In order to give employment to 200-odd Whites and 1,200 Bantu, the people of this country are going to pay roughly between R3,000,000 and R3,500,000 in extra duty, for household commodities such as shirts, pyjamas, blouses, nightdresses, and so on, and then it will still not be possible for this factory to produce anything like the consumption in the country. At the most they will be producing 3,000,000 yards of finished material, whereas the country requires roughly 30,000,000 yards. So in order to enable this factory, one day, to manufacture 3,000,000 yards of shirting and poplin, duties are being placed on 27,000,000 yards of poplin which will have to be imported into this country all the same. What it all amounts to is that for the sake of employing <span class="col_3409-3410" refersTo="page_0397"/>a few thousand workers in this Bantustan area, and giving impetus to the border factory policy, the Government has succeeded in disrupting an entire industry and making the public pay heavily for this policy! I believe that the Government did not believe that this Cyril Lord manoeuvre would ever be exposed and brought under close scrutiny, because the duties which have now been imposed on these everyday household commodities are actually more per year than the whole cost of establishing this particular factory. The question that we have to ask ourselves is: Where is this going to stop&#x003F; Is this not just the beginning of a policy which the Government is going to pursue, regardless of what it will cost the country&#x003F; If I am wrong in that assumption, will the hon. the Minister indicate to me whether a similar factory has not been established at Rosslyn&#x2014;a border area&#x2014;and the same principle being followed there&#x003F; I refer to the establishment of a button factory in Rosslyn, where duty and preferences are now being given to this border industry for the manufacture of plastic buttons, metal buttons and leather buttons. All of these articles were coming in previously, free of any duty. This factory, however, is only producing plastic buttons, on which a duty is now being placed; it is not producing metal buttons and leather buttons, but a duty has been placed on those two commodities as well! You therefore have the fact that every commodity on which buttons are used is now going up in price. Take boiler-suits, overalls, where metal buttons are used on those garments&#x2014;they are all being pushed up in price. These two commodities are not being manufactured here, but in order to encourage this factory to come to the border of a Bantu reserve, duties were willingly imposed in respect of all these articles. We on this side of the House and the public are definitely concerned that this situation should not continue, that the public must become aware of how far the Government is determined to go in order to make border industries a success, because if border industries are not a success, then Bantustans are not a success, and if Bantustans are not a success, the Government must fall. So the rest of us become expendable, as the hon. member for Benoni has very clearly shown&#x2014;the rest of the country is regarded as expendable, but this policy must be pursued and must succeed.</p>

<p>May I conclude with a fervent request to the Minister to make one facility, at least, available to the Witwatersrand, to make the East Rand feel that we are not the &#x201C;Cinderella&#x201D; children of this country, that we do matter, that we do count, and ask him if he will not assist the hon. Minister of Transport to make roughly R10,000,000 available for the construction of our urgently needed South Main Reef Road. This road has been recommended as an urgency. There are 12 members in this House&#x2014;three of whom are Cabinet Ministers&#x2014;all of whom have given their blessing to this road and it has been established that it is a necessity for the industrial development of the East Rand and the Eastern Transvaal. The hon. Minister of Transport tells us, however, that this country cannot find R10,000,000 out of his R88,000,000 surplus in order to construct this urgently needed road, which will link up the Witwatersrand, all the East Rand towns and the Eastern Transvaal. If anything is criminal and if anything shows disregard, then it is this neglect of the building of this road. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to show some consideration and make the R10,000,000 available to the East Rand and the Eastern Transvaal.</p>

<p>I wish to associate myself with the congratulations which have been extended to the Minister of Finance for this outstanding Budget and the financial success attained this year.</p>

<p>Let me immediately tell the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) that it was a revelation to us to learn that it was United Party policy to make strenuous objection to defence expenditure, particularly to money spent on heavy machinery, defence machinery, etc. Can we take it that that is the direction the United Party will follow in future and what is their object, in these difficult times in which we are threatened from all sides, in objecting to defence expenditure&#x003F; We must get clarity on that point because if that is the direction they want to follow we shall definitely make it known to the public.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to a point raised by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) with reference to the matter dealt with by the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Keyter). He said that had the United Party been in power they would have imported at least 1,000,000 Whites as immigrants to this country annually.

The minute wages go up production costs go up.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the third leg of the amendment of the Opposition which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; subsidize certain basic foodstuffs to a greater extent with a view to increasing local consumption &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; diminishing the need for exporting these products at a loss to the producer.</block>

<p>Surely the most important basic foodstuff is maize. When you use maize various products of the country are affected. The hon. member says it should be subsidized to a greater extent. Maize is used in two ways. Human consumption accounts for the greater percentage of mealies consumed; more than two-thirds of the mealies produced are consumed by man. It is still the cheapest food to eat in South Africa. The maize consumed by man is subsidized by the Government to the extent of 34.5 cents per bag. Let me say at once that the Government does not subsidize maize which is exported but it subsidizes the local market. The subsidy in respect of maize for animal consumption is even higher, namely, an additional 15 cents. That has been the position for a number of years already. That means that maize for animal consumption is subsidized to the tune of 50 cents per bag. During the years that maize for animal consumption has been subsidized the consumption has hardly increased but human consumption has increased. We now want to know this from the hon. member: If a 35-cent subsidy by the State is not sufficient in the case of maize for human consumption and a subsidy of 50 cents in the case of maize for animal consumption what does he expect&#x003F; The hon. member pleaded in particular for the subsidy to be increased in the case of maize for animal consumption. It will then have to be subsidized by even more than 50 cents per bag if you want to increase the consumption. Only then will you be able to absorb the greater portion of the 70,000,000 or 65,000,000 bags which are produced in this country.</p>

<p>What about the railage&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in the case of local consumption, you still have the railway rebate of 37&#x00BD; per cent. The mealies which are exported are not subsidized by the Government. That would also be in conflict with existing international agreements. That is the reason why a loss is suffered on the export of maize, because in the case of export maize the full railage to the sea ports has to be paid; the 37&#x00BD; per cent rebate is not allowed in that case. We should like to know from the hon. member what increased consumption does he expect; does he think it will be such as to have been worth while&#x003F; The hon. member for Kensington laughed when the hon. member for Ladybrand referred to the wool levy. But according to this amendment that levy should not only be used in the case of wool. In the case of maize 90 per cent of the levy is paid by the maize farmers and the hon. member referred specifically to the R14,000,000 and the R4,000,000 levy in the Stabilization Fund. He says that must now be used to reduce the price and to subsidize the local market. Is the hon. member in favour of the one product subsidizing the other&#x003F; If he is then the hon. member for Ladybrand was quite right when he asked why we should not be allowed to use the wool levy to feed our sheep so that we can produce a better quality wool for which there will then be a better market. The principle is the same. Is the hon. member pleading for that&#x003F; He says the maize farmers should use their levy to subsidize certain other products so that those products may be sold more cheaply. Does the hon. member wish to apply that principle in respect of the wool levy as well&#x003F; Should we also use the wool levy for subsidization&#x003F;</p>

<p>We want to know from the hon. member to what extent he thinks we should go. The hon. member drafted his motion without thinking any further about the matter; without thinking how far we should go, and how the position of the one farmer would be justified as against that of the other. He thinks there will be a tendency towards lower prices if the product of the one farmer subsidized that of another. If he says the Government should do that I want to put this question to him: How large, does he think, should that subsidy be so that the consumption will be increased to such an extent that it will have been worth while and that the 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 bags of yellow mealies which are consumed to-day will be increased to such an extent that it will more or less absorb 58 per cent of the total harvest of 1965&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_3413-3414" refersTo="page_0399"/>I should like to bring a few other matters to the notice of the Minister. The first is in respect of transfer duty. It is not very clear from the Press reports whether that reduction in the transfer duty only applies to the person who buys a property in a city. Let me say at once that it will be the first time that a principle is established whereby a differentiation is made between the town dweller and the farmer who acquires a property. I should like the Minister to explain this point to us. I hope this concession will not only apply to the acquisition of property in a town but also in respect of the platteland.</p>

<p>The other point is in connection with income-tax. Over the years the income-tax system has become more and more complicated as well as the forms that have to be submitted. It is practically impossible for a farmer to-day to devote all his time to his farming activities without engaging a bookkeeper, and what is more when it comes to the end of the year he has to have his books audited. In principle that is right but the position is becoming practically impossible as far as the farmers in the lower income group are concerned. I appreciate the arguments in favour of such a system and that we cannot differentiate between the farmers and the ordinary businessman, but generally speaking the farmers would welcome it if a system could be devised which would make their position easier. When this matter was discussed we argued that we could not differentiate but I think that ground has already been covered. I am not saying that is the right way but I wonder whether it would not be easier to deduct that portion when your product is marketed. I only make that suggestion for the consideration of the Minister because every farmer would welcome a simplified income-tax system.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) said that this side of the House objected to the defence expenditure. I think if he had listened closely to the debate he would know that the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) did not lodge any objection. We on this side realize the difficulties facing the country at the moment&#x2014;a country without any treaties and a country becoming more isolated every day, and as a result it is very necessary for us to strengthen our defences, and we as a responsible Opposition do not object to the money being spent. Our only concern is the accounting for these funds and supervision. It involves considerable sums and the responsibility on the shoulders of the Government for the control of these funds is so great that it is necessary to see that there is proper control over this expenditure. But this argument will be developed by other speakers.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Christiana went on to talk about immigration and said that the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) had said that if our policy had been carried out the country would have had at least an additional 1,000,000 immigrants by now. He made some remarks about us opening our doors to immigrants and getting all types. He said that we would not have houses or employment for them. I should like to tell the hon. member&#x2014;I am sorry he has gone out now&#x2014;that the prosperity in Western Germany to-day is attributed to the 8,000,000 displaced persons whom Russia pushed over her borders. Those people came in with new ideas and built up that country. We see what happened in the U.S.A. and in Australia. I do not say that we should take anyone who comes but certainly we can be too selective. Do not forget that when we arrived in this country the Immigration Department did not meet us on the beach to ask whether we were suitable people. The hon. member also went into technicalities in regard to farming finances in connection with mealies. I would not like to take part in the argument, except to say that he said that the increased costs were due to the increased costs of labour. But that is not so. The increased costs are due to the rising costs of farming equipment. To-day we saw what can happen in the House when we had members of the farming community on both sides of the House not being able to get together as one body to help each other in this Parliament of ours, due to our political divisions, but had to debate their troubles across the floor of the House against a political background. It shows bow we are politically divided in this country, which is not to the benefit of the country as a whole. The hon. member also said something about the income-tax forms. I think not only the farmers but everybody finds that these are very complicated, and although the Receiver of Revenue will tell you that if you read, the small print carefully you will be able to understand them, in nine cases out of ten we have to employ a highly qualified accountant at a substantial fee to understand the various forms sent out.</p>

<p>The Minister of Finance has produced this record surplus of R88,000,000, which will probably be R100,000,000 when his final accounts are drawn up and one is disappointed that more has not been done for the intermediate class of taxpayer. It shows that this Government has not been able to come forward in all the time they have been in power with some positive social security policy, a policy to look after the man in the street. We are not all born millionaires and we are not all born to go to the top. We have those people who have to work all their lives and who have very little future when it comes to the evening of their lives, and it is the responsibility of the Government to look after these people. One of the things that should be done is to introduce social security. This Government took over the foundation of what the United Party left them, but they have never developed it. We have also seen the policy of ploughing back all our revenue surpluses to capital development. The Orange River scheme which will take years to complete will cost a lot of money but one wonders why the Minister of <span class="col_3415-3416" refersTo="page_0400"/>Finance did not consider financing this scheme partially from Loan Funds, and this also applies to South West Africa as well. The report in regard to that territory has not yet even been considered, but we are making provision for the expenditure of money in that territory. He is also making provision in his Budget for the Transkei; this money will be given in the form of a gift. I am not sure whether it is subject to the gifts tax. When you advance money to anyone you want to see a return and one of the faults of this Government is the lack of policy to ensure a return on this investment. The Government jogs along from day to day. If this Minister of Finance can have a surplus of R88,000,000, what do vou think the position would have been if the United Party were in power&#x003F; [Interjections.] We would have had the greatest prosperity of any country in the world. We would have been the envy of the world, but to-day we are becoming more and more isolated. Our prosperity is brought on by isolation. We are living on our own income. We are very fortunate that we have gold and diamonds, and that is why we are living as well as we do to-day. but we cannot continue like that. In order to live in this country we have to export or die, and we must get to know the rest of the world. [Interjection.] In dealing with taxation, I say that the whole of our taxation system should be on a more equitable basis and the load of taxation should be spread over the population fairly evenly and justly. Over the years our taxation has become unbalanced, and some sections of the community pay more than others, and there should be a revision from time to time. The average individual may not pay so much in income-tax, but he pays more in indirect taxes. If he buys a bottle of whisky or brandy he pays an indirect tax, and he even pays an indirect tax on South African articles because there is a loaded tariff, as the hon. member for Benoni has pointed out. We agree that a country has to be taxed to pay its way, but let us examine one aspect of over-taxing in this country of ours, and that is in the motor industry. Over the years the motor industry and everything connected with it has been the pet hobby horse of all Ministers of Finance. When they want an odd million they know where to go to get that money. They either add a cent to excise or customs on vehicles or they add a cent to the price of petrol. It may be argued that everyone who runs a motor-car also pays taxes, but I still say it should be equitable, and they should not pay as much as they do at present. I have taken out some figures which are very surprising. I asked a question in the beginning of the Session and the reply given to me was that the customs and excise taxes on cars and spares, petrol and diesel fuel, tyres and tubes, amounted to R54,631,089. The excise duty on motor-cars amounted to R25,899,050. The duty on petrol is R22,126,285, and on automotive diesel fuel it is R2,205,748, making a total of R24,332,033. All this gives a grand total of R104,862,172.</p>

<p>From that we must deduct R30,000,000 which goes to the Road Fund, which leaves a net total of R74,862,172. Now we have not finished with that yet, because the Railways come along and take their cut, which also affects the farmers. The Railways make a profit of R13,346,935 on the transportation of petrol, and a profit of R3,920,218 on other fuel, giving a total of R17,267,153. It is a colossal sum, but we are continually told that the Railways are run on business lines and therefore we cannot get additional railways unless they are payable, but look what happens here. They derive a profit of R17,000,000 out of the motorist. They run 5,441 vehicles over something like 31,743 route miles, and what do they pay&#x003F; Their vehicles come in duty free and they pay no licences and they make the wonderful contribution to the Provincial Roads Fund of R304,000. They also have a monopoly. The motorists in the country and in the towns, including the farmers, pay for the upkeep of those roads which the Railways use. This is all wrong, and it is one of the anamolies which should be adjusted. If the Railways cannot afford to run their road services they should get a grant from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

<p>I know hon. members opposite are worried. But we are not finished with the motorist yet. In addition, the motorists, including the farmers, pay licence fees every year of R28,213,000, in addition to all the other money. We are told about the revenue of the gold mines, but here is a real gold mine. The real gold mine as far as the Minister of Finance is concerned, is the motor industry, and when I talk about the motor industry I mean everybody who has a motor-car. At one time it was considered that if a man had a motor-car it was a luxury, but to-day it is a necessity. [Interjections.] If the hon. member goes along to buy a Volkswagen he pays excise tax of R169. On a car that sells for R1,365 the excise tax is R182.60. The whole question of motor taxation is completely unbalanced and should be re-examined. I believe it is a matter which is worrying the Minister and I believe he has a committee which is investigating the matter. We hope that they will adjust the situation because I think from year to year it has become like the house that Jack built, and a little bit has been added here and there until the whole thing has become unbalanced. Finally, it must be remembered that every time a motorist goes to a garage &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Every time he puts in a gallon of petrol he pays an indirect tax of 13.8c. In addition, if he lives in Johannesburg or Pretoria he has to pay the Minister of Transport 6c a gallon railage, although just recently it was still 7c. So he pays something <span class="col_3417-3418" refersTo="page_0401"/>like 20c in indirect taxation. That has been forgotten about. Do you know, Sir, why these taxes are put on&#x003F; Because it is an easier form of taxation. The petrol comes out of the bulk tank and they collect the tax, and when the motor-car comes out of the assembly plant they collect the tax.</p>

<p>I have drawn the attention of the House to what I call unbalanced taxation and I think it should be re-examined. We on this side do not object to taxation, but we object to over-taxation and unbalanced taxation and we say that with the prosperity that we have at the moment we should use our reserves to plan for the future. Let the Government come forward with something solid. A social security plan, some security for our youth, a planned educational system, not just go on from day to day and hope for the best. Just recently the Minister of Economic Affairs relaxed import control a little. Why&#x003F; Because he knew that inflation was creeping into the country and he had to do something about it, so just before he left he lifted the lid slightly. But taking these day-by-day steps brings you nowhere, and this Government is going there very fast.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are one or two points that I want to discuss. The last speaker will forgive me if I do not ask him how much he charges people who bring their cars to him for greasing or how much he gets for the petrol he sells. That is his affair and we do not begrudge him his profit, but I want to ask him please to leave the farmers alone because he knows nothing about farming.</p>

<p>I want to refer to something which was touched upon here by the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman). The hon. member made certain comparisons. He first talked about maize. After the two speakers on this side had finished with him, very little was left of the case he put up, but I just want to say this to him: I am a wool-grower and I am very proud of it, and I am also very proud of the fact that we have an organization which is able to look after itself. The International Wool Secretariat is probably one of the finest organizations in the world. The hon. member must please not come and peddle here with the funds of the Wool Board and try to get subsidies to feed his sheep. We are man enough to pay the maize farmer what is due to him. Sir, the maize farmer is one of the greatest assets of this country. He exports maize on a large scale. The Maize Board must be congratulated on the wonderful work that they do, on the foreign exchange that they earn for this country and on the markets that they have created. We wool-growers are not envious; we do not begrudge them the price that they get for their product. Why should the maize farmer subsidize the sheep farmer in order to produce meat cheaply&#x003F; I do not want to enlarge upon this because it is not worth the trouble.</p>

<p>But I was shocked by the statement which was made here by our old friend who is sometimes referred to as Jeremiah. I was shocked by the statement made by him about the Orange River scheme. Sir, if there is one thing which is near and dear to our hearts it is the Orange River scheme. That is why we resent it when people attempt to interfere with that scheme or when they suggest that its implementation should be delayed. This scheme is one which is worth so much to us in the Eastern Province and to the whole of South Africa that I am amazed to find that a member of the United Party is against the rapid development of that scheme.</p>

It will be a good thing for hon. members over there to go and see what is already being done; to see the wonderful planning which is taking place in connection with the tunnel which will cost R28,000,000 and in connection with roads which have already been surveyed and 100 miles of which will be tarred. We are against any delay in the implementation of this scheme; South Africa is against it, and every person in the Eastern Province will have something to say to those hon. members who talk about delaying the implementation of this scheme. The hon. member for Constantia, of course, does not understand the difficulties of the farmers. He does not realize to what extent the platteland has become depopulated.

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I very gladly reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question. Is it not true that it was the hon. member for Cradock who piloted that motion through this House and that it was Mr. Andries Vosloo who seconded it&#x003F; Is it not a fact that this whole scheme emanates from the Government and not from the United Party&#x003F; They never pleaded for an Orange River scheme; it is true that on one occasion they did plead for a Fish-Orange River scheme, but I just want to tell the hon. member that it was this Government, this Prime Minister, who made this beautiful scheme possible by voting the money for it. We on this side proposed the scheme and our proposal was unanimously accepted by the House. This scheme is of so much importance to the farmers of our country that there can be no talk of delay. There are camps which have to be laid out; there are roads to be built, and the Government has already embarked on the preparatory work. When that water from the Orange River is carried via the canal to the Eastern Province <span class="col_3419-3420" refersTo="page_0402"/>and other areas, the whole of that part of the world will be converted into a flower garden. I go so far as to say that this scheme will produce greater results than even the Tennessee Valley scheme because there are so many factors which are going to prove helpful to us. In the Eastern Province, for example, there will be no fewer than ten power stations. Once the height of the dam wall has been raised to 60 feet the power generated there will be quadrupled and all the difficulties which have been experienced in the whole of the Eastern Province and in the Karoo throughout the years will be resolved. We feel therefore that it is absolutely essential to implement this scheme as soon as possible, and we resent the fact that a member should get up in this House and propose that the implementation of that scheme be delayed. Just think what that scheme will mean to us. The problem of droughts, the farmer&#x2019;s biggest enemy, will be solved to a large extent. Sir, the Cabinet Committee appointed by the Government, with Mr. Steyn at the head of it, is accomplishing miracles in expediting this whole matter. We are grateful to the Government and the Department for the appointment of this committee which is solving problems for us within a month which would otherwise have taken a year to solve. We want to let those people know how much we appreciate the work they are doing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the fall of the canal there has to be planned. There are no fewer than seven places where excavations have to be undertaken; there are three towns which have to be laid out; there are national roads to be built; and I wonder where we are going to end if there is any delay in implementing this scheme. The first area, of course, which will benefit from this scheme is the Eastern Province, because we already have our harbours, we have our national roads, we have our railways. This scheme will, of course, cost a huge sum of money and the agricultural industry cannot bear the cost alone. Indeed, that will not be necessary because once power is available there will be a decentralization of industries and those industries will make their contribution to the cost. Sir, I simply cannot understand how the Opposition can come here and propose that this scheme should be delayed. I believe that the whole of the Eastern Province, the whole of the Cape, will vote against the United Party as a result of the attitude that they have adopted in this debate in connection with the Orange River scheme. I am sure that there is not a single English-speaking farmer in our part of the world who is going to vote for them again. Those English farmers are my friends and there is hearty co-operation between us. I am sure that the farmers in the Eastern Province, who are so unanimous as far as this matter is concerned, are grateful for the assistance given to them by the Government. Many of them had to sell a portion of their land because it was simply impossible for them to make a living there. To-day they are so grateful for this scheme that I am sure that they are going to erect monuments one day to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Water Affairs. Mr. Tom Bowker&#x2019;s name has been mentioned here by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). Tom Bowker would certainly not have voted for any delay in the implementation of the Orange River scheme, nor will a single Eastern Province member vote for such a proposition. But I want to say to you, Mr. Speaker, that this scheme is not going to provide just a temporary solution in the drought-stricken areas; it is also going to promote the decentralization of industries. That decentralization of industries wifi be able to take place on a larger scale than in the Tennessee Valley. The facilities have already been provided there. After six years, when this water becomes available, the Government wifi reap the first fruits of this scheme, and when the scheme is further extended, as it wifi be extended later on, about 92,000 morgen of land wifi be under irrigation, and when that happens I foresee that this scheme is going to be one of the greatest national assets ever created by any Government in South Africa. Sir, we have our gold and we are grateful for that fact; we wish the gold mines every success; we wish all our industries every success, but surely secondary industry and the gold-mining industry must also concede some little place under the sun to the farmer. Mr. Speaker, there are hon. members here who sat with me on the Select Committee on the P.A.Y.E. system and they wifi be able to confirm that the income of 75 per cent of our farmers is less than R2,000. As a result of this scheme and other schemes which are at present engaging the Government&#x2019;s attention, those farmers wifi be placed on a sound footing again. They wifi not have to flee to the cities. Where people are at present on uneconomic holdings they will be placed on economic holdings, and the whole of our agricultural industry will be placed on a sound footing. The only enemy which the farmer has in South Africa is drought; the farmer does not complain so much about the prices he gets but he does complain about the uncertainty of farming. I want to ask the Government now to remove that uncertainty as far as possible.</p>

<p>The risk factor.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I think the Government should give a little attention to the risk factor in the agricultural industry, because if one branch of the agricultural industry fares badly, it is no encouragement to other branches of the industry to extend their activities. I am thinking of the dairy industry, for example. We believe that the production of dairy products must be encouraged in South Africa because South Africa simply cannot do without milk. That is why we ask for a basic price which wifi be high enough to enable the farmer to make a decent living. That is all the farmer expects. We are very grateful, however, for what this Government <span class="col_3421-3422" refersTo="page_0403"/>has done for the farmers in the past. But what did the United Party Government do for the farmers&#x003F; I recall the days when maize lay rotting at the stations; I recall the days when we practically had to give our wool away for nothing; I recall the days when they exported our maize and made a slight profit. What did they do with that profit&#x003F; They deposited that profit into the coffers of the State, and it was only when the National Party came into power that that money, or at any rate what was left of it, could be given back to the farmers for the building up of a stabilization fund. I want to congratulate the farmers on the fact that they have built up their stabilization fund to such an extent that they can face the future with great confidence. I say therefore that the whole country will be up in arms if the United Party comes forward with a proposal, as the hon. member for East London (City) did here, that we should take the money of the maize farmer to subsidize the meat producer. We all know that the farmers are satisfied with this Government. Nobody can be blamed for the droughts.</p>

What hon. members on that side want is kaffir-farming; they want a lot of kaffirs to do the farming. They put forward such a strong plea here for the squatter system that one would have sworn they were kaffir farmers. We on this side feel that we do not need the squatter system; we want to stand on our own feet and we are prepared to pay decent wages to those people so that they can also make a living. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to say that we approve of everything that this Government has done in the past.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to listen to the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) who spoke just before me. The hon. member realizes that the Orange River project will bring about new development, create new possibilities for expansion and give a tremendous impetus to our agricultural industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when one considers the fact that the agricultural industry in the northern provinces is barely 50 or 60 years old, and that after the Anglo-Boer War there was virtually no agricultural industry, it goes wtihout saying that the agricultural industry in those provinces is much more susceptible to natural disasters and that the uncertain factors to which the previous speaker referred are far more noticeable there. In order to understand the position it is necessary for us to picture the drought conditions that prevail at present in the Northern Transvaal. I want to say here immediately that we are aware of the fact that things are going very well with many branches of the agricultural industry and the reason why things are not going well in the Northern Transvaal is simply because no rain has fallen there and because things cannot be made to grow by artificial means. Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute immediately and express our gratitude to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing who has extended a helping hand to the farmers there who are finding things difficult. We also want to pay tribute to the departments and officials who have had to make decisions from time to time on the requests for assistance emanating from those areas. Those decisions often determined whether the farmer concerned could continue in the industry or whether he had to offer his services in some other sphere on the labour market. It is a pleasant privilege for me therefore to thank the officials and the members of the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Committees very heartily indeed for everything that they have done to lighten the burden of the farmers in those parts. Various aid schemes were brought into being there but those schemes were only emergency aid schemes. The idea of these schemes was not to rehabilitate the farmers; the idea was only to enable these people to keep going and, of course, to hope for better days ahead. It has been said repeatedly recently&#x2014;and this is a typical example of what often happens in this area&#x2014;that the farmer farms on the Land Bank&#x2019;s farm, with the money of the State Advances Recoveries Office, for the State. We do not say this derisively but we are deeply conscious of the seriousness of the conditions which prevail in the Northern Transvaal.</p>

<p>What has been the effect of the drought conditions in that area&#x003F; It is no longer a problem which affects only certain individual farmers; it is a problem which affects the whole of the community. One-third of the congregation of a certain church in a particular area have left already. The area is becoming depopulated. The remaining members of that congregation can no longer meet their commitments. We have the problem in the schools that there are no longer sufficient children to justify the retention by these schools of their former grading. The teachers have to leave; the hostels are standing empty to a certain extent. This state of affairs results in a large measure of dislocation. The small businessman serving the farming community can no longer make a living. If he does not leave timeously he will go the way of so many others before him; he will have to go into liquidation. Even the organizations which the farmers have built up for themselves, the agricultural co-operatives, no longer have the turnover of products which they used to handle on behalf of the various control boards and they are no longer in a position, therefore, to give their members the customary and necessary financial assistance. We say that as a result of those drought conditions a problem has developed there which seriously affects the <span class="col_3423-3424" refersTo="page_0404"/>whole community there and which seriously disrupts the life of the entire community there. At the same time the depopulation that is taking place has resulted in a curtailment of existing services. The local people are losing opportunities of employment and we find that there is no longer the business turnover that there used to be. This has resulted in a deterioration of the economic position and of social conditions there, with a resultant psychological effect which can only be described as tremendously demoralizing. But we are grateful for the fact that in spite of all the problems that I have mentioned and the difficult times that the people there are experiencing, they have continued to maintain their self-respect, and it is because of this fact&#x2014;a fact for which we are very grateful&#x2014;that we do not come to this House to plead for charity or alms or to ask that moneys owing to the State should be written off; we are not pleading here for the subsidies proposed by the Opposition. All that the farmers are asking for is for an opportunity to continue to follow the calling that they love and to remain on the soil in which they have put down their roots. This being so, our plea to the hon. the Minister, because we are already aware of the reasons for this unfortunate position, is that an official inquiry be instituted to ascertain how those farmers can be timeously rehabilitated. All we ask is that an inquiry be instituted to determine what is needed. After that inquiry ways and means will then have to be found to consolidate the position of those farmers in their chosen calling once again, a calling which is indispensable to our national economy. Once that inquiry has been instituted we foresee that many of those farmers will have to be consolidated and resettled because they are farming on holdings to-day which according to present standards are uneconomic. A further degree of disruption will therefore be unavoidable in order to be able to act eventually in the best interests of those people. That is why we want to associate ourselves with the remarks of the hon. member for Cradock who became lyrical&#x2014;and we do not blame him&#x2014;about the development of the Orange River scheme. We also want to take the Opposition to task for suggesting that the aforementioned scheme be delayed because we believe that with the development of that scheme it will in all probability be possible&#x2014; and we trust that this will actually be done&#x2014; to place many of our farmers from the Northern Transvaal under the Orange River scheme so as to give them a better opportunity to rehabilitate themselves.</p>

<p>I leave this subject, however, and I trust that it will be possible for the Government to agree to hold a departmental inquiry into conditions in the Northern Transvaal, not in order to determine the causes of this unfortunate state of affairs, because the causes are well known, but to find ways and means to solve the problem there. The existing aid schemes have been of great assistance to us. Five years have already gone by and as yet there is no absolute certainty of relief in the immediate future. Indeed, the opposite will probably be the case because even if it does rain soon, the fact still remains that those farmers have experienced a tremendous setback from which they will not easily recover for some years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this brings me to a subject which is of the utmost importance and urgency. Mindful of all the problems connected with the agricultural industry and mindful of the numbers of uncertain factors, which are completely unpredictable and uncontrollable, I feel that what we need is the establishment of an agricultural finance department which will, I am sure, cope very successfully with the agricultural problems which arise throughout the Republic from time to time. I say this because that department will be set up with the specific object of financing the agricultural industry under conditions such as these. Let us see what the position is at the moment. At the moment we have various State Departments which are trying very enthusiastically to be of assistance to the farmers. We are not being critical when we say this but we are all aware of the fact that they are not able to comply with all the needs of the farmers. We have, for example, the State Advances Recoveries Office which was originally not intended to fulfil the function which it is fulfilling to-day. Its purpose originally was to assist sporadically as and when a state of emergency in the farming industry developed. We find that 69 of these emergency schemes have been put into operation with Cabinet approval since 1935 when the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act and the State Advances Recoveries Act were passed. We are grateful for this, but we are even more grateful that the Cabinet in its wisdom decided in <span class="col_3425-3426" refersTo="page_0405"/>1960 to make certain of those schemes permanent. The farmer knows now that he can depend upon the assistance of the State in time of trouble. But we also have the Department of Lands which since 1912 has been doing a limited amount of financing, more particularly for settlers. This financing ability was considerably increased last year, for which we are grateful, but this has merely resulted in a further duplication of existing services in another category. We have the Department of Agricultural Technical Services which also does agricultural financing to a limited extent; we have the Land Bank which is in fact not a State institution but which is, after all, State-controlled to a large extent. They have their own sphere in which they do agricultural financing. We have the Department of Water Affairs with its loans and subsidies. The farmer finds himself surrounded by a maze of organizations from which he can obtain assistance and this also results in the fact that his financial obligations are divided up amongst a number of Departments. This fact results in high costs, inconvenience and delay, and we say that much efficiency has also to be sacrificed because of this position. Our experience has been that all these Departments that I have mentioned have recently concentrated upon becoming more streamlined; they have tried to keep pace with the requirements of the farmer and for this reason they have from time to time adjusted themselves according to the requirements of the times and the circumstances that have had to be overcome.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the permanent schemes we have to-day, for which we are grateful, but it is very clear to us that a change will have to be made very soon. It is simply impossible to our way of thinking that an agricultural industry can continue to operate in the midst of so much uncertainty. There are many members who may perhaps tell us that the private financial sector ought to do that financing. Mr. Speaker, that is our problem exactly. The private sector is simply not able to undertake agricultural financing in South Africa effectively, even though it might want to do so. We know that the commercial banks and other financial institutions assist farmers appreciably by way of short-term loans, under certain conditions, for the purchase of implements and so forth, and even for the purchase of land, and we are very grateful on this score, but it is not effective simply because the agricultural industry in South Africa, more than in any other country, is subject to many factors which are beyond human control. Because of this fact, the risk to the investor is increased. This being so, the private sector is not inclined to risk its money in that industry, and that is why we have the unfortunate position&#x2014;and this is something we experience almost daily&#x2014;that it is when the farmer is in the direst straits that the private financial institutions become most concerned about their investments in that industry and the farmer is expected to meet his commitments at the most inopportune time&#x2014;indeed, at a time when he is struggling to keep his head above water. We are grateful to those financial institutions which give our farmers additional assistance from time to time but from the nature of the case it is just impossible to expect the private financial sector to provide the farmer with credit facilities indefinitely. This being so there is only one other source of assistance to the farmer, and fortunately, that source is in the hands of the National Party to-day. We therefore take the liberty of approaching this Government, which has thus far assisted our farmers through these difficult times, to say that the time is ripe for action to be taken in that direction because a body of this nature will immediately be able to cope with those uncertain elements in our agricultural industry. It is obvious that when the State makes an investment in any agricultural project in this way the State will, of course, as a partner in the undertaking, want to have control over what is to become of that project. Assistance of this nature will therefore have to be conditional because the State will provide, when money is advanced, that that money is spent in a specific way and that it is used for a specific purpose. The introduction of a scheme of this nature will bring about greater stability for the individual farmer. We will then no longer encounter so many struggling farmers in the industry. Those unsuccessful farmers will gradually learn how to become successful farmers simply because the State will keep a watchful eye over their activities and supply them with the information they require. Mr, Speaker, we really hope that, mindful of the urgent needs of our farmers, it will be possible for the Government to establish a department of agricultural finance in the near future. With a view to the importance of the agricultural industry to enable the economic upsurge in the Republic to continue, we are not asking too much when we ask the Government to give serious consideration to this request. By this means we shall be able to place the agricultural industry, which is the backbone of our country, on a healthy and economic footing once again.</p>

<p>This afternoon I wish to deal with one or two points raised by previous speakers in connection with the Budget, which really surprised me. The one point was raised by the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) who said that if we had had an immigration policy years ago, as advocated by the United Party, we would have found ourselves landed with &#x201C;what type of person&#x201D;. Let me first tell the hon. member that that kind of remark does us no credit and it does himself no credit either.</p>

<p>The answer to that, is quite simple and straightforward.

<p>The hon. member for Groblersdal (Mr. M. J. H. Bekker) referred to farmers. All he wants is a good, sound, healthy economy for the farmers. I think we can all agree with him there. What I would like to tell the hon. member is that there are many of us who know quite a lot about farming&#x2014;not the wool farmers or the mealie farmers or the citrus or the sugar farmers but the farmers who struggle to make a living on smallholdings. The problem facing us as a country is to reconcile the increase in prices for primary produce, so as to make it a proposition for the producer himself to produce the produce, and to make it possible for the consumer earning a low wage or salary to buy these essential commodities. That is the reason at the back of this particular amendment moved by the United Party. My particular mission is to bring to the notice of the House something affecting those people whom it is my honour to represent. I am trying to reconcile two points of view, from the remarks which have been made here from time to time, and of which one reads in the newspapers all over the country as a result of speeches by members of the governing party. The Prime Minister said there would be no concessions to Coloured persons.</p>

<p>Where did he say that&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Minister for Coloured Affairs says we must do our best to uplift the Coloured man. The point is this that an awful lot of talking is done about what is to be done for the Coloured man in terms of words&#x2014;uplifting him into a vacuum. The hon. Minister for Railways said he did discriminate&#x2014;that was the word he used. As a result of questions I asked him, the only information I could get dealing with the employment of Coloured persons on the Railways was, that where Bantu were found to be redundant and superfluous to requirements he would offer the jobs to Coloured persons.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) went to considerable trouble to tell me that that meant, I was endeavouring to introduce Coloured, Indian and Bantu workers to the Railways. That is the type of remark which makes the Coloured man believe, correctly, that the Government is insincere in its lip service to uplift him. The Coloured man says quite plainly, and quite straight, and quite honestly, and almost unanimously, that he is not interested in job reservation; he is not interested in the compulsion under the Group Areas Act; he is not interested in separate development. He rejects them. That is the Coloured man&#x2019;s attitude. So I say, that in order to reconcile the attitude of the hon. the Prime Minister of &#x201C;no concessions&#x201D; with the attitude of the Minister of Coloured Affairs who, speaking in London, said: &#x201C;Our job and duty is to raise the Coloured man&#x201D;, is not easy.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one or two cases, which have come to my knowledge as a result of questions I have asked. We were told that there were many vacancies in the police and we were told the rates of pay. I would say that if the Minister of Finance would set aside a sum of money to deal with the very real problem of making friends with the Coloured man, to find ways and means of uplifting him; of giving him a better deal, or seeing that he is paid an adequate wage and salary, he would be doing this country a service. I say to the hon. the Minister of Finance, who has produced this enormous, globular, almost celestial, surplus, that the vast mass of people in this country, the wage-earner, the salaried man, the Coloured man, gets nothing. He gets literally nothing. To that, members opposite can quickly say to me&#x2014;I shall say it before it is said&#x2014; that our rate of tax is low. As the Minister of Finance knows so well, the indirect taxation is a burden on everybody and is so severe, that his Budget could not exist without it. Almost the whole of the R1,018,000,000 revenue is derived from customs, excise and from income-tax. When one examines the figures and sees the indirect taxation which has got to be paid by even the lowest in our economy, we find ourselves in the situation of saying that those who get R200 and down per month, have received no concessions whatsoever. I therefore appeal to him; I ask him sincerely, to reason with his own people to abandon the attitude, when any one or two or ten or 20 men ask for something for the <span class="col_3429-3430" refersTo="page_0407"/>Coloured community, of charging them with trying to upset the entire economy of the country by wanting to swamp business or trade or the Public Service with Coloured persons. What I say, Sir, is this, that Coloured people have every right to be employed in the Government service wherever it is possible. The Minister of Labour said the other day, that the manpower shortage was an exaggeration. Those words have already been thrown back in his teeth by any number of men engaged in commerce and industry throughout the country. I say here this afternoon, that the matter could be resolved quickly if an active and constructive programme was introduced to train the Coloured man and the Coloured woman. If they were given an opportunity of learning something they would be useful. I say our educational system should be so expanded as to be able to bring this about.</p>

<p>Many millions of pounds are spent on Bantustans and border industries. I want to ask the Minister of Finance how much money is spent on the promotion of industry in which Coloured persons can be employed&#x003F; When I tackled the Minister of Railways he said the Railways were controlled by conventions. I put it to you, Sir, in all earnestness, that conventions of that kind, can never stand the test of public opinion nor world opinion. Coloured people live with us; they belong to us; they speak our language; they speak both languages; they go to our churches; they have our customs; they wear the same clothes, they have the same hates, loves, desires, anxieties and worries, and they are entitled to exactly the same as we have, and should get it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not interested in that type of irrelevant interjection. I plead for a group of people who have been neglected for a considerable time in spite of all, shall I say, sweet words which fall from the mouths of Government speakers. When the actual test comes we find that the Coloured person is left away on the outside. One has only to motor through this province, which I did quite recently, to see the conditions under which they live. Much has been said about agriculture. Nothing has been said about the Coloured person in agriculture. If anybody cares to take a trip along the Orange River he will see the conditions under which Coloured people live, and the conditions under which they are compelled to farm, the limited scope at their disposal, the horrible houses which are theirs to occupy, and the lack of facilities in all directions. That is their lot. If any member of this House cares to take a look at the various villages in the Cape Province&#x2014;I only speak of the Cape Province, because I know it&#x2014;and would see the conditions which are offered to Coloured persons in terms of the law, which is to-day, shall I say, the great flower in the buttonhole of the Government, he too would hang his head in shame.</p>

<p>It was my misfortune to miss the previous Minister of External Affairs. I hope the present Minister of External Affairs will take time off to see the conditions in the town of Beaufort West, which he represents, and see the conditions under which Coloured persons are expected to live. See if he can go into the forums of the world in international places, and defend what he sees there. The Irrigation Department employs numbers of Coloured persons in temporary capacities. These people have been in the service for upwards of five years. In reply to a question of mine as to whether or not they would be permanently employed I was told: When there is a vacancy. Those of us who work in public bodies know that if persons are employed in a temporary capacity for five to ten years, surely it is time the establishment was increased to take care of those people. The test of our progress, Sir, is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, but whether we provide enough for those who have too little. And there are very many people in this country who have much too little. I say, with a Budget of the size of the one presented to us this week, with the estimates so badly framed that an expected surplus of R100,000 has been turned into a mere R100,000,000, we have earned the hatred of entrenched greed, because we are giving nothing to those who deserve the most.</p>

<p>One final point is the question of education, with which I shall deal in detail under the appropriate Vote. Let me just say now that I am astonished at the amount of money that has been found for the new Department of Coloured Education but which was not made available to the Administrator of the Cape Province when he was in charge of education. I want members of this House to know, that education for Coloured persons could have been compulsory. An ordinance was passed making it so. But strangely enough the hon. Administrator of the Cape Province has been kept short during all the years, when this controversy was raging as to whether Coloured education should be transferred or not. The answer always was that there was no money. There has been a Nationalist majority in the Provincial Council for some years. The Administration had the machinery, the technical people, the trained staff and the personnel to conduct it but under the guise that there was no money it was taken away. The Minister of Coloured Education told me across the floor of the House that he was only responsible from 1 January. I put it to you, Sir, that he knew for a very long time what was going to happen. Within three months an enormous sum of money is made available to the Minister of Coloured Education when the machinery was in existence for the Administrator of the Cape Province to do the job.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with a matter which interests me and to draw the attention of the <span class="col_3431-3432" refersTo="page_0408"/>hon. the Minister of Finance to a state of affairs which I think might enjoy his attention. He has, after much pleading by many people over many years, undertaken to do something about the marginal gold mines. The City of Kimberley, which happens to fall in my constituency, was in the doldrums for years because of the slump in the diamond industry. To-day the diamond industry is well off and the city as such, together with all the towns in the Northern Cape has entered into an era of prosperity. I want to put it to the hon. Minister of Finance whether he does not think the time has come when the discriminatory company&#x2019;s tax on diamonds, which is now 90c instead of 60c should be reduced and furthermore that the 10 per cent export tax on diamonds should be removed. I say that for one reason. It is true, that at the moment, the diamond industry is flourishing. It is paying enormous taxes. The Minister of Finance will be able to verify, that little of that money has found its way back to the area, from which it was taken. He will also say and produce figures to me showing that the price for diamonds is the highest it has been for years. I concede all these things, but I put it to him that with the mines getting deeper it becomes more costly to produce and profits begin to fall. Before the cities that depend on diamonds find themselves in the position of the marginal mines in the Transvaal, which had another economy handy to bolster them up, I suggest with all due deference that he pays some attention to dealing with that particular aspect of our economy.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister of Mines why has there been such a delay in developing the known deposits of diamonds in the Coloured area of Kamaggas and adjoining farms&#x003F; The hon. Minister has kindly given me some answers in reply to questions and said that he had appointed a committee. I put it to you, Sir, that the hon. Minister must know that there is a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction among the Coloured community, who are vitally interested in this particular deposit which is believed to be rich. They cannot understand why proposals which, according to my information, closed on 30 November&#x2014;have not been accepted or rejected. I think tenders were invited or offers were invited for the prospecting of the land. These closed as long ago as 30 November, yet nothing has been done. We are still appointing a committee. I think the hon. the Minister will concede that this scheme which was put out and closed on 30 November was only one of many. Many people have been involved; many people have been asked to give opinions and many people have been asked to give advice. I wonder whether the fact that that is predominantly a Coloured area and that the people there are Coloured persons who will be interested and get the lion&#x2019;s share, I hope, of what comes out is the reason for the delay. I cannot understand why there is this inordinate delay. Nor can I believe or concede that the hon. the Deputy Minister does not know exactly what he is doing. I think he is a knowledgeable man on this subject.</p>

South Africa consists of one-seventh of the area south of the Sahara; she has 10 per cent of the population and produces 25 per cent of the food; 15,000,000 tons of food are produced by South Africa annually, that is, one ton of food for each inhabitant. It is estimated that every inhabitant man, woman and child of all races in South Africa consumes half a ton of food per annum. This means that there is a food surplus of about 7,000,000 tons per annum in South Africa. The inhabitants of all other countries south of the Sahara up to the Limpopo number 150,000,000 and they produce about 45,000,000 tons of food per annum. At a consumption of half a ton per person per annum they will need approximately 75,000,000 tons of food although they only produce 45,000,000 tons. There is therefore a shortage of between 30,000,000 and 40,000,000 tons as far as they are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_3433-3434" refersTo="page_0409"/>It is an unfortunate fact that the White man is gradually disappearing from the Black independent states in Africa. The White man is disappearing from the health services scene and also the information that he has been making available in respect of agriculture and his efforts to uplift the Black from his barbaric state. The result is that the shortage of 30,000,000 tons may easily be doubled during the next few decades. It is possible that hunger will reign supreme in the decades to come. What is the position, for example, in Ethiopia&#x003F; This is one of the countries which accuses us to-day before the World Court. Ninety per cent of the people of that country are illiterate; 50 per cent of them are suffering from malnutrition. They have no resistance to disease becaue they are so undernourished. Their wages are extremely low; there are no homes for them. Even in the capital of Addis Ababa they live in mud houses. Forty thousand of them die annually from malaria; their herds of livestock are dying off; slavery is rife, one-third of the national revenue is stolen during the process of its collection. But Haille Selassie, the head of that state, has salted away an amount of R800,000,000 in Western financial institutions for his own use. In passing part of the pattern of life in China and in India is that tens of thousands die of hunger each year.</p>

<p>Black Africa will become impoverished in the process of becoming free and I mention these matters with a view to the possibility that South Africa may be able to market her products in Black Africa in future and that those countries may be able to pay for those products out of the millions of dollars which they receive, amongst others, from America, dollars that are rained lavishly upon them. In South Africa we have 100,000 independent farmers and they remain reasonably constant because of the interaction of sub-division on the one hand and consolidation on the other hand. Land ownership on a large scale does not give rise to great consternation on our part but we cannot say the same as far as land ownership on a small scale is concerned. Ownership of land on a large scale is not something that happens everywhere simultaneously with ownership of land on a small scale; and it is not permanent. It is a sporadic occurrence that takes place at odd places throughout the country but the position always rights itself in the cycle of consolidation and testation.</p>

<p>Our task is to reconstruct these 100,000 units so that they can be used in the best possible way with a view to supplying our own needs and exports. The population of the world to-day is 3,000,000,000 but two-thirds of these, as we know, are suffering from malnutrition, that is to say, 2,000,000,000. It is estimated that by the year 2000 the population of the world will be 6,000,000,000. Proportionately, therefore, the world will then require about 3,000,000,000 tons of food annually, and according to present indications. 4,000,000,000 people will then be suffering from malnutrition. South Africa must not only set an example to an unsympathetic Western world in regard to the need for the amicable co-existence of the various races, but she must also assist that unsympathetic world to feed the hostile East and Greater Africa. Even though we are a small and weak agricultural country we cannot shirk this difficult task. Our farmers must make a decent living. People suffering from hunger beyond our borders must be provided with food and our national economy must be strengthened. What are our prospects&#x003F; [Interjection.] I do not know what that interjection was, Mr. Speaker, but interjections of that nature while I am dealing with a serious matter such as this remind me of the English saying: &#x201C;It is better to be a witty fool than to be a foolish wit!&#x201D; Well, an hon. member over there may get up and speak, and the people on his side will listen to him. There is another English saying which states: &#x201C;No matter how foolish a person may be, there will always be somebody else foolish enough to listen to him!&#x201D;</p>

<p>What obstacles are there which prevent our complying with this vocation&#x003F; We experience a variety of acute setbacks of short duration which sometimes threaten to become chronic. These are enough to break our farmers economically. Farmers who previously had large banking accounts which they built up without State assistance find to-day that their banking accounts are overdrawn to the extent of R100,000. As a result of this fact a very dangerous tendency is unfortunately developing on the part of certain people and they have started thinking that farming in South Africa is no longer under any circumstances a paying proposition anywhere in the country. That is a pessimistic attitute which can do us no good. It is unnecessary and superfluous.</p>

<p>Because of these setbacks, it is necessary that assistance be given by the State. There is another great danger inherent in this fact. We must remember that the freedom of the farmer goes hand in hand with, and is maintained by self management. His freedom is of far greater value to him than some form of assistance which restricts that freedom, places that farmer under supervision and makes him subject to prescription rather than to information, which requires him to account for all his actions instead of enabling him to maintain himself as a free entrepreneur, researcher, and formulator of successful farming methods. In every farming unit the personality of the farmer as a free entrepreneur, researcher and a formulator of scientific farming methods must be preserved. His farming must bear that stamp.</p>

<p>Another great stumbling-block in our path which prevents us from achieving our ideal is the question of high land prices. There are certain maize-oroducing areas in our country where 15 years ago farms were sold at R20 per morgen and are now being offered and sold at R100 per morgen; there are certain <span class="col_3435-3436" refersTo="page_0410"/>sugar farms which ten years ago were purchased for R10,000 and which are now being offered and sold for R80,000. If one were to pay R6 per morgen, quite apart from wages for daily and seasonal labourers and quite apart from the cost of remedies for the prevention and care of diseases, then bearing in mind the fact that one needs 8 morgen of grazing per sheep, it costs one up to R50 even before the sheep are put onto the land.</p>

<p>The next hampering factor is drought, the drought which troubles us to such an extent year after year. The drought has already reached such proportions in the Northern Transvaal that when a farmer was asked when it rained in the parts, he answered: If I remember correctly it was last year on a Thursday! Mr. Speaker, it is because of these continual droughts that in one magisterial district which is about half as big as the constituency into which it falls and which includes our district, the farmers in August last year owed the Land Bank R3,713,806 and were in arrears to the extent of R372,836. The reason for this was the drought. I just want to add that the assistance given in terms of the Farmer&#x2019;s Assistance Act since 1958 to the people in that same area, without including contributions in respect of production loans and loans for stock feed, rations and so forth, amounted to R720,254, with arrears of R61,609. The proportion of the amount in arrear to the amount borrowed is 1:4. Mr. Speaker, this gives us an indication of the critical position of the farmers who have to endure a drought of this nature year after year. I cannot resist the temptation to quote from <i>Organized Agriculture</i> in order to point out how drought affects the crop farmer as well as the stock farmer (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The drought strikes hard at the farmer&#x2019;s soul and body. Before his eyes he sees the young mealies begin to shrivel up at 11 o&#x2019;clock in the morning and the crop on which he has pinned his hopes for an income for the year withers away; his daughter wants to teach; before his eyes he sees his stock weaken when they no longer have any grazing and when the drinking troughs are empty.</block>

<p>That has been the position of the crop farmer in the drought-stricken areas for as long as four or five successive years. I want to read another quotation with reference to the cattle-farmer (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the large cattle farms the boring machines thump unceasingly. Ten, 12, 15, boreholes to depths of even 600 feet are sunk in the hope that the next one may perhaps be successful. But time and again the drill simply moves on to the next place indicated by the geologist or the water diviner. Sometimes a drill remains on a farm for three months; sometimes it remains there for six months and sometimes for three years, and the tariff is up to R2 per foot &#x2026; for a dry hole as well.</block>

<p>These conditions have resulted in the fact that there are actually parts of our country in which things are going very badly although I want to deny once and for all that things are going badly for all farmers generally and that bankruptcy is staring them in the face. That has never been the case during the whole period of 15 years that this Government has been in power but it is true that sporadically things go badly. There are a few points that I want to make and I want to do so in pursuance of reports that I have received from a few places in my constituency. I asked them to send me reports on the drought and these are the reports:</p>

<block name="quote">Area A: About 90 per cent of the grazing is either finished, withered or trampled upon; boreholes weak; cash crops are a failure; wheat crops mostly destroyed by finches; combating of finches successful but started too late Condition of cattle deteriorating.</block>

<p>Area B: 90 per cent of grazing finished; crops withered; anticipate 10 per cent return; condition of stock poor; boreholes deteriorating; 50 per cent of wheat crops destroyed by finches.</p>

<p>Area C: No crops on some lands; other lands, 12 per cent. Grazing poor; condition critical.</p>

<p>Area D: 30 per cent grazing; finch plague very serious; successfully combated, but, unfortunately, too late. Crops 10 per cent to 50 per cent.</p>

<p>I can go on in this way to show that the drought is a threat to us. It is also a fact that it stands in the way of the ideal that I mentioned at the start of my speech&#x2014;of our possibly feeding the hungry masses of Africa and building up an export market.</p>

<p>Another factor is soil erosion. I want to quote from the <i>Transvaler</i> of 13 Feburary 1964. (translation.)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Each year 400,000,000 tons of sub-soil are washed down to the sea in South Africa&#x2019;s rivers. This represents nearly 200 square miles of soil 12 inches deep. At this rate South Africa has only from three to four generations to survive in the agricultural sphere.</block>

<p>The following also appears in this report(translation.)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most important stumbling-block in the path of the acceleration of the soil conservation process is a lack of funds.</block>

<p><span class="col_3437-3438" refersTo="page_0411"/>Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this to be a stumbling-block. It is suggested in this report that this money should be supplied by our economy as a whole. I agree 100 per cent that the mines and commerce, as well as industrial undertakings, must be prepared to contribute towards the retention of our soil fertility, because if our fertile soil is washed away, all the gold that we mine and the oil which may still be discovered underground will not keep us alive.</p>

<p>A further factor impeding our progress in this regard is injudicious mechanization. Dr. Tomlinson dealt with this matter recently at Towoomba, Warmbaths, on a farmers&#x2019; day when he spoke on &#x201C;The economy of mechanization in agriculture&#x201D;. Sir, mechanization does indeed have its advantages, but it also creates problems. Advantages as well as problems must have increased considerably when we take into account that from 1940 to 1960 mechanization costs rose from 15 per cent to 40 per cent of total costs. What is more, from 1947 to 1957, the price of tractors in South Africa increased by 348 per cent as against 82 per cent in America. Therefore, although there are definite advantages to be derived from mechanization, the problems in connection with mechanization have also increased considerably. To mechanize advantageously the following facts must be remembered: (1) Non-Whites increase the cost of machinery as well as the rate of depreciation when they work with that machinery; (2) injudicious tractor purchases on small farms increase mechanization costs enormously. In order to combat these evils we must have (1) the selection and training of non-White tractor drivers; (2) advanced mechanical knowledge on the part of the farmer himself in his capacity as supervisor over his labourers on the farm; (3) the co-operative purchasing of mechanical equipment by smaller farmers in order to make the best use thereof. A sound basis is a medium tractor which can be used to plough and cultivate 80 morgen of clay soil, 100 morgen of loamy soil and 120 morgen of sandy soil per annum; and (4) formal agricultural training for all future farmers and the full utilization of existing services by practical farmers is and remains indispensable. One cannot emphasize this last point sufficiently; My acknowledgments to Dr. Tomlinson.</p>

<p>We thank the Government for what it has done and the way in which it has assisted the farmers over the difficult years. The farmers do not want charity. The Government has assisted where it has been able to do so and it will where possible continue to assist them in future as well, so as to make them all full-fledged farmers, men who can make a worthwhile living independently and who, as hitherto, will be able to make their contribution towards strengthening the economy of our country. Despite setbacks, I maintain that, with the good guidance given by this Government, coupled with the farmers&#x2019; own toughness and powers of endurance, the future of farming generally is indeed rosy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member who has just sat down on the speech that he made and I want to give him the assurance that the House as a whole enjoyed listening to him. He gave us a thorough survey of farming conditions in large parts of our country.</p>

<p>I want to come back now to the motion moved by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) on one of our first private members&#x2019; days. As you know, Mr. Speaker, not very much time was allowed for that debate and I did not have the opportunity of protesting against certain allegations made by the hon. member on that day. I want to make use of this opportunity to do so now and I want to express my appreciation of the fact that the hon. member is present. I told him that it was my intention to reply to his speech if I was given the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>In moving his motion the hon. member suggested that a commission of inquiry be appointed to investigate the general position of the agricultural industry. By that he meant at all levels and in all spheres and sectors of farming. The hon. the Minister replied to this request in due course and I just want to say that his answer probably had the general support of the House because it is certainly not necessary to have an inquiry made into farming in South Africa. We are acquainted with the position and so are hon. members opposite to a large extent. What I did not like about the speech of the hon. member for Gardens was that he found fault with the Government. The theme of his motion was actually that the Government was responsible for conditions in our country. I feel convinced, having regard to what other hon. members have said, including the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek) that the statement that the Government is to blame for conditions in the agricultural industry is devoid of all truth. Reference was made to bankruptcy. The hon. member for Gardens was strongly supported by the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) who is always inclined in debates on farming matters to talk about the bankruptcy of farmers. I think hon. members who continually talk of bankruptcy whenever farming conditions are discussed, do the farmers a very great injustice. It is not the truth either. I agree that certain farmers do go bankrupt and that certain farmers do disappear from the farming profession but that has been happening over the years; we find in the business world and in every other undertaking that as a result of incorrect planning or incorrect management certain people fall away from time to time. In the farming sphere certain farmers are overcome by the forces of nature and fall away. That also applies to a limited number of farmers. But it cannot be said of the farmers in general. The theme of the hon. member for Gardens was that these <span class="col_3439-3440" refersTo="page_0412"/>conditions were due to the bad management of the Government. That is also a statement that is devoid of all truth. I do not think there has ever been a Government in South Africa which has been more sympathetically disposed towards the farmers than the present Government. I am not speaking as a politician now. The accusation is sometimes made that this Government is only a farmers&#x2019; Government. We find that other interested groups make accusations in the newspapers and remarks on public platforms about the sympathy that is shown by the Government towards the agricultural industry in general. And that is the truth. It is definitely not a question of favouritism. The Government is sympathetic because it is essential for every nation to ensure that things go well with the agricultural industry. Agriculture is the life artery, the fountain-head of every nation. I take it that the hon. member for Gardens is himself a very careful farmer; indeed I have learnt that he is, but if he is such an exemplary farmer, I want to ask why the farmers in his constituency do not send him to this House and why he has to represent an urban constituency in this House&#x003F; There must be a reason for it and I think we must seek the reason amongst the farmers on the platteland. That applies not only to the hon. member, it also applies to the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson). I understand that he is also a very progressive farmer but he does not represent a farming constituency; he represents Sea Point. The same thing can be said of other members opposite. Do we need any better proof that the farmers support the Government than the fact that these good farmers whom I have just mentioned but who happen to follow United Party policy and politics are simply not considered as representatives of the farmers&#x003F; They are not given the opportunity as the representatives of the farmers to plead the cause of the agricultural industry in this House. It has been said that the farmers are facing bankruptcy but I just want to add that the Government cannot make rain. We have listened here to the speech of the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek) in which he outlined the disturbing conditions in certain parts of the country, but no Government on earth can make rain. There is a further great problem as far as the farmers are concerned and that is the problem of marketing. A large proportion of our primary products is marketed overseas and we are dependent upon overseas markets. We cannot simply fix prices and say: &#x201C;You must pay these prices&#x201D;. These are conditions over which our farmers have no control and over which the Government has no control either. Accordingly that accusation against the Government does not hold water. As far as Government assistance to the farmers in South Africa is concerned I do not know whether we can think out any new formulae. I find it difficult to think of one instance in which the Government does not assist the farmers financially when it becomes necessary to do so. Take the question of the purchase of land by the Land Bank. What was the position in the past&#x003F; One could only obtain a loan of 60 per cent of the valuation of the farm. The law was changed and to-day one can obtain a loan of four-fifths of the valuation for the purchase of land. What was the position of the Department of Lands in regard to the purchase of land&#x003F; The maximum was &#x00A3;2,000. My colleague on the right used to be a member of the board and in those days advances for the purchase of land were limited to &#x00A3;2,000. The present figure is &#x00A3;11,500. Farmers who find themselves in financial difficulty are assisted in many other ways. There is the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board; we have State Advances and there are schemes for the purchase of stock and implements. Assistance has been given to farmers who have been hit hard by drought over the past years. In every case in which one has had the right to expect the Government to lend a helping hand, that support has been given. As far as the allegations of the hon. member for Gardens are concerned, I must say that they are devoid of all truth. I think we must be politically honest when discussing the interests of the farmers.</p>

<p>From time to time, when it becomes necessary to do so, hon. members on this side also advocate sympathetic treatment of the farmers, and we will continue to do so. From time to time we will draw the attention of the Government to conditions as we know them. As I have already said, agriculture is the life artery of any nation. After gold it is the second largest earner of revenue for our country. I just want to say in passing that last year the gross income of the agricultural industry amounted to R882,000,000 and the industry employed 620,000 non-Whites as permanent workers; I am not counting the temporary workers. The Government has to keep its finger on the pulse of the agricultural community and that is what it is doing. Many statistics have been mentioned in this debate by hon. members. I do not want to follow their example but I just want to mention with appreciation a few matters which I think merit the gratitude of the whole country. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the concession in regard to estate duty, the concession as far as income-tax is concerned, and the increase in the pensions of those people who are dependent upon their pensions. These are very fine gestures on his part and one has the right to expect concessions of this kind in a Budget such as this. The criticism of the United Party of this Budget thus far reminds me of what happened three years ago&#x2014;one can go back even further than that&#x2014;when the Republic came into being. I think of all the prophecies that were made on platforms throughout the country and in the newspapers which support the Opposition. We have the opportunity to-day to take stock and to cast our minds back to what was said at that time.</p>

<p><span class="col_3441-3442" refersTo="page_0413"/>Blood and tears were predicted if we became a Republic and if we left the Commonwealth. It was predicted that the banks would close, that we would have strikes, that we would have unemployment and that there would be large-scale poverty. They even went so far as to predict bloodshed. What became of all those predictions&#x003F; South Africa, generally speaking, finds herself in a stronger financial position than ever before. That is the answer to those predictions of the United Party to which we have had to listen from time to time. Hon. members opposite have found fault with this, that and the other but South Africa is grateful to the Government and is proud of this Budget. That is amply borne out by the comments which have appeared in the newspapers in general. What criticism do they offer&#x003F; No criticism worth mentioning has been put forward. That is the answer. There we have the true barometer of the popularity of this Budget. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister very heartily indeed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I regret I cannot discuss adequately the speeches I have just listened to from the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek) and the hon. member for Lichtenburg (Mr. M. C. van Niekerk). I think they will agree that we have never had a Government in South Africa which has not been sympathetic towards the farming industry of South Africa. We have always been sympathetically disposed towards the farming industry in South Africa, because we are a developing country and being a developing country, we realize the importance of the farming industry. We realize to-day that it is most unfortunate that farmers have to leave the land. That is what is happening. I know that the hon. member for Waterberg has explained to us that the cause of it is: Drought. Drought has always been the enemy of the farmer in South Africa. I remember how when I lived in the constitutency of the hon. member for Lichtenburg we had two successive bad years: One year we had drought and there was no crop; the following year they had good rains, but we were plagued by locusts and again the farmers did not have a crop. Many of the farmers had to leave their farms and go to the diamond diggings. But the spirit of the Lichtenburgers was not broken. We celebrated that disaster by having a great debate &#x201C;Wat is die ergste, sprinkane of droogte&#x003F;&#x201D; That has been the spirit of the farmers right throughout history, and not only the farmers in South Africa, but in every country. I was particularly interested in the information from the hon. member for Waterberg when he told us that Haile Selassie had been able to salt away his wealth in another country. I can assure him that nobody in South Africa will be able to salt away blocked rands while we have this Minister of Finance. He is now cogitating, and I think he is working out another scheme. As far as the last one is concerned, we told him at the time when he introduced it that it would have the effect it is having to-day. I hope he will be more successful next time.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not interested so much in loans and donations to farmers. I wish to discuss the donations that the hon. the Minister referred to in his Budget speech, donations to universities. In discussing that, I think we must go back to 1960 when the hon. the Minister introduced his first scheme. In 1960 he introduced a scheme in which he said that companies could donate 1 per cent of their taxable income to financing our universities&#x2019; laboratories, schools of technology, libraries, grants for technical books, and so on. That was his plan. But he said, in propounding his plan to us that if a company was prepared to make a gift, 75 per cent would go to the university of the company&#x2019;s choice, but 25 per cent would go into a common pool to be utilized by the Minister of Education, Arts and Science. That was his proposal in 1960. The following year he came again to discuss donations and said, what we had expected, that the plan seemed to be a failure, that there had not been a good response. For very obvious reasons, which he saw! The hon. the Minister did not like the idea of it not being a success because he suggested that he had considered very seriously the abolition of the plan. But he did not abolish it. He accepted the advice of this party, he abolished the 25 per cent compulsory donation and said that any company could give the 100 per cent to any university of its choice. That was in 1961. In 1962 the hon. Minister came again and did not make much reference to the plan, but said the scheme would continue for another year. Then in 1963 I saw the first glimmerings of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s new plan. He said in 1963 that he was prepared to make this a donation over a period of five years&#x2014;the scheme could continue for five years, instead of being renewed from year to year. There was the first idea of a five-year plan, but he did not follow it up. Now he has come along with the plan for this year, and I should like to read the operative sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I propose now that companies be allowed to deduct from their taxable incomes up to a maximum of 1 per cent of such incomes, any donations made to a national loan and bursary fund for students in need of assistance to complete their studies at a university, university college, technical or training college. Details of the scheme will be worked out in consultation with the Department of Education, Arts and Science.</block>

<p>It is called the National Loan and Bursary Fund. The money has to be deposited, I understand, into this National Fund. The hon. the Minister is making the same mistake as in <span class="col_3443-3444" refersTo="page_0414"/>1960. Again he is prescribing how the money is to be spent, instead of saying to a company that if it is prepared to accept this new scheme it will be permitted to devote its donations to any college or technical college or university of its own choice for deserving students. I think that is a good scheme, but to say the money must go into a national fund to be utilized by the Minister of Education will, I think, right at the beginning ensure that the scheme is not the success that the Minister hopes it will be. I hope it will be a success. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>I should like to say this in passing, although I do not wish to pursue the matter. I should like the Minister to think of a company in which I have a very modest interest. This company has to pay company tax to the Minister of over 50 per cent per annum, not 30 per cent, and in addition to that the Minister, as the shareholder under the gold mining lease, takes another 22 per cent. So the Government takes from this mining company and its shareholders over 72 per cent of the profits, leaving them 28 per cent. The Minister has this year very generously said to private companies they can plough back not 40 per cent but 45 per cent of their profits, but how much can you plough back into a company if all you have left is 28 per cent&#x003F; But the Minister is not finished yet. When the dividends are paid out of the 28 per cent, those dividends are again taxed in the hands of the individual shareholders. Does the Minister think that a shareholder in that company would be very enthusiastic in giving 1 per cent of the company&#x2019;s taxable income&#x003F; I should like the Minister to give the question of gold mining taxation the attention it has been waiting for now for 20 years. Year after year that taxation formula has been tinkered with, and I think that if the Minister were to be generous, and say, as the Socio-Economic Planning Council said in 1947 &#x201C;We are prepared to recommend working gradually towards bringing gold mining taxation into line with the taxation of other companies&#x201D;, the whole position would be retrieved.</p>

<p>I want to go a little further. I do not think the Minister in arranging these donations really appreciated the seriousness and the magnitude of the educational position in South Africa to-day. It is very serious indeed, and for obvious reasons. I accept that the Minister has the modern conception of a university. He realizes that a university to-day is not a place of learning for the sons of the privileged people of the country only. It is not a place where a young man goes to debate and play rugby and sing <i>Gaudeamus Igitur</i>; it is a place where young people go to work, and the Minister, who occupies a very important position in regard to universities, will realize that to-day we are seeking out the best men we can find. But I think he is going the wrong way about it. I think he does not realize that education is not a luxury which it is necessary for the economy to support. Throughout the world to-day education is of course making new and increasing demands upon the economy, but at the same time the economy is making greater demands upon education. There is reciprocity. The two go together, especially in a developing country. We try to classify countries in the world to-day into these three categories: Those that are undeveloped, like the countries to the north of us; those that are fully developed, like the U.S.A., the United Kingdom, Western Germany and Russia, which, although it is not fully developed is developing very rapidly. In those countries, even where they are fully developed, they realize that it is essential to make this provision for technological training and for the training of the staff that the hon. the Minister of Transport referred to in his speech. I made a note of it so as to get it correctly. The Minister of Transport referred to the shortage of engineers and technological staff, and then he said especially technicians as assistants to the highly qualified men. That is very important. These various skills that we require have been described in industry as a &#x201C;spectrum of skills&#x201D;, from the highly qualified man, from the engineer, through the technician down to your artisan, who will be the lowest grade of trained man. I think the hon. the Minister appreciates that. We have to make provision for training these men, and for that we require planning. We require a plan, and not a suggestion made annually in this way, or in the ordinary Estimates that we receive from the Minister of Education. We require an investigation by statesmen, by the policy-makers, by economists, by industrialists, by statisticians, into the whole question of education in South Africa to give us a plan of what we are to do, especially to get men. We know the old Jingo song&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We&#x2019;ve got the guns;</block>

<block name="quote">We&#x2019;ve got the men;</block>

<block name="quote">We&#x2019;ve got the money too.</block>

<p>I think our Defence Department probably have the guns, and we have the money, but the question is whether we have the men in our higher education. That is the question. How are we to get the men&#x003F; When we come to select them and look for men in the technological field, and men who are trained as technicians, the basis of their training is science and mathematics. If science and mathematics are not properly taught there should be an investigation into the teaching of science and mathematics. Investigations like this have been going on in countries throughout the world. One may perhaps say that they are vocational subjects. Perhaps they are, but in the development of our country, which is not a fully developed country, nor an undeveloped <span class="col_3445-3446" refersTo="page_0415"/>country, but a developing country, we have to make this provision. In making this provision I think it is necessary for us to say we will investigate how science and mathematics are taught at the very foundation of this superstructure of university education, namely the high schools. Every year young men leave the high schools and go to the university and they have difficulty in passing those subjects in the first year. I am not surprised. We have so many unqualified people in the secondary schools. A survey made by the Department of Education tells us that one-third of the high school teachers teaching mathematics are unqualified. I actually met a principal of a high school who said that he did not have one member on his staff who was a properly qualified teacher of mathematics. This is a very serious matter, and if it is true there it is true right throughout our system. Well, what are we to do&#x003F; I think the first priority in our system of education in South Africa, especially university education, is to train teachers. When I say teachers I mean the teaching profession in the broadest sense, not only primary school teachers and secondary school teachers, but the teachers in the universities as well. They are the seed corn, and from them we will develop our system. A prominent investigator in Britain said that the standard of teaching mathematics had fallen so low that in 20 years the subject might not be taught properly&#x2014;and that in a fully developed country! That is a serious danger with which we are confronted. [Interjection.] We must first ensure that we are training the right teachers, and then we must keep them. The hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) &#x2014;I am sorry he has left&#x2014;said in his speech that those people who had left South Africa, especially the university people, were now coming back. I do not think it is as simple as that. There are people who have left South Africa because they were fleeing from the wrath to come, but there are other people in our universities who have left South Africa for other reasons, one of them being that the scale of remuneration is not satisfactory. It is not easy to devise a satisfactory scale. I do not know whether the Minister knows of the work being done by a young Johannesburg scientist in this field, Mr. Kenneth Adams, who has devised a salary scheme for the teaching profession where the graph of the payment of salaries will rise fairly rapidly. Something of that kind will have to be done because if a man is qualified in mathematics and science to-day, he need not teach in a school. Industry will offer him a big salary. That is one reason, but there is another reason why they leave this country. They go to a more congenial atmosphere. They go to a university which makes provision for research, and where they can discuss research with other people engaged in the work. Therefore we must try to give our people those opportunities in South Africa. That is my second point.</p>

<p>I want to mention another aspect of this development before I leave the subject. I am asking for a ten-year plan. The Minister spoke of five years. The plan he initiated is just tinkering with the problem, in my opinion. In modern language, a five-year programme would be a crash programme, and I would even support that, but we want a scheme for ten years, a scheme prepared by people for a society that has not yet been created. Hon. members opposite know that they have a philosophy in politics with which we do not agree, but to both sides the development of our education is essential and there we can work together. We require development in South Africa as we envisage it in future. Hon. members opposite require this education for the South African state that they envisage, a state containing Bantustans, with which we do not agree. But whether you accept the view of the Government or of the Opposition, both sides agree that education should be developed. The hon. the Minister will realize that as I have been speaking I have been thinking, as he was, of the education of students at the universities for White people. What I have said applies <i>a fortiori</i> to Coloured education, to Bantu education and to Indian education. If education is essential for our White people, it is even more essential for our Bantu people if they are going to develop these states. Let us take a look at what we are doing about Bantu education. I think we are not doing what we ought to do. When one takes a look at the Estimates one should feel ashamed as a South African of what we are doing. We give Bantu education a pegged amount of R13,000,000 a year. In addition we say: &#x201C;You will pay your own direct taxation.&#x201D; In addition to that we say that the parents can pay at school as well. We do not do that in the case of White children. This Government, from Government sources, gives R13,000,000 a year to Bantu education for 70 per cent of the people of the country, and our provinces, for White education, for fewer pupils, spend R130,000,000 a year&#x2014;ten times as much. I think we can do more. I know that the hon. the Minister says the amount is pegged. It is pegged in the Bantu Education Account. I think the time has come when we must debate this whole question of the Bantu Education Account. Here we have the Minister of Bantu Education running the Department as a bed of Procrustes. If he has <span class="col_3447-3448" refersTo="page_0416"/>to expand in one direction, he has to contract in another. We tell the world how many more thousands of children are at school. Why are there so many more thousands of children at school&#x003F; Because we have introduced double sessions. If you have two sessions a day, naturally you can double the number of children without increasing the number of teachers or the cost. If you have four sessions a day for the teacher you could probably reduce the cost still further. I think we must get away from that. If we are going to develop Bantustans, or if we are going to follow our policy, then we must improve this system of Bantu education. I believe that for the future most of these people we are educating at the Bantu university colleges will have to be teachers, because a third to a sixth of your graduates in any community have to be teachers; I would say from 20 to 25 per cent. By &#x201C;teachers&#x201D; I mean teachers in the broadest sense: university lecturers, research workers and teachers in the primary and secondary schools. We shall have to do that for Bantu education. I think we have reached the stage now when we need a very serious decision on education in the future. I know we say that Bantu education has to be separate but, Sir, at the University of South Africa, when they have their courses up there in Pretoria, they all meet together&#x2014;Bantu, Indian and Coloured. They attend the same course; they are doing the very thing to which the Government objected at Fort Hare. It is exactly the same thing, reported here, on the highest authority, by the departmental sheet, the <i>Bantoe-onderwysblad.</i> Out of their own mouths they are condemned! Now, Sir, I want to put this question to the hon. the Minister about these accounts. I see that the amount for Bantu education has been reduced this year by R3,500,000. Presumably that is because that money is the Transkei contribution. The Minister said in his Budget speech that there was a grant to the Transkei of R13,000,000. Does that grant of R13,000,000 include this R3,500,000&#x003F; I think it is very important to know that. We are going to give R1,000,000 under this sub-head when we have authority to give R1,500,000. Why do we do this&#x003F; Surely the time for us to assist Bantu education to produce the type of leaders they want is now. We must be prepared to do it; the old days have gone.</p>

<p>Finally I want to ask the Minister this question about the Transkei. There was a very important congress in Europe last year to discuss education for the whole of Europe, for all the developed countries of Europe. It was sponsored by the Ford Foundation. Should the Ford Foundation or the Carnegie Foundation be prepared to help in the Transkei what would be the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reaction&#x003F; Let me just mention what the Rockefeller Foundation has been doing in Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This private American foundation has allotted $30,000 till September 1964 to help train teachers of English and French at the University of Dakar in Senegal and the University of Ibadan in Nigeria.</block>

<p>They have given $226,268 to the University of Ibadan for its over-all development; they have given $48,550 to expand studies at Makerere University College; they have given $86,000 for a maize improvement programme at the plant breeding station in Njoro, Kenya; they have given $75,000 to the Yale University in the United States for young Africans taking advanced legal training; they have given $22,800 to train African scholars at the University of London; they have given $10,000 to the Haile Selassie University in Addis Ababa. Now, should they be prepared to assist us in the Transkei, what would be the Minister&#x2019;s reaction&#x003F; It is quite obvious that the Transkei has not sufficient money to develop the system of education that we would like to see, and if it does not have that money, how are they going to get it&#x003F; Would our Government be prepared to allow these foundations to come in and assist&#x003F;</p>

<p>If this country that is being promoted and assisted to obtain independence does not have the money, the obvious thing is to say that you will allow everybody else to contribute and help. I think that is only fair and reasonable. In the meantime I think we must give serious thought to the question of helping in Coloured education, a matter which was discussed here by the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden). I am reminded of the joint sitting we had here in this House when the late Dr. Malan appealed to our party and went so far as to quote Shakespeare, he was so earnest in his appeal. He said: &#x201C;There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.&#x201D; That is the tide we are on now and I hope the hon. the Minister will take it at the flood.</p>

<speech by="#kotze">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. KOTZE</person>:</from>

<p>It has apparently become the custom for the party on that side of the House to attack the governing party in regard to various matters, irrespective of <span class="col_3449-3450" refersTo="page_0417"/>whether or not they bring the name of South Africa into discredit in the outside world by so doing. The hon. member who has just sat down has had a great deal to say about training. Starting with the no-confidence debate we have been attacked by that side of the House because of the lack of trained labour, because of job reservation, because of the Broederbond and everything else. I just want to address this one remark to the hon. member before making my speech. Notwithstanding the millions that the Rockefeller Foundation distributed throughout the world like a Father Christmas, what is the position to-day in connection with graduates amongst the Bantu people&#x003F; Last year there were only slightly more than 1,700 throughout the rest of Africa south of the Sahara while in the Republic of South Africa we had more than 2,400, notwithstanding the small amounts which we make available for the training of our Bantu. Last year we had 1,768,000 Bantu children at school which represents about 85 per cent of the entire Bantu school-going population. In addition to that, as the Christian guardians of the Coloureds, we had 317,000 Coloured children attending school. We are providing them with all their requirements gradually and in harmony with the development of the whole country. Before dealing with this subject the hon. member spoke as though we in this country were doing nothing in connection with training. I just want to say in passing that since the National Party came into power in 1948 four new universities have come into being and five new faculties&#x2014;an engineering faculty, a science faculty, a dentistry faculty and an agricultural faculty. But we have also made bursaries available. I just want to mention in passing that it is not only the State itself that has made bursaries available. Bursaries have also been made available by the Railways; out of funds which it obtained from the Central Government the C.S.I.R. made more than 910 bursaries available for scientific training and the Public Service Commission also made 210 bursaries available during the past year. One can go on in this way but I do not actually want to discuss this point. I think the educationists on this side will deal adequately with the hon. member who&#x2014;I say this with all respect&#x2014;did something unpatriotic by comparing our country with foreign countries. With the limited means at our disposal the 3,500,000 Whites in South Africa are doing a tremendous amount for the non-White people and they are doing their duty as the Christian guardians of the non-White people within South Africa&#x2019;s borders. Actually, I feel like continuing in the same vein but I know that there are educationists on this side of the House who want to reply to hon. members opposite. Not one of the hon. members to whom I want to reply is here; they make accusations and then they leave the chamber. The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) who is a comparatively new member and with whom I shall therefore deal lightly, made the accusation that the National Party only talks about the Coloureds. Unfortunately, the hon. member has forgotten who the people are who are actually doing things for the Coloureds. He has forgotten that it was this Nationalist Government which established the tremendous housing schemes that we find today on the Cape Flats and throughout the whole country. He forgets about the University College of the Western Cape; he forgets about the Coloured Rural Areas Act; he forgets completely about the Coloured Education Act, with its broad pattern for the development of the Coloured in general, which was passed last year and in terms of which Coloured education was taken over by the Central Government. Apparently he thinks of one thing only and that is the franchise. In this connection the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) told us a few days ago that demands for the franchise and political rights make up only 9 per cent of all the demands made by the Coloureds. He proved to us that the non-Whites were more interested in matters such as wages, housing and so forth than in the franchise.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) could find only one thing to talk about and that was, &#x201C;drought, drought, drought&#x201D;. In the past the hon. member always added the question of a fodder bank but he has apparently now got out of that groove after 30 years; he has now become wiser and he has not raised the question of a national fodder bank in this debate. But immediately after he referred to the question of drought he made a number of accusations. Amongst other things he referred to what he described as the basic flaw in the agricultural policy of the Government. He followed this up by saying that the Government was doing nothing to promote the interests of the farming community. The hon. member finds fault with the training facilities that are made available to our farmers. He also finds fault with the technical basis on which the whole agricultural policy is being built up in these modern times in which we are living. Mr. Speaker, these are what I consider to be fundamental matters and when we come to these fundamental matters it is clear that the hon. member is making a very big mistake.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at what the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has done for agriculture. A tremendous change has taken place since 1948. Not only has the Directorates of Agricultural Research and Agricultural Field Services been set up to coordinate agricultural research and agricultural field services, but many other innovations have been introduced, such as the Divisions of Agricultural Mechanization and Agricultural Engineering. These form the nucleus of a future Research Institute for Agricultural Engineering. What has taken place under these <span class="col_3451-3452" refersTo="page_0418"/>Directorates&#x003F; A number of new research institutes and divisions have been established. Originally there were three of them. These three have been enlarged to what they are today and four have been newly-established. There is also a research institute for citrus and sub-tropical fruit. I cannot mention all of them because my time is too limited, but I do want to mention a few of them. There is the institute for fruit and food technology at Stellenbosch; the institute for viticulture and wine-making at Stellenbosch; the institute for the protection of plants at Pretoria; the horticultural institute at Roodeplaas, Pretoria; the veterinary institute at Onderstepoort and the institute for animal husbandry and dairying at Pretoria. Other institutions besides these have also been established. These are all experimental farms and research stations which have been brought into being because the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services has wanted to build up modern agriculture scientifically so as to comply with the requirements of the times. We now have an experimental farm at Ermelo, a pineapple research station at East London, experimental farms at Elgin and De Dooms, a citrus research station at Addo and Citrusdal and a karakul farm at Upington. The Upington farmers made that farm available and the farm itself has been valued at R150,000. It is an experimental farm. These are only some of the things that have been done by this Department and then the hon. member for East London (City) finds that there is such a terrible basic flaw in our agriculture! We can take the matter even further, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>The question has been asked as to what the State is doing to promote farming. It has been said that the State has failed to make training facilities available to the farmers. When this Government came into power there were only three faculties of agriculture in existence&#x2014;at the Universities of Stellenbosch, Pretoria and Natal. A fourth one was established in 1958 at Bloemfontein University. In 1948 the number of students enrolled in those three faculties totalled 479. By 1961 their number had increased to 1,236. We go further. In 1948 we only had 46 teachers of agricultural subjects at those three institutions. Now, in 1964, that number has increased to 210. The hon. member for East London (City) continues to find fault with the agricultural services in South Africa. I want now to discuss the basis on which our agriculture is built up and the scientific part that it plays.</p>

<p>Let us see how the farmers make use of these facilities. From 1948 to 1958 the State made 668 bursaries available and the control boards, under the guidance and control of the State, made a further 712 bursaries available. Altogether 1,380 bursaries were made available. One cannot say therefore that any fault can be found with the State in this regard. I feel rather ashamed to say that the farmer himself must take the blame in this regard; he has not reacted to the extent to which the State has given him guidance. That is apparent from the figures. We have five colleges in the country&#x2014;at Glen, Potchefstroom, Cedara, Groot-fontein and Elsenburg. In 1948 there were 323 students at these various colleges. In 1956 there were 532, in 1959 558 and last year, 560. Accommodation was available for more students at those various colleges. Last year there were 560 students at those colleges but accommodation was available for 659. There were only 95 students at Cedara but there was accommodation there for 103 students; there were 94 students at Elsenburg although there was accommodation there for 96; there were only 62 students at Glen although there was accommodation there for 102. There was ample opportunity for students to study at the college at which they could be given the requisite training. But that is not all; the accusation goes further. The accusation has always been that we do not have an adequate number of trained staff. But what is the actual position&#x003F; In 1947 the staff of the Agricultural Technical Services Division totalled 2,218 but in 1963 they totalled 4,474. When we analyse this figure we find that in 1947 we had 93 extension officers while in 1962 there were 234. Research workers: In 1947 we had 718 and to-day we have 1,324. Technicians: 438 in 1947 and 1,077 in 1962. There were 294 staff members in the general division in 1947 and 1,822 in 1962. This proves conclusively that the accusation of the hon. member for East London (City) is quite unfounded. The hon. member sucked a number of these accusations out of his thumb. I cannot express it in any other way. It was unfair of him to make those accusations and, to my mind, unjust as well.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Gordonia (Mr. G. de K. Maree) has tried to reply to the accusations made by this side in respect of the handling of the agricultural industry in South Africa. The hon. member saw fit to quote passages to us from some pamphlet or other which was drawn up for him either by the Department or by the Information Service of the Nationalist Party during some previous election. What did the hon. member say then&#x003F; He went on to say that they had established all the new directorates in the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Very well. They did reorganize the Department; they did establish a Directorate of Research, etc., but what we want to say to the hon. member for Gordonia and the Nationalist Party is this: We are not satisfied with the amount of research that is being done. We know that the number of research projects is being increased every year, but the question that we want to put to them is this: To what extent do the results of that research reach the practical farmer&#x003F; One of the fundamental problems in this country is that although these things are being done there is such a shortage of extension officers and trained technicians capable of conveying that information to the <span class="col_3453-3454" refersTo="page_0419"/>farmer, that the farmer does not get the benefit which he ought to get from this research.</p>

<p>Has the hon. member forgotten about the Rautenbach Commission&#x003F; That commission was appointed by his Minister of Agricultural Technical Services. The commission was appointed to help him to alleviate the tremendous shortage of technical staff that exists in the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. To what extent has the Department implemented the recommendations of the Rautenbach Commission&#x003F; The hon. member should look at the questions which were replied to last year by the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and there he will see to what extent they have succeeded in overcoming this tremendous problem of shortage of staff, a problem which they themselves admit does exist. The hon. member then draws this doubtful inference; he says that it is not their fault if the farmers do not make use of the services which are made available to them!</p>

<p>I want to deal with something else this afternoon. The greatest problem which the farmers in South Africa are experiencing at the present time is the problem which was mentioned here by the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman), and that is that the farmers are simply unable to maintain a decent standard of living as a result of the downward tendency in the prices of agricultural produce. That is something which the hon. member for Gordonia cannot deny. That is why more and more farmers are leaving the platteland every year. That is the problem which faces the Government, and unless the Government solves that problem they cannot boast that they are sympathetically disposed towards the farmer of South Africa.</p>

<p>The other matter with which I should like to deal is the charge made here by the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker). He says that the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) alleged that we wanted the implementation of the Orange River scheme to be delayed. What nonsense! What the hon. member for Constantia said was that the shortage of manpower would force us to delay the implementation of certain essential schemes in this country. That was said not only by the hon. member for Constantia but by the hon. the Minister of Finance himself. The Minister of Finance himself made that statement at page 23 of his Budget speech. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To return to the internal economic situation, the problem of bottlenecks will certainly require attention. As regards skilled labour, the Government is doing and will continue to do its best, through training and through immigration, to alleviate the shortage.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister then went on to say what certain employers could do to improve the position&#x2014;for example, by better organization and better utilization of labour, including older people and partially disabled people. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The public sector can also help to relieve the pressure in the construction industry by postponing, where possible, capital construction projects or by spreading the work over a longer period of time. This, however, is not always so easily done. Many projects are in fact essential to continued economic expansion in the private sector and cannot be postponed without seriously retarding that expansion. For social as well as economic reasons others, such schools and hospitals, cannot be unduly delayed.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. the Minister of Finance said. He then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But so far as it is possible, it is the duty of the Government, the Provincial Administrations and the local authorities to curb their capital construction programmes at the present time.</block>

<p>The hon. Minister of Finance himself referred to this matter, and now that the hon. member for Constantia draws the sound inference from that statement that it may even mean that a scheme such as the Orange River scheme will possibly have to suffer later on, the hon. member for Cradock interprets it as a suggestion by this side of the House that the implementation of that scheme must be delayed. The hon. member for Constantia merely stated that as a result of the shortage of manpower in South Africa, which is also recognized by the hon. the Minister, certain capital programmes would necessarily have to be delayed to a certain extent&#x2014;not because of United Party policy but as a result of Government policy. They have the money but they do not have the manpower to tackle it.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the matter that I want to touch upon this afternoon and that is the shortage of manpower in this country. I do not think there is anybody who will deny that this problem does exist. No person in this House will deny that we have a shortage of trained technologists, scientists, managers and medical practitioners. I just want to quote, for example, what was stated by Dr. Frikkie Meyer in a foreward to a journal issued by the National Development and Managerial Society in January 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By 1970 South Africa will need 2,345,000 people who have received training in management to meet the needs of our economy. By that time South Africa&#x2019;s economically active population will be 7,000,000 out of a total of 18,000,000. By 1970, in order to <span class="col_3455-3456" refersTo="page_0420"/>sustain our economic growth, we will need at least 728,000 managers, officers and working owners, 917,000 workers and 700,000 technical, professional and allied specialists.</block>

<p>That is the view of an expert body in this field, and one asks oneself whether, with our small population of something like 3,000,000 Whites, we shall be able, in spite of the best immigration schemes, to cope with the development which lies ahead; whether we shall be able to do so without making great sacrifices in our country. And having put this question, the next question that arises is this: What can we do to have more trained people, more scientists, doctors, managers, etc. at our disposal&#x003F; Where should we start&#x003F; Where are we to get them&#x003F; Everybody admits that immigration is a wonderful way of helping to solve this problem, but this problem of a shortage of trained manpower is not one which is peculiar to South Africa; it is a problem which exists throughout the whole world. There is a shortage of manpower in all developing countries. In the first place therefore we in South Africa must not imagine that we can solve this problem through immigration; we should see whether we cannot get this trained manpower from the ranks of our own people, from the ranks of our White population in this country. I contend that the time has come when, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said this year, we should work out some sort of crash programme in an attempt to meet the requirements of our country as far as trained manpower is concerned. How can we do so&#x003F; We are grateful for the fact that we have approximately 45,000 students at our South African universities, including the University of South Africa. I feel that we should start with highly trained people, or with the people we need most, in other words, we should start at the universities which have to train these people. We are grateful for the fact that we have 45,000 students at our universities, but is that the maximum number we can have at our universities&#x003F; Is that number adequate&#x003F; Have we an adequate number of universities in this country&#x003F; I believe that we should start with our youth, with the boys and girls who are not in a position to obtain university training. I believe that there are hundreds of boys and girls in this country who would like to receive university training but who in the nature of things cannot afford it because it is so expensive. As my witnesses in this regard I want to call Mr. J. P. Coetzee, director of military production in South Africa and Dr. S. P. Ligthelur, who is head of the Department of Physics at the University of Potchefstroom. A few months ago these two men wrote an article which appeared in the <i>Huisgenoot</i> and in which they said that we were wasting our most precious manpower in South Africa. They refer in this article to investigations made by the Department of Education, and they estimate that by 1965 we will have a shortage of 15,000 scientists and a shortage of 2,600 engineers. They point out that if we want to cope with the Iscor expansion costing R560,000,000, with the Sasol expansion, the Orange River scheme, the Pongola project and the oil refinery projects which we contemplate tackling over the next ten years, we will be faced with a tremendous shortage of manpower in South Africa. Surveys made by them disclosed that we were losing about 250 boys and girls every year who are unable to go to university because they themselves or their parents lack the funds. If we lose 250 potential students every year who cannot attend university because they do not have the funds, it means that over a period of five years we lose more than 1,000, and naturally the longer the period the more we lose. What can we do&#x003F;</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the Minister of Finance has made provision for R13,000,000 in his Estimates for universities and for an additional few million rand on Loan Account, and in spite of the fact that he pays 70 per cent of the cost of universities, has the time not come when a commission of inquiry should be appointed to examine the possibility of providing free university training in South Africa for capable students who do not have the means to go to university&#x003F; We do not say that this must be done, but we feel that the time has come to appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate this matter. It is true that bursaries and loans go a long way towards improving the position. South Africa would not be the first country in the world to adopt such a system. There are many other countries in the world where university training is free. Is this not the appropriate time, in these circumstances, to see to it that such a scheme is called into being for young people whose parents are not in a position to pay for their university training&#x003F;</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Finance, upon which an amendment had been moved by Mr. Waterson, adjourned on 20 March, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended on Friday I was pointing out that the manpower shortage in this country was an acute problem but that it was a problem which was not peculiar to our own country. I added that although immigration could make a material contribution in solving this problem, all countries, even those countries from which we get our immigrants, were also struggling with this problem and doing everything in their power to retain their own people.</p>

<p>I then suggested that we still had many potential scientists and technologists in our own country if we could only assist those people to receive university training. The debate was interrupted at the point where I was asking that a commission of inquiry be appointed to go into the question of free university training, particularly for capable and deserving students.</p>

<p>Sir, when I talk about free training I naturally exclude hostel fees and board and lodging charges. It will continue to remain the responsibility of the student to meet the cost of his board and lodging. We know that the State at the present time is paying something like 75 per cent of the expenditure connected with our universities. The fact that the State accepts greater financial responsibility should not give the State any greater right to interfere with the domestic affairs of our universities. That is something, of course, that we cannot allow, as the hon. the Minister himself had occasion to point out in the course of his speech during the past week-end.</p>

<p>The question, however, which faces the authorities is this: If our manpower is not being utilized efficiently, where is the wastage taking place&#x003F; I think it is obvious that that wastage is taking place both before and after matriculation. There is a tremendous wastage there. That fact is borne out clearly by the investigations made by Mr. Coetzee and Dr. Ligthelm who sent out questionnaires to about 600 principals throughout the Republic. It would not be difficult, of course, to pick holes in the proposals that we are putting forward here. It may be said, for example, that there are not enough universities. We may be asked on what basis the selection is going to be made and what we mean by &#x201C;capable and deserving&#x201D; students. We may be told that our existing institutions cannot cope with this because they do not have the necessary facilities at their disposal. I want to submit to the House, however, that this matter is so urgent that the Government should consider as a matter of urgency every proposal in which there is any substance at all, and that it should not simply dismiss it with a shrug of the shoulders. This shortage is still going to assume greater proportions and the result is going to be a decline in the rate of growth of our country. It will pay us to tackle <span class="col_3459-3460" refersTo="page_0422"/>this problem at this stage rather than to try to resolve it at a later stage when the present conditions have worsened.</p>

<p>I contend that our approach to university training is out of date. University training is no longer the sole property of certain selected students and students of means, or at any rate it ought not to be under present-day circumstances. It should be placed within the reach of the man in the street. Drastic adjustments are called for to make university education available to every White man in particular. University training is no longer a privilege; every White student is unquestionably entitled to it. Sir, it is fitting that the Cilliers Report has made its appearance at this particular stage. One welcomes the recommendations which were disclosed by the hon. the Minister during the week-end, particularly with reference to increased salaries for the teaching staff at our universities, as well as the other concessions which are going to be made and which will be of considerable help to the universities in embarking upon capital expansion. But in saying that I must also express my regret that this report, which was submitted to the hon. the Minister before the end of last year, was only made known to us last Friday when the hon. the Minister had occasion to make a public speech with regard to this matter. In these circumstances we are entitled to ask one or two questions immediately: Is provision made in the Estimates which are now before us for the additional expenditure which will be incurred in the new financial year&#x003F; Or does the hon. the Minister of Finance propose to come along later on with supplementary estimates to make the necessary provision&#x003F; As I have said, one welcomes the main recommendations contained in this report, but what astonishes one is the idea put forward by the hon. the Minister in the course of his speech at Bloemfontein, as reported in the public Press, that since the State will now be contributing more the universities should also consider the question of making the students pay increased tuition fees. Let me ask the Minister immediately whether that recommendation is also contained in the report or whether it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own idea&#x003F; Is it realized by this advisory committee, which consists of all the Rectors, the principals of universities throughout South Africa, that if tuition fees are increased it will mean increased expenditure for parents who have children at university, or increased expenditure for the students themselves&#x003F; I want to say that if tuition fees are increased as a result of the recommendations contained in this report, then it will simply mean that what is given with one hand will be taken away with the other; what promised to be a benefit will become a disadvantage again. An increase in tuition fees will not help to attract the gifted but needy child to our universities. In conclusion, let me put this question once again: If university fees are to be increased, why should certain people only have the honour of receiving university training; why should it be confined to the selected and chosen few&#x003F; The amendment of this side of the House asks that education in this country, particularly technical training and university training, should be made more readily available and brought more within the reach of the ordinary man in the street. It is for that reason that we on this side support this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education,_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I feel that I should take part in this debate immediately, particularly in view of the very large degree of ignorance which apparently prevails in connection with what is being done in the sphere of education and training in this country. I must say that if hon. members on the other side who took part in this debate had to make their SDeeches to-day instead of last Friday they would have chanced their tune considerably. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) has made the accusation that the Cilliers Report was placed in the hands of the Cabinet towards the end of last year. That is correct. But this is a very important report. The Government had to consider it carefully; it was not dealt with just lightly and haphazardly, as the hon. member would perhaps have liked us to do. Proper consideration was given to every facet of this report in the knowledge that this report, if accepted, would introduce an entirely new dispensation in the whole of our university system. It is not merely a question of adapting the recommendations to the old Holloway formula as far as the subsidization of universities is concerned. The report contains many important recommendations, and I hope to have the opportunity to discuss this report again under my Vote and to give hon. members the opportunity to do so. We can then discuss the report in greater detail.</p>

<p>As I have said, hon. members revealed a great deal of ignorance in this matter. The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell! was apparently not satisfied with the proposal contained in the Budget speech of my hon. colleague, the Minister of Finance, to establish a National Bursary Fund. The Opposition felt that they had to put forward a certain amount of criticism. The hon. member for Pinetown wants a tax rebate in respect of all moneys spent by parents on the training of their children; the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) wants a commission of inquiry consisting of a large number of experts. Remarkably enough, the hon. member did not include educationists amongst his experts but I do not know whether that was not purely an oversight on the part of the hon. member. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) wants to introduce free instruction for needy students at our universities. Sir, the greatest measure of planning has been undertaken by this Government, and I find it remarkable that hon. members opposite should come here today and plead for planning. We all admit that there is a shortage of manpower. But <span class="col_3461-3462" refersTo="page_0423"/>there has been such a phenomenal growth under the National Party Government that that shortage of manpower is something which none of us could foresee. [Interjections.] The fact that there has been this phenomenal growth is really a bitter pill for hon. members opposite to swallow, and they are very pleased, apparently, that there is a manpower shortage to-day. But, Sir, there is a manpower shortage throughout the whole of the Western world. There has been great industrial expansion. The solution which hon. members opposite have at the back of their minds for solving this problem of manpower shortage is one which they dare not admit openly. The only one who dares to come out with it openly is the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman).</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member for Boland is also prepared to say it openly; he also has the courage of his convictions. Members of the United Party, however, simply hint at this solution and they try to make a political issue out of it. I repeat that there has been planning.</p>

<p>The fact that there has been planning is borne out in the first place by what we did in 1962 when we established the National Education Advisory Council, and one of the very first matters which is engaging the attention of the Advisory Council is the very objection raised by the hon. member for Kensington in connection with mathematics and science teachers. The obvious body to undertake this planning is the Advisory Council. Why, then, should we look around to see whether we cannot find some other group of people who will be able to put forward a better plan than the plan put forward by this Council, the appointment of which was welcomed by the hon. member for Kensington himself&#x003F; There has been planning. The first task which was entrusted to this Education Advisory Council was to examine the position of the teacher in all its various facets, his remuneration, the shortage of mathematics teachers, the shortage of science teachers, etc. Great headway has already been made in this connection.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot deal with all the different facets simultaneously, as the hon. member usually tries to do. I shall deal with them one by one.</p>

<p>If hon. members read their newspapers this morning they will have seen that the educational heads are gathering in Pretoria to-day. At this moment I cannot reveal everything that has already been done, but so much progress has been made with the planning that we will certainly reap the first fruits of the work of this large and important Council in the course of this year. Hon. members opposite voted with us for this principle; they agreed that this was the right course to adopt. The A. C. Cilliers Report has now been released and hon. members can get a copy of my speech from the Department of Information and I hope they will study it together with the report. But what did the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) say here&#x003F; He wants to know whether provision has been made in these Estimates for the additional expenditure that will flow from the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Cilliers Report. There is an item in the Estimates in which provision is made for more than R2,000,000 in respect of contributions to universities in order to comply with the request made to us.</p>

<p>Hon. members will observe that the A. C. Cilliers Commission recommends higher salaries, which are well deserved. Provision has been made for the appointment of auxiliary staff so that professors or other lecturers who have large classes will be enabled, with the assistance of demonstrators and with the assistance of tutors and other auxiliary staff, to give more attention to the students. For that purpose alone R600,000 has been provided so as to be able to provide better training at the universities. More adequate provision has been made for research, for laboratories and for libraries. Do hon. members realize that as a result of the acceptance of this report the contributions of the State have risen from slightly more than 66 per cent to a little more than 71 per cent&#x003F;</p>

<p>The main issue here is what has already been done and from what date the planning started. In this regard I can tell hon. members that the Government has not been asleep, as hon. members opposite try to suggest. This Government had the vision to plan right from the beginning. I want to mention <i>seriatim</i> what has already been done and give the House just a few figures in this connection: In the year 1948, when the present Government took over, there were 19,728 students at our universities, whereas in 1963 there were 34,814, an increase of 76 per cent over the 1948 figure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education,_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Be that as it may. Let us see now what has been done for the students. Government allowances to these universities amounted to R2,023,896 in 1948, whereas in 1961 they amounted to R10,694,095, an increase of 428 per cent. Although the number of students increased by 76 per cent, the subsidies to the universities were increased by 428 per cent. But an even more significant figure is the following: In 1948 the Government allowance per student was R102.3, while in 1963 it amounted to R295.61, an increase of 189 per cent. Hon. members opposite represent themselves as experts who are entitled to put <span class="col_3463-3464" refersTo="page_0424"/>forward criticism; they suggest to the public that nothing is being done for the poor student. These figures, however, prove precisely the opposite. Although there has also been a rise in the cost of living, there has been an increase of 189 per cent in the allowance paid per student. That is what the State alone is doing; we shall see in a moment what is being done by other bodies.</p>

<p>Then I come to the question of capital funds to expand the universities; to ensure that the necessary accommodation is available. In this regard, too, the State has done its duty because the State guarantees 40 per cent of the interest and redemption charges. In 1948-9 the total amount of capital funds approved by way of loans amounted to R139,000, but in 1963-4 it amounted to R3,598,124, an increase of 2,489 per cent as far as capital expenditure is concerned. The purpose of this is to meet the capital needs of the university in erecting the necessary buildings and buying the necessary equipment.</p>

<p>Now we come to the question of bursaries and loans. Sir, I want to say here that there is no necessity for any young man or any young woman in this country who wishes to receive higher education to forgo that training because of the fact that the parents are needy and unable to pay for it. Here are the facts: In 1956 we introduced a bursary and loan scheme for universities in terms of which bursaries and study loans may be granted by the universities to needy students. The bursary awards amount to R60,000 per annum, and since 1956 a sum of R253,000 has already been made available for the purpose of loans. In addition to that there is the Victoria bursary of R1,800 per annum for post-graduate study; there are also the overseas exchange bursaries which amount to a total of R48,000 per annum; then there are the national bursaries awarded by the university principals amounting to R16,800 per annum; there is the bursary scheme of the Public Service Commission, for which the Government also makes provision; for 1963-4 the amount is R289,000. Furthermore, bursaries are made available for preand post-graduate studies by the Railway Administration, the Atomic Energy Board, the oil companies, the Chamber of Mines and C.S.I.R. The C.S.I.R. alone makes available approximately R513,500 per annum. Then there is the Helpmekaar Study Fund with its grand effort to assist needy students. Then lastly there is the proposal by the hon. the Minister of Finance to establish a National Bursary Fund. Apart from that most of the universiteis have private funds which they make available in the form of bursary loans. I want to tell hon. members that it has always been possible, in some way or other to give partial if not full assistance to students who are really in need. The impression which is being given here that there are so many people who are deprived of the privilege of receiving university education is a false impression. I do concede that difficulties are experienced in connection with board and lodging in the larger centres, and that is why the Government has started with the establishment of a new university at Port Elizabeth. It is in the larger centres that the middle and lower income groups find it difficult to meet the cost of board and lodging. That is why it has not always been possible for every prospective student to attend university. The percentage of students in the Port Elizabeth complex was particularly low. It may become necessary later on, as pointed out by the Cilliers Commission in its report, to establish additional universities which will have to be treated on the same basis, but this is something which has to be properly planned and worked out; universities cannot simply be established haphazardly. The hon. member knows that we are going as far as we possibly can with regard to university training, which is a very expensive item. Where there are large concentrations of people we will do everything we can to meet the requirements, and in fact we have already made a start in that direction, but we cannot simply go and establish universities all over the place. With the establishment of this new bursary fund my hon. colleague has introduced a new dispensation which will make it possible for many students to make use of these new facilities. The hon. the Minister has estimated the amount at R500,000 but I think that is a very conservative estimate and I predict that this amount will very soon have to be increased considerably.</p>

<p>Secondly I come to the question of technicians. Attention is being given not only to university training but also to technical and vocational education. If what has been done in the sphere of technical and vocational education does not testify to the most careful planning on the part of this Government since 1948, then I do not know what planning is. As far as new schools are concerned the capital expenditure in 1948 amounted to R2,412,000, and during the corresponding five-year period from 1958 to 1963 it was increased from R2,000,000 to R8,311,000&#x2014;nearly four times as much. In the past five years, since the passing of the Vocational Education Act in 1955, almost four times the previous amount has been spent on vocational education. Then there is the expansion at the existing schools and colleges. The expenditure in this connection from 1948 to 1955 amounted to R3,000,000, and in 1963 the expenditure on extensions alone at existing schools and colleges rose to R5,500,000. Is that not planning&#x003F; These figures bear eloquent testimony to the fact that there has been planning. Take the annual current expenditure on this sort of education. In 1948 it amounted to R2,309,000; in 1962&#x2014;the figure for 1963 is still not available&#x2014;the expenditure mounted to R9,500,000, an increase of 312 per cent from 1948 to 1962. Take the teaching staff at vocational schools. In 1948 we had 1,052 teachers only; in 1963 we had 2,691 capable teachers in charge of vocational training. Let us compare the number of pupils in 1958 with the number in 1963. In 1958 we had 2,069 pupils at the higher commercial schools and in 1963, five years <span class="col_3465-3466" refersTo="page_0425"/>later, we had 6,467. In the higher technical schools we had 5,065 in 1958 and in 1963 we had 10,349, twice as many. We take all the applicants we can get and we make provision for them in these schools, even if we have to do so in temporary buildings to begin with. Then we still have the higher domestic science schools where the figures are 980 and 1,230 respectively. As far as these different schools are concerned, the total number of pupils in 1958 was 18,630, and to-day the figure stands at 30,025. Since vocational education is a very expensive form of education, however, one cannot establish a school in every small town; we must have at least 300 pupils before we can establish a new school. In the meantime we have our continuation classes which are developing into full-fledged schools. But what is happening in the new year&#x003F; If hon. members had looked at these figures they would have been more moderate in their criticism and perhaps more careful. In 1964-5 new schools will be completed at an estimated cost of R7,489,000, and only two of these schools will be replacing existing schools. If hon. members opposite had just taken the trouble to look at these figures before making their speeches they would not have uttered so much nonsense here.</p>

<p>The hon. member does not understand what I am saying, of course, nor is he trying to understand it. These schools which will be completed in 1964-5 will be able to absorb an additional 4,570 pupils. The hon. member said in the course of his speech that immigration was a good thing, but that immigration was not the complete answer. We realize that, and that is why the Government is planning in such a way that these 12 schools will be able to absorb an additional 4,570 pupils in 1964-5, in other words, we are training our own people. Provision is also made in these Estimates for additions and improvements at a further 11 schools at a cost of R1,460,000 which will enable them to accommodate an additional 820 pupils. Provision is therefore being made for a total of more than 5,000 additional pupils in the new financial year.</p>

<p>It has also been decided to build 49 new schools as from 1955-6 at a cost of R27,500,000, and these schools will be able to accommodate 24,500 additional pupils. Then there will be extensions at 35 existing schools at a cost of R7,000,000 to accommodate 5,260 additional pupils. As the money and the teaching staff become available, it is proposed therefore to spend a total of R34,500,000 as from 1955-6.</p>

<p>We now come to the poor child about whom the hon. member is so concerned. No tuition fees are payable in these vocational schools; books and stationery are provided free of charge. The charge for board and lodging is the very reasonable amount of R120 per annum as far as the vocational schools are concerned, and if the parent is so indigent that he is unable to pay anything at all, the child is given free board and lodging. If the parent is so poor that the child has to be provided with clothing, then clothing is even given to him and in certain cases even pocket-money. The hon. member now comes along and represents himself as the champion of the poor child. I say that we are almost going too far. In my own opinion we are going very far indeed. The hon. member tries to make the world believe that this Government is doing nothing for the middle and the low income groups in respect of education. He wants the principle of free education to be applied to needy university students. Those students can receive university education by means of bursaries and also by means of loans. I am strongly in favour of granting loans to students because I want the autonomy of the universities to be preserved. We are rapidly reaching the stage where our educational institutions are becoming State institutions. The contribution of the State has already increased from 66 per cent to 71 per cent, and if that is the trend, then I want to issue a warning note, as I did at Bloemfontein on Saturday, that the universities and other people and even the students themselves, even if they have to be assisted by means of loans, must co-operate with us so that these institutions do not become outright State institutions. I too jealously guard the principle that they should remain autonomous institutions.</p>

<p>Then I come to the training of technicians, of which we have a great shortage. I want to deal with this very briefly. We have various courses, in fact a long series of courses, for the training of our people. But we also have courses to launch people on their careers. In other words, people already in employment can undergo intensive courses of training in the various subjects at technical colleges for 4&#x00BD; months, that is to say for one half of the academic year. During the remaining 4&#x00BD; months they work for their employer and thus earn money. Let me just point out what results have been achieved. Although these technical courses were instituted only three or four years ago, certificates and diplomas have already been issued to 1,126 persons. These courses are for chemical and laboratory technicians, engineers, surveyors and draughtsmen, agricultural technicians, meteorological technicians and radiographers. Then there are courses in sugar technology, labour therapy, physiotherapy and medical technology. These 1,126 certificates and diplomas have been issued to these people, but in November of last year the number of people who had enrolled for these various technical courses was 3,351. Then I just want to mention a number of courses which are given at technical colleges after matriculation. I refer to the competency certificate in engineering (mechanical and electrical); the examinations of the respective institutes of engineers and the courses for health <span class="col_3467-3468" refersTo="page_0426"/>and meat inspectors. Then we have courses in commerce, art and administration; there is the national commercial diploma; there are secretarial courses; there are courses for students who wish to become chartered accountants and members of the Chartered Insitute of Secretaries; there is a course in industrial design and in accounting and auditing. If I had the time I could convince this House and the whole country that this Government has in fact planned ahead systematically to meet our requirements. Moreover, to plan for our immediate requirements we have the National Education Advisory Council, the Scientific Advisory Council and the Economic Advisory Council, which are all giving their attention to this great problem. What is needed is a crash programme to meet our immediate needs as rapidly as possible, and that is what we are doing. In the second place we need a long-term policy so that we can look ahead to see where there are likely to be shortages in the future, and there is no question that that is precisely what we are doing in every sphere. No inquiry is necessary therefore, and this leg of the amendment does no credit to the Opposition because that is precisely what this Government has been doing systematically and is still doing. Do hon. members know that the total amount that is being spent on education by the provinces and by the Central Government is more than R156,000,000 per annum&#x003F; In the last resort that money comes out of the pocket of the taxpayer. The accusation therefore that this Government is negligent, that the Government is not planning, is a false accusation; it is entirely without substance. I contend that with the schemes which are already in operation and with all the plans which are being carried out to-day, we will have no difficulty in coping with these problems and shortages.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister will forgive me if I do not deal with the important educational matters raised by him in his very interesting speech. I am sure that other speakers will deal with it in the course of this debate. I want to utilize my limited time to deal with matters outside education. The most satisfying feature of the present debate is the picture it reveals of the strength and stability of our economy. The figures and facts revealed in the Budget speech by the hon. the Minister of Finance highlight the blessings which Divine Providence has bestowed upon our country. They reveal in no uncertain manner the tremendous economic potential with which this country has been blessed. They present a picture of South Africa&#x2019;s economy of which all true South Africans are justifiably proud, and I am happy to be able to pay tribute to it. The tremendous growth in our economy as revealed in this year&#x2019;s Budget is most heartening. To my mind it justifies the claims made by the hon. the Minister of Finance that our economy is one of the main bulwarks of our national survival, to use his own words.</p>

<p>This strong and growing economy and the buoyancy of our national revenue have enabled us to undertake great projects without having to borrow funds from abroad and without having to levy additional taxation. It has been suggested that a large proportion of the surplus on Revenue Account for the current financial year is attributable to the underestimate of Inland Revenue. This may have had some bearing on the last surplus, but in all fairness one has to concede that the new P.A.Y.E. system rendered it extremely difficult for the Treasury to estimate with any degree of accuracy the amount of revenue which would be collected in the first year that this system was in operation. There is no doubt that there has been an under-estimate of revenue resulting from this procedure, but I am certain that apart from that the Government&#x2019;s calculations were thrown out of gear by the tremendous growth of our economy. This growth to my mind was largely responsible for enabling the Minister not only to reveal a surplus of R88,000,000 but to budget for expenditure to be funded by our taxpayers to an amount exceeding R1,000,000,000. This, to my mind, is very heartening indeed. This strong economy and our buoyant revenue have revealed our country in its true light as one of the outstanding economic countries in the world. The year under review has shown that despite many threats of boycotts and sanctions, despite open threats of aggression, and despite threats of expulsion from world bodies, and indeed despite our withdrawal from some of those bodies, South Africa has gone ahead and has as strong an economy as can be found in any part of the civilized world. For all this we are grateful. The past year has shown our great economic strength. It has shown that even despite our Government, and despite the many political mistakes we have made&#x2014;and heaven knows, we have made many&#x2014;this great country of ours has survived and will survive economically. Our gold reserves have reached a new height of R525,000,000. Our imports have improved by 18.74 per cent, and our exports have improved by 14.24 per cent. Our consumer spending increased by R400,000,000 over the preceding year. In addition, we know from statements that have been made by the Government and by responsible investors here that over the next ten years there will be capital investments in public undertakings amounting to some R4,000,000,000. We know, further, of a large number of financial institutions which have committed themselves to industrial development and expansion programmes, and that they propose over that period spending an additional amount of some R500,000,000. All in all, no country could display a more glowing picture of this remarkable resilience and its ability to rely on its own resources.</p>

<p>Having said this, I think it is necessary for us not to become too smug and too complacent about our future and about the security of our country. The very fact that our <span class="col_3469-3470" refersTo="page_0427"/>national survival to a large extent depends on our strong economy, as mentioned by the hon. the Minister, must surely indicate that we are the envy of many states in this world, and particularly of many states on this continent. What would some of these states not do to lay their hands on this country and to enjoy the benefits of our great economy&#x003F; In the light of the open threats that have been made, I feel that there is entire justification for building up our defences. It has been suggested in some quarters inside and outside of this House that these threats of aggression should be contemptuously ignored. I personally do not agree with that attitude. I feel that we would be failing in our responsibility to our people in this country if we did not take every reasonable precaution to protect ourselves against any possible aggression. If these acts of aggression do not materialize&#x2014; and I pray that they do not&#x2014;all that we will have lost will have been the money spent on preparing ourselves. In point of fact, however, that money will not have been lost; it would have been money wisely spent to avoid the horrors and devastation which will necessarily follow any act of aggression. But if any act of aggression does take place, which heaven forbid, we will know that we fully prepared ourselves to meet it to the best of our ability. For these reasons, therefore, whilst one realizes that the amount provided in the Budget for our national security is enormous, we would be failing in our responsibility to our citizens if we did not take the necessary precautions to defend ourselves.</p>

<p>The Minister has transferred from this year&#x2019;s surplus some R52,000,000 to defence, thus bringing the total defence expenditure to R210,000,000. Obviously this is a very large amount in a peace-time Budget, but in the light of present-day circumstances I feel that this expenditure should not be criticized. Our national security will absorb 26.8 per cent of our national income as envisaged in the Budget, but for the reasons I have already mentioned I cannot agree with those who criticize this expenditure. I can only hope that the spending of this large sum will be the means of averting aggression.</p>

<p>Having said that, I do feel that the Government should do everything possible to ameliorate the hostility of the outside world towards us. We cannot afford to continue to ignore the outside opinions which have been so forcibly expressed concerning the political set-up in this country. I do not for a single moment suggest that we should tolerate any interference whatsoever in our domestic affairs, but I do say that we cannot afford unnecessarily to antagonize world opinion.</p>

<p>It may be asked what we can do to avoid this antagonism. I am certain that if the Government refrained from introducing additional apartheid measures year in and year out and allowed this country some political peace for a number of years, the anti-South African views expressed by the outside world would be greatly ameliorated. I am quite certain that it will have a very good effect if the Government could see its way clear to avoid coming with these additional apartheid measures session after session. The trouble is that session after session the Government introduce more apartheid measures, some drastic and some petty, many of which appear to be grossly exaggerated overseas, but all of which continue to conjure up against South Africa a great deal of unnecessary hostility. I want to assure the Government that we have many friends overseas who are willing to do everything possible to help our country to overcome the shocking criticism overseas. My appeal to the Government to-day is to help our friends to help us. I was very interested to read over the week-end a statement made by the President of the S.A. Foundation following his return to this country from a recent world tour. Sir Francis de Guingand said he found in many overseas countries a greater acceptance of the over-all aims of the policy of separate development, but he felt that slight modifications to the policy would bring dividends to South Africa&#x2019;s traditional friends. Sir Francis went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I found among South Africa&#x2019;s real friends a certain measure of perplexity as to how they could help South Africa more. They are desperately short of ammunition to assist in furthering our cause. They ask for a modification of some aspects of our policies which they find difficult or often impossible to defend.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whilst admitting that such modifications would certainly at this stage never satisfy the Afro-Asians and their fellow travellers, I believe that we might be surprised at the dividends which such a course would produce among our traditional friends.</block>

<p>Then Sir Francis continued to refer to something which I regard as most important, and about which I have spoken so often in this House. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I find that some aspects of little apartheid receive general condemnation.</block>

<p>It is this little apartheid which has caused so much ill feeling overseas. I agree entirely with these views. The little or petty apartheid measures affect particularly our Coloured people, and such measures are wholly unjustified. They receive world condemnation and they lose us many friends. Surely the Government must see this and realize that a modification of this apartheid policy, particularly as it applies to our Coloureds, will help us tremendously with our traditional friends overseas. I do not at this stage for a single moment ask the Government to abandon its basic policy of apartheid. Those pleas have been made by me and by other speakers in this House over the years without success, but I do say that to continue with these apartheid measures session <span class="col_3471-3472" refersTo="page_0428"/>after session, some of them being of a drastic and some of a petty nature, is a means of exacerbating world opinion against us, and the time has come when the Government should realize the serious effect it has on world opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was shocked to read the other day of a proposal to hold an international conference on sanctions against South Africa in London this year from 14 April to 17 April. I say that the unnecessary apartheid measures which have been debated in this House from time to time, and even during this Session, are playing right into the hands of the fanatical organizers of this conference. I should like to quote to the House a report in regard to this conference which appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> on 17 February this year. It is headed, &#x201C;World Experts to Talk on Sanctions against South Africa&#x201D;. It says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The International Conference on Economic Sanctions against South Africa to be held in London from 14 to 17 April has the makings of the most influential examination of action against an individual state that has ever been undertaken. Invitations have gone to almost every country in the world to send up to ten delegates, all of them experts in trade, international affairs, strategy and other specific fields. Those who have already accepted include Ministers in various overseas Governments. Five heads of State&#x2014;Ben Bella (Algeria), Nkrumah (Ghana), Tunku Abdul Rahman (Malaya), Leopold Sedar Senghor (Senegal) and Jomo Kenyatta (Kenya) have already agreed to act as patrons, while the growing list of 130 sponsors represents some of the foremost academicians in 13 countries.</block>

<p>The conference, which is expected to attract as many as 600 delegates, will examine every conceivable aspect of sanctions, from the legal, political and economic to policing problems and gold. If a consensus is reached, the findings will then be submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations or the Security Council, probably through one of the member African states.</p>

<p>After opening with a plenary session, the conference will break up into expert panels under individual chairmen to study specific aspects of sanctions. Before them they will have specially commissioned papers on these subjects which are now being prepared by reputable experts.</p>

<p>In selecting the authors of the papers, the organizers have been careful to choose reputable and &#x201C;acceptable&#x201D; experts, principally from the West, with no known public connections with South African protest movements and who are not committed to the use of sanctions as a political weapon against South Africa. I understand well over half are British. On the other hand, some papers will inevitably be written by African leaders. One &#x201C;committed&#x201D; expert, however, is Mr. Hakkerup, the Danish Foreign Minister, who will be reading a paper on &#x201C;The International Implications of the South African Racial Crisis&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The study groups will be carefully balanced to represent the widest possible divergence of interests, and as far as possible they will reflect every major power bloc in the world. This will help to restore the balance of the conference which in many respects will reflect the United Nations in composition and will inevitably be predominantly Afro-Asian.</p>

<p>Among the panel chairmen so far named are Bishop Reeves, who will preside over the South Africa Commission; Mr. Justice Theron, President of the Exchequer Court of Canada and Honorary Presi3ent of the International Commission of Jurists, who will head the legal and political commission; and Mr. N. A. Z. Swai, Tanganyika Minister of Development Planning, who will preside over the Economics Commission. &#x2026;</p>

<p>Among those who have lent their names to the campaign as sponsors are: Gunnar Jahn, head of the Nobel Peace Prize Foundation; Dr. Cyril James, Vice-Chancellor of McGill University, Canada; Professor James Meade, former U.K. Government Adviser on Economics, Professor Kenichi Nakaya of Japan; Mr. M. V. Nesterov, U.S.S.R. Trade Minister; Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, who fathered the atomic bomb; and Professor Linus Pauling, who has twice won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

<p>Finally, and this is the aspect that distresses me more than anything else, the conference is being financed by several Afro-Asian states, and its convener is Mr. Ronald Segal, the former editor of <i>Africa South.</i> Sir, I want to pause here to say how distressed I am to find that this young, misguided man, Ronald Segal, should be the convener of this conference. He is a South African, having been born and brought up in this city. I knew his late grandfather and his late father very well indeed. Both of them were honoured and respected citizens of this country and made their mark in this country as respectable and well-esteemed business men and public men. They played an important part in the communal life of South West Africa and of this city. They won the esteem and affection of every section of the community for their charitable work and for their generous contributions to all causes irrespective of race, colour or creed. I am sure that both these men, the father and the grandfather, would turn in their graves if they knew how this young man is now conniving with South Africa&#x2019;s enemies in order to harm our country, the country of his own birth. I wonder whether those who are helping him in his endeavours, which I have read out here this afternoon, realize that his own entire worldly fortune comes from the very country that he is now endeavouring to harm. Sir, his grandfather and his father made their money <span class="col_3473-3474" refersTo="page_0429"/>in this country and this young man is now living on the fruits of their hard-won earnings.</p>

<p>I think it is as well that his colleagues in this International Conference should realize and know these facts. I should like to say in the strongest possible terms that Ronald Segal&#x2019;s conduct is deprecated by every decent South African, and particularly by every responsible member of our community.</p>

<p>Surely he realizes that his endeavours to impose sanctions and boycotts against our country will harm the very people whom he professes to want to help. If these proposed sanctions which are going to be scrutinized by so-called world experts become effective, who will suffer most&#x003F; The Coloureds and the Bantu of South Africa. Of necessity, if boycotts are successfully applied, our industries will have to restrict their output, with the result that many employees will lose their jobs. We know from sad experience that in such times of crisis the first to suffer are the Bantu and the Coloureds, and these are the people on whose behalf Ronald Segal and his friends profess to be leading this anti-South African campaign.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have discussed the matter of sanctions and boycotts with responsible Coloured leaders in the city, and I am glad to say that they are totally and uncompromisingly opposed to any form of sanctions or boycotts being applied to this country. They realize only too well that the result of such ill-considered actions can only affect the living conditions of the non-White population of this country. They know that they will be the first to suffer. Surely this young man, Ronald Segal, and his fellow travellers like Hodgson, Patrick Duncan, Wolpe, Bishop Reeves and others, must realize the incalculable harm that their actions will cause to the very people whom they profess to want to help. In the name of the Coloured people whom we represent in this House, I appeal to those people to abandon this reprehensible proposal of attempting to bring our country to its knees. Threats of organized boycotts and economic sanctions can only have the opposite effect. They will only spur on our country to develop and to rely on its own resources, and to impose trade reprisals against those who attack us. In this effort South Africa will have the wholehearted support of the entire South African nation, irrespective of race, colour or creed or political affiliation. Sir, I should like these agitators to know that we do not need their help and that their reckless proposals are deprecated by all responsible leaders of every section of our multi-racial population.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>It is indeed a refreshing experience to be able to congratulate the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) and to thank him for the speech he made here this afternoon, not in the interests of a political party or a group he may represent but in the interests of South Africa. When he was half-way through his speech I made a note and said to myself: &#x201C;I love you, I love you not.&#x201D; However, I welcome what he said at the beginning of his speech in regard to our defence and I welcome in particular what he said at the end of his speech in regard to the attitude which he and the people whom he and his colleagues represent adopt towards the agitators who want to have boycotts applied to South Africa. What he said in that connection is indeed what the Nationalist Party has already been saying for many years. I hope members of the Opposition will shortly also subscribe to the attitude the hon. member for Peninsula has adopted to-day out of the love he has in his heart. I welcome a speech such as that. It can only promote the growth and development of South Africa. I would, however, just like to put this one question: Judging from the expression on her face I wonder whether the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) supports the hon. member for Peninsula. The hon. member for Houghton spoke in this Budget debate; she has apparently appointed herself as the advocate of the non-Whites in this House, the Bantu in particular. She spoke about Bantu education and the amount of money allocated to that in the Estimates. I make no apologies for getting up here and appointing myself as the advocate of the White boys and girls of South Africa and their higher education.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts and Science on what he said at Bloemfontein last week-end on the occasion of the graduation ceremony at the University of the Orange Free State. I want to thank the Minister for having said in so many words that the recommendations made in the report of Professor H. C. Cilliers would be accepted. We are all aware of the need which exists in South Africa for higher trained manpower. We also know that there is a great wastage of matriculants because they do not go to university. I wish to say something to the House this afternoon for the edification of some hon. members who do not perhaps know the Afrikaner as well as I know him. Because he is so independent and proud you do not easily get an Afrikaner to admit that he cannot afford it financially to send his child to university after matriculation. I want to bring to the notice of the House and the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts and Science that there are still many cases where the White parent cannot send his child to university because of economic circumstances. We know that that is indeed the case. I am the last one to plead&#x2014;and here I agree with the hon. the Minister&#x2014;that a university should lose its autonomy and that it should become a State institution. But it is for this House to find ways and means of giving every White boy and girl, whether they are Afrikaans speaking or English speaking, who are in any way deserving cases, the opportunity of enjoying higher education. That is why I say I welcome what the hon. the Minister said at <span class="col_3475-3476" refersTo="page_0430"/>Bloemfontein last week-end. We welcome the fact that the hon. the Minister announced that the salaries of university personnel would be increased by between 11 per cent and 12 per cent. This House and South Africa must not wait too long before they ensure that the necessary university facilities are available to our boys and girls when they have to go to university. When we look at the 1961 crop of matriculants it is disturbing to see that 6,000 matriculants who have equipped themselves for university training did not go to university. A very large percentage of these matriculants who could have gone to university did not go because of economic circumstances. When we consider that that means that over a period of five years 30,000 matriculants do not go to university, that so many graduates are lost after matriculation, I say the Republic of South Africa cannot afford it. It is a good thing that we are going to spend R450,000,000 on the Orange River scheme over a period of 30 years; we welcome that; it is also a good thing that we are setting aside R210,000,000 in these Estimates for defence; it is a good thing that the Republic of South Africa is arming itself and getting itself in readiness physically and in the military sphere, but it is equally important or more important that we arm the White sons and daughters of South Africa with the necessary knowledge. The White man can only remain superior to the non-Whites at this southern tip of Africa if he remains intellectually superior to the non-Whites. It is our task, our responsibility, to provide the necessary educational facilities and to make it possible for the White student to make himself efficient in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, large sums of money are made available in the form of bursaries. We have listened to the figures quoted by the hon. the Minister. But there is another type of boy and girl for whom I wish to plead this afternoon. We are too inclined to concentrate on the boy and girl who pass matriculation in the first class. He or she is not necessarily the boy or girl who learnt how to work hard in the secondary school. You have the other student who during his first and second year at university develops into a harder worker and becomes a very good student. I want to plead that that boy and girl should not be left behind, but that bursaries should also be made available to these boys and girls who perhaps pass their matriculation in the second class and who at the age of 18 or 19 years develop into a harder worker and become an asset to South Africa.</p>

<p>I have another suggestion to make. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of students who, after they have matriculated, have to go and work because of economic circumstances. They cannot afford to attend a university on a full-time basis. I come into contact with these young people every day, not only in my constituency but far beyond the borders of my constituency. Those boys and girls in the Transvaal usually go to Pretoria. They prefer working in Pretoria because they can then attend classes at the university. I do not have the statistics at my disposal but I have often been told that such a girl or boy starts working and tries to attend classes and to study during his first year. They either neglect the work they have to do or they neglect their studies because they cannot do justice to the course they are trying to take because of the demands made on modern youth to-day. I want to put this suggestion to the hon. the Minister to-day for his consideration that we should introduce a four-hour working day for this type of youngster who works and studies at the same time. I repeat that the possibility should be investigated whether the employers could not perhaps introduce a four-hour working day for those girls or boys who study while they work and that the remuneration should remain the same. If that were done the employer&#x2014;and I start with the Public Service Commission&#x2014;would ultimately benefit because that boy or girl would have acquired greater knowledge at the university. I repeat that if such a boy or girl goes to work, perhaps in Pretoria, perhaps in Cape Town, perhaps in Stellenbosch and attends classes at the university at the same time, not only will the employer benefit but South Africa will ultimately benefit because of the greater knowledge that White student has acquired.</p>

<p>I want to conclude. I welcome the speech of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) and I welcome the speech of the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts and Science. I think in this regard we are on a plane where it is not necessary to split political hairs. Sir, I had the opportunity of having a brief insight of an hour into this report which was tabled last Friday, the report of the Professor Oilliers Commission, and in conclusion I wish to make an appeal to the Government to have this report printed and made available to at least those members of this House who have the education of the White youth of South Africa at heart.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Wolmaransstad who has just sat down has thanked the Minister of Education for accepting the recommendations of the Professor Cilliers Commission. The hon. member will agree that both sides of this House are on common ground as to the necessity of improving our higher education. We differ perhaps on certain principles and the way in which this should be done, but I agree with the hon. member that bursaries and loans should be made available to matriculants who wish to go to university and whose parents cannot afford to send them there. I would qualify that by adding that bursaries and loans should be made available to every talented and gifted child.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to endorse fully what was said earlier to-day by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) concerning this report of Professor Cilliers which was tabled on Friday. This report, which only became available to this House on Friday <span class="col_3477-3478" refersTo="page_0431"/>afternoon, was commented on by the hon. the Minister in Bloemfontein on Saturday, and here I want to endorse the statement made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) that surely this House should have been presented with this report earlier, and I say that in spite of the assurances which the hon. the Minister gave us earlier this afternoon. One appreciates that when a report such as this comes before the Cabinet it takes a certain time to assess it and to come to a conclusion, but as we are dealing with expenditure on higher education in this Budget debate I feel very strongly that this report should have been made available to us earlier. I would ask the hon. the Minister of Finance directly why he made no reference to this report in his Budget speech&#x003F; I am quite sure that the Minister of Finance must have known of this step that was taken, and yet his only contribution in the Budget in the sphere of education was this tax concession, up to a maximum of 1 per cent of their taxable income, to companies which make donations to the National Loan and Bursary Fund. I feel that the way in which the Government&#x2019;s decision with regard to the recommendations of the Cilliers Commission was made known is a violation of the rights and privileges of Parliament. Sir, I welcome this report and I also welcome the Government&#x2019;s action in increasing its allocation to the universities. It has been advocated over many years in this House that the allocation to universities should be increased, without interfering with the closely guarded autonomy of the universities. The Minister has briefly outlined to us this afternoon that more moneys will be made available for increasing the salaries of university professors, and one welcomes this. One feels that the &#x201C;brain drain&#x201D; that we have been experiencing over these last years may well be turned now into a &#x201C;brain gain&#x201D; for South Africa, and one welcomes the increased allocations of 27 per cent and 33 per cent in respect of libraries and laboratories. Apart from the bursaries and loans which will now be made available to students under this new scheme, there are, of course, the bursaries and loans made available to students by the C.S.I.R., the Railways and various other bodies. In this connection I would like to refer the hon. the Minister to what is stated on page 70 of the Cilliers Report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Britain to-day there are scarcely any economic barriers debarring the talented and needy student from university education.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister also referred to the Holloway Report. In this connection I want to say that had that report been fully implemented there would have been some 541 gifted and deserving students who could have received help annually. The Cillier&#x2019;s Report says on page 74 that &#x201C;this is not exactly a very impressive figure&#x201D;. I trust therefore that the hon. the Minister is going to take a huge step forward in making available bursaries and loans to all those talented students in South Africa who wish to attend universities but who cannot afford to do so.</p>

<p>Sir, the fishing story of the hon. the Minister of Finance, as told to us in his Budget speech, was very entertaining. We know, of course, that every fisherman possibly exaggerates the size of his catch; it is a common human weakness, and it is now become an integral part of all good fishing stories. To me it would seem that the big fish pulled the fisherman off his perch, and it is not clear now whether the fisherman caught the big fish or whether the big fish, which is the armaments expenditure, caught the fisherman. Sir, some people refer to this Budget as the &#x201C;guns or butter Budget&#x201D;, which is a much more sombre title than the Minister&#x2019;s gay references to the innocent sport of fishing.</p>

<p>Sir, in the short time available to me I shall confine myself to the Minister&#x2019;s treatment of university education with particular reference to bursaries. I wish I had the time to deal with adult higher education, which is a new and very important issue in our modern age of automation. With respect, Sir, I feel that adult education would not do any harm to certain members of the Nationalist Party. Sir, higher education starts with entrance to the university, and I feel that the present system is handicapped by inadequate preparation for the university at the high school. I am fully appreciative of the fact that high school education is the responsibility of the Provincial Administrations, but what is required is a preuniversity college to bridge the gap between the high schools and the university, which should give instruction for one year in science and technology. Apart from that the method of university training and learning should be explained to the students. In that way we would perhaps bridge the gap between the spoon-fed high school training and the freedom of university training. What we need today is not so much additional universities; this was acknowledged by the Minister of Finance in introducing his Budget. What we must do, however, is to eliminate this wastage of students which is taking place at present. We know that over 50 per cent of our university students drop out of their courses after the first year. It is interesting in this connection to compare the figures of overseas countries with our own. According to the latest figures South Africa has over 45,000 White university students. Britain, with a population of 53,000,000, only has 100,000 university students, and the British population is 16.5 times more than the South African White population. On this basis therefore South Africa should have 6,000 students. Germany, with a population of 50,000,000 has 200,000 students, and on this basis South Africa should have 12,000 students. Holland with a population of 12,000,000, has 43,000 university students, and on this basis South Africa should have 11,000 students. The United States of America, with a population of 190,000,000, has 800,000 university students. On this basis <span class="col_3479-3480" refersTo="page_0432"/>there should be 13,000 students. On a proportionate basis therefore it will appear that South Africa should have 12,000 university students but in point of fact we have four times as many students. When we consider the thoroughness of German and Dutch high school and university education and look at the number of university students in those countries, then we realize what an excessive load is carried by our small White population. We can only come to the conclusion that our high school teaching and our university teaching must be improved further to reach even higher standards because we are already an industrial nation and we are becoming a great industrial nation. We face competition from all these advanced countries overseas and it is all the more necessary therefore to raise our university standards even higher than they are to-day. Sir, just look at the world-shaking discoveries which come from the universities of the U.S.A., the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and even Russia. An entirely new situation is facing us in the world to-day and what we require is up-to-date university education and active encouragement of every talented young man or young woman who wants to go to university. Our problem to-day therefore is a twofold problem: We have to improve the standard of teaching at the preuniversity level and at the university level and we have to improve our selection of students. Above all, we must guard against any wastage of students once they reach our universities. We must not handicap deserving young people by preventing their entrance to university. Instead of quantity at our universities we must also aim at high quality training in science and technology and other subjects taught at university. I feel that the ratio of students to teaching staff should not exceed ten to one. In order to keep your teaching staff up to date with modern advances in science and technology and in methods of teaching and training, it is very important that the teaching staff at universities should have systematic opportunities to go overseas to study science and technology at overseas universities and any other subjects which they may have to teach. Financial facilities should be given to university professors on a wide scale so that they can go overseas, in rotation, to undergo refresher courses, apart from the refresher courses which are provided here at our own universities.</p>

<p>As far as talented students are concerned I feel that all talented students should be entitled to receive a bursary to cover both their tuition fees and their living expenses. This will have to be done on a selective basis. In addition I feel that they should also be paid during the vacations provided they complete certain set studies during the vacation. Sir, it was in last year&#x2019;s Budget debate that I asked the hon. the Minister of Finance for a yearly allocation of R3,000,000 for study bursaries for talented and gifted students. Judging by the present Budget, it will appear that the hon. the Minister of Finance agrees with my argument that there is a real need to support gifted and talented university students because the hon. the Minister has said that he proposes to allow &#x201C;companies to deduct from their taxable incomes up to a maximum of 1 per cent of such income in respect of donations made to a National Loan and Bursary Fund to enable students in need of assistance to complete their studies at university, university college, technical or training college. The cost to the Exchequer was estimated at R500,000 for 1964-5&#x201D;. I feel that this is an important step in the right direction but along the wrong approach, because we find in the Estimates on page 110 that a paltry sum of R103,530 is allocated for bursaries and loans to the university students. This includes loans to non-White medical students. The hon. the Minister of Finance has now admitted that much higher sums are needed for the support of university students. We were told in his Budget speech that about R500,000 is required for this purpose. I feel that over and above the R103,530 provided for in the Estimates the Minister should have provided the full R500,000 out of the surplus of R88,000,000. The Minister of Finance has passed the responsibility for investing in the talent of our youth on to industry; he has left it to the companies to make donations to the national loan and bursary fund, up to a maximum of 1 per cent of their taxable income. The Minister estimates that if the companies exercise this right to make donations, then something like R530,000 may become available for bursaries to students. I have two objections to the proposal contained in the Budget. In the first place I feel that provision should have been made in the Est mates for R3,000,000 to provide bursaries for talented and gifted young people who wish to go to university to complete their education. My second point is that the small sum which the Minister visualizes this scheme will cost is dependent on the benevolence of the companies. I am unable to understand the logic of the Minister&#x2019;s approach because the Minister of Finance admits that additional assistance to university students is required, and both he and the Minister of Education, whom we heard here early this afternoon, admit that there is a shortage of trained manpower. We all know that there is a shortage of trained manpower and we know that the provision of trained scientists and technologists is one of the most important requirements in building up and maintaining the modern industrial structure of South Africa in the future. I feel that an important problem such as this requires a direct and unequivocal attack; we cannot depend on the goodwill of companies. I feel that the Minister should set aside the required sum from Revenue and not just one-sixth of it.</p>

<p>I would like to remind the hon. the Minister that his party relies a great deal on the vote of Nationalist university students, and I feel that what the Minister is doing for university students in this Budget is a poor return for the support that he receives from them. <span class="col_3481-3482" refersTo="page_0433"/>Sir, to substantiate my contention that there is a great need for financial support for universities, I would like to quote from an article which appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of last Wednesday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Students pull in their belts as they scrimp to make ends meet. Part-time term work and vacation work is arranged for such men and also for about 100 others who will not be able to remain at university unless they succeed in earning part of their keep. Some men come to university with a lump sum like R100 to see them through their university days, but it costs a minimum of R50 a month to keep body and soul together and pay university fees.</block>

<p>The number who work their way through university without some assistance is small, but the number who have to add to their meagre money is large and grows ever larger.</p>

<p>I trust therefore that the hon. the Minister and his party would be generous and show their confidence in our youth by investing a sum of R3,000,000 to promote higher education.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to say that the hon. the Minister of Finance has demonstrated to us that the South African economy is booming. The word &#x201C;booming&#x201D; is the operative word because our economy is booming to-day but it was not booming three years ago or even two years ago. Just as there was no boom two or three years ago, similarly there may be no boom two or three years hence. We all share the hope that our present economic prosperity will continue but we feel that it is the duty of the Government and of the Minister to look ahead. The Pharoah&#x2019;s dream of seven fat years followed by seven lean years is based on thousands of years of experience. The hon. the Minister knows very well that the prevention of economic cycles of booms and depressions is the plague of the modern capitalistic system; it is the main concern of economists and politicians of the Western world. Anti-cyclic economy has as yet not been achieved. Built-in precautions are applied in very many forms in national economy but they are no final solution; they only act as cushions. The Pharoah&#x2019;s dream should be a lesson to South Africa, and these years of plenty should be used to provide for the future. Sir, I do not wish to deny the ability of the hon. the Minister, but it is nevertheless a fact that it is the natural resources of South Africa and the skill of the population which provides the economic basis on which the Government and the country that and on which the Minister&#x2019;s services to the country depends. Neither of these, incidentally, is the creation of the Government. The present economy of this country has not been created in the last 15 years; it has been created over the last 300 years. In this economic structure the Dutch, the Huguenot, the German, the English, the Jewish and also the non-European races played and are playing their main role. Sir, Governments come and go; political parties come and go; Ministers come and go; but the natural resources of the country and the skill of the population remain the basis of the country&#x2019;s prosperity. It is for all these reasons that I feel generous provision should be made now by the Minister for the future, including the future lean years, for an investment in youth, an investment in the youthful talents of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Before I say a few words about what the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) has just said I wish to extend my hearty congratulations to the hon. the Minister of Finance on this Budget which is probably outstanding in the history of South Africa. I think this is the first time in the history of our country that such a huge amount is going to be spent on public services in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down went back 300 years to find reasons for the prosperity which we are enjoying to-day. She says it is not this Government which has over the past 15 years ensured this prosperity. She says this prosperity is due to the history of 300 years and that this prosperity is really due to the natural resources of South Africa. I want to tell the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) that the natural resources of South Africa have lain dormant for 300 years. Before they were developed they meant nothing to the economy of this country. It is because of a National Party r&#x00E9;gime which has followed a policy of &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;, which has developed those natural resources to their utmost and are still doing so to-day that we are now enjoying this prosperity. I do not think she can deny that in the least. If she says it is the history of 300 years that is responsible for this prosperity she is wide of the mark because it is the National Party who has given us an Iscor, who has developed iron ore, one of the most important natural resources in South Africa. It is that which is responsible for this great prosperity. It was a National Party Government which established a Sasol where coal, one of our natural resources, is being developed. It was also a National Party Government which established a Foskor. For the rest it is a National Party Government who, with its import control system and its policy of protecting South African industries, has endowed us with this great prosperity. Unlike her I am not so pessimistic as to think that within a year or two we shall once again face a depression. I can assure the people of South Africa that as long as the National Party is in power they will prosper.</p>

<p>I also wish to say a few words about the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks in connection with education, particularly higher education. The United Party always try to create the impression that they were the people who drew attention to this state of affairs. I wish to remind hon. members opposite that it was I who, three years ago from a back bench on the Government side, drew attention to the <span class="col_3483-3484" refersTo="page_0434"/>shortage of technicians and technologists in South Africa. It was after that that the United Party started to sing this tune. At that time the Government had already appointed a commission to investigate the matter. I relied on the report of that commission at the time for the figures I submitted to the House. I wish to remind the hon. member that this problem cannot be solved so easily. We are a small White nation of only 3,000,000 although the total population figure is about 16,000,000. Those 3,000,000 Whites have to carry practically the entire population in this respect. That is why there is such a tremendous backlog. Let me also say this to hon. members opposite that to the extent to which our policy of separate development develops to that extent the non-Whites will start carrying their own burden and the Whites will no longer have to carry such a heavy burden alone.</p>

<p>However, I got up to talk about something else. I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Peninsula on his speech. He referred to the huge expenditure on defence and said he welcomed that expenditure; he said he thought it was necessary. I also wish to say a few words in that connection to-day. Mr. Speaker, South Africa envisages spending about R210,000,000 on the defence of our country and where this figure is the highest ever earmarked in this country for this purpose&#x2014;a figure which is much higher than any figure spent on defence during the war years&#x2014;I think every South African citizen must realize that the Government regards the threat to our peace, our safety and the continued existence of our nation and fatherland in a very serious light. Where such a large amount is being set aside for defence we must ask ourselves from which quarter South Africa should expect this onslaught on our safety and our continued existence, because it is only when you have a clear picture as to whence that threat, which must be repulsed, will come that you can determine whether this amount is justified or not. In my opinion there are three possible threats to the safety, peace and continued existence of South Africa. The first is the infiltration of subversive elements. The second is the communist danger in Africa and the third is armed international intervention in the domestic affairs of South Africa.</p>

<p>I wish to say a few words in connection with each one of these. As far as the first is concerned I think it has already to a large extent become a &#x201C;spent force&#x201D;, for the present at least, for the very reason that the Minister of Justice has taken such effective action against these subversive elements and acts of sabotage that they have practically been wiped out. I am well aware of the fact that subversive forces are still ceaselessly being trained overseas and that countries outside have not in the least abandoned their infiltration, sabotage and rebellion plans. As far as the second danger is concerned, the communist danger, I regard that as something totally different. It is an irrefutable fact, Mr. Speaker, that by their over-hasty departure from Africa the Colonial powers of Europe have created a vacuum which is at the moment filled by Communism, Communism which has obtained numerous footholds in Africa. In this connection, by way of illustration, I wish to quote something said by Lord Salisbury. He recently said the following about British politics&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All that we have in fact achieved by scuttling out of all these countries prematurely and abandoning the task to which we had set our hand, has been to create a power vacuum which has immediately been filled by just those forces that represent all that is most abhorrent to us.</block>

<p>Lord Salisbury then goes on and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Could the Government or indeed anyone else be so complacent in 1964, as they seem to have been in 1960, in the light of the situation that is unveiling itself now before our eyes&#x003F;</block>

<p>Lord Salisbury then goes on and sketches the situation which is unveiling itself before our eyes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have seen what has happened in Cuba and elsewhere, the setting up of nearcommunist dictatorships, the triumphant tours of communist leaders through what were formerly Western spheres of influence. We see what is happening at this very moment in Zanzibar, Tanganyika and Uganda. This is assuredly not time for soothing phrases, for lulling our peoples into a false sense of security. It is a time for warning them urgently of the dangers of the very sombre situation that confronts us.</block>

<p>That was what Lord Salisbury said and you must remember, Mr. Speaker, that he issued this warning to the British public. If the situation in Zanzibar, Tanganyika and Uganda is dangerous to Great Britain and the West then it is ten times as dangerous to South Africa, because if Cuba is a dagger aimed at the heart of the U.S.A. then Zanzibar is assuredly a dagger aimed at the heart of South Africa. In order to conquer the continent of Africa for Communism the communist realizes only too well that the strongest bastion of the West in Africa is the Republic of South Africa. The destruction of South Africa as a Western power in Africa will not only mean the end of White civilization in South Africa, but it will also be a fatal blow to the entire Western world.</p>

<p>With rocket and nuclear installations on Zanzibar and with footholds elsewhere in Africa South Africa&#x2019;s position is exceptionally vulnerable. It is for this very reason that I welcome the huge amount in the Estimates.</p>

<p>I wish to point out that apart from this communist <span class="col_3485-3486" refersTo="page_0435"/>threat to South Africa there is a third possible threat to the peace, safety and continued existence of South Africa. It has become abundantly clear that the Afro-Asiatic block within the African states do not consider themselves capable at this stage of taking up arms against South Africa in spite of their conferences at Addis Ababa. It is equally abundantly clear that they are to-day concentrating on training forces to infiltrate into South Africa to cause internal unrest and to incite sabotage in the hope that by doing that, according to the recipe used in Algeria, they will be able to incite the local population to rebellion. I am convinced that our internal security is such that our Police Force will be able to meet this situation adequately. But I do not know whether that is the position in the following case. It can therefore be accepted without any fear of contradiction that the planned extensive onslaught on South Africa will not take place in the immediate future, but it does not follow that the Afro-Asiatics, particularly the African states, have abandoned their so-called plan of liberating southern Africa. On the contrary we can now expect that they will no longer attempt an onslaught on South Africa under their own steam as it were, but that they will attempt to engineer armed international intervention through UNO.</p>

<p>There are factors such as our policy of separate development alongside others which I do not want to discuss at the moment, which make armed international intervention in South Africa very possible. I wish to refer to one of these factors, namely, a policy in UNO circles of building up a super international force superior to the defence forces of member states. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Harold Wilson pleaded recently, on the occasion of his visit to America, that the defence forces of Britain should be linked up with such an international force to maintain peace.</p>

<p>The American, Merwin K. Hart, recently wrote the following in an American journal, from which I want to quote at length&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Congo operation is a precedent for a long-established policy in the UN&#x2014;the gradual disbanding of all nationalist military strength and the building up of UN armed forces. The objective&#x2014;which has been openly stated again and again&#x2014;is to make UN forces strong enough so that no national force&#x2014;not even American forces &#x2014;can stand against them.</block>

<p>Then he goes on and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where will that leave the independence of once-free nations&#x003F; Just where Katanga is now. If the UN lays down a policy, and the people of any country do not like it, the UN will have the superiority in armed forces which makes it possible to impose the policy against the wishes of the people of the area. If communists or pro-communists in power wish to impose their will, no resistance will be possible.</block>

<p>Where does that leave the United States&#x003F;</p>

<p>Just where it leaves Katanga.</p>

<p>I can equally ask: &#x201C;Where does that leave South Africa&#x003F;&#x201D; And then I can also reply: &#x201C;Just where it leaves Katanga&#x201D;. In the eyes of the Afro-Asiatics, but particularly those of the African States, the Portuguese territories and particularly the Republic of South Africa can and must pre-eminently be such &#x201C;precedents&#x201D; as the Congo and Katanga and Cyprus as well to-day are precedents. It is in this connection that I should like to mention General Charles de Gaulle. His attitude is unequivocally that France should have a national defence force which may not be inferior to any other force not even an international force. I wish to state here that I&#x2014;and I am talking in my individual capacity, not on behalf of a party&#x2014;think General de Gaulle deserves to be strongly supported in his attempt to build up a third force in the world, because the present set-up of two opposing colusses, the East and the West, can very easily upset the balance. If this balance is upset it would mean a world conflagration which would destroy the human race. If there were a third power it might have a beneficial affect, not only on maintaining a better balance but it might mean that a portion of the Western World might perhaps not be consumed in that world conflagration.</p>

<p>When I talk about these different threats against South Africa we must ask ourselves what means we have at our disposal of meeting this danger. As far as I am concerned there are three means. The first is a defence force which must serve as a deterrent. The second is a defence force which must be a force to intervene on land, at sea and in the air and whose task it will be to defend South Africa against her enemies and to keep South Africa&#x2019;s enemies outside her border in check. The third is a defence force within our own country whose primary object will be to destroy on our own soil any hostile elements that have infiltrated.</p>

<p>I particularly want to make a plea in respect of two of them, firstly the force that must destroy elements that have infiltrated. We know that is still going on in spite of the fact that we have for the time being been able to meet that problem but we know that overseas forces are ceaselessly preparing forces to infiltrate into South Africa. I want to plead in particular for the kind of force that will combat that. I want to suggest to the Defence Force that they should acquire more mobile units in the form of helicopters and so forth, for example, in order to combat this type of enemy. As far as the second is concerned, namely, a full-scale war in which the land, sea and air forces will be concerned, we shall not be alone if we are up against a communist danger. I think we shall be able to depend on our Western allies in such an event.</p>

<p>Then I come to the third means and that is the deterrent. We know the best deterrent <span class="col_3487-3488" refersTo="page_0436"/>to-day is undoubtedly nuclear weapons. The nuclear weapon has two technical sub-divisions which are equally important and that is the bomb and the means of transport. I do not want to be extravagant when I discuss this matter but I have strong feelings particularly as far as the means of transport of the nuclear weapon is concerned. We already have the mirage aeroplanes for example. It is also fitting that we should have that type of aircraft and other supersonic aircraft, because they by themselves serve as a strong deterrent. I feel, however, that far greater attention should still be given to rockets or the ballistic missiles. I think that is very necessary. Zanzibar is in the same relationship to South Africa as Cuba is to the United States of America and if Cuba is such a threat to the United States which is such a big and powerful country, I think we should seriously think about acquiring ballistic missiles. Naturally these are things that one does not discuss in public, Sir. It is not even a matter on which I expect the Minister of Defence to reply to me. But I do feel it is absolutely essential that we acquire some ballistic missiles. I even want to go so far as to say&#x2014;I know it is not the intention of the Minister of Defence to develop the atom bomb&#x2014;that he should at least give consideration to how it is to be transported. As the situation is developing in Africa to-day; where the communists are getting such footholds in Africa we shall also have to give attention to this side of the matter. I know we have the manpower for it; we have the brain power for it; we have the raw materials for those weapons. That will be the best deterrent we can have for the future.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by making a third plea and that is that we should form a home-guard. In this connection I wish to refer to the commando system we have at the moment. I wish to plead that that system should be reformed in its entirety. Where the members of our commandos get a little shooting practice to-day they should be completely reformed so that every man between 18 and 60 years can serve on a war footing. There are many people who can drive a lorry, for instance, others can transport foodstuffs. It does not necessarily mean that you will have to stand guard at a bridge or that you must handle a firearm, but everyone between those two age groups should be placed on a war footing as far as the platteland and our cities are concerned. We are a small nation and the better we are organized the better we shall be able to deter those people who have evil plans against South Africa. The fact that we have over the past three years expanded our defence force in such a wonderful way, that we have spent so much on it that we have become independent to a great extent as far as our weapons are concerned, so much so that an embargo boycott on weapons to South Africa will not affect us, has in itself served as a great deterrent to those people who harbour evil intentions towards South Africa. Let me just say this that I welcomed the announcement by Wilson in Great Britain that they would place an embargo on the supply of weapons to South Africa, because I know if they were to do so it would mean that in that respect too South Africa would become completely self-sufficient and independent just as she has in all other respects where they have tried to hurt us through boycotts.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, apart from waxing lyrical about the virtues of the Nationalist Party the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) contributed very little to the educational side of this debate this afternoon. The hon. member for Heilbron went on to deal with politics on the African Continent. I must confess I found it a little difficult to follow him at times particularly when he took to praising General de Gaulle. I would like to remind the hon. member that the French statesman he mentiond was responsible for handing over 1,000,000 Frenchmen to the mercies of the Arab world in Algeria and I would like to ask him whether he approves of that or not. It seems to me that his arguments, on the face of it, were a little illogical.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the educational side of this debate, and say that we welcome the statement by the hon. the Minister of Education over the week-end with regard to this question of increased salaries to university lecturers. I do not intend saying any more than that. The matter has been adequately dealt with by other speakers on this side. But the hon. the Minister then went on to say that he agreed with his Cabinet colleagues with regard to this question of a shortage of manpower in South Africa. He is in good company; as he knows, the hon. the Prime Minister has made a similar statement; the hon. the Minister of Finance has mentioned it and so has the hon. the Minister of Railways and now we have the hon. the Minister of Education as well. But this particular Minister stated this afternoon that the shortage was universal and that it was not common to South Africa. I do not think that statement in any way excuses South Africa&#x2019;s neglect of this issue. In any event, Sir, we are not concerned with the situation in other countries; we are concerned with what is happening here in South Africa. I have yet to know of any other country, any expanding industrial country in the world that has Cabinet Ministers who make the kind of statements that were made by the Minister of Economic Affairs last November, and by our own Prime Minister also in November last year, on this question of the seriousness of the manpower shortage in South Africa at the present time. The Minister of Economic Affairs said this in an interview which I am reading from the issue of the <i>Cape Times</i> of 9 November 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Diederichs emphasized the danger of this manpower bottleneck in South Africa rapidly developing and urged industry and all concerned to help the country meet the challenge.</block>

<p><span class="col_3489-3490" refersTo="page_0437"/>The Prime Minister went a great deal further, Sir. In a statement arising out of consultations with the Economic Advisory Council he said that he had come to the conclusion that unless extra efforts were made to supplement the training of the manpower available in South Africa, the future economic development of the country would be seriously hampered. Can the hon. the Minister of Education tell us, if the situation is not serious in South Africa, of any other civilized country in which the position has deteriorated to the extent it has deteriorated here&#x003F; I think he will find it a little difficult to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister then went on and criticized hon. members on this side of the House for their suggestions as to how these shortages might be eased. It seemed to me that he was clearly on the defence in regard to this issue. I would suggest that some of the points put forward by hon. members on this side of the House who are interested in education might be helpful to the hon. the Minister. I hardly think it was an occasion for an indictment of those of us who all are interested in this subject. In fact, I think it was most unfortunate that he gave that impression this afternoon. It is not for us to try to find the answer, Sir. It is the Government&#x2019;s business. Some of us are genuinely concerned about helping the hon. the Minister and he knows that perfectly well. If we sat on this side of the House and said nothing about it we should be indicted for having no life in us at all and if we do raise an issue then we are indicted in any case by the hon. the Minister. What kind of parliamentary debate is that&#x003F; This is my first encounter with the hon. the Minister and I hope he will forgive me for raising this point, but I do not really think much of his tactics in this debate. Mr. Speaker, these Estimates were placed before us by the hon. the Minister of Finance last week. Our job is to examine them. Hon. members on this side of the House have been doing that ever since the Minister of Finance made his speech. It is our business to put questions Sir; it is our business to ask for information; it is our business to issue challenges just as it was the business of hon. members over there when they sat on this side of the House and they never seemed to do anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what I would like to point out is this. What kind of response do we get&#x003F; We can only deplore the fact, as a few hon. members have already pointed out, that one of the most important statements on the subject of educational development in South Africa is made by the hon. the Minister in a public speech and not here in Parliament. There is another instance, and I am sorry that I have this bone of contention with the hon. the Minister so early in the Session, but it seems to me that there was a deliberate attempt by the hon. the Minister to evade giving information when various questions were put on the Order Paper earlier this Session in this House. Those questions were put on the Order Paper by me. I would like to deal with that in some detail in a minute.</p>

<p>I want to say finally that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement here this afternoon, giving a lot of facts and figures on the educational situation&#x2014;very interesting facts and very interesting figures&#x2014;all the same the way he presented those facts and figures gave the impression that the hon. Minister deliberately intended to make monkeys of hon. members on this side of the House. I deplore his tactics in that regard.</p>

<p>I want to come back to realities. The hon. the Minister made great play of the fact that the National Education Council has had many matters referred to it for consideration and he mentioned teachers and their status and their conditions of work and so on. It was very significant to me, Mr. Speaker, that that was the only matter that he mentioned. The hon. Minister went on rather vaguely to say that planning was well on its way and that he hoped they would report this year. I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that we are not in the least bit satisfied with the Minister&#x2019;s statement here this afternoon in that regard. In fact I think he told us very little indeed. Because, Sir, for all his words and for all the interesting facts that the hon. Minister gave us, we still never seem to get to grips with the real education issues in South Africa on a broad basis. We get a lot of words and empty promises but we want to know what the Government is doing about it in terms of an over-all plan. If the hon. Minister and the Cabinet are so anxious, what are their plans&#x003F; Have they a &#x201C;crash&#x201D; programme, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked when the motion of no-confidence was before the House&#x003F; It is perfectly useless to deal with this question of education and of the manpower shortage piece-meal. The hon. the Minister of Education said so himself in a statement last year after the first meeting of the Educational Council&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_3491-3492" refersTo="page_0438"/>I should not wish the Council to tackle the educational problems of the country piece-meal. The Council will have to survey the whole scene; a thorough study will have to be made of every phase of education to obtain a comprehensive picture of the position before the council submits any advice or proposals to me.</p>

<p>We agree with the hon. the Minister, but what are the short-term and what are the long-term plans of the Government for education&#x003F; We still have to hear something about them. Surely the hon. the Minister must have a list of heads under which he is working&#x003F; He must know something about it. To-day&#x2019;s statement was totally inadequeate in that regard. The mass of evidence given before the Select Committee on the National Education Council Bill in 1962 proved the public&#x2019;s interest in the matter. They are looking for some bold steps to be taken by the Government. In his second-reading speech the hon. Minister said in 1962 that he intended to convene a National Education Conference as soon as possible after the appointment of the council. He went on to say that he intended to convene such a conference either annually or every two years and that all sorts of interested parties would be invited to attend. Why has no such conference been held&#x003F; Can the Minister tell us&#x003F; Two years have passed and nothing has happened. In reply to a question of mine on 24 February in this House, I asked the hon. Minister whether it was his intention to convene such a conference and his answer was an emphatic &#x201C;No&#x201D;. So the hon. Minister did not mean what he said in 1963. On 24 February I also asked the hon. Minister what matters had been referred to the Educational Council, how many <i>ad hoc</i> committees had been appointed, what specific aspects of education it was intended they should investigate, how many reports he had received from either the committees or the council, and whether he would give us some information, or lay these reports on the Table of the House. What was the Minister&#x2019;s answer&#x003F; He said that the council was preparing its report, that he was not prepared to anticipate its findings and that he would table it in this House towards the end of May next. At that stage I was not sure whether by May next he means May of next year or May of this year. I take it, from what the hon. Minister said this afternoon, that he meant May of this year.</p>

<p>No report was tabled by the Educational Council last year, but then they had only just been appointed&#x2014;we accept that. But can the hon. Minister tell us how it could possibly prejudice the council or prejudice the contents of its report, if he were to give us straightforward answers to my questions as to what matters had been referred to the council for its consideration&#x003F; That is all we want to know. We are not asking him for the council&#x2019;s findings. We know perfectly well that they may not be in a position to tell us at this stage. I want to remind the hon. Minister that he himself said in the second-reading debate in 1962 that a lot of issues would require long-term research and he went into these in great detail. He said that he thought the council would have to give advice on the diversity of training and the certification of teachers at universities, colleges and technical colleges, the organization of secondary education, differentiation, the problem of the education of adolescents, choice of subjects and curricula, the general forms of vocational education, vocational guidance, etc. That is what the hon. Minister said in his speech in 1962 and these are all important matters. Last year, in this House, the Minister informed hon. members that a very heavy programme had been entrusted to the Education Advisory Council. Well, Sir, surely we are entitled to know what that programme is&#x003F; But we can get no information from the hon. the Minister. It is now 12 months since the council had its first meeting, on which the Minister made a statement. Can we for instance know from the hon. the Minister how often the five nominated members of the Executive Committee have met&#x003F; The public would like to know that they are on the job. A lead is expected from them. The hon. Minister has said that all sorts of issues are being handled by this council. What are they&#x003F; I want to remind the hon. Minister of another statement that he made. The hon. Minister said in 1962 that the members of the Executive Committee &#x201C;would have to devote all their time to the work of the committee and accordingly would receive salaries&#x201D;. Well, have they done that&#x003F; Have they devoted all their time to it&#x003F; I doubt it. If not, why not&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, I have no desire to reflect upon the integrity or the ability of the people on the Executive Committee. That is not the point. But they are busy people already holding down full-time educational posts. How can they possibly be expected to have to deal with the work of the Educational Council full-time as well&#x003F; We said that this would happen. This is now the second year that this House has been asked to vote a sum of R40,000 for the Education Council. That is little enough. But if this money is going on salaries then we want to know what work is being done. On the other hand if members of the council are going about the country making serious investigations into one aspect of education or another, they will need a lot more money than the R40,000 and that should appear on these Estimates. If the Minister cannot give us a satisfactory answer, the country has every right to feel alarmed at what looks very much like neglect in these matters by the Government. Mr. Speaker, let us look at the broader picture. What do we find&#x003F; We find that this question of a manpower shortage affects half the portfolios in the Cabinet. It certainly affects a large number of Government Departments&#x2014;judging <span class="col_3493-3494" refersTo="page_0439"/>by the shortage of personnel in many of those Departments themselves. So universal is this shortage that it was difficult for me to decide under which Vote to raise this matter. I asked myself whether I should raise this matter under Labour, under Defence, Economic Affairs, Health or Education, Arts and Science. They are all vitally affected. The real answer lies, of course, in a comprehensive educational plan to cover them all. Where is it&#x003F; We have yet to see it. Here another crucial question immediately arises: What kind of coordination exists between the Government Departments I have just mentioned on this problem of a shortage of manpower&#x003F; We pleaded in 1962 that the Education Council should be a representative body, representative of the whole community. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said at the time that the whole Advisory Council was academic and we said that that was a mistake. Sir, we reaffirm that. How on earth can any Government, particularly this Government, get down to an intelligent long-term assessment of the country&#x2019;s requirements in terms of trained manpower and then proceed to formulate plans to meet those requirements unless there is adequate and permanent coordination in the field of labour, industrial development, public health, the Public Services, the Defence Department, and the Education Department&#x003F; We have no information that the Government is working on that basis.</p>

<p>I want to say something about the Division of Education. I wish to put a question to the House: How can any modern industrial country like South Africa, with a vast non-White labour force on which we are dependent, and four population groups at different stages of development, grapple with this problem of a manpower shortage unless we have one comprehensive planning authority and one comprehensive plan for the education and training of all our workers, of all colours, grades and skills&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, look at these Estimates. The hon. the Minister has a whole host of officials to take the figures out for him, but there is no means of discovering in these Estimates, for ordinary members like ourselves, what the final sum is that is being allocated to education, unless we search under as many as 22 different heads in order to try and form some sort of idea. What kind of overall planning is that, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; I want to know also how any Government can embark upon a short-term or a long-term plan for education and training in the face of a manpower crisis, such as we have in South Africa, with four different Ministers handling education votes of one kind or another, and a few other Ministers handling educational institutions in terms of their portfolios as well. Mr. Speaker, in terms of modern economic planning, and the high standars of technical efficiency that are demanded by science, by the professions and by industry to-day, it seems to me to be absolute lunacy, Sir, that those who are expected to give a lead in the field of education should be divided in this way. What is the position in South Africa&#x003F; We have the Minister of Community Development, who controls what the Government chooses to call &#x201C;Coloured Education&#x201D;. He sits in one little kraal all by himself. We have the Minister of Indian Affairs, in charge of what the Government calls &#x201C;Indian Education&#x201D;, whatever that may mean. He sits in another kraal. We have the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and he controls Bantu education, and sits in a kraal by himself&#x2014;with a limited amount of finance. We have the Minister of Education, Arts and Science, who controls what the Government calls &#x201C;White education&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, meanwhile the crying need in South Africa is to utilize, to train and to co-ordinate the ability of all our workers, White and non-White in the country&#x2019;s interest. But the Government has a fixation on colour and so there is no attempt at co-ordination at all. No wonder that our educationists and our industrialists get discouraged in this matter! No wonder we have not a hope of introducing a comprehensive well-thought-out plan for the country as a whole. The Government&#x2019;s policies prohibit it.</p>

<p>As far as we in South Africa are concerned, I think the United Party is entirely justified in saying that this Government has let the country down very badly where education is concerned. Why cannot we have bold, dynamic planning in this field&#x003F; Why must we limp along in this way&#x003F; The hon. member for Heilbron said that he raised this issue of a manpower shortage in 1956. May I remind the hon. member that in 1948 the De Villiers Commission, which was appointed and reported on behalf of a United Party administration, urged a complete overhaul of our educational system and that the present Government has been criminally negligent and done nothing about it.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to place on record that this Government of all the patriots has let South Africa down on this issue. There are no two ways about it. They talk about our cultural heritage, about Western civilization, but they have not the first idea of how to maintain either where education is concerned. And the pity of it is that the people who will suffer will be our children&#x2014;your children and my children, the people who deserve it least.</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>I rise because in the short time at my disposal I wish to bring a matter to the notice of the Government which is of real interest and which should receive the urgent and serious attention of the Government, and therefore the hon. member will forgive me if I do not react to her speech. It is the question of the increasing financial burden our cities in South Africa have to bear. It is well known to all that the cost of local government in our urban areas is steadily increasing and that they have risen to unprecedented heights. That cannot be otherwise because our cities to-day have to <span class="col_3495-3496" refersTo="page_0440"/>cope with tremendously increasing populations. Now it is obvious that with the growth of the urban populations also the demands made of municipalities for the provision of certain services like housing, new townships, transportation, power, water, the building of streets and the accompanying planning are increased, all of which is very expensive in these times.</p>

<p>If we look at the latest census, we find that the populations of our urban complexes between the years 1951 and 1960 increased as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>With this growth in population the provision of services has obviously also increased, and that put a growing financial burden on our urban local governments which places them in great difficulty. Take the city of Cape Town as an example, where the population increased by 26 per cent. In 1950 Cape Town&#x2019;s expenditure on Revenue Account (the Taxation Account) amounted to R14,972,000. In 1960 it was R28,348,000, an increase of 89 per cent in respect of their expenditure on Revenue Account. On their Capital Account their expenditure in 1950 was R5,500,000, and that increased to R12,678,000 in 1960, an increase of 140 per cent. That is the increasing financial burden with which a city like Cape Town has to cope. The City Treasurer&#x2019;s Department in Cape Town assures me that this expenditure has in recent years shown a sharp rising tendency. I want to mention another example, Bloemfontein, the city which I have the honour to represent. In 1950 the expenditure of the city of Bloemfontein on Revenue Account (from general taxation) was R1,043,962. In 1960 the expenditure on Revenue Account already amounted to R1,896,836, and to-day it is already far more than R2,000,000. That was an increase of expenditure on Revenue Account of 81 per cent over a period of ten years. Their Capital Account increased from R1,151,852 in 1950 to R3,160,631 in 1960, an increase of 174 per cent.</p>

<p>I have given these two examples of Cape Town and Bloemfontein in order to indicate to what extent their financial burden has increased. It may be accepted that this is the position in regard to every city in the Republic. I have the figures available for other cities, but I think that these two examples are sufficient to indicate the increasing financial burden with which our cities have to cope to-day. This sharp increase in expenditure was to a large extent caused by their unprecedented population increase and the concomitant provision of services. But, and I want to emphasize this, it should be noted that the expenditure increased out of all proportion to their population growth. It is that increasing financial burden which has to be borne by the ratepayers in our cities, and they now have to bear a much heavier burden than they did 10 or 12 years ago, apart from this increase in population.</p>

<p>I want to plead seriously with the Government to-day to consider whether the time has not arrived to grant relief to these people, and for the Government to make a contribution to the increasing financial burdens of the cities. I honestly think the time has arrived for the Government to pay rates to the local governments on the Government buildings and properties in the various cities. Our cities annually suffer a tremendous loss in rates because of the fact that the Government, the S.A. Railways and the Provincial Administrations do not pay rates on their buildings and properties in the cities concerned. I want to take my city of Bloemfontein as an example. The loss in rates to Bloemfontein is the following at the moment: On Government buildings R87,657 per annum, on buildings of the S.A. Railways R24,799, on vacant sites belonging to the Railways R22,094 per annum, and on buildings and properties of the Provincial Administration R32,920, a total amount of R167,470 per annum. That is an amount which will help the Bloemfontein City Council appreciably if it can collect that revenue, to combat the rising costs, if the Government should decide to pay rates on its buildings and properties.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the percentage of non-taxable and taxable properties. We find that whereas the percentage of the valuation of non-taxable properties in Bloemfontein in 1950 was 36.7 per cent, as compared with the valuation of taxable properties, that percentage is to-day already 47.1 per cent. In all fairness, I must say that the properties of institutions, associations and churches are of course not taxable either, but that constitutes a very small percentage. The central and provincial authorities are responsible for the greatest increase in this regard.</p>

<p>When I plead here that the Government should assist the urban areas, I know that the argument will be advanced that it will mean that portion of the financial burden of our cities will be transferred to the shoulders of the whole of the population and that the rural areas will then also have to make a contribution towards this financial burden, and it may be argued that this is unfair to the rural areas.</p>

<p>I want to argue, however, that every city in our country renders a particular service to the rural areas surrounding it. The city in the first place renders an economic service to the surrounding rural areas. Factories, wholesale and retail businesses, building societies, regional banks and publishing companies in the cities <span class="col_3497-3498" refersTo="page_0441"/>all make a contribution towards rendering this economic service to the rural areas.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>This is an essential service to the farmer in the rural areas during these times of agricultural mechanization. This economic service is rendered by the city, apart from the mutually economic inter-dependence of the city and the rural areas. I should like hon. members who have raised objection to note this. The city is of course dependent on the rural area for its food, raw material and purchasing power, just as the rural area is again dependent on the city as a market for its products and as a source of labour for the rural population which cannot be absorbed by agriculture or which cannot make a living in the rural area.</p>

<p>The city also renders an educational service to the rural area. In the educational sphere the city provides a higher technical and intellectual education than the rural area. The city also provides the chief library services. In the sphere of journalism it is in the cities where the main newspapers of the country are printed and distributed to the rural areas.</p>

<p>But in the third place the city also renders an administrative service, because the city is usually the headquarters of the regional officers of the various departments which have to serve the surrounding rural area.</p>

<p>Apart from Cape Town and Pretoria, which are the seats respectively of the legislative and the administrative bodies, and Bloemfontein which is the judicial capital, Cape Town, Pretoria, Bloemfontein and Pietermaritzburg are also the seats of the four Provincial Administrations.</p>

<p>There are also other respects in which the city renders particular services to the rural area, but I think I have quoted enough examples to indicate the particular services rendered by the cities to the rural areas. On these grounds I want to ask the Government to give financial assistance to our urban areas by at least accepting the responsibility for paying municipal rates on its buildings and properties. If the Government decides to do so, it will also set a good example to the Provincial Administrations to render assistance in regard to the building and maintenance of roads running through the cities and the urban areas.</p>

<p>In recent years much has been done in the way of rendering assistance to the rural areas in the form of the assistance given to agriculture.</p>

<p>I do not want to make any reproaches in that respect. I want to be fair and say that they were given essential assistance, and that even more assistance should be given. I think, however, that the urban areas also now have a justifiable claim for assistance. I think that the Government should seriously consider the financial difficulties in which our urban municipalities and ratepayers find themselves. A heavy burden is resting on the urban ratepayer, and I do not think I am asking too much when I ask the Government to pay rates on its properties in our cities.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet, I also want to say that I am particularly glad that the hon. the Minister emphasized in his Budget speech that the public sector can relieve the pressure in the building industry by postponing capital works or at least by spreading them over a longer period. I do not doubt the necessity for such capital works in the least, but I do think that in view of the housing position and the shortage of building workers it is now the time to give preference to the building of houses.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Housing recently indicated that in our urban areas alone a large number of houses have to be built. In the eight urban areas more than 8,000 housing units for Whites have to be built, and more than 55,000 housing units for non-Whites. It is also a well-known fact that the shortage of labour is felt mostly in the building industry. Under these circumstances I feel that it is absolutely essential that priority should now be given to housing and that capital works with a view to providing office space should be held back as far as possible, particularly also in view of the fact that in some of our cities there is at the moment a surplus of available office space. I hope and trust that this will be done. I am very sorry that hon. members representing the rural areas considered it necessary to interrupt me. I think I have always been a very reasonable member of this House. I have never yet interrupted any member who pleaded for the rural areas and for agriculture. I want to express my regret in that regard, but that will not prevent me from telling the Government that if the rural areas and agriculture need assistance they should be given that assistance, because I consider that to be in the interests of the country, but I also want to base my case on the same grounds on which they plead for assistance, and I also want to plead for assistance, in a time of financial need, for the urban areas, and particularly for the local authorities which are faced with an increasing financial burden.</p>

<p>I do not want to give you all the details I have with me, Sir, and I know, Mr. Speaker, that in your discretion, when these matters come to your notice, you deal with the matter accordingly. But I regret to say that on many occasions these matters are not noticed because they are done in such a way that they do not travel to your ears. That is a practice which is being followed in this House. By innuendo, and sometimes more directly, I say most definitely that this Jewbaiting is taking place. The sort of thing that is being said when certain members in this House rise to speak is immediately: &#x201C;Go to Israel; use the third language; there go the Jews again,&#x201D; and commonly the epithet is thrown across the floor of the House: &#x201C;Finkelstein,&#x201D; meaning that because a certain person called Finkelstein in Russia indulged in subversive propaganda against South Africa, that is attributed to the person who stands up to speak in this House. There was a very careful statement made the other day in regard to Karl Marx, when it was said that he was a Jew. Immediately the interjection came by way of a query that a certain member of this House was related to Karl Marx. You would rule me out of order, Mr. Speaker, but it does not rest only in this place; it is travelling further, even to the Other Place. Another epithet that is frequently thrown across the floor of the House when members of the Jewish faith get up to speak is, &#x201C;communist&#x201D;. Time and again one hears that in this House, and the device that is being used in this House is that when a member of the Jewish faith outside does something wrong then invariably you hear it attached to the whole race in this House. I think it is most deplorable. By hook or by crook it is dragged into the debate. We have had a recurrence of this in years gone by, and I believe that it is an abuse of the privilege of this House. It is something we should safeguard most dearly. We should not allow it to be abused in any way. Fortunately, in a sense, in your discretion, Sir, many of these things which are being said do not find their way into Hansard in printed form. You have this discretion, and that discretion is being used because afterwards one does not find them in Hansard indicating the impropriety of some of the things being said in this House.</p>

<p>During this Session, and particularly last week, members of the Jewish faith, properly elected to represent the constituents, have been singled out for the most shocking aspersions, and this House and the people outside are entitled to a statement from the Prime Minister himself and to an explanation from the Prime Minister himself in regard to this highly deplorable trend. We want to know from the Prime Minister whether he approves of the remarks that have been made and the attitude they betray and whether, if he does not, he will take steps as leader of his party to see that this sort of thing comes to an end. We want to know also, if he does not approve, why he has allowed remarks and the attitude revealed to go unrepudiated, because this has been going on for a considerable time. I do not know whether the Prime Minister appreciates it; he is not always in this House because he is a busy man and has to attend to his duties as Prime Minister, but this attitude is increasing in tempo and it has already caused damage to our reputation in the world outside, and it is surely not necessary for me to go into the details. I have given some of the milder remarks, if I may put it that way, but some of them do not bear repetition in this House. As I have said, I do not want to go into the merits and demerits of the matter in absolute detail, but surely a civilized people are entitled to believe that this type of race hatred died with that arch racist, Adolf Hitler. Let me say that we on this side of the House belong to a party which demands only that its members shall give their love and service to South Africa, without judging them as to their religion and their origin. We look upon them as fellow-citizens and accept them as fellow-South Africans serving South Africa. It does not seem to be appreciated, although members on this side of the House represent very often a different point of view from that of the Government and are in debate with members on that side of the House, that we are equally as good South Africans as members sitting on that side of the House and that we serve South Africa as well as they do. It is part of the institution and of the system, and according to our views we are serving South Africa. Their service to South Africa has been of very considerable value. They have served South Africa in peace and in war and the members of the Jewish faith have contributed to our industrial advancement and they have contributed materially and spiritually to the general advancement of this country. By that test it cannot be said that they are not South Africans. They belong to our community and they are certainly better South Africans than many of their present calumniators. This is all the more contemptible in the light of the record of service of these people, as I have said, and I want to say that the relationship between the Afrikaans people in this country of all parties, no matter what the political opinions of the persons concerned are and the Jewish South Africans, has fortunately always belied and repudiated the attitude of the extremist racist anti-Semites. What has been happening in this House is all the more regrettable because the people of South Africa do not stand for that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="col_3501-3502" refersTo="page_0443"/>Sir, what are these people trying to do&#x003F; Are these the official sentiments of the Nationalist Party, and if not, are they trying to make them so&#x003F; Do they seek to persuade their party to return to the days when no Jewish South African could be admitted to that party&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that the hon. the Prime Minister will not so lower himself as to participate in this deliberate, this miserable attempt to drag our Jewish fellow-citizens into politics in this way. I am also quite sure that the hon. the Prime Minister will not do so.

<p>They are trying their utmost to make anti-Semitism a political question in this country once again and I shall tell you, Mr. Speaker, why they are doing so. It is because they are also losing the support of the Jews on a large scale and this is merely an attempt to sow suspicion amongst the Jews. It is a miserable attempt which is doomed to failure. The hon. member for Von Brandis need not tell us that there are Jews in this country who are just as good South Africans as we are. Most of them are better South Africans than he can ever hope to be. What is happening here&#x003F; A few remarks have been made here, flippant remarks in my opinion, with which I do not necessarily agree, but hundreds of remarks are made on that side with which most hon. members on this side do not agree either. For example, when David Marais draws a cartoon in the <i>Cape Times</i> and one of the characters in that cartoon is a criminal or a gangster or a &#x201C;hobo&#x201D; whose name is always van der Merwe, do those hon. members have any fault to find with that fact&#x003F; Have they ever taken the <i>Cape Times</i> to task in this regard&#x003F; Have they ever told the <i>Cape Times</i> that when it publishes cartoons depicting gangsters and similar people of low character it should not always call such people van der Merwe&#x003F; But do we take any notice of that sort of nonsense&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) always refers to the Afrikaners as people living in Blikkiesdorp. Why do the Opposition not repudiate statements like that&#x003F; But I think that it would be silly of us to expect the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to repudiate nonsensical remarks of that nature. These are merely frivolous remarks. And they also call us Nazis. [Interjection.] Must the hon. the Leader of the Opposition repudiate that sort of remark as well&#x003F; But those hon. members have been destroyed so utterly that they will do anything to try to retain the little support they still have. This is no different from what the <i>Cape Times</i> and the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> have tried to do. The hon. member for Von Brandis spoke about &#x201C;Finkelstein&#x201D;. What of it&#x003F; Is it so wrong that one man should call another Finkelstein&#x003F; Finkelstein is a well-known and good old Jewish name. My father had an old Jewish friend by the name of Finkelstein and he was an outstanding fellow. If someone tells me to go to Israel, why should I become annoyed&#x003F; To tell the truth, if the hon. member for Von Brandis tells me that I should go to Israel, I should very much like to go because I would like to see what that country is like. But the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Cape Times</i> instructed the hon. member opposite to make a great hullabaloo about anti-Semitism; the label of anti-Semitism has now to be hung around the neck of the National Party and a bitter racial struggle has to be unleashed between ourselves and the Jews. But they are trying in vain to incite the Jews against the Afrikaners and they are trying in vain to incite the Afrikaners against the Jews. There is no semblance of anti-Semitism in the National Party. I can say this with the greatest confidence because I have been a member of the United Party and I am now a member of the National Party. There are people in this party who do not like the Jews but there are more people who are members of that party who do not like the Jews. I may be accused of many things but certainly not of being anti-Semitic. It is absolutely irresponsible to bring up a matter of this nature. I say that the anti-Semites in this country are to be found in the ranks of the United Party and the Progressive Party. They are the people who have no time for the Jews. Take the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller). <span class="col_3503-3504" refersTo="page_0444"/>He was Mayor of Johannesburg. Take the bon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel). He was also the first citizen of Johannesburg, but let these two gentlemen try to become members of the Rand Club and see what happens ! I can tell the hon. member for Florida that he will be thrown out of the Rand Club for one reason only&#x2014;because he is a Jew. If the hon. member for Hospital tries to apply for membership of the Rand Club he will be blackballed simply because he is a Jew. I know of many other reasons why they should blackball him, but they will blackball him simply because he is a Jew. Let me tell those two hon. members that they have a far better chance of becoming members of the Broederbond than they have of becoming members of the Rand Club. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis told us very earnestly here that those two hon. members had been elected because they were Jews. Those two hon. members flatter themselves if they think that we regard them as being the representatives of the Jews in South Africa. If the Jews wanted to elect people to represent them in this House they could choose two far better men than those two hon. members. We know Jews who are far better than they are. Because they cannot stand their ground politically, because they have lost their political sense of humour and because their party is disintegrating, they now misuse their position as members of the Jewish race to hang the label of anti-Semitism about the neck of the National Party. Sir, I am and have always been a friend of the Jews and I want to say this. If I find as much anti-Semitism in the National Party, or even half as much, as there is anti-Afrikanerdom in the United Party, then I shall resign from the National Party!</p>

<p>I am a friend of the Jews but I want to give my Jewish friends some advice. They must not allow themselves to be taken in tow by the race-hatred of the <i>Cape Times</i> and the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> They must not allow themselves to be swayed by the conduct of those two hon. members and their pettiness in this House. Nobody in this country would be so stupid and so irresponsible as to blame the Jews in this country simply because Israel decided to vote against us at UN. The Jews in this country cannot be blamed for that but they can be of great assistance to their friends by raising their voices more strongly and more vociferously in favour of South Africa when Israel takes decisions that are unfavourable to South Africa. They must raise their voices as strongly as the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) raised his voice to-day. If they do this they will be helping their friends in the National Party very much indeed&#x2014;and they have a wealth of friends in this party.</p>

<p>I also have this to say. I hope that the Jewish community in South Africa is not going to lose its sense of humour; indeed, I am sure that the Jews will not lose their sense of humour. The hon. member for Florida has lost his sense of humour and the hon. member for Hospital has never even had a sense of humour! All he has is an insatiable hunger for publicity; that is all. But no Jew with any sense of humour at all will allow himself to be swayed and influenced by this miserable attempt to make this non-existent anti-Semitism a political slogan in South Africa and to hang that false label of anti-Semitism about the neck of the National Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that we are taking this whole matter much too seriously. After all, the Jews are also only human. There are good Jews, moderate Jews and bad Jews. The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) is a person whom I regard as being a good Jewess and, if you will permit me to say so, I think that she is even an attractive Jewess. I consider the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) to be a moderate Jew and I regard the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) as being a bad Jew. (Laughter.) [Interjection.] The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) says that he is not a Jew. That is at least one disaster the Jews have been spared! (Laughter.) Yes, all I can do is to make fun of the whole matter. The Chief Whip of the United Party, who is a respected member of this House, has done himself a very great disservice this afternoon by participating in this miserable action. The only reason I can give for his conduct in this regard is the simple fact that they now realize that they no longer have the support of the English-speaking people. The number of their Afrikaans-speaking supporters is also rapidly diminishing and now they are also losing the support of the Jews. This is what they are trying to prevent by means of this miserable attempt they have made. The whole thing is utterly ridiculous and as far as I personally am concerned, I refuse to become serious about a lot of nonsense, about a few remarks that have been made in this House. Let the people who no longer have a sense of humour participate in this sort of thing. Other people who have sound common sense and who see matters in their correct perspective will not take part in things of this nature and I want to leave the question of the Jews at that. The only further remark I have to make in this regard is that all the Jews on the other side who want to come over to the National Party will be received with open arms. They are welcome.</p>

<p>In the short time I have left I should like to say a few words about the question of the shortage of manpower in South Africa, the efforts of the United Party to solve this problem and particularly the efforts on the part of the Chambers of Industry to relieve this manpower shortage. The only solution which the United Party have to this problem of the shortage of manpower is that job reservation in South Africa should be abolished. The Opposition say that the only way in which to solve this problem is to follow a policy of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;, and then they advance the false argument that if we have the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; the employer will always employ a White man in preference to a Bantu if a <span class="col_3505-3506" refersTo="page_0445"/>policy is followed in terms of which a White man and a Bantu are paid the same money for the same work. But that is a false argument. If a &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; policy is followed, one will be placing a weapon in the hands of the unscrupulous employer which he will use to deprive the White worker of all security. To abolish job reservation and to think that one can solve the manpower shortage by applying a policy of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; is nothing less than treason against the White worker. The argument of the United Party is: Pay them the same and then the employer will employ the White man instead of the Bantu. But that is simply not the case. Who fixes the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;&#x003F; It can only be fixed by the Government and it can only be a minimum wage that is determined, a wage which must of necessity be lower than the wage earned by the White worker to-day, for the simple reason that one cannot fix a wage during a period of high conjuncture, on what is being paid to-day, and think that that determination can be applied indefinitely, even during a period of low conjuncture. Economically, that is an absolute impossibility, and so that wage has to be fixed at a lower rate than is the case to-day. As soon as this is done, one gives the unscrupulous employer a weapon with which to threaten the White worker. The White worker then has this Sword of Damocles hanging over his head because he knows that if he does not produce better work or if he does not work longer hours or if he does not want to accept less pay the employer will train a Bantu to do that same work and pay him far less than he is paying the White worker. One would then be placing an extremely powerful weapon in the hands of the unscrupulous employer.</p>

<p>But it will not rest with the unscrupulous employer because as soon as one does something of this nature in the economic life of a country, a thing called Gresham&#x2019;s Law comes into operation, and Gresham&#x2019;s Law states that bad coins drive out good coins. Bad employers drive out good employers because as soon as the bad employers begin to make use of the cheap Bantu labour at the minimum wage that has been fixed, they offer such competition to the good employers that the lastmentioned simply cannot keep going and are then compelled also to resort to what the bad employers are doing. And so the bad employers call the tune as far as wages are concerned. Those wages will enable the Bantu to maintain a good standard of living but will also lower the standard of living of the White workers enormously. The Bantu will be only too grateful to obtain that work because it will be a great improvement for them while, if the Whites have to work for the same wage, they will have to lower their standard of living drastically. Therefore, under a policy of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; we will simply have a reign of terror against the White workers in South Africa. This policy may be easily applied during this present period of high conjuncture because we do not have sufficient White workers. It will also be said that the non-Whites will have to be trained on a large scale to be fitters and turners and artisans in other trades. While we are enjoying a period of high conjuncture it may make no difference, but if we experience some economic setback or other and there is a period of low conjuncture, the first workers to be put out on the street will be the White workers. Therefore, this so-called &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; is nothing less than a pattern which will eventually place the White worker at the mercy of the unscrupulous employer who will force him to compete with cheaper Bantu labour on the open market. It is true that we are saddled at the moment with a manpower problem but I think that it is greatly exaggerated. Dr. Francois Jacobs, the Administrative Manager of Union Steel Corporation, states that there is rather a shortage but that by making better use of our manpower, by making more use of mechanization, by resorting to better training methods and by making better use of the services of people over the age of 40 years we will be able to make up this shortage. But we do not have this on his authority alone; we also have it on the authority of Mr. Rissik, the President of the Reserve Bank, who has also stated that this manpower shortage in South Africa is greatly exaggerated. But this problem does exist and we do have means of solving it other than by abolishing the pattern of job reservation, other than by applying the dangerous principle of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;, a principle which is and must be the enemy of the White worker. We have furthermore the solution of immigration, but we can only have immigration to the extent to which we can absorb those immigrants and accommodate them. There is, as the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Mr. Henning) stated in his excellent maiden speech, the question of the better utilization of our labour, the better utilization of the services of people over the age of 45 years, the better utilization of female workers in South Africa, together with the use of mechanization to an increasing extent. That is the solution; that is a healthy solution; that is the solution which is economically sound; it is a solution which will not undermine our economy and will never undermine the position of our White worker. But we in this country have to guard against one thing, and particularly at this stage of our development. In this era of great prosperity we have to be careful about one thing&#x2014;and I fear that this is the mistake that is made by the Opposition, and, what is more serious still, the mistake that is made by the Chambers of Commerce and by the Chamber of Industry&#x2014; and that is that we do not make prosperity our idol; put everything we have at the service of prosperity; put our country at the service of prosperity; put our pattern of life at the service of prosperity. They want to put everything that we have built up over the past 300 years at the service of prosperity instead of putting prosperity at the service of those things. After all, Mr. Speaker, how <span class="col_3507-3508" refersTo="page_0446"/>swiftly can a country develop&#x003F; Things affect a country just as they affect an ordinary business. A country can develop as swiftly as its raw materials and its capital and its labour force permit it to develop. It can add to these things by means of immigration and by borrowing capital and so forth. If I own a business I can expand that business according to the capital at my disposal, the labour forces at my disposal and the management ability at my disposal. I can borrow money as soon as the time for doing so is ripe; I can issue new shares; I can build up a very powerful business by using other people&#x2019;s money. A very flourishing business may be built up in this way within a certain period of time but the difference there will be that that business will no longer belong to me. We have to be very careful lest in this tidal wave of prosperity we find ourselves in a situation in which we will be enjoying more and more prosperity only to discover that South Africa no longer belongs to the White man. We must be warned against that. The introduction of a policy of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; must of necessity lead to the situation in which not only the position of the White worker but also the position of the White man in South Africa will be undermined. I want to say that we must be very careful, under pressure from industrialists and dealers, not to allow our yearning for prosperity to rob us of this country. We are at the moment one of the most prosperous countries in the world. We are expanding swiftly; we have nothing to be dissatisfied about. I can see no reason whatsoever for the complaint that if we had more workers we could expand and prosper more swiftly. We have every reason to be satisfied. We are saddled with the same problem that is being experienced by every other country in the world, but to change the whole basis of our policy now simply because there is an artificial shortage of manpower&#x2014;except in the building sector where there really is a shortage&#x2014;and to abolish the basis of our policy of job reservation, which is and has been after all, the basis of the labour pattern in South Africa under all Governments, is to gamble with the safety of our country and to gamble with the safety of the White man for the sake of this so-called prosperity.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to take this opportunity to express a few thoughts about the problems in connection with our wheat production in South Africa. I am glad that I need not render further assistance to the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). I think he has replied adequately to everything which was put before us in connection with the anti-Semitic feeling which has been created here artificially. I think we can regard that matter as having been stillborn. I regret that such a worthy member, who although he seldom speaks, sometimes speaks very intelligently, made such a foolish speech in this House to-day.</p>

<p>When I say a few words here in regard to wheat production and the problems of the wheat farmer in our country, I do so with a full realization of the problems facing us in regard to the maintenance of our standard of living and the cost of living, and I also bear in mind the needs of the consumers. Wheat is produced in South Africa mainly in three areas&#x2014;the Swartland, the South-Western Districts, of which Ru&#x00EB;ns is the main area, and the Orange Free State. Approximately one-quarter of our wheat production is produced in various other smaller areas like the Orange River Valley, the north-west and certain irrigation areas in the Transvaal. It is significant to me that there is a reasonable balance between the production of the various areas. The average production of the Swartland for the past five years was 1,780,000 bags, that of the South-Western Districts 1,838,000, that of the Orange Free State 2,401,000, and that of the other areas 2,052,000. It is interesting to note that the Free State has in recent years actually become the chief wheat-producing area in our country and that the traditional wheat-producing areas, namely the Swartland and the South-Western Districts, are gradually beginning to lag behind. I want to point out, Sir, that this is really indicative of the fact that things are not going well with this industry in the Swartland and in the South-Western Districts. The price last season, 1963-4, was fixed at R5.60 per bag for B1 wheat. In determining the wheat price the costs of production are thoroughly taken into account, although certain factors exist which in our opinion are not borne in mind sufficiently. But on broad lines we can say that the determination of prices for wheat in South Africa under the system of control is determined by two factors, viz. production costs and the entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage. I can quite safely say that the wheat farmers in South Africa have accepted that basis of price fixation. It has undoubtedly led to certain advantages; it has given the consumer the advantage of a reasonably low and stable bread price, and it has brought about certain advantages to the producer, namely that it has brought stability to the industry. I still remember the years&#x2014;and not hundreds of years ago, but only 20 to 25 years ago&#x2014;when the wheat farmer in South Africa did not always know what to do with his wheat crop. As the result of control, that difficulty has been solved. In spite of that, I should still like to voice certain objections to-day in connection with the present wheat price, seeing that the hon. the Minister is here now.</p>

<p>We have every appreciation for the fact that stability has been created in the industry, and for the fact that by means of price control a reasonable price is ensured for the wheat farmer. But on this occasion I should like to voice a few doubts in regard to the present price of wheat, in the hope that the hon. the Minister will thoroughly consider the matter and that, with his knowledge of the problems of wheat farming, he will take these problems <span class="col_3509-3510" refersTo="page_0447"/>into consideration and try to meet the wheat farmers as far as possible.</p>

<p>The first objection to the price of wheat I wish to mention is that as the result of lower grades, which we get so often&#x2014;during the past year that happened again in the Swartland area and I think also in the South-Western Districts&#x2014;and which alone result in reduced production, the wheat farmer in a bad year, in which his wheat has been afflicted by all kinds of diseases, does not receive the average fixed price. In other words, he is bound to a much lower price because he delivers a poorer product&#x2014;not that I expect a higher price for people who deliver a poor product, but it simply reduces the income of the wheat farmer, whereas he still has to incur the same expenses. That creates all kinds of financial problems.</p>

<p>A second consideration I want to mention to the Minister is that land values are set at too low a figure for the purpose of price determination. In the South-Western Districts it is put at R51 per morgen, and in the Swartland at R47 per morgen. I know that there is the consideration that the authorities who determine wheat prices must as far as possible try to combat inflationary land prices. Therefore it is not wise to take land prices at too high a level for the purposes of fixing the price of wheat, but I do want to say that these land values are definitely unrealistic. It is out of all proportion to the present market value of land. I think the present market value of land generally in the areas under consideration is at least twice the amount which is taken into consideration when the price of wheat is fixed. It therefore remains a very important factor which creates all kinds of problems for the wheat farmer. At that valuation no young wheat farmer can really start farming because he cannot buy land at any price other than the present market price. There is always a percentage of farmers who leave the industry, who simply cannot carry on because of their age and who do not have a son to take over the farm, and who therefore have to capitalize their property and live on their interest. On that basis the industry is closed to the new farmer who has to buy his land in the open market.</p>

<p>A third consideration I wish to mention as an objection to the present price of wheat is that the rate of interest on capital has since 1941 been put at 5 per cent, and that that rate of interest is too low. The wheat farmer cannot get money on mortgage bond anywhere at that rate of interest. That rate of interest is out of all proportion to the rental value of land. The man who wants to hire a wheat farm simply cannot get any land at that rate of interest. I want to point out that there is in fact a considerable percentage of farms which have been paid for, but that in my opinion there are very few wheat farmers who farm on land that has been paid for, because within a relatively short period the farmer&#x2019;s son must really take over the farm and he must hire that farm from his father, and he must do so at a rate which is appreciably higher than the rate of interest which is taken into consideration for the purpose of determining the price of wheat.</p>

<p>I want to mention a fourth consideration which is perhaps most important of all. When everything goes well, when the crops are fine, when the rain comes in time, there is hardly any wheat farmer who complains about the present fixed price. But our country is no great wheat-producing country. We are too often faced with periodic droughts, rust in the wheat, wind damage, frost, with wheat lice in the Free State, and now even the mice plague in the Swartland, particularly in the western area. It often takes the farmer a few years to recover from the damage suffered in one bad year and to get going again. When one makes inquiries at agricultural co-operatives, one realizes that if it were not for the fact that our wheat farmers&#x2019; co-operatives are to-day fairly strong financially many of our wheat farmers would simply have gone to the wall because they just cannot finance their wheat farming themselves. They simply operate on the credit they can obtain from their co-operatives, in the hope that they will again have a good crop. Unless we pay proper attention to that in our future planning and in the determination of prices, it will simply mean that as time goes on increasingly more wheat farmers, particularly the smaller ones, will have to give up, and it would be a great pity if this process is accelerated. I want to mention an example. In 1962-3 the price of wheat was calculated on an average yield of about nine bags per morgen. If we analyse what the actual yield per morgen was in the area surveyed, we find that in the Swartland the average yield was seven bags per morgen. In other words, the production costs of the farmer who got seven bag per morgen were much higher than the theoretical average on which the price was fixed&#x2014;two bags per morgen less than the yield taken into consideration when determining the price. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to bear these facts in mind this year when determining the price of wheat. From time to time we speak to directors and managers of agricultural co-operatives, and particularly of our wheat co-operatives, and we can tell the hon. the Minister in all honesty that those people are concerned about an appreciable percentage of our wheat farmers who simply cannot make ends meet any more. Amongst our wheat farmers these days there is a measure of pessimism; they feel that their circumstances and their needs are not being seriously considered. I do not want to say that that is so, but I do want to take this opportunity to ask the Minister seriously to consider the position of our wheat farmers because these facts speak for themselves. It is significant that people from the viticultural districts have recently been buying farms in the wheat districts at prices which no wheat farmer is prepared to pay because he knows what problems exist and what the <span class="col_3511-3512" refersTo="page_0448"/>cost of wheat production is, and the damage he may suffer. These people from the viticultural districts, however, buy these farms because they come from a sector of our agriculture where the farmers in general are much more prosperous. Sir, we are dealing here with a settled section of our farming community. I think that applies also to the Free State, of which I cannot speak from experience, but I am thinking now particularly of the Swartland and the South-Western Districts, the Ru&#x00EB;ns area and other districts. We are dealing here with a settled community and not with people who continually allow their farms to pass into the hands of others. This community has made a very great contribution to the development of our country, although financially it may not be such a great contribution. But during the war years, when we were dependent on local production, it made a great contribution towards feeding our population. It is a community which in future may hold a key position, particularly when taking into consideration the tendency towards the increasing isolation of our country, and I want to ask that we should not leave them in the lurch but that they should be assisted to retain their interest in the growing of wheat.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, unless the Government devotes serious attention to the price of wheat and to the position of our wheat farmers, I predict that the South-Western Districts and the Ru&#x00EB;ns area and the Swartland will in future become predominantly wool and meatproducing areas. At the present prices there is hardly any incentive for the wheat farmer to carry on with wheat production, and as increasingly more people discover this to be the position, it will simply mean that in this country with a growing population we will have reduced wheat production. There may of course also be other economic considerations; it may be said that we can sell our wool overseas at a good price, that we thereby earn valuable foreign currency, but viewed as a long-term policy this is the wrong tendency, and therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to the economic position of our wheat farmers. I know that he is sympathetic to the wheat farmer; he knows their problems, but I want to ask that he should also persuade the Government in the near future to consider the circumstances and the needs of the wheat farmers and to assist them.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by expressing just one more thought. I have already referred to the position of the smaller wheat farmer. It is significant that it is the man who is financially independent who can make use of the State schemes in regard to farm planning and soil conservation, but the man who lags behind is the comparatively small farmer who reaps 500 or 1,000 bags of wheat, and he is the man who cannot derive any benefit from the farm planning and soil conservation schemes. Those people lag behind to an increasing extent, and their soil is increasingly being lost to us.</p>

<p>Therefore I hope that the hon. the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services, will consider whether it is not possible to assist these farmers whose financial position is weak by giving them a higher subsidy or assisting them to plan their farms and to apply soil conservation methods. There is a serious need for it. If we want to retain the existing wheat-producing land in South Africa and build it up so as to be able to produce even more in future, it is absolutely essential that this matter should receive serious consideration. I confidently leave this matter in the hands of the hon. the Minister, in the certainty that he will do his best for our wheat farmers, but I wish to conclude by saying that in many cases they are in a precarious position.</p>

In fact, the hon. member has rarely been present during the debate.

<p>I am pleased to hear that. In that case we shall then very definitely always have protection here. To revert to the matter raised by the hon. member for Von Brandis, I should like to say it is a very serious matter, and I should like to give my reasons for thinking so. I shall prove that the National Party has in the past been an anti-Jewish party. I should like to quote a motion proposed by Dr. Malan in this House on 12 January 1937. I should like to quote what he said in a motion of no confidence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its disapproval of the neglect of the Government to take early and active measures to prevent the further influx of Jewish immigrants and especially the so-called German refugees and, in addition, to impose certain restrictions upon them; to prevent the immigration of persons of races such as, amongst others, the Jewish who cannot be readily assimilated.</block>

<p>A whole series of these things then follow&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To abolish Yiddish as a specially recognized European language, the knowledge of which is sufficient for immigration purposes.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that this National Party bears the stigma of being an anti-Jewish party, and when this attitude once again begins to manifest itself in this House, it is a serious matter. But what have we had from the hon. member for Vereeniging&#x003F; He adopted a lighthearted attitude in his reply to the hon. member for Von Brandis.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this Budget debate with a sense of near disapproval. I say that for two reasons.

<p>The hon. the Chief Whip is becoming alarmed quite unnecessarily. It is his task to ascertain which matters are going to be discussed and to make the necessary arrangements with our Whips. The fact that for nearly three days we have been debating this matter without Ministers being present here just goes to show that the hon. the Chief Whip has not done his work.</p>

<p>I was unaware of my personal importance that because I was not present, the Ministers did not deem it necessary to be present either. But the simple truth is that this debate has been carried on without Ministers being present here. A few Ministers were present to-day, but on Thursday and Friday very few of them were present.</p>

<p>My second point of disapproval was the attitude of the hon. the Minister of Finance. The hon. the Minister is not here either, but his attitude was that the surplus of R88,000,000 belonged to the Government. His attitude was that it was thanks to this good Government that he was able to show this surplus.</p>

<p>I do not think it is going to remain at R88,000,000. I think it will finally be R100,000,000. And now the attitude of this Government is that they can dispense alms, and I find that utterly unsavoury. What is the truth, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; The <span class="col_3515-3516" refersTo="page_0450"/>truth is that this money belongs to the taxpayers; it belongs to the people in South Africa who risked just a little more, planned a little better and worked a little bit harder. They are responsible for this result. But the attitude of the hon. the Minister is that he can now do as he likes with these large sums of money, and that he can dispense alms to a few people. And I listened to the Budget speech with a sense almost of disapproval because it showed me that as usual this Government has no plans; that as usual it has no vision; that as usual it cannot check the extravagance and the waste of money that is taking place.</p>

<p>I should like to look back into the past a little, and ask what this Government has said in connection with taxation and the national income. I should like to quote from a pamphlet published by Mr. M. C. de Wet Nel in 1948. This is the heading&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Put a stop to it: South Africa deserves better. Why you should vote against this hopeless Government and for the Nationalist Government.</block>

<p>What were the reasons given by him&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because the public debt has risen. In 1939-40 the public debt amounted to &#x00A3;291,000,000. On 31 March, 1947 it totalled &#x00A3;549,000,000. The debt therefore has increased by over &#x00A3;300,000,000 in 11 years.</block>

<p>And now, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; In 1947 the total debt was R1,217,000,000 and at the present time it is R2,885,000,000.</p>

<p>Shame, Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister is now as wrong as he was at that time. That is not the only thing said by the hon. the Minister. At that time the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development went further and dealt with the terrible taxes the public were paying. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1935-6 you paid &#x00A3;32,000,000 in taxes; in 1946-7 it amounted to &#x00A3;117,000,000&#x2014; nearly &#x00A3;100,000,000 more in 11 years.</block>

<p>Oh, he was terribly upset about that. What is the position at the present time&#x003F; As usual the Minister was wrong; those figures he quoted were not correct. In 1946-7 we paid &#x00A3;280,000,000 and in 1963-4 it is R862,000,000. That is according to the Estimates of the hon. the Minister. And next year it will be R1,050,000,000. But what is being done with all this money&#x003F; That is equally important. On 18 February 1964, in reply to a question by the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) the hon. the Minister of Finance replied as follows: There are 22 Cadillacs, Plymouths and Galaxies in which hon. Ministers are travelling around. I have no objection to that, but this is where the joke comes in as far as I am concerned &#x2026; Mr. Speaker, Someone asks &#x201C;What about your Cadillac&#x003F;&#x201D; I paid for mine myself, and that is the difference. I did not ask the public to pay for mine. I also fill up with petrol at my own expense. And, moreover, I drive it myself, but the great joke about this is this: Over and above these 22 Cadillacs, etc., the hon. the Minister of Transport says there is in addition a pool of motor vehicles for the use of Ministers when they require fiveor sixseater cars. You know, Mr. Speaker, one can hardly walk in Parliament Street any more because of the multitude of ministerial cars. Do you know what the expense has been during two years in connection with these 22 cars&#x003F; It is R35,237&#x2014;nearly R36,000. That is according to the Budget. And they covered 437,000 miles. It is no wonder that in Utrecht, where I live, I sometimes see some of these big cars with a driver and a secretary or so.</p>

<p>But that is not the only thing that is interesting. This Government, which is a little too expensive for South Africa to afford it, according to that hon. Minister has 31 residences, excluding Liberias and Groote Schuur, and the municipal valuation of those residences, which is usually less than the market value, is R912,000, nearly R1,000,000. In addition there are three flats, for which a rental of R684 per month is being paid. Of this R684 per month the Ministers in question pay R184 per month, and the balance of the bill is footed by the taxpayers.</p>

<p>That is not correct. Our Ministers lived in dignified homes, but I do not think our Minisers were as extravagant as these Ministers. Then there is an amount of R159,000 for furniture. It is interesting to note that for these 31 residences an amount of R7,832 is being paid in the form of rent by the Ministers concerned, and the balance comes out of the pockets of the taxpayers. But that is not all. This is a Government of Bantustans, is it not Mr. Speaker&#x003F; This is a Government which has decided that South Africa is no longer to be a single unit; that large slices of South Africa have to be given away to independent states; they are now going to retain a small piece in the middle for the White man, as they say. But they are paying dearly for it. Sir. Buildings have to be erected; a large residence has been built at Umtata for Mr. Hans Abraham. In that connection they spent R230,000 and in Mafeking R244,000; in Nongoma R205,000; in Sibasa R407,000, etc. We lent Dalinyebo R40,000 to build himself a residence.</p>

<p>But that is not all yet. Do you realize, Mr. Speaker, that of every four Nationalist Party members, one is either a Minister or a member of a commission&#x003F; I understand the Native Affairs Commission sits for six days a year, <span class="col_3517-3518" refersTo="page_0451"/>and for that they are paid R2,030. That of course does not include the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). He is there fulltime, as we see in this House every day. Of course he never stops talking here. He receives an extra R1,000. In order to popularize this concept of Bantustans with the people whom the Government wants to accept this idea, the Government is paying them a tidy sum of money. Botha Sigcau receives R3,000; Victor Poto receives R3,000; another Sigcau receives R3,000; Dalindyebo receives R3,000; Matanzima receives R2,000. As you know, Mr. Speaker, Zululand will not have anything to do with these Bantustans, and there the Government really spends a lot of money. They are paying Dinizulu R4,436 and Sandile receives R3,000. That is only to see whether their co-operation cannot be secured. That is not all either, Mr. Speaker. We need merely look at the number of new Ministers. Formerly there was one Department of Bantu Affairs; now there are two. Formerly there was one Department of Agriculture. At that time things were still going well with the farmers, but to-day we have two Departments of Agriculture and now the farmers are really faring badly.</p>

<p>We have a Department of Coloured Affairs and a Department of Community Development; we have a Department of Tourism. Education is sub-divided into White, Coloured, Bantu and Indian education. We even have a Minister of Indian Affairs to-day. It is so interesting; do you know who he is, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; He is the leader of the Nationalists in Natal. He has now become the leader of the Indians also. We have a Department of Immigration now. We have commissions galore. We have a Press Commission, such a beautiful picture which appeared in this morning&#x2019;s paper, with a row of books behind them. Heaven alone knows when those books will arrive in this House, and where they are going to be stored. As far as we know that commission costs us R353,000 to date. We have had the Tomlinson Commission report, consisting of so many books that they could not send it here&#x2014;they had to give us an abbreviated report. We have had the Odendaal Commission; we have had the commission on the depopulation of the rural areas; we have had a commission on the cost of agricultural implements; we have a commission dealing with our coinage. At the moment they are trying to find out how little silver we can put into our coins. We have had a commission on the high cost of medical treatment and there are a whole lot of others too.</p>

<p>There are so many of them that my time does not permit me to enumerate them all. The point I wish to make is this: All these commissions are appointed; and all those members must be paid and no notice is taken of their recommendations. The Government simply carries on as it likes. There is the Advisory Economic Planning Council of the hon. the Prime Minister. Nobody knows what advice they give him. There is the Education Advisory Council. As I have said, one out of every four National Party members is either a member of a commission or a member of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>I have said we have a Department of Immigration, but do you remember, Sir, that the hon. the Prime Minister on 12 March 1953 at Evaton said that the policy of the United Party would mean getting 50,000 immigrants from Europe&#x003F; The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B.

<p>In 1953 the Prime Minister did not know yet that he would be introducing immigrants. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development at that time referred from place to place to the 24,000 immigrants. Subsequently 4,960 came in, and then he said: &#x201C;In this way your children&#x2019;s future is being frittered away for the sake of strangers.&#x201D; And today they are travelling all over the world to recruit immigrants. Mr. Speaker, you know the person who composed the little Afrikaans song &#x201C;Hoe ry die Boere sit-sit so&#x201D;, must have been thinking of these Ministers. These Ministers are never together in the Republic of South Africa at one and the same time. They go travelling overseas one after another.</p>

<p>At the outset I said that I had listened almost with disapproval to this Budget speech. I disapprove of the boasting attitude of the Minister, that attitude of his that it is the Government which has brought about this surplus. I repeat it is the taxpayer of the Republic and the people who were prepared to work a little harder, to risk a little more and who planned better who achieved this surplus, and not the Government.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) wearied herself this afternoon by quoting a long list of figures in order to try to prove how this Government wastes money. I wonder what the position would have been had her side of the House been in power. These items of expenditure are in connection with essential services for which every Government has to make provision. Where she referred to the increased expenditure on Loan Account, I can only tell her that these are productive investments. We are accustomed to the fact that when the hon. member for Drakensberg speaks, she uses up all her time in discussing agricultural matters. To-day she deviated from that and tried to convince us that the Government was not doing its duty properly in another sphere as well. However, things went so well with her <span class="col_3519-3520" refersTo="page_0452"/>under this Government that she herself admitted that she had paid cash for her Cadillac. I take it that this money came from her agricultural income and from the profits she made as the result of the sound agricultural policy of this Government. But I do not want to follow her further.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the Budget and I want to say that this Budget again emphasizes the very fortunate position in which South Africa finds itself. It is experiencing an unequalled economic revolution; it forms a sharp contrast with the deteriorating economies of other states in Western Africa. It compares very well and in most cases surpasses the unstable economies of many Western countries. The hon. member for Drakensberg should take note of these facts. When this Budget has again proved the viability of a sound economy, one can understand why the Afro-Asian states are so jealous of and inimical towards South Africa. The grapes are enticing, Sir, but to them they are sour grapes. One can also understand the feeble efforts of the Opposition to criticize this Budget, because there simply is not a weak place where they can drive in a wedge.</p>

<p>This Budget has also emphasized once more that South Africa is a very rich country. We have an almost inexhaustible potential of minerals, the successful exploitation of which has enabled our mining industry to contribute no less than R719,000,000 or 13.1 per cent to the net national income of R5,481,000,000. But that is not all. The soil of our fatherland is also fertile, so much so that its agriculture, forestry and fishing industry contributed the large amount of R568,000,000, or 10.4 per cent of the net income.</p>

<p>Agriculture has also shown a phenomenal growth during recent years, so much so that in one single year, from 1962 to 1963, the gross agricultural income increased from R822,000,000 to R855,000,000, an increase of R27,000,000, and that despite the protracted and serious droughts with which our farmers had to cope. That speaks volumes for the achievements of our farmers.</p>

<p>Also in the sphere of industry and manufacturing, the progress was phenomenal. This important sector contributed R1,399,000,000, or 25.5 per cent of the net national income. Lastly, I want to refer to the commercial undertakings which flourished to such an extent that this sector was responsible for R708,000,000, or 12.8 per cent. The great pressure of business on our railway stations, our Railways and main roads and in our harbours proves to what extent our foreign and internal trade is growing. That cannot be denied by the hon. member for Drakensberg or the Opposition. They allege that it is merely as the result of our natural resources that our economy is so flourishing, but that is quite a wrong statement to make. We as farmers know that a good farm does not necessarily make a good farmer, but a good farmer always makes a good farm. An important example, in order to prove this proposition, is the fact that one-seventeenth of the population of Africa produces one-quarter of the agricultural income of the whole of Africa. That is South Africa. In other words, a good master or a good Government of a small country produces more than the remaining sixteen-seventeenths of the rest of Africa under bad management. It is only through sound planning and consultation and the stimulating initiative of a good Government that such development is possible. It is only the statesmanlike policy of this strong and stable Government which has resulted in our obtaining the security which is so essential for a high degree of confidence in the country and overseas, confidence which in turn has laid the foundation for the phenomenal economic upsurge we are experiencing to-day and which has also made this Budget, which can hardly be attacked, possible. One foresees a sad day, Sir, if the Opposition could come into power again, with hon. members like, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Drakensberg, carrying the key to our Exchequer.</p>

<p>If I may pay a compliment to the hon. the Minister of Finance and his efficient officials, I want to say that by means of this Budget they have provided a silver lining for the otherwise very dark clouds hanging over South Africa and which, due to the enmity, the hatred and the threats coming from beyond our borders, are obstinately refusing to disappear from the political horizon of our fatherland. This silver lining gives us courage again and stimulates our confidence in our inherent power and independence, and also in our economic ability to combat the future boycotts and attacks which may be planned against us. It sets the mind of every voter in the country at rest to see how the Nationalist Government has succeeded during its term of office in building up an economy and a resistance which hitherto have been able to cope with all threats of boycotts, etc.</p>

<p>Then I come to the second important aspect of the Budget, viz. the ample provision for defence. Out of the total sum budgeted for, R1,019,500,000, with a surplus of R88,000,000, R210,000,000 has been set aside for defence. This is an increase of R52,000,000 over the previous year. It is the highest peacetime amount in our political history. The necessity for it needs no proof. Repeated threats from the members of UN that the cold war in which we find ourselves to-day will be turned into a shooting war if South Africa does not abandon its policy of separate development cannot be ignored. It is clear that this amount is really still too small. To summarize, it ought therefore to be clear to everybody that the Government has succeeded in building up a particularly high degree of economic and physical defence for our country and that the Budget provides for further expansion. We are very grateful for that because economic and physical defence are two very important requirements for any country threatened by a shooting war from outside.</p>

<p><span class="col_3521-3522" refersTo="page_0453"/>I have my doubts, however, Mr. Speaker, whether we have made enough progress in regard to our spiritual defence to offer the resistance demanded from us in this time of crisis. It is the human element which is so very important for a struggle to the bitter end. The spiritual arming of a nation, is an essential pre-requisite for successful warfare. I may perhaps best illustrate what I mean by pointing out how the spiritual frame of mind of the Russian nation in the battle for Moscow enabled them in those critical hours to ward off the German attacks. I can also illustrate it by pointing out how the British people on their island dug in their heels as the result of their common spiritual attitude after Dunkirk. Perhaps I can take an even better example from our own history and refer to the spiritual adaptation of our Voortrekkers when in 1842 they had to cross the mountains when they left Natal, but were still inspired by the will to fight and to conquer.</p>

<p>The struggle with which we are faced in Africa is no longer a mere ideological struggle or a clash of interests. It has changed to an out-and-out colour and racial struggle between Black and White, with a disquieting amount of spiritual indoctrination of the White man towards ultra-liberalism. In such a racial struggle one must choose sides and there simply is not a neutral standpoint in between for any White man in our country. It is clear that in an open clash the Government will need general support, but that in the meantime while the cold war is going on and while drastic preparations have to be made there is a regrettable confusion of tongues in regard to the question as to what should be the common colour policy or colour attitude of the Whites in our country towards the non-Whites and particularly in respect of statements with regard to equality and political rights on the part of the Black states outside our borders. It sometimes appears as if on the part of the Opposition there is a complete lack of clear understanding and awareness of the danger of the attacks being planned against us and against the right of self-determination of the White man in South Africa. The very irresponsible statements made by the Opposition, <i>inter alia,</i> during the second reading of the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill, prove the utterly corrupt spiritual attitude of the largest political opposition party in South Africa. The Progressives and other leftists, together with the evil propaganda made by the British Press overseas, strengthen my proposition. In the ranks of the liberals and leftists there are already some people who have openly chosen sides, who do not talk, but who have adroitly chosen the side of the subversive organizations which are undermining the State, as was revealed, <i>inter alia,</i> by the Rivonia case. One should never speak to the Black man with two tongues.</p>

<p>In order to enforce respect for the standpoint of the Whites in this country as well as abroad, we as White people should speedily find a broader national terrain from which a solid unanimity may be reflected to counter the unanimity of the Blacks in regard to their plans against us. In my opinion, there is a great need for a common front and a united attitude not only on the part of the political parties and the Press, but also on the part of every White man and woman in the country. Cannot we discipline ourselves to such an extent that at least during these critical years of the struggle of the White man we will speak more clearly to the outside world in regard to our colour policy and our most cardinal racial problems&#x003F; The Black man in Africa knows what he wants; he wants to drive the White man out of Africa. They are so united in spirit that if they shout &#x201C;Uhuru&#x201D; the foundations of the White European states shake and the gates of UN tremble. They know what they want. Do we have a unified plan and policy&#x003F; Are we disciplined in so far as our attitude is concerned even in this House&#x003F; Do we speak with one tongue when we adopt a standpoint against the Black man in regard to the place he must fill in our social and political structure&#x003F; I put this question to the House whether, in addition to economic and military defence, our White population group is spiritually correctly adapted; in other words, whether we have made sufficient progress in regard to our spiritual defence in order to carry on this bitter struggle further and to bring it to a successful conclusion&#x003F; I fear that we stare blindly at economic prosperity and military power, and that we are under the illusion that the White man is expendable only in the rest of Africa. Sir, as far as I am concerned, our annihilation can only be prevented by great spiritual exertion which will strengthen and support our economic and physical resistance. I am sometimes afraid that history is repeating itself and that the Continent of Africa is again shaking off the White man from its back, as it has done throughout the centuries. The clipping of the wings of the Western eagle over Africa and Asia brings the position of South Africa as the last White outpost very strongly to the fore, because to the extent that the Western eagle loses its feathers the communist vultures extend their wings from Moscow and Peking over this continent and the East. UN and the Commonwealth are already three-quarters Black and the Afro-Asian states consistently take sides with the communists and thus form an international pressure group against South Africa which we have to bear in mind; 31 out of the 36 independent Black states have already been converted from democratic states to one-party states, and others have already become communist. The repeated murders of missionaries in African states also proves that Christianity is again being shaken off the back of Africa, just as the old Christian churches disappeared in North Africa. The continued retreat and withdrawal of the White man from the Africa states shows the tempo at which the blackening process is taking place. The question is therefore whether Africa is again putting back the clock to the Dark Ages to free itself of <span class="col_3523-3524" refersTo="page_0454"/>the White man with his religion, his culture and his knowledge and the development he brought here&#x003F; The signs are unmistakably there. The Black man in his march against the White man achieved his greatest success by spiritual indoctrination. Whether we will stop him at this southern point of Africa will, in my opinion, simply depend on the spirit and the frame of mind with which we wage this battle. A divided spiritual attitude opposite the coordinated unity of the Black man will also be fatal to us as Whites in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) has been quite proud of the fact that this Government has seen fit to devote a very, very large sum of money for the defence of our country. We on this side feel that it is necessary to have this money spent. We regret, and I regret personally, that so much money has to be spent to defend our shores. The cold war is on us and has been on us for some time, and I wonder how much money has been spent by us on the cold war. How much money have we spent to better our position as far as the cold war is concerned&#x003F; How much would be saved if we spend more on trying to improve our foreign relations&#x003F; How much more would we have to spend for our own needs here if the policies of the Government were acceptable to the outside world&#x003F; Because of the Government policies, and nothing else, we have to defend ourselves. I do not think for one moment that anybody is going to attack us in a hot war. I do not think so. I sincerely hope, and I am sure that every person in this House hopes that we will never see the day that we shall have to repulse invaders. We do not want that. But I do say that we should go out of our way and spend as much as we possibly can to try and make better friends with those who were friends with us earlier in this century.</p>

<p>Sir, what is happening to us&#x003F; We are losing our friends, and even in those agencies where we are actively represented in UNO, we are finding ourselves uncomfortable. We have already left the I.L.O. It is my sincere hope that this Government will do its utmost to keep us in the World Health Organization. We cannot afford to give that up, and we must not walk out of that organization. For two reasons. Firstly, for what we can give and secondly, for what we can learn from that organization. South Africa has got a very proud name in the World Health Organization and our representatives who have gone there have contributed more than just an ordinary contribution. We have been foremost in the work of that organization, and I am sure that the Western nations are appreciative of what we have done. I am quite certain they will miss us if we go. I ask that we should stay for as long as possible. The whole idea of that organization is based on health issues. Politics should have no part in it. No part of politics should ever enter that agency of UNO.</p>

<p>I would be prepared to tell them that and I am telling them now, and I hope that what I say is reported, because those are the views of this side of the House. That organization can save the health of the world and South Africa can prove an active participant in the work that is done by that organization. I do not want to mention names, but people that we have sent to the World Health Organization from this country have already become world famous and our contributions have become world famous. The work that we have done to combat poliomyelitis, malaria and sleeping sickness, plus the work of hundreds of others who have been only too pleased to contribute alongside of us, makes sure that the best comes out of that organization. Now we have been insulted there, but the Black states must realize that they are the ones that have most to gain by South Africa remaining in there, and we must stand fast for as long as possible in that organization, so that we can give, as we have always been prepared to give in the past. The Western nations must stand by us and do their utmost to keep us in that organization. It is the one agency of UNO that I say is a <i>must,</i> and until the day comes that we are forcibly ejected from that agency, we must play our part to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>Talking about the amount of money that we spend on defence and the little that we have spent on the cold war, comparatively speaking, it seems to me that if we continue to adopt this pessimistic attitude of expecting an attack, the dangers are that somebody may be rash enough to try something of that sort. I do not think it will happen; I do not think anybody would dare to attack us.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have gone through the Estimates as they affect social welfare services and health services. Two or three weeks ago I stressed in this House how important it was for us to vote a little more for the pensioner, and I am very pleased that the hon. the <span class="col_3525-3526" refersTo="page_0455"/>Minister has persuaded the Cabinet to give the pensioner an additional R2.50 so as to put the ordinary social pensioner on the same level as those who were receiving a little more because they had nothing. But there lies the rub: those who have nothing are still in the same position. When I asked the hon. the Minister for an increase of R2 in the pension, my idea was simply to reimburse the pensioner for the rise in the cost of living. But the pensioner who has no other means is getting nothing more in this Budget and he is the very person who should have been given an increase. I heard that choice morsels from the rich man&#x2019;s table were apparently to be given to the pensioner without any other means. All the pensioner is getting is a &#x201C;morsel&#x201D;; it is certainly not a choice morsel. It is something that is acceptable, of course, but it is nothing more than a morsel. Those people who require assistance more than anybody else are getting no relief. The reason which was advanced for increasing the pension by R2.50 was not one of generosity; the reason that was given was to bring the pension in line with other social pensions because of administrative difficulties encountered in the payment of pensions. Necessity should have been the reason for giving this increase, not administrative inconvenience, and the necessity for granting this increase was greater in the case of those persons who were receiving the present pension than in the case of those who are now going to get a little more in order to bring their pension into line with those who had nothing. I want to make a suggestion now to the hon. the Minister. It is impossible for the pensioners to make ends meet on their pensions. I accept that it is difficult to administer the scheme when the pensions paid to various social pensioners differ, but I am going to make a suggestion to him which will overcome the difficulties of the pensioners to some extent. Instead of giving a money grant I am going to suggest to the Minister that food vouchers to the value of R2.50 be given to the 26,000 pensioners who are actually living on the bread-line. These food vouchers could be split into small units so that they can be used particularly for food and clothing. Those are the two items which the pensioner requires more than anything else. If these pensioners can get these food and clothing vouchers it may just enable them to make ends meet with very, very great difficulty. I told the Minister last year how difficult it was to live on this pension. I explained to him that half the pension had to go towards rent and that very little was left for anything else. I do not propose to go into those various details again, but I want to emphasize that rents have gone up even in the very poor quarters in which the average pensioner lives. In many cases the pensioners are unable to meet these rents. The latest thing is for a couple of male pensioners to share their room so as to halve the cost of the increased rental. These rooms are very, very small. Some of them are little cubicles in backyards, but pensioners are now starting to share these rooms. Sir, this is not good enough and I ask that some assistance be given to these people.</p>

<p>There is another vital issue that we raise in our amendment. Provision is made under the Social Welfare Vote for an amount of R623,500 for subsidies to homes for the aged and infirm. It sounds like a lot of money to pay out on subsidies, but the previous year the subsidy amounted to R714,000. There is actually a drop of close to R100,000 in the subsidy to homes for the aged and the infirm, and it is these very homes which are trying to accommodate more of these old-age pensioners who are unable to look after themselves. They are trying to do more and more for these people. The hon. the Minister told us a few days ago, in answer to a question by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield), that these homes have now lost the grant that they were getting from the lotteries in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. In those circumstances particularly this subsidy should never have been reduced because these homes are going to find themselves extremely short of funds in the future. Demands will undoubtedly be made to the Minister for increased grants and I ask the hon. the Minister in all sincerity to deal with these demands as sympathetically as he possibly can. We must not put it off because these people are waiting cap in hand for help. In the past they have been given ambulances; in the past they have been given monetary grants apart from the lotteries. These are all matters which are now lost to them. Who is going to provide them&#x003F; The old-age pensioners cannot give anything. The churches are doing their best and the welfare organizations are doing their best already. It is up to the Government in this time of prosperity. We have money for other things; we have large amounts for armaments. We have enough money at least to put sufficient away for these people. I read in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report that 1,100,000 cartridges were stolen from the army. We read that it is a loss of R59,000. Do we realize that every one of those cartridges represents at the very least a loaf of bread, that there would have been over 1,000,000 loaves of bread that could have been bought by means of my suggestion of coupons&#x003F; Taking that each pensioner uses two loaves of bread a week there would have been enough bread for the pensioners for two months, just on that one item alone.</p>

<heading>Statement by S.A. Ambassador in the U.S.A.</heading>

<p>The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS replied to Question No. *XVIII, by Mrs. Suzman, standing over from 20 March.</p>

<question by="#suzman" to="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to (a) a statement reported to have been made by the South African Ambassador to the United States of America, on 25 February 1964, in regard to a report stated by him to have been issued by the South African Medical Association in December 1963, on the conditions of detainees and (b) a denial issued by the Secretary of the South African Medical Association on 18 December 1963, in regard to the report referred to; and</li>

<li>(2) whether the Ambassador has been informed of this denial; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs" to="#suzman">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) Yes. The Ambassador&#x2019;s statement was based on a report which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 15 December 1963 the opening paragraphs of which read as follows:

<ul>

<li>The South African Medical Association has conducted a full inquiry into conditions in prisons, and is satisfied that allegations of maltreatment are unfounded, Dr. A. H. Tonkin, Cape regional representative of the association, told me to-day.</li>

<li>Unless new evidence about 90-day detainees could be produced on the medical and psychological effects of such detention, the <span class="col_3533-3534" refersTo="page_0459"/>association could not&#x2014;and would not&#x2014;be drawn into a &#x201C;political controversy&#x201D; over the matter, he said.</li>

<li>Dr. Tonkin said that at the invitation of the Department of Prisons, doctors visited prisons and made full inquiries into conditions there.</li>

<li>They made these investigations after allegations of maltreatment of prisoners. The prison authorities allowed doctors to see everything they wanted.</li>

<li>Doctors found that allegations of maltreatment were completely unfounded. On the contrary, they felt &#x201C;embarrassed&#x201D;.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>(b) Yes. It was brought to my notice as a result of inquiries made by my Department.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) Yes, only since he made the statement referred to in the question. It should be noted that the denial affects only one of the three grounds on which the Ambassador refuted certain grave allegations and that his refutation therefore continues to be valid.</li>

<p>First Order read: Resumption of debate on motion for House to go into Committee of Supply and into Committee of Ways and Means (on taxation proposals).</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Finance, upon which an amendment had been moved by Mr. Waterson, adjourned on 23 March, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned last night I had told the House that we should make every effort to stay in the World Health Organization. I went on to make suggestions to the Minister as to how I felt he should act and do his utmost to help the pensioners, especially those living on the borderline, and I made the suggestion that he should issue monthly vouchers to these pension cases so that they could change these vouchers for food or clothing.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to another very important matter which I think everybody in this House realizes has to be adjusted. I refer to the means test. The means test was introduced here in its present form almost 12 years ago. During this long period we have not had any changes in the valuation of this means test, and I feel that the time has come that we should review the present means test set-up and see whether we cannot alter it and make it more realistic and bring it into line with present-day cost of living and with the real position and the present real value of money. Unfortunately, Sir, the means test affects those people who need help most, and what was good and valid ten to 12 years ago <span class="col_3543-3544" refersTo="page_0464"/>is of no real value to-day when it comes to putting up a barrier and preventing certain people from getting what we consider to be a pension to keep alive. That is what it means, that they are going to be kept alive by the pension that the Government is granting. The means test cannot be fixed for all time. It has to be altered from time to time and has got to keep pace with the changing values of our economy and the value of money. We have failed to do that during the past ten to 12 years. We have raised pensions, we have given more money to the pensioners, but those who did not get a pension ten or 12 years ago are still not getting a pension. Sir, there are too many borderline cases to-day that are being refused pensions because of this insurmountable barrier, and we in this House have to make up our mind to break this barrier down so as to allow more people to get the pension, people who deserve it. Because a person, as has been said over and over again, happens to be thrifty and manages to accumulate a small property or a small amount of cash, that person is debarred from a pension, and it is making that particular person worse off than a person who has nothing at all. The person is worse off, because unless he sells his property, or realizes his small little capital, he cannot get a pension. How are we going to help these people&#x003F; The fear of bringing down the value of the means test is that we may let in too many people into the pension scheme and that it may cost the Government too much money. Mr. Speaker, we have got so much money for defence; we must find money for these deserving people. They are our defence as well. They belong to us. We must look after them. We have got to do something, and the least that we can do, if we cannot do away with the means test entirely, is at least to make it more realistic. Let us give these people a chance to keep going. I do not know, and the Minister does not know, how many people should receive help. We do not know in this House to what extent we should alter the means test. The time has come&#x2014;as a matter of fact it should have been done years ago&#x2014;to institute an investigation immediately to see how we can alter this means test, how we can alter it in such a way that many of the people who have applied during the past few years for pensions, and have been refused because they are borderline cases, can be given a pension. We must find out how many of these people there are. The Minister&#x2019;s Department has got a lot of details that will give us a basis on which to work, and from there we can work out how many borderline cases we have got and how many more people we will probably let in into our pension scheme. It may be 10,000, it may be 50,000. We do not know. But I do know that we must do something immediately. It has got to be a drastic alteration. There are too many people who write to the papers, there are too many people who appeal to Members of Parliament and too many people who go direct to the Minister and his Department appealing for pensions, and the time has come for us to do something about it. If pensions can be raised from time to time, so the means test must be altered in favour of the pensioner so that he will be let into the scheme. The ideal would be naturally for us not to have the means test at all, but until that happy day comes we must make provision for those people whom we think ought to be allowed to receive a pension from our Government.</p>

<p>In the few minutes that I have got left there is one other matter that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister and that is the rise in pensions that he has given to the Coloured people and the Bantu people. It is quite unrealistic. It comes to a matter of 14 cents per day to a non-White. Now it is difficult with our present cost of living to spend the 14 cents. In other words if a man wants to use up some of this morsel that is being granted to him from the rich man&#x2019;s table, he would probably have to wait four days; he would have to accumulate this increase for four days before he would be able to buy half a loaf of bread. Taken on the whole it is all ight, but if you take it from day to day the amount that has been granted to the pensioners is so small that it becomes almost negligible. I would say to the hon. Minister that when he makes a rise in pensions he should not do it proportionately, because the proportions are so terribly small that they become negligible for the very, very lowest of our income groups. If he raises the pensions he should raise them realistically and give those people a little more than this cent a day. The cent a day is welcome to them, but how they are going to spend it is another thing, and as I say, they have to wait several days before they can accumulate these extra cents to buy something.</p>

<p>I want to appeal lastly to the Minister to take into consideration the scheme I put forward at the beginning of the year in which I asked him to build in every new township, to make provision in every new township, houses for the infirm and the aged. Sir, voluntary organizations have done their level best to cope with this demand, but it is a special type of housing that is needed, it is a special type of accommodation that is needed, and for that reason I have found that the voluntary organizations cannot provide sufficient accommodation. There are too many of our old people who are infirm, too many of our old people who have become crippled with arthritis and disease who cannot get accommodation in these homes that have been provided ostensibly for all the ill and old people, or should I say the old people who are ill. I ask the hon. Minister to go into this matter and see if he cannot provide in every district at least one home that can accommodate 10 to 15 people and have somebody in the home to look after the infirm. I am sorry that my allocated time is up and that I cannot proceed along these lines, but perhaps <span class="col_3545-3546" refersTo="page_0465"/>one of the other members on this side ol the House will continue where I leave off.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) raised some very important matters here, of which the means test was one. I should like to remind the hon. member that the Government has from time to time given some relief as regards the means test. It goes without saying of course that all of us are very sympathetically disposed to less privileged people, and that hon. members on both sides of the House will always plead for increased social pensions. But one thing is very clear: I do not think there has ever been a Government in South Africa that has done more for the less privileged people than the present Government and the present Minister of Finance. There are other hon. members who will reply to the hon. member on the points made by him. I should like to refer to a small group of people who have unfortunately not been dealt with under this Budget, and they are the little group of physically disabled persons on social welfare settlements. These people have been overlooked in various Budgets, and I should like to urge the Minister of Finance to give particular attention to these people. On those closer settlements such as Sonop, Karatara and Ganspan we are dealing with people who are called chronic invalids. The Minister of Social Welfare has introduced certain classifications, and that has resulted in certain people having become entitled to these increased pensions at Sonop, among them certain war veterans and certain people who are entitled to old-age pensions, while a small proportion of the people on this settlement do not receive it now, and they are those very people, the physically disabled people. I have already spoken to the Minister as well as to the Minister of Social Welfare and I hope there will be the requisite funds to label these people with the same tag, so that they will also participate in these increased pensions.</p>

<p>However, I have risen to deal with an entirely different matter. During the recent Budget debate, agricultural matters have probably been discussed to a greater extent than in any other previous Budget debate. Farming in general, animal husbandry, agriculture and various branches of the agricultural industry have been discussed here. Soul-stirring pleas have been made in connection with the ravaging drought in our fatherland which has had catastrophic consequences for our farmers. I am thinking of the hon. member for Groblersdal and the hon. member for Waterberg who have painted the moving scenes in those afflicted areas. This drought is worse than the drought of 1933, and we are grateful to the various Departments of State for the sympathetic manner in which they are acting to assist our people. I should like to say that in my own constituency the tobacco farmers have been hard hit as a result of withering droughts and destructive hailstorms and blistering heatwaves, and I have felt that I should avail myself of the opportunity to-day to draw the attention of the Minister to the position of the tobacco farmers. I know the Minister of Finance will not take it amiss of me, for the Treasury is one of the largest shareholders in this industry. In order to place the tobacco industry on a healthy economic basis once and for all, it is necessary that at least five requirements should be satisfied. A first important requirement is that the Government, and more particularly the Minister of Economic Affairs, should take immediate active steps against what we regard as undesirable and unfair imports of tobacco leaf and cigarettes to the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Not only do I smoke, Mr. Speaker, but I also take snuff. I should like to say that the farmers are deeply concerned about the ever-increasing importation of tobacco products, particularly from Southern Rhodesia. From 1957 to 1963 the imports of tobacco rose to 44.4 per cent, and at the present time it already amounts to 22 per cent of the total national consumption of tobacco products in the Republic of South Africa. The farmers are very concerned about this, for they concentrate upon their own domestic market; there they are still receiving economic prices, and if imports are to collar this domestic market, it goes without saying that they will be saddled later on with supplies of tobacco that cannot be sold and chronic gluts, which will then have to be exported at much lower prices than can be obtained in the domestic market. I think the principal cause of these unfair and undesirable imports is the disparity between customs tariffs prevailing between Southern Rhodesia and the Republic of South Africa. I do not wish to be reproachful; I know the trade agreement is refused to the Republic of South Africa, but I should like to appeal to the Minister of Economic Affairs that when the trade agreement expires, he should try, in a very nice, tactful manner, as he always does, to rectify this matter, so that the customs tariffs can be equalized between Rhodesia and the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>I just want to show the distorted and unfair customs structure between the Rhodesias and the Republic. If we export one pound of tobacco from the Republic to the Federation, 50 cents customs dues are levied, and when it is imported into the Republic from Rhodesia, it is only 35 cents. When we export cigarettes to Rhodesia, the customs duty is 112.50 cents, with an additional 15 per cent <i>ad valorem,</i> and when cigarettes are imported into the Republic it is merely 35 cents. It is a completely <span class="col_3547-3548" refersTo="page_0466"/>unequal, almost distorted customs duties structure, and we hope it will be rectified. But I should like to appeal to the Minister of Finance himself in particular, and say that there is a second very important requirement to make this tobacco industry completely sound and that is that a Minister of Finance should see to it that the tobacco industry is never taxed to the hilt, but that he should always apply a judicious excise duty. I do not wish to be reproachful. I should like to admit at once that our present Minister of Finance has always been sympathetically disposed towards the tobacco farmers. He has never come forward with an increased excise duty, although his predecessors did so. But I should like to make it very clear here that the tobacco farmers in recent times have gone through a very critical time, particularly in consequence of the high and burdensome and almost excessive duty announced in the Main Estimates of 1958. That was an excessively high duty. I do not wish to make reproaches, but successive Ministers of Finance, those of the United Party too&#x2014;in this connection I am thinking of Mr. Hofmeyr and later on Minister Havenga and Minister Naude&#x2014;were all firmly under the impression that when it comes to excise duties, one can never reach saturation point as regards excise duties, and that consumption will virtually never reach saturation point. They reasoned that if you tax tobacco, there will be a drop, but it will not be something worth mentioning, and it will recover immediately, and you will once again have a rising graph, and eventually you will once again have normal consumption. That is what they thought. But what happened after 1958&#x003F; The consumption of tobacco and cigarettes and tobacco products dropped to a disturbing extent. The consumption did not increase, but for a long time it not only remained static, but even dropped. From 1957 to 1963 kiln-dried tobacco alone dropped by nearly 4,500,000 lb., and that is a very serious matter, for now not only imports are collaring the domestic market, but the increased excise duty also results in reduced consumption. This has caused deep concern in the domestic market, where up to now fairly economic prices have been obtained. So I should like to take this opportunity to say that I think we should be very cautious here as regards the tobacco industry. After the increased duties were introduced, we experienced a period of stagnation, but later on it even dropped, and I should like to quote the figures to the Minister. The excessive duty was introduced in 1958. People thought consumption would recover immediately. But even the revenue from excise duties shows that consumption for the first time remained static and that consumption virtually reached saturation point. The excise duty also became static. In 1961 the Minister collected, in the form of excise, R64,150,618 from cigarettes, and more than R5,000,000 from pipe tobacco. The next year, 1962, it was R46,032,000 from cigarettes, even less than the previous year and the next year it was only R46,036,000 too. There you have three successive years, and it shows incontrovertibly that for the first time in the history of the tobacco industry we have had such a depressingly high duty that our excise duty has virtually reached saturation point. That should be a note of warning to the Minister, for he knows it is a very attractive source of taxation. It is the goose that lays the golden egg. Had we not introduced the high duty, and had we had a judicious duty, we would have had a much better result, and we would have been collecting exactly the same excise duty to-day, but then we would not have given the industry such a hard knock.</p>

<p>Yes, I support the industry; I do not support the United Party though. I should like to say to the Minister of Finance that not only the excise duty has become an imminent danger. Fortunately, after three-four years consumption is now recovering and there are signs that there is an increased consumption in our country, and we are thankful for that, but the Minister really must not regard that as the green light to come along with a new onslaught now.

<p>Yes, the hon. member will hear me, but some people hear but do not understand. Now I should like to come to the third requirement. To put the tobacco industry on a sound economic basis once and for all, it is necessary, and the manufacturers should see to it, that they produce a cigarette within a short time that will ensure 100 per cent safety against all noxious ingredients in tobacco smoke. There are many people who are stampeded, in the same way as the hon. member who interrupted me, people who are stampeded by the report of the American Medical Commission of Inquiry into smoking habits as a possible cause of lung cancer. Do you know what those people are demanding&#x003F; That the tobacco factories should be closed down, and that the tobacco industry should be destroyed. I think that is senseless, because there are indications that within a short while the smoking habit will be 100 per cent completely safe.</p>

<p>The hon. member surely has very little confidence in science. I should like to give the hon. member the assurance that research has helped the farmers to survive one crisis after another, and I am confident that we shall shortly be producing in South Africa a typical South African cigarette consisting of 100 per cent South African tobacco leaf, which will provide 100 per cent safety, also to that hon. member, and which will have a salutary and enjoyable and tranquillizing influence on the uneasy mind of the hon. member who asked me this question.</p>

<p>If the hon. member were to smoke as much as I do, there will not be a glut. They are working on a filter which now already is removing 90 per cent of a certain element, and 60 per cent of another harmful element, and therefore it would be a foolish and senseless thing to want to dismantle the tobacco industry. This tobacco industry is an established industry. It is one of the oldest industries in the country. It is an industry with a tradition; it is an intensely specialized industry, and do you know that there are 25,000 families who are dependent upon the tobacco industry for their livelihood, and there are tens of thousands of small farmers who concentrate upon intensive tobacco farming&#x003F; What is more, more than 150,000 Bantu workers are engaged on those farms in the tobacco fields. Millions of rand have been invested in drying kilns and equipment. Even the tobacco factories are employing approximately 6,000 employees. But the Treasury itself is a large shareholder. From 1960 to 1963, during these four years only, the Treasury derived R211,295,775 from the tobacco industry alone.</p>

<p>No, but the smokers cannot smoke if the tobacco farmers are not there to produce the tobacco. They are indivisibly bound to each other. When I refer to the tobacco industry I see a long chain with various shareholders. I see the farmer and the manufacturer and the smoker, and the Treasury collects its share from each of them. During the first few months of the year there has been increased consumption, and when next year the Minister has a big surplus, it will be due largely to the fact that he will have collected more in excise duties.</p>

<p>But I have to hurry. I should like to make a fourth point, which is absolutely indispensable to place the tobacco industry on a sound basis, and that is that provision should be made for the requisite research facilities. In this connection I should like to congratulate the Government on what it has done, and the tobacco industry itself too, which used funds from the Central Tobacco Board for putting the tobacco industry on a sound footing. What is more, this research helped the tobacco farmers to survive one crisis after another. I remember the time when we were planting the wrong type of tobacco and when a chronic surplus faced us. Mr. Havenga then said we should plant the right type of tobacco, and research helped the farmers, and at great loss we immediately switched over to the new type. Now we do not only have the right type and the right quality, but we are in a position to build up an export market, and last year the tobacco industry already earned more foreign exchange overseas than the wine industry in South Africa. R4,800,000 in foreign exchange was collected. I am mentioning these things because I know the Minister has a soft spot for the tobacco industry and I should like to thank him for being the person who had so much foresight and vision that he made R1,000,000 available for research and publicity, and we are at the present time using this R1,000,000 to render cigarettes so safe that the hon. member who asked me the question need have no fear, but that he can buy a packet of cigarettes immediately, and he will look much better after having a smoke than he appears at the moment.</p>

<p>There is a fifth point I wish to make, and I hope effect will be given to this. It is in connection with the economic survey we want the Government to institute. It is necessary that a thorough and searching economic survey of tobacco production be made as soon as possible. The Minister of Agricultural Economics will recall that in 1954-5 and 1955-6 a thorough inquiry was instituted into the high costs of production of tobacco, but subsequently it was discontinued. What we are asking now is that a full economic survey be undertaken embracing the whole tobacco industry. Those, then, are the requirements to be complied with in order to place the tobacco industry on a sound basis. It will be to the joy of the Minister of Finance, in the interests of the State, as well as being of great assistance and benefit to the tens of thousands of small tobacco growers in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Having just listened to the hon. the Chief Whip I have come to the conclusion that if the hon. the Minister again shows such a large surplus at the end of the next financial year, he will be doing the wrong <span class="col_3551-3552" refersTo="page_0468"/>thing if he celebrates it with a drink. It will be better perhaps if he celebrates it by lighting a fat cigarette. I have seldom listened to such a convincing speech in the interests of the tobacco industry from a man who does not smoke himself. What interests me particularly is the fact that the hon. the Chief Whip is one of the few members on the other side who have actually discovered that there are, after all, a few groups of people in this country whose position is such that they do have cause for complaint. And the hon. the Chief Whip did in fact complain very strongly. I do want to say to him that his remark that the hon. the Minister is always sympathetically disposed towards the tobacco farmers as far as excise duty is concerned, is perhaps not entirely correct. Looking at the figures I find that the Minister expects the huge sum of no less than R61,000,000 next year from excise duty. The Minister may be sympathetically disposed towards the Chief Whip, but if this is the way in which he shows his sympathy with the tobacco farmer then I would rather steer clear of him if he ever decided to become unsympathetic!</p>

<p>What also interests me is the fact that the hon. the Chief Whip has not found it necessary to put forward a similar plea on behalf of the wine producers. After all, the wine industry is another goose that lays golden eggs for the State. But perhaps we should look to the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) to plead the cause of the wine industry. The hon. the Chief Whip also found a few other groups with whose position he was not entirely happy. He said that more benefits should be given to the physically disabled.</p>

<p>I agree with him but I am glad, at any rate, that he realized this.

I am aware of what has been done for the pensioners, but the Government did no more than its duty. As a matter of fact, when we look at the prosperity in South Africa I contend that we are doing far too little for these people. But I shall come back to this point a little later.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the hon. member over there does not realize that we are not going to have an election this year.</p>

<p>This Budget has been attacked a good deal and praised a good deal in the past few days; it has been described in various ways, but I think the description which the Government likes least of all perhaps is that this is a Budget for the rich man. That description is one which I think the Government does not like for obvious reasons, because if ever there was a Government which regarded itself as the protector of the poor man in South Africa, it is the Nationalist Government. There is also another reason, of course, why they do not like that description and that is that they know that it is not entirely devoid of truth. Let us examine the position. The man in the street sees only one thing in this Budget; he knows that he contributed his share towards this huge surplus of R88,000,000. And what does he get out of it&#x003F; Nothing. The man in the street with an income of less than R4,600 gets nothing out of this Budget. But that is not the only way in which the man in the street has been forgotten; it is not only in this Budget that he has been forgotten. I want to point out that the man in the street, both in this Budget and in the budgets of the past few years, has been treated harshly by this Government.</p>

<p>I want to refer in particular to the White Paper, for which one is indebted to the Minister because it is a very interesting document and it contains various sources of information. On the one hand it reflects our economic progress, but what I find particularly interesting is the fact that in this White Paper we see to what extent indirect taxation has increased over the past ten years. When we look at the figures we find that ten years ago direct taxation amounted to R306,500,000 and that ten years later it amounted to R488,000,000, an increase of 59 per cent therefore. Indirect taxation increased from R132,000,000 in 1954-5 to the huge figure of R304,000,000 in 1964-5, an increase of no less than 129 per cent. While direct taxation over these ten years has increased therefore by an average of 5.9 per cent per annum, indirect taxation has increased by 12.9 per cent. And when we look at the last two years, the financial year which has just closed and the next financial year, we find that as far as direct taxation is concerned the Minister in fact expects a decrease of almost R5,000,000, but as far as indirect taxation is concerned he expects an increase of about R20,000,000.</p>

<p>I think there are two conclusions that one can draw from these figures. The one is that as a political party the Government side is only too well aware of the very clever ways in which one can hide indirect taxes. An indirect tax is declared once, it remains in operation for years, and the public forgets about it whereas direct taxation is levied every year, and it is about direct taxation that the public is worried. Indirect taxation is a sort of hidden tax. Direct taxation, on the other hand, is what the Government boasts about when they tell us that taxation has not been increased. Although that is what we are told, the White Paper shows convincingly that there is an increase of ho less than R20,000,000 in indirect taxation. In brief, this indirect taxation is a hidden tax; it is a tax that one pays without noticing it. It is a sort of &#x201C;pick pocket&#x201D; tax.</p>

<p>But there is a second ineluctable conclusion to be drawn from this high indirect taxation and that is that very little distinction is drawn <span class="col_3553-3554" refersTo="page_0469"/>between the poor man and the rich man. The Minister is not unaware of the fact that under the system of indirect taxation the ordinary man, proportionately, is hit much harder than the rich man. Sir, if we lived in a society in which the economic position of our people was more or less the same, then it would not matter much. But in South Africa in particular where on the one hand we have people who are millionaires and on the other tens of thousands living on the bread-line, and even below the bread-line, I believe that any system of indirect taxation should be applied with the greatest degree of circumspection. I do not think the hon. the Minister has devoted sufficient attention to this point over the past ten years, and that is why the poor man is again being hit very hard indeed in the Budget this year. We need only look at the figures. The poor man, who is just as fond of his cigarette as the rich man, is taxed on the same scale as the rich man. He is just as fond of his drink as the rich man, and indeed he does not drink much less, but nevertheless he pays the same tax as the rich man. Take motorcars. The ordinary man in the street is just as anxious as the rich man to own a motor-car; he also has to use petrol but the State taxes him on the same scale as the rich man, to a total tune of almost R24,000,000 on motorcars and an additional R24,000,000 on fuel. And the part that shocks one is that even matches are taxed. The duty on matches is more than R500,000. If my argument is correct that the poor man receives fewer benefits than the rich man, then it seems to me that for every match that the poor man strikes the rich man must strike five matches. That does not seem to be right to me. The fact remains that these people are hit with the same whip; they are being hit hard by this Government which alleges that it is pre-eminently the Government which looks after the poor man. Then there is still the customs duty which in the forthcoming year will produce R96,000,000 and which covers thousands of articles which are used by the poor man as well as the rich man. The poor man pays the same duty on those commodities, but I contend that this duty hits the ordinary man much harder than it hits the rich man. The Government is applying a system of taxation which in proportion to their income hits the ordinary man much harder than it hits the more well-to-do person, and that is why I say that over the past ten years, as the White Paper indicates, this Government has not gone out of its way to help the less privileged.</p>

<p>I should also like to say a word or two about old-age pensions. I have just said that little or nothing has been done for the man in the street. I want to say too that for the oldage pensioner this Budget contains nothing, if anything at all. I am well aware of the fact that over the years the Government has made quite a number of allowances to pensioners, but we are not living in difficult times; we are living in times of great prosperity, and I believe that the people of South Africa are prepared to be taxed so that the old people of our country can share this prosperity. When we think how high the cost of living is and what high rentals these old people have to pay for their small houses; when we think of the thousands upon thousands of complaints which reach members day after day and which appear in the Press from time to time, we realize how difficult it is for these people to make ends meet on a total sum of R27 per month. In many respects the pensioner has to live the life of a recluse, and in this Budget the Government had an opportunity such as it has never had before to lift the pensioner out of his recluse-like existence and to ensure a better living for him.</p>

<p>When we look at the means test we find that the position there is equally impossible. The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fischer) has already dealt with this. We all know that the pension stood at R144 in 1951. The Government then introduced the bonus system. These bonuses have grown over the course of the years to R180 per annum but the basic pension of R144 has never been touched; it has remained unaltered. We now find that, when the means test is applied it is not applied to the whole of the pension, that is to say, the pension plus the bonus; if the pensioner has any assets the means test is applied not to the total pension of R324 but to the much smaller figure of R144 which was fixed as far back as 1951. There are thousands of people who have certain assets but as a result of the application of the test they fail to make the grade. The result is that while they may own a small house they have no income at all. I have been asked by numerous people, &#x201C;If I own a house, does the State expect me to eat the house; what am I supposed to live on&#x003F;&#x201D; We find that old people who have reached the eve of their lives own a small house&#x2014;a fact for which we should be grateful to them, because the people who built houses for them-selves are the people with a sense of responsibility&#x2014;but they have no money to live in that house. I think this position should be radically changed because it reflects no credit on a prosperous country like South Africa. Sir, I do not want to say much more about the question of house-ownership. I personally came across a case where within the space of two or three years the value of a house had doubled. Here we had a man who, when he was 65 years of age, said that he was healthy enough and that he did not propose to apply for an old-age pension because he was still able to work. At that time his house was worth, let us say for the sake of argument, R4,000, but five years later, when he was 70 years of age and no longer able to work, he wanted to apply for an old-age pension. But during those five years the value of his house had doubled to R8,000, and after he had done his duty all those years he was told by the State: &#x201C;Your house is worth so much now that you do not qualify for an old-age pension.&#x201D; Let me add at once that when the Department of Social Welfare saw this case in its true light, after I had <span class="col_3555-3556" refersTo="page_0470"/>explained the position to them, they were prepared to co-operate; this man has now been given a pension, but there must be many similar cases in South Africa where the people concerned have not been given this assistance and where they are living under the most impossible conditions to-day. I do not think anybody with any sense of values can really believe that our old people are well off on R27 per month. In addition to that we must bear in mind that these old people also have to pay indirect taxes&#x2014;and here I am thinking of wireless sets which are sometimes their only source of enjoyment. They pay just as much for their licence as the wealthy man does. The licence fee is a high one, and what do they get for it&#x003F; This is a matter in which born sides of the House should support the hon. member for Rosettenville and ask the (government to appoint a commission as soon as possible to examine the means test as it applies to the old people of South Africa so that our old people can once again lead decent lives.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) has done his best to convince us that the Government is over-taxing us. It is scarcely necessary to say that he failed hopelessly. In spite of everything he said it still remains a fact that South Africa is one of the countries with the lowest scale of taxation in the world and that our people believe that as long as this Government remains in power they will not be over-taxed.</p>

<p>But I should like to come back to the matter which was touched upon by the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter). Let me say at once, before hon. members overwhelm me with questions, as they did the hon. member, that I am not a smoker and that I have no monetary interest in the tobacco industry. I can say, however, that I am particularly impressed with the great perseverance of the tobacco farmers; I am particularly interested in their modern methods and in the success they have achieved, and I am sure that like myself everybody else is very proud of the progress made by our tobacco industry, which has established itself in many parts of the world and which has put South Africa&#x2019;s name on the world map. But after all these achievements on the part of our tobacco industry we now find that an almost world-wide propaganda campaign has been launched against the use of tobacco. The position is so bad that in certain circles people are even urging that legislation be passed to prohibit the use of tobacco. They base their demand on the assumption that cigarette smoking supposedly causes lung cancer. This assumption has naturally frightened almost everybody except the heavy smoker. Like many other people, however, I realize what tremendous harm this campaign causes not only to the tobacco farmer but also to the industry and to the workers in the factories, and I believe therefore that the time has come to sound a warning note against overhasty conclusions and against possible unnecessary action. I ask myself therefore, as many others have asked themselves before, whether cigarette smoking really causes lung cancer. I contend that as yet this question has by no means been answered scientifically and irrefutably. There is a great difference of opinion amongst world-famous scientists and I believe that a great deal of research will still have to be done before we get the answer to this question. There are large groups of learned people who are rather inclined to believe that lung cancer is caused by a virus. There are some people who believe that it has something to do with our eating habits. Others believe that the greatest role in the causation of lung cancer is played by hereditary qualities. In recent times attention has been given to the possible consequences of contaminated air, and the question now being posed is whether air contamination does not play a major role perhaps in causing lung cancer. I believe that the answer lies in a number of factors and perhaps combinations of factors, but I am perfectly certain that lung cancer is not caused by just one factor that we can conveniently single out as the sole cause. It has definitely not yet been proved convincingly that cigarette smoking plays any role at all in the causation of lung cancer. That is something which first has to be proved, and once it has been proved it will still have to be established to what extent it bears any relation to other possible causes. That is why I say that we should not simply allow ourselves to be stampeded and that we should not go so far as to hang a suspected accomplice and then allow the real murderer, which might perhaps be air pollution, to go scot-free. The fact that this danger does exist is proved very clearly by a report issued recently by a group of German scientists, all members of university staffs. These scientists are attached to seven different universities and institutes and they worked under the leadership of Dr. Reinhardt Poche of Dosseldorf and Dr. Kneller of the University of Bonn. After years of study they have come to the conclusion that cigarette smoking does not cause lung cancer. They are rather inclined to believe that lung cancer is caused by air contamination by industries and motor-cars. They made extensive experiments.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into details but I want to mention just one experiment as an example. They divided the population into occupational groups and they came to the conclusion that the incidence of lung cancer was highest amongst those persons whose work is associated with modern traffic&#x2014;chauffeurs, bus drivers and traffic officers who continually inhale gases discharged from exhaust pipes. The next group consists of those people who are employed in industry and who come into contact with dust and who constantly inhale air contaminated by smoke. They checked all the various groups until they came to the group which comes into contact with contaminated air least of all, that is to say, persons who work in offices and in homes. Their finding was that the death rate from lung cancer was lowest amongst this <span class="col_3557-3558" refersTo="page_0471"/>particular group, but what is important is that these are the very people who are the heaviest smokers. This group of scientists established that the average age at which one contracted lung cancer was from 55 to 60 years and they found that this figure had remained constant from 1908; but what is important is that they also found that that figure had remained constant in the case of the non-smoker, the light smoker as well as the heavy smoker. Well, if cigarette smoking plays such a big role in the causation of lung cancer then surely one would expect a slight variation in this figure; one would expect the heavy smoker to contract lung cancer at an earlier age. They came to the conclusion that cigarette smoking had nothing to do with lung cancer. Professor Poche, who was in charge of this investigation, concludes his report on this note&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the basis of the results of the many years of our investigations I must find that as regard the spreading of cancer of the lungs, smoking has by no means the significance which has been attributed to it. Of course, tobacco contains a number of cancerogenic substances. These minute quantities, however, in view of the abundance of cancerogenic substances in contaminated air, play only a subordinate role.</block>

<p>On another occasion he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I myself am convinced that cigarette smoke is unhealthy, but I also know that it has no bearing on the origin of lung cancer.</block>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to note that Professor Tybus of Newcastle, England, has worked out that in England where 180,000,000 tons of coal is burnt as against 11,000 tons of tobacco, the amount of carcinogene benzpyrene discharged into the air as a result of the burning of coal is 1,500,000 lb. as against only 8 lb. in the case of tobacco.</p>

<p>In the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Prevention of Air Contamination Dr. Halliday of the C.S.I.R. says on page 11&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The graphs in England and America indicate that lung cancer occurs mainly in the larger cities. It is interesting to note that persons who come to South Africa from England are more susceptible to lung cancer than persons who live in South Africa. This tendency rises in direct proportion to the length of their period of residence in England. In South Africa the area with the highest incidence of lung cancer is the city of Durban. Durban&#x2019;s figure is almost double that of Port Elizabeth and it continues to rise.</block>

<p>Other research workers in South Africa agree with this finding. Their finding too is that the rate at which lung cancer increases in the Republic, just as in countries abroad, is determined by the size of the particular industrial centre. According to our own Department of Census and Statistics it appears that the aver age number of deaths due to lung cancer in Bloemfontein is only 4 per annum. According to the population figures one would therefore expect the figure in Durban to be 12 or 13 but in actual fact it is 48. There are many persons who believe that this is an indication that air contamination might well be responsible for the increased incidence of lung cancer, particularly when we look at the figure for Bloemfontein which has a dry, clean air and which is not a large industrial city. The graph over the period from 1940 to 1961 indicates very clearly that the death rate due to lung cancer in the cities of Johannesburg and Durban increased twice as rapidly as it did in Bloemfontein and 2&#x00BD; times as rapidly as in non-industrial centres. In his article, &#x201C;Lung Cancer Among White South Africans&#x201D; in the British Medical Journal of 31 October 1955 Dr. Dean says that the Whites of South Africa smoke more cigarettes per head than the population of any other country in the world, and yet according to the 1958 annual report of the World Health Organization, South Africa, in spite of the fact that the Whites here smoke more than people in any other country in the world, has the lowest incidence of lung cancer in the world. In the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of 8 February 1964, Kitchen writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Within the past few weeks a table has been published showing the tobacco consumption per adult in 11 countries. According to this we in England are the most modest smokers of the 11 but our lung cancer death rate is the highest in the world.</block>

<p>He goes on to mention that the average number of cigarettes smoked in England in 1960 was 2,760 per person and in America 3,810 per person, and yet the lung cancer death rate was 481 per 1,000,000 in England as against 203 in America. People in New York smoke the same number of cigarettes per head as the population of Idaho and yet the lung cancer death rate in New York is four times as high as that in Idaho.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have not been trying to prove that lung cancer is caused by contaminated air; it is not quite so simple. On the contrary this problem is far too complex to lay the blame for lung cancer at the door of one particular factor. What I am trying to indicate, however, is that there is still an enormous difference of opinion amongst the scientists of the world. I have tried to show that it has not yet been proved scientifically what the cause of lung cancer is and that it has definitely not been proved that cigarette smoking has anything to do with it. It is true that there is such an assumption, but that assumption is based mainly on statistics and not on scientific research. I have mentioned statistics here which could equally prove that lung cancer is caused by contaminated air. This fact is clearly brought out by the following persons: Let me first quote what Dr. Harry Greene of the Yale University has to say&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_3559-3560" refersTo="page_0472"/>All that the Government has are statistics by a statistical association and the statictics do not mean much &#x2026; At the present time I do not believe that cigarette smoking has anything to do with cancer. I am in favour, however, of continuing experimentation. Somebody, some day, will come up with the answer to the cause of cancer.</p>

<p>Dr. Rigdon of the University of Texas says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has not been proved from a scientific viewpoint that smoking causes lung cancer. I should like to see, instead of statistical studies, the mechanics of how it is supposed to cause cancer.</block>

<p>Dr. Berkson of the Mayo Clinic, the world-famous institution says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The case against cigarettes remains totally unproved.</block>

<p>It should be clear to all of us therefore that we should not simply blindly follow those who condemn smoking but that we should approach this problem patiently and judiciously and on a scientific basis. We do not close industries or factories because various industrial diseases are contracted in various industries. Nobody on earth would try to launch a campaign that we should close the gold mines because mine workers contract pneumoconiosis. Nobody would be so foolish as to launch a campaign that swimming on the Natal coast should be forbidden because sharks claim numbers of victims there. No, what we do is to try, along scientific lines, to establish the cause of the problem and, once having established the cause, we try to cope with the problem along scientific lines. It goes without saying that here too we should adopt the same method. Fortunately we have our Tobacco Research Institute in South Africa, an institution which is already doing research in this connection. This institute is already doing research into the cultivation and the processing of tobacco, the composition of tobacco, the smoking technique, etc. What is very gratifying is the fact that they have obtained the co-operation of Onderstepoort as well as of the University of Pretoria in this important work. I think I am quite correct in saying&#x2014;indeed I am convinced&#x2014;that we will be leaving this matter in safe hands if we leave it in the hands of our scientists. Even the chairman of the Terry Commission, the Surgeon-General of America, admits that that commission gave no final verdict as to the possible effect of filters in cigarettes. Even he admits that this is a fertile field for investigation; he admits that it is possible that the filter may have the same effect as a reduction in the number of cigarettes that one smokes. Here then we have the various lines along which we can tackle this matter in my opinion. I am sure that everybody is grateful to the Government for the fact that it has placed R1,000,000 at the disposal of the tobacco industry for research and I repeat that if we leave this matter to the scientists I am convinced that we shall be leaving it in safe hands.</p>

<p>I am sure we are all indebted to the hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) for his learned dissertation on the causes of lung cancer, and I agree with him that the cause has not yet been proven. I think the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) can sleep for a fair number of years on both ears without worrying about the possibility of smoking being forbidden. It is one of those things which will take many years to prove and in fact it may never be proved because there are so many other factors involved, as my hon. colleague has mentioned. I do not wish to follow him any further; I do not think that this is altogether the forum for a debate on the cause of lung cancer.</p>

<p>I wish to speak particularly on the question of the shortage of doctors. The Government for the moment seems satisfied that there is a shortage of doctors and that the situation is apparently likely to become worse. The Medical Council has made all possible arrangements for importing doctors from other countries, but there is not much of a queue of doctors waiting to come here. In fact few indeed wish to come here. The medical schools have been asked to increase the output and they have agreed, but they have agreed to do this within the limits of their present facilities. The Government have asked them to go beyond these facilities. To this the universities have largely replied that while they are willing to increase their facilities the Government must give them the funds to do so. If the Government is so anxious to get people to qualify as doctors then it must provide these funds now. The present intake can be increased within the next year, because it is usual in each university to take the number that that university can accommodate plus a certain number to allow for wastage the first year. The selection at the end of the first year is strict. Then there is also a group of men and women who come in from the smaller universities to the medical schools and places must be found for them. There are others who have the B.Sc. degree, which fits them to enter the second year. I do not think, judging by the present signs, that the hon. the Minister of Finance is aware that it is possible for most of these medical schools to start the second-year courses, that is to say, the second year commencing in February 1965, with almost the numbers that they will be able to handle, but they cannot handle them unless the funds are given to them to create more laboratory accommodation and to provide more laboratory equipment. The medical schools are stretched to their limit already. If therefore the Government really feels that it has to supply more doctors, it is up to them to supply the funds now. The University of the Witwatersrand, for instance, can accommodate 50 per cent more students if it is given <span class="col_3561-3562" refersTo="page_0473"/>the funds to add the necessary three storeys to its new medical school. It was not the intention of the university to add these three storeys at the moment because they had no funds, but if the Government will provide funds now, these storeys could be added to the building which is at present being erected. The University of Cape Town cannot take any more medical students unless it is given funds to build more laboratories and unless it is supplied with more apparatus. The University of Stellenbosch unfortunately has not yet reached its full potential and can therefore only go a certain distance, especially as it is handicapped because of the fact that it has a smaller hospital at its disposal. Sir, the problem of providing adequate laboratories is an urgent one. It is urgent because the students will be seeking admission next year and, as I have said, they cannot be accommodated. If the Government, however, will meet the universities soon, there can be a rise of almost 40 per cent in the student intake. It must be remembered that the finished product is only delivered at the end of seven years. The universities are handicapped by the fact that they are now reaching the stage when their equipment is obsolescent. They have not been able to replace it; they are short of funds, and I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should make available loan funds to the universities for the provision of costly apparatus and that he should give them a long period for amortization. The purchase of apparatus will not wo sen the problem of the shortage of manpower in this country because little, if any, is manufactured here. Almost all has to be imported. I am told by a university authority that the cost rises roughly by about 5 per cent a year because there are so few people who manufacture apparatus. The University of Cape Town, for instance, has costly medical apparatus worth over R200,000, which has been supplied to it free by the Americans. How long this will go on I cannot say.</p>

<p>With regard to the increased allowance under the new formula, the Government should make more capital available to the universities so that they can build increased areas for their work, play and student amenities. The Government is apparently delighted with the new Cilliers formula for the subsidization of universities but this is a one-sided delight. The universities have certain reservations. The Government looks forward apparently to a perfectly satisfied group of universities from 1964-8, but the universities are not even satisfied to-day. The findings of the Cilliers Commission were based on figures submitted to them by the universities early in 1961, so the figures on which the commission&#x2019;s findings are based and on which the formula is based are already three years out of date. Instead of overcoming the difficulties of the universities, the new formula will merely lift them up a little and they will gradually drift back into further debt until 1968 when the formula will be revised. If at each quinquennial revision the figures are always roughly three years out of date, it is obvious that the universities will never be able to make ends meet. Surely some more practical means could be devised so that there will be a gradual change over the five years and then a revision at the end of those five years, taking into account the growth of staff and the introduction of new faculties. Consider, Sir, the position of the two coastal universities. Both are obviously called upon to introduce faculties of oceanography. The University of Cape Town needs a new ship badly. We must have information not only about the contents of the waters around our coasts: not only must we know what fish there are, where they go, why they die and why they disappear&#x2014;all these things should be placed in the hands of the universities&#x2014;but we must also know what our continental shelf holds. A country with the enormous mineral riches near the surface that we have, riches which are probably unequalled in the world, cannot possibly accept that such riches cease at the high watermark. We know that already because people have found diamonds in certain areas, but it is not only diamonds; there must be many other minerals which ought to be investigated, and this work can only be done by the universities. It is not worthwhile waiting for private enterprise to do it. Surely it would pay the hon. the Minister of Finance to investigate the question of asking the rich fishing industry of the country to help to finance these investigations; to ask them to take part in these investigations, or even to ask the mining industry or the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>I want to turn now to the question of the control of research. The hon. the Minister of Finance has now introduced a further 1 per cent relaxation of companies tax for the purpose of encouraging the granting of bursaries. In 1960 he allowed 1 per cent for technological research and he subsequently widened the scope of the type of research permissible. The universities, short as they are of capital funds, could obtain large sums of money from industry and commerce if the Minister would increase the percentage of income exempt from tax to roughly 5 per cent. One university informs me that they received nearly R500,000 in one year. If the percentage exempt from tax had been 5 per cent it would have received R6,000,000. The Minister will not miss the little bit of tax which would have been collected on this amount.</p>

<p>These universities are also handicapped as far as freedom of research is concerned. They always have to go to the C.S.I.R. to obtain funds. It is true that under the new formula there is a sum of R600,000 which has been thrown into the pool, for so-called free research by the universities but when one thinks of this in terms of the number of universities and the amount of research that requires attention, one realizes that it is a relatively small amount. In any event it is a drag upon universities to have to work at the behest of the C.S.I.R. They all speak highly indeed of the treatment they receive, but the C.S.I.R. <span class="col_3563-3564" refersTo="page_0474"/>Committee members point out themselves that very often they are dragged away from their work to Pretoria at difficult times. In any event I cannot see why the C.S.I.R. should control medical research. Why must the medical schools be tied down almost to a dictatorship from the C.S.I.R.&#x003F; Surely if the councils of these universities, to which the Government itself looks for advice and help, can be entrusted with the training of the youth of this country, they can be trusted to decide among themselves what research they will do. The present system leads to unnecessary delay and makes it difficult for the universities to extend projects over a period of longer than a year or two, it makes their position very difficult and they are unhappy. This is one of the factors which is driving young men away from this country because year after year they see that inadequate funds are provided, whereas that does not apply in some other countries. There is a grave shortage of technological workers in the country, not only medical technologists but technologists in every form, such as engineering and so forth. The Whites have provided and are providing almost to the limit; the Whites are already strained to the limit to provide the professional men, the engineers and the doctors, etc. and they cannot supply much in the way of technologists who must be university trained men with a university degree. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the potential which exists amongst the Indians. My personal experience of the Indians in technological work is that they have a capacity for learning which is on a par with that of the Whites. There is a large pool amongst these people competent to be trained. They can in that way begin a professional type of occupation which will meet the case once put by the hon. the Prime Minister when he said that the Indians could not expect always to be traders. That is quite true. They can provide a large number of technologists. They have the brains for it. Perhaps a similar state of affairs exists amongst the Coloured people. But I have not sufficient knowledge of these people to be able to speak on the matter. I commend to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice that he should as rapidly as possible provide for Indian training in the new Indian University of the highest quality in technology.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to say a few words on the professors&#x2019; salaries. The hon. the Minister of Education yesterday put out his chest and said he had raised the salaries. He spoke as though he was giving them a fortune. He spoke as though that would be the last claim they could possibly make. When I looked through the salaries, Sir, I was shocked. These men are the intellectual elite of the country. They are the people by whom future Cabinet Ministers must be trained. These are the men who have to train the future leaders of the country and what are they offered&#x003F; If we want to stop the drain of our young men away from this country we must show them that at the top of the tree is a prize worth having. That is one of the reasons why the youth, the professional youth of this country, go away. They go away because they see something at the end of the road in this country which is not particularly worth struggling for, they see prizes just as good if not better in other parts of the world. We have to compete in the world market for brains. We have to fight the world market which is short and which comes to us to see what we can spare and we can spare none. I think the professors&#x2019; salaries should be revised very soon.</p>

<p>The course of this debate has unfortunately from time to time been interrupted. Hon. members talk about certain specific matters and then they switch over to other matters. I have been sitting here listening since Friday. In view of the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), it is necessary for me to deal with certain matters on this occasion. Social welfare and pensions have often been discussed, but then the debate was switched over to other matters. In any case, this is the third occasion during this Session that the same subject has been debated here. We have had two motions, and amendments were moved to those motions. The same matters were discussed over and over.</p>

<p>The electorate throughout the country. This matter was discussed on 14 February. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) moved a motion with three legs, that the scale of pensions should be reviewed, that the means test should not be applied so strictly, and that suitable accommodation should be provided particularly for the aged. In the discussions on 14 February the hon. member admitted certain things. <i>Inter alia,</i> he made this admission which has now unwittingly been controverted by the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is true that the present pensions have been increased by this Government over the years.</block>

<p>That is an incontrovertible fact, Sir. The hon. member for Umbilo admitted it, but the hon. <span class="col_3565-3566" refersTo="page_0475"/>member for Maitland denies it. It is true that those pensions were increased. They were increased by 170 per cent by this Government, above what they were during the time of the United Party r&#x00E9;gime. The proportionate increase in the cost of living over the same period was 68&#x00BD; per cent. In other words, pensions were increased to a much greater extent than the cost of living increased. Where do hon. members of the Opposition get the right to accuse us of not having kept pace with the increased cost of living&#x003F; These figures have been given time and again in this House, but nevertheless they continue with this accusation.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member suddenly asks: &#x201C;What about the means test&#x003F;&#x201D; He asks that question because he feels guilty in regard to these increases. The hon. member is a lawyer and I thank him heartily for the admission of guilt he has just signed. He has signed it, and that is the end of the matter. He therefore agrees with the hon. member for Umbilo. The hon. member for Umbilo stated a second proposition. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The private sector collects appreciable amounts.</block>

<p>He said that on the same date. But that is no secret. Hon. members on both sides of the House know that the system on which we work is that the State does not shoulder the total responsibility for caring for all needy people. Hon. members have subscribed to that system for years already, and still do, as I shall indicate in a moment. The private sector collects a tremendous amount of money. I have often said before that I think it is a good thing for us to keep alive the interest of the private sector in regard to caring for the less privileged sections of the population. I think it would create an extremely difficult position in South Africa if we were one day to lose the interest of the private sector in that respect. Why do hon. members not get up and speak frankly&#x003F; Why do they not say frankly: &#x201C;Abolish that interest of the private sector completely and let the State alone shoulder the responsibility of caring for the less privileged&#x003F;&#x201D; Why do they not say that&#x003F;</p>

<p>This year again R2,650,000 was added to the pension benefits, by way of special pensions. That is for the Whites alone. If we add the non-Whites, the total is R3,450,000. Increased contributions have often led to a rise in the cost of living, as the hon. member for Rosettenville said in his speech. Now that was the standpoint of the hon. member for Umbilo on 14 February. On 28 February we had a motion in this House moved by the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter). The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) moved an amendment to that motion. He must have moved that amendment on behalf of his party, or else I do not know on whose behalf he moved it. This was his amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House expresses its concern because the Government has failed to make adequate provision for the minimum needs of pensioners and other less privileged people and the needy sections of our population.</block>

<p>Therefore the Government has to make provision for their minimum needs. Does the hon. member agree that the Government should provide for the minimum needs of everybody&#x003F; It makes no difference how many there are; it makes no difference whether in the course of the years they did not themselves make provision for their old age, in spite of our being so proud that there are still so many people who make provision for their old age themselves. The hon. member agrees that the Government and the Treasury should make provision for the minimum needs of pensioners and the less privileged and needy sections of our population. Provision has to be made for that by the Treasury! Now hon. members of the Opposition have the temerity to say in the same breath that they are not in favour of a welfare state. Mr. Speaker, hon. members of the Opposition talk so inconsequentially that with the best will in the world one cannot get anything specific from them. On 28 February the hon. member for Durban (Central) said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hitherto I have not suggested that the Government should contribute towards the pension of the worker.</block>

<p>That is diametrically opposed to his amendment. Then he goes further and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think the Government should contribute.</block>

<p>In other words, he does not favour any contributions being made by the Treasury to the workers&#x2019; pensions. But on the other hand, in terms of that amendment, he wants everything to come out of the Treasury. Sir, what is to be gained with such propositions and such speeches in this House&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then we had the chief speaker in this debate and his amendment. He talks about &#x201C;planned and increased provision of sufficient funds in order to provide better social services and to improve the position of social pensioners, particularly of the aged and the infirm, by a drastic relaxation of the means test&#x201D;. The hon. member for Constantia therefore still believes in a means test. He does not agree with either of those two hon. members. The hon. member for Rosettenville should tell me if I have misunderstood him. I would not like to misinterpret him. According to what I heard, he, <i>inter alia,</i> said the following in the speech he has just made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we cannot do away with the means test entirely &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_3567-3568" refersTo="page_0476"/>In other words, they want to do away with the means test entirely. But he is the very man who in a previous debate stated that he was not in favour of a welfare state.</p>

<p>I do not want to misinterpret the hon. member. He knows I appreciate the interest he and other hon. members have in this matter. He stated further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The ideal would be not to have a means test.</block>

<p>People in Europe also said that; people in the welfare states in Europe said it, and they also said so in Britain. I studied those systems and found that in Britain, in spite of their welfare services, 20 per cent of the people were not adequately covered by those services. In Britain it is 20 per cent, but it is even much higher in many other countries. Those are the people who do not make a contribution; the State pays their contributions.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia now moves his amendment in general terms. I think that when a matter like this is being discussed and the main speaker moves an amendment with three legs, those three legs should at least be able to stand on their own feet. But in his third leg he merely says that funds should be made available. That is general and vague; he did not expand on it. The hon. member did not say where the funds should come from. He did not say that the State alone should provide those funds. He did not say that the State should only make a contribution to those funds which are to be established. Why did he not suggest a contributory pension scheme as being the policy of his side of the House and be done with it, so that one at least would know where one stood&#x003F; The hon. member for Constantia advocates the same system. He made a long speech and said: &#x201C;There is no policy; there is no planning.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I can quite understand why the hon. member says: &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; When the hon. member for Constantia had finished speaking on that subject, he said: &#x201C;But the planning still rests on the foundation of a means test.&#x201D; I repeat that after this debate had been in progress for a long time, and after this subject had been discussed periodically, we heard nothing more about those funds. We did not hear how the funds should be constituted; we did not hear on what basis those funds should be established.</p>

<p>I have dealt in this House repeatedly, during this year and in former years, with the improvements which have been effected by this side of the House in regard to the position of the pensioners. On 14 February I said that after my investigation in Europe in regard to this contributory pension scheme I found no country in Europe where a contributory pension scheme was adequate to cover everything.</p>

<p>I could not find one. In England, for example, the contribution is R1.06 a week and there are still 20 per cent of the people who cannot be provided for out of that fund. In addition, they still have the comprehensive scheme of the National Assistance Board and the County Council Scheme, and a multiplicity of other schemes which render complementary services. This question of the system has surely already repeatedly been discussed in this House. In 1944 the United Party Government instituted an investigation. They considered the report and said that in view of the nature and the circumstances of our population the system which is still in force to-day should be retained. They said that in view of the composition of our population&#x2014;we have a heterogeneous population and not a homogeneous one&#x2014;the system we are using to-day should be retained. It is therefore United Party policy. Thereafter there were repeated investigations, with the same result. I have given details in regard to the schemes overseas. After everything that has been done we come to the same conclusion, namely that the hon. member for Constantia still wants to retain this system.</p>

<p>I just want to point out what changes have already been made. During the past year subsidies were increased as follows: On 1 April 1961 the subsidy for the infirm was increased from R8 to RIO per month <i>per capita</i>; on 1 April 1963 the grant for furniture in old-age homes was increased from R30 to R90 Der inmate. That was an appreciable concession. In 1948 there were only 25 subsidized homes. The amount on the Estimates in 1948 was R40,300. In 1963 there were 101 such homes and the amount on the Estimates for subsidies was R714,000, and a further 25 homes for the aged are still being built. They will be available shortly.</p>

<p>I want to tell hon. members that, with all the experience I have gained, I would be the last person to get up and say that we have now found a panacea for all these problems with which we are faced. I say with the greatest emphasis that we will always have to cope with this problem, no matter what changes we make, no matter whether we have a welfare state or not. The position in Europe is that they are continually making changes from year to year as circumstances change. I have so often said in this House that this sort of thing is not static. One cannot do something to-day and say it will be permanent; from time to time it will have to be changed. It has to be adapted to the demands and the changed circumstances of the times.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland said that nothing had really been done. I now want to give the figures: In 1947 the means test limitations plus the pensions amounted to R180 per annum; <span class="col_3569-3570" refersTo="page_0477"/>in 1948 k was increased to R240 per annum; in 1951 it was increased to R324 per annum, and thereafter bonuses and special allowances were added. In 1951 the bonus brought up the total pension to R168. That was what the people received. In 1953 it was R216 per annum; in 1954 it was R228 per annum; in 1955 it was R252 per annum; in 1959 it was R264 per annum; in 1960 it was R276 per annum; in 1962 it was R294 per annum, and now it is R324 per annum.</p>

<p>Even when compared with the national income in the Budget I think it amounts to 10 per cent of the Revenue Account in the Budget. It meant an increase of 170 per cent over a period during which the cost of living rose by 68 per cent.</p>

<p>Hon. members have asked me to reconsider these various matters. I want to tell hon. members in all sincerity that I gave them the undertaking that I would institute an investigation in Europe. I have implemented that undertaking. I came back and I have already said twice in this House that in various respects we can learn from the European countries, but they can also learn from us. I was received there with the greatest goodwill. They asked me what we did here, and I asked them what they were doing. We came back with a mass of legislation and literature which we have to study thoroughly. We must try to see what we can find there which is adaptable to our circumstances; we can make use of it. In the same way, they asked us to make certain information available to them. I have been saying for years that the position is not static and will not remain static.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to a question put to me by the hon. member for Rosettenville. He asked me why the amount of the subsidies was decreased by R91,000. I just want to tell the hon. member that infirm people are increasingly being removed from the hospitals as old-age homes and homes for the infirm are being provided. The costs in the hospital amount to R25 per month per person; in the old-age homes that amount of R25 per month is reduced to R10 per month. Old-age homes are being built everywhere in the country. In Cape Town an old-age home will soon be built to accommodate 200 aged people. Many of those old people will be able to leave the hospitals. When they are placed in these oldage homes the cost will be reduced accordingly. The Estimates for next year are based on the previous year&#x2019;s expenditure. It is very difficult to make an estimate. It is difficult to determine precisely how many of these oldage homes will be available. However, I want to reassure the hon. member for Rosettenville. Although the Estimate for next year is based on the previous year&#x2019;s expenditure, the policy still remains the same. The policy has not changed at all. The formula for the subsidy remains the same and the payments will be made accordingly.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to a few other matters. I have already said on former occasions that I came across certain things during my visit overseas which we could fruitfully investigate and then perhaps adapt to our needs. One of those matters is to give old people the opportunity to work longer, old people who are physically healthy. I have said that this was one of the aspects I investigated there. We are busy dealing with that matter. I added that there they have a system of delayed pensions. If a person feels he is still healthy enough to work then he states he does not want his oldage pension at 65 years of age. He continues working. His pension is then delayed, but he receives an increased pension one day when he draws it. That is also an aspect which we are now investigating thoroughly. I have already had consultations with my colleague the Minister of Labour to see how we can help each other in regard to the provision of work for old people who are still able to do a certain type of work. I must also consult the relevant departments. These are not matters which can be decided in a moment. For all these years I have taken hon. members into my confidence. I have said that we are dealing here with human beings, with the interests of the individual, and that we dare not experiment with it. We must make a thorough investigation and be very sure before we make any changes. We must know that those changes will be for the better. That needs much actuarial calculation and consultation with various departments. This is one of the matters which is not now being mentioned here for the first time. I have already said previously that I was dealing with it. The hon. members of the Opposition are much too inclined to say that it is actually they who always take the initiative and then we just follow suit.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) is the first to agree. Now he can perhaps tell me what has happened to his suggestion that the State should make no contributions at all towards social pensions. What has happened to that&#x003F; I have just read it out to him. But let me get to the crux of the matter. There is another matter which I have already said we are busy with, and that is the provision of accommodation for the aged. I have already said that I have gone to much trouble to have this matter investigated thoroughly. I was particularly interested in and devoted particular attention to the matter of the accommodation of the aged in the countries I visited. Something which I liked is the system I saw in Britain and also in other countries, but in a particularly nice form in Britain, and that form rests on two principles. The one principle is that one should get the <span class="col_3571-3572" refersTo="page_0478"/>aged people out of the slums of the large cities. That is a very sound principle. They are brought to new townships, of which ten have already been established around London. Difficulty was experienced in getting these people out there, but a start was made and those institutions made a deep impression on me. The second principle which also made a deep impression on me, and something which I have always advocated myself, is that one should not isolate the aged. When they are accommodated they should not all be put into one township, in a single group. Give them the chance to feel that they still form part of society. Give them the impression that their lives are still of value to us. They are the people who did much to bring us to where we are to-day. I had consultations immediately on my return, and in fact I had consultations with my colleague, the Minister of Housing, when I was still overseas. I also had consultations with him after my return, and as hon. members have noticed, an announcement was made in the Press a few days ago that provision is being made for new housing schemes everywhere in the country at a very fast rate. As he put it, this would not take years, but months. We have already discussed the matter, and our Departments are busy negotiating with one another. We should like to make provision for our old people in all such schemes. Here at Bosmansdam and at every place where there will be such schemes we now want to try within a period of months to establish accommodation for our aged, so that they can be better housed in those communities which will be established there. I have also stated previously that what particularly impressed me was the flatlet system, but linked with this system is the communal centre, so that when these old people cannot care for themselves any more they go to the communal centre in the vicinity where they can obtain meals or anything else they need.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The last portion of the speech of the hon. Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, is one with which we on this side of the House are in full agreement with and which we welcome, and that is in regard to the problem of suitable accommodation for the aged. It is a matter which has in recent times taken a different concept as to previous years whereby these persons were accommodated in large institutions. The system to keep them in the community is an important principle and is one which is welcomed.</p>

<p>However, there are other aspects which we must discuss during the course of this Budget debate and which must be replied to. The hon. Minister has indicated that we on this side of the House do not accept the fact that the present Nationalist Government has from time to time increased pensions. We have never denied that fact. We have always said that pensions have been increased from time to time, but those increases have merely kept pace with the decrease in the purchasing power of money. Indeed the Government would have failed in its duty if it had not increased pensions from time to time. The State responsibility to try and counter poverty among certain sections of our community is indeed a very great one, it is one which we realize must be shouldered by the Government in a responsible manner. We are not unaware of the fact that they have from time to time increased social pensions, but we doubt whether those increases have been commensurate with the decrease in the purchasing power of the money that has been made available to them. Another point is that we also acknowledge the fact that in social welfare work it is imperative that the co-ordination of the State and the Church and welfare organizations should be maintained, and on that particular basis we have formulated our policy on this side of the House. We have never agitated in favour of a welfare state as such, but at the same time no one can deny that an adequate social security scheme is required in South Africa to ensure that security is provided in time of need. We have seen in recent times that President Johnson of the United States of America stated in his State of the Union speech at the beginning of this year that he was going to declare war on poverty in the United States of America. He highlighted social security as one of the measures that would have his attention. No one can say that the United States of America, a country of free enterprise, is now becoming a welfare state. But they are conscious of the fact that security in time of need is of paramount importance in regard to the governing of any country which takes cognizance of the fact that that security should be provided.</p>

<p>There are other aspects which I would like to deal with at some length. But I think that many of the details concerning the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions can be dealt with when the Minister&#x2019;s Vote comes under consideration. However, I can assure the hon. Minister that although he might be a little disappointed that this is the third occasion that we on this side of the House have introduced a debate on matters affecting old age persons and pensioners, that we certainly intend to continue to press further on this particular issue in the interest of those persons concerned until such time as we believe that their position has been sufficiently alleviated.</p>

<p>Let us look at the Budget before the House to see what relief is afforded to the needy persons. Last year in the Budget debate the hon. Minister of Finance said that a special allowance of R2.50 per month for White pensioners, or R30 per annum per person, was being given to that section of the community which had no assets and was indeed the neediest amongst the needy. He said that their need was highest. Now if you look at the Budget proposals, Mr. Speaker, you will find that that section does not receive a single cent in regard to the R88,000,000 surplus in this Budget, and a large number of persons is <span class="col_3573-3574" refersTo="page_0479"/>involved. The most under-privileged section amongst the needy are these persons who have no assets whatsoever, and if you remember the Pension Laws Amendment Act of last year, you will remember that it was clearly defined in that Act as to what limit those persons shall have. For instance the White social pensioner would receive R30 per annum provided he had no other income in excess of R60 per annum, and proportional amounts were allocated to the non-White section of the community. Sir, the introduction of the special allowance system brought about a great deal of disappointment and dissatisfaction amongst social pensioners, because they found that after the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions had undertaken the enormous task of checking these files, only a small percentage of those pensioners qualified for that special allowance. Consequently many of these pensioners were disappointed in that respect. To look at these figures, we find that amongst the White social pensioners, there are altogether (old age pensioners, war pensioners, blind persons and disabled persons) 126,469 White pensioners and of that number 33 per cent have now received a special allowance, viz. 42,457. That means that approximately 84,000 or 67 per cent of the social White pensioners will now derive the benefit of the increased R2.50 per month, from this Budget. It is satisfying from our point of view to know that those 84,000 persons are going to receive some financial relief and benefits from the surplus. However, it is a pity that the increase was not a greater increase, an increase of perhaps R3.50 per month or R42 per annum, which would have meant that the 42,000 persons who have no assets whatsoever and have no other income would also have received a small increase in their pensions. Those 42,000 persons will receive nothing in regard to this Budget.</p>

<p>The position in regard to the non-Europeans is even more serious when one studies the White Paper that was made available by the Minister of Finance. Here we find that these persons are having to live on extremely meagre pensions due to the position of having a proportional ratio of 12:6:5:2 in regard to the various racial groups, and in terms of the Pension Laws Amendment Act of last year they are also subject to another means test before qualifying for the special allowance, and in spite of the various restrictions for receiving the special allowance, such as other income from other sources, being a very small amount of R60 per annum for Whites, R30 per annum for the Coloureds and R25 for Asiatics, we find that a large number of these non-European people still qualified for that special allowance. So according to figures that were supplied to me in reply to a question, we find that in the Coloured community of the 68,957 social Coloured pensioners, some 62,650 received the special allowance, that is 91 per cent. This means that the remaining 6,307, or 9 per cent of the Coloured social pensioners, will receive this year the increased amount of R15 per annum, which is being given to them. As far as the Asiatics are concerned, there are 10,981 social pensioners and of that number 8,079 are already receiving the special allowance of R12.60 per annum. That means that only 2,902 Asiatics will receive anything of the R88,000,000 surplus. Of the Bantu, there is a total number of 317,300 social pensioners and here I have had extreme difficulty in trying to assess what the Bantu community will receive in regard to increased pensions. The difficulty is that whereas in respect of the White pensioners, the Coloured pensioners and the Asiatic pensioners, the various Departments were able to supply figures of those racial groups as to how many received this special allowance in respect of last year&#x2019;s increase, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development is unable to supply any such figures. I understand from that Department that the Bantu persons to qualify for that special allowance last year, had to apply for it, and it appeared that not many of the Bantu persons seemed to be aware of the fact that they could have applied for that increased special allowance last year of R5.10 per annum, and unfortunately, a large number of the Bantu people will now have missed the opportunity of receiving one year&#x2019;s special allowance of R5.10 per annum. However, they will derive some benefit from the present Budget proposals.</p>

<p>So the over-all picture shows that of the R3,450,000 for social pensioners, one has to assess how much will be paid to the 84,000 White pensioners who will receive benefits, and my calculation shows that it is roughly R2,500,000, and for the 6,300 Coloureds at R15 per annum, it will be something like R94,600 and for the 2,902 Asiatics at R12.60 per annum it will be approximately R36,500, an amount of R2,651,500 <i>in toto.</i> The Minister has allowed an amount of R3,450,000 for the increase in social pensions. That will mean that roughly R798,000 will be available for the Bantu people, and basing my calculations on these figures it would appear that approximately 57 per cent of the Bantu people received the special allowance last year, and the Minister of Finance is estimating that approximately 157,000 Bantu will now receive the additional amount of R5.10 per annum. Looking at all these figures, one can only come to the conclusion that this Budget is not providing any relief whatsoever to the neediest amongst the needy, and the final figures show that of all social pensioners of all races there will be some 274,000 social pensioners who will receive nothing of the R88,000,000 surplus, not one single cent. We are told of the great prosperity in this land, and yet here we are going to see a position whereby the persons who are the neediest of the needy have been completely ignored in regard to these Budget proposals. I believe that it is an act of callous disregard for the welfare of these over 250,000 social pensioners who are looking to the Government for some further assistance to help them to fight against the ever-increasing <span class="col_3575-3576" refersTo="page_0480"/>cost of living and the decreasing purchasing power of their money. The more one looks at these figures, the more convinced one becomes that the hon. Minister of Finance should have been far more generous in his allocation of this surplus. If all social White pensioners were granted R42 per annum (and thereby the other racial groups would also receive a further increase), and taking into account an increase of R42 per annum, making it R3.50 per month for the White pensioner, according to my calculation it would have cost the country R5,902,000 instead of R3,450,000, which would have meant an extra cost of R2,450,000. This is less than R2500,000 and it would have meant that all social pensioners of which of all races there are now some 523,707, according to the latest figures &#x2014;over 500,000 people&#x2014;would all have received some benefit and some further assistance from the Government. This is their livelihood in many cases. They are fully and entirely dependent upon that amount of pension. The welfare organizations are having an enormous struggle to assist these people. I know that one of the large benevolent societies in Durban that issues food vouchers and assists the aged with accommodation are having a tremendous struggle themselves to exist financially. They have received financial support in the past from lotteries, which is now being disposed of; they are unable to receive any further financial assistance. I hope that at a later stage the hon. Minister of Social Welfare will make approaches to the Minister of Finance to see what can be done to further assist these welfare organizations.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I replied to a question which had been put to the hon. Prime Minister and gave full particulars.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>It is true that the hon. Minister did reply and said that these matters would be dealt with on their merits, but I do hope that we will get more than that from the hon. Minister. We would like a complete review of the present financial assistance to welfare organizations, a review of the basis of subsidies. In the United States of America for instance, in respect of professional welfare officers who are in the employ of welfare agencies and societies the Government is providing 100 per cent reimbursements of the salaries of such professional welfare officers. Consequently they are able to provide more fieldwork which is a very special part of social welfare. However, I wish to deal with that aspect perhaps at a later date, because I want to stress the position in regard to the present plight of social pensioners and the fact that they should have received something more from this Budget, because these are the persons who are the neediest amongst the needy. Sir, we must have a plan to assist these people. As I mentioned earlier, in the United States, President Johnson has declared war on poverty, and I believe that we can follow a good deal of what is being done in that country in regard to assisting persons who are living in dire circumstances to-day. President Johnson came to the conclusion in his speech to the nation on 8 January 1964: &#x201C;The new Budget clearly allows it, our taxpayers and people surely deserve it&#x201D;. I believe that exactly the same position exists here in our country to-day. We have a Budget showing R88,000,000 surplus. We have persons living in poverty. We know there always will be poverty. It will not be possible to eliminate poverty completely, but it certainly is possible in the circumstances to bring alleviation to those persons who deserve some alleviation.</p>

<p>The other group of persons whom I think will be extremely disappointed in the Minister of Social Welfare&#x2019;s speech this afternoon and also the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s speech will be the persons for whom there will be no relaxation in regard to the means test. Apparently there is to be no relaxation whatsoever in the means test. Time will not permit me to deal with the matter in any detail, and other speakers on this side have dealt with it. However, I want to make a plea to the hon. Minister of Finance to give consideration through the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions to increase the number of social pensioners in South Africa to-day by relaxing in certain instances the means test, particularly in regard to the amount that is allowed as an unencumbered asset of R2,400. This figure I believe is some ten or 11 years out of date. We know of cases where people are living in homes to-day where they have lived for over 30 years. By diligent hard work they have paid off their home and now find that they are not entitled to receive any pension whatsoever, whilst other persons living in a similar type of house because they reached the age of 65 at an earlier date and before revaluation took place in that city, qualify for a pension. He is able to enjoy the amount of pension that is made available to him, whereas the other person cannot receive any pension whatsoever. These people are faced with a very difficult predicament of either trying to exist in the house on a small amount that they might be able to receive from other sources, or to sell their home, and if they sell their home and they have the cash available and are not living in their own home they are only allowed a free unencumbered asset in the case of a single person of R1,200. I believe that these are all matters which affect a large number of people, those who are struggling to live in the lower income group, and I believe that these persons are the ones that should receive due consideration from the Government at times such as these when they find that in spite of prosperity, they can hardly keep going. Prosperity is passing these people by. They are not sharing it in any way whatever. And I think that the State should meet its obligations by assisting these people by making it possible for those who are not wealthy people to also qualify for some form <span class="col_3577-3578" refersTo="page_0481"/>of social pension which will make the twilight of their lives just that little happier.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>As one of the most senior members of this House, I should like to refer to what happened in the House yesterday, when the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) got up and accused this side of the House of having anti-Semitic feelings. Sir, that hon. member is a very responsible member and one with great experience, and therefore one cannot just view this matter lightly as if it were raised by a younger member who perhaps in his enthusiasm raised the matter in this House when it should never have been raised here. I mention this because I am convinced that in dealing with such a deeply human matter it could cause South Africa tremendous harm. If this were just an accusation against some members on this side for having used certain expressions, it might still have been forgiven, but it is an accusation against this side of the House, and as such I fear that the accusation levelled by the Chief Whip of the United Party may be published to the world and cause us much harm. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) has already dealt with the matter very effectively, but I felt that I should state very clearly, and with the greatest responsibility, that we are not guilty of such conduct. The hon. member had not the slightest right to say so, and I want to give him the assurance that no such attitude exists as far as this side of the House is concerned. In fact, I want to go so far as to say that the day when something of that nature rears its head in South Africa it should be killed like a snake, because it can only harm our fatherland. I want to say that since the earliest days of our history in this country the Jewish community has played an honourable role in South Africa. We think of Sammy Marks in the days of President Kruger, and we also think of what the Jewish industrialist, and the business acumen of the Jews generally, means to us in these very critical times in which we live. They are in the vanguard of the people who help to earn the money which enables the Minister of Finance to keep our country prosperous, so that South Africa may live in peace and quiet. We know that we cannot afford not to take notice of what goes on in this country and outside of it. I should like to say that if ever there was a time in the history of South Africa when all the sections of the population, the Afrikaans and the English-speaking people, the Jewish community and every White person in this country, should stand together to help South Africa to prosper and to preserve peace and quiet in a time of crisis, it is to-day. But it should not just remain there. All sections of the population should try to achieve that. Our chance to pass through this period safely depends on whether every man and woman assists our Ministers to preserve and foster a spirit of goodwill. In view of the fact that the communists are very active in South Africa to-day, perhaps more so than anywhere else in the world, we have one weapon against them, and that is to be just and fair to every individual in our country, and our most effective safeguard is to ensure peace and quiet for all sections of our population. If we do not ensure that, and riots and strikes ensue, it will form fertile soil for communist agitation. Therefore I repeat that we need goodwill, peace and quiet in our country. Therefore it is the duty of every good South African to assist in establishing those good human relations in South Africa which will help us to survive these critical times. That is why we are so thankful that the Minister of Finance could introduce a budget this year which reflects how prosperous we are. We know that there are still many needs that should be supplied, and there are so many things which one would like to do if only one had the money. Unfortunately I suppose we will never have enough money to do everything we would like to do, but we are nevertheless thankful for what we are able to do. South Africa&#x2019;s future lies in our ability to utilize our prosperity for the benefit of all sections of the population and thereby to raise the standards of living of everybody. For that, money and work are required, and we have the labour and the money, for which we are very grateful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately things are not going so well in the agricultural sphere. We are suffering from an unprecedented drought to-day. That has already been dealt with very effectively by some other speakers, but I make no apology for again bringing to the notice of the Minister and the Government the drought which is affecting such a large area in the country. I want to point out that whereas only a few months ago we expected a maize crop which was estimated at 80,000,000 bags, that has now been reduced to an estimated 46,000,000 bags, and in large parts of the country the drought still persists. But it is not only the position of the maize farmer which concerns us, but also that of the stock farmers throughout South Africa. There was not enought rain to provide grazing for the animals in the coming winter. I am thinking of the cattle-farmers in the Northern and Western Transvaal and in my constituency, which areas together represent the greatest cattle-ranching areas in the country. We think also of the cattle-farmers in South West Africa, where after years of drought, good rains fell last year and the grass grew, but it has been trodden out, and if the rains do not come soon there will be no grass later in the year. The farmer is facing a very dark future, and I think it is only right to state the position in this House so that the country will realize what the position is. We are grateful to know that the Government is already evolving great plans in order to combat this position. We have great confidence in our farmers. We know how hardy they are and how they can stand up to hard times, and we depend on them, but I think it is just as well to mention it so that they will know that the Government is not unsympathetic and that <span class="col_3579-3580" refersTo="page_0482"/>we are busy making plans here in order to cope with those difficult problems. I do not want to go into further details. I think I have stated the matter as a whole and I just want to mention one final point, and that is in regard to the matter I have already briefly raised in the Part Appropriation debate, namely the system of divisional councils in the Cape Province.</p>

<p>The position is that the farmers are now saying that they rent their farms from the divisional council or from the Provincial Council of the Cape Province. Since 1950 the taxes on farms and town properties in the Cape Province have increased by 152 per cent. In 1950 the amount was R2,495,719, and in 1962 it was already R6,298,882. It is not necessary for me to say much more about it. I have stated the matter briefly, but I just want to add that it is felt that one can only load a person or a province to the stage where the burden can no longer be borne. It is said that it is the last straw which breaks the camel&#x2019;s back, and I am afraid that in the Cape Province we have reached that stage in so far as taxation on property is concerned. If one takes a large district like Vryburg, it contains a large Bantu area which is almost as large as any to be found in the Transvaal, but that Bantu area pays no taxes to finance the building of roads. In other words, the small number of White inhabitants who still live in the district of Vryburg have to pay all the taxes for the whole area, with the result that their burden is becoming so heavy that they simply cannot continue to pay any more. I gave the figures the last time I spoke and I do not want to give them again. I know the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet will also give the House some information in this regard. I just want to say that the time has arrived for this House to give effect to the spirit of Union in the Republic and that we should not seek to shelter behind the provincial boundaries, thereby treating the citizens of certain provinces as the orphans of the State as a whole. I would like to make a serious appeal to members of the House to bear these matters in mind. The Minister has appointed a commission and we are eagerly awaiting the report in regard to this matter which is of vital importance to my constituency and also to the whole of the Cape Province.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I listened with interest to the calm and dignified speech made by the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne), a man whom I have always admired, but he will forgive me if I do not pursue the matter he raised initially in his remarks. I feel that the attitude of this side of the House has clearly and authoritatively been expressed yesterday by the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty), the Chief Whip of the Opposition, and I have nothing further to add. But one thing I do say as a relative newcomer to this House and as a backbencher, that I for one will watch the attitude of hon. members opposite in future with a great deal of interest.</p>

<p>Earlier in this debate the hon. member for Pinetown referred to the million forgotten people in this Budget. He was making a direct reference to the people in the income bracket below R4,599, the average man in the street who is still asking what he gets out of it. It seems to me that the attitude of the Minister of Finance has been one of complacent indifference. His answer I think boils down to this: We are spending R210,000,000 on defence; that is the price of our isolation, we are spending R13,000,000 on the Transkei chasing ideological impossibilities, and we are setting aside another R20,000,000 just in case it is needed in South West Africa for the same reason. But what is the reaction of the man in the street&#x003F; When the boom-blunted perception of the &#x201C;volk daarbuite&#x201D; descends to ground level, I believe that they will want a change in Government, because the Government is losing touch with the man in the street. I do not say that without reason. I take as my basis the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Family Allowances which was released in June 1962, and which has been available for study and consideration since then. The Committee made recommendations to the Minister of Finance, to the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, the Minister of Education, the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services, the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, the Department of Housing, and the Department of Health. Various questions have been addressed to these various Ministers in connection with their attitude to the recommendations made in the report. Their answers have been enlightening but very depressing. I will quote the first question which was addressed to the Minister of Finance. It asked the Minister whether any recommendations arising from the relevant chapter of the report had in fact been considered, and the answer was &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. Then he was asked whether they had been given effect to by his Department and the answer was &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Then he was asked if they were given effect to, what recommendations and what financial benefit has been derived there from by taxpayers each year since 1962. The answer was that there were no direct advantages to taxpayers arising from the recommendations made. This rejection of any suggestion is in spite of the fact that the Committee criticizes the present rebate system and refers to it as a most undesirable state of affairs if the ideal of larger families is to be achieved. Then in conclusion the committee says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To conclude, recognition by the State of the expense involved in raising children is best expressed by explicitly exempting an appropriate part of the family income from taxation, and regarding only the income in excess thereof as taxable income. In this way all concerned clearly understand that the Republic does not attempt to subsidize children but merely recognizes that the ability to pay tax is lessened by the presence of children in the family.</block>

<p><span class="col_3581-3582" refersTo="page_0483"/>The next question was addressed to the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions. It was worded slightly differently and the answer was more encouraging. The question asked the hon. the Minister which sections of the report had been considered and given effect to, and the Minister replied that the first portion of the question had been answered by the answer to a similar question from the hon. member for Umbilo, who takes an interest in matters of social welfare, but in so far as the question is concerned in regard to the amount of money involved which had been allocated by his Department in excess of normal expenditure, and arising out of the recommendations in the report, the Minister said this, that in respect of maintenance grants in the year 1962-3 an additional R123,000 had been spent and in respect of family allowances R7,000, and in the year 1963-4 in respect of maintenance grants R661,000 had been spent, and in respect of family allowances R75,000. According to the report of the Auditor-General, 694 family allowances were paid in the year ended 31 March 1963, involving an amount of approximately R160,000. I am not deprecating this expenditure, but I want to compare it with the amount allocated and spent during the same period by the Department of Immigration in granting assistance to immigrants. The amount of R1,675,000 was spent in this respect. Juveniles immigrating without their parents received up to R120 allowance. No mention is made of the means test, but the money is made available where necessary. It has been said by the Minister that the cost per immigrant, to bring them to South Africa, is approximately R155 <i>per capita.</i> Bearing this in mind, is it not reasonable to assume that an expectant mother, a South African citizen, should receive some direct assistance financially from the State for the new young South African she is about to provide&#x003F; I am not alone in that thought. Professor van Zyl of Stellenbosch University also suggested that the time had come for South Africa to consider this matter. He said: &#x201C;Suid-Afrika moet nou wakker skrik.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The next question was addressed to the Minister of Education, Arts and Science and the answer was a brief one which I wish to quote. The question was the same, asking what money had been allocated, and the reply was that what was recommended in this part of the report has for the past 30 years been an integral part of the educational programme of the Department of Education, and therefore the quesion of additional expense fell away. When one considers the report of the committee on family allowances, one comes to the conclusion that this 30-year plan needs a new look in order to achieve better results. The statement by the Minister this week has thrown a certain degree of light on this aspect and one has reason to believe that many aspects will be improved as the result of the decision of the Minister. But in answer to the question he said that no additional money had been allocated for these various matters. The Committee on Family Allowances itself said that there was a very great need for a sufficient number of bursaries and for reasonable loan facilities. Such facilities, they say, would also make it unnecessary for mothers to go out to work. Meanwhile, what do we find in this Budget&#x003F; As far as bursaries are concerned the amount has remained the same since 1962, namely R26,000, and as far as loans are concerned, they have been reduced from R26,000 to R9,000.</p>

<p>Further recommendations made by this committee were that education should therefore embrace proper training for parenthood. Girls should receive special attention. A gymnasium for girls should be established. Full use should be made of adult education; there should be more free education and free books, and there should be more assistance in connection with university careers. Sir, there are many problems concerning the increase in our White population which only a dynamic State policy can hope to combat. I have no time now to go into details, but there are certain aspects I feel I should like to refer to. I feel we must take into consideration this aspect of increasing our White population.</p>

<p>The first point I wish to refer to is the question of abortions, the large number of abortions and the permanent sterility resulting from them. One estimate puts the resultant loss of White babies per year at 50,000. Then there is the question of sterility. The committee discussed this aspect and as the result of figures supplied from overseas, from the U.K. and the U.S.A., a figure of 14&#x00BD; per cent was given in regard to childless marriages, and the committee concluded that although no specific figures were available in the Republic, this figure could well apply to the White population of South Africa. It seems that the fertility rate is falling although it is offset to a certain extent by the drop in infant mortality, but there are other aspects causing anxiety, according to the report. It says that small families are becoming increasingly more general, even among the working classes, and the report predicts that the Whites will take 40 years to increase a population of just over 3,000,000 to just under 5,000,000. Sir, that is a long time. The third point in this regard is the high divorce rate. The figure is given of 4,000 Whites per annum, and it is said by the committee that 60 per cent of these divorces take place during the first ten years of marriage, the period of a woman&#x2019;s maximum fertility. If one takes into consideration the quarrelling, the discord, the unhappiness, the tension and the ultimate separation ending in divorce, the whole process results in a slowing down of the birth-rate. This, I believe, is closely related to a fourth point, namely the question of the working mother. It is not my intention to deal here with the pros and the cons of the working mother, I believe that it is primarily one of economics in which the State should have an interest. But is the State paying sufficient attention to this aspect of the working mother and what effect it is having <span class="col_3583-3584" refersTo="page_0484"/>on the present generation of children&#x003F; Anyone who is aware of what is going on in South Africa and throughout the world knows that we have a teenage problem on our hands. Does it not result basically from a lack of mother love and care at an important stage in the life of a young child&#x003F; Is the State doing all that is necessary to ensure that sufficient care and attention are given to the children of mothers who have to go out and work&#x003F; I could quote other examples in connection with malnutrition and I could show that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing are not playing the part they could play in this matter. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services is certainly issuing pamphlets giving information and films and papers, etc. telling people what they should eat, but what is the use of telling them that when they cannot afford to buy it&#x003F; And when it comes to the supply of protective foods, the committee itself admitted that the supply and distribution of protective foodstuffs needed investigation. It said that State subsidies should be so applied so as to induce farmers to produce more of the necessary foodstuffs; the householder must be able to buy cheap protective foodstuffs. But what do we find&#x003F; We find that in so far as the farmers who produce the protective foodstuffs are concerned, they are changing their pattern of farming due to the low prices they receive. Surely intelligent subsidization could overcome these difficulties.</p>

<p>One more word on malnutrition. Some of our protective foodstuffs like fruit, meat and eggs are being exported and we find that eggs, one of the basic protective foods, were being exported last year to the extent of 15 per cent of our annual production. But what do we have on the other side&#x003F; We have malnutrition and kwashiorkor, of which we had nearly 15,000 cases reported only last year. As far as housing is concerned, I have not the time to deal with the matter, but I do not believe the Department has given serious consideration to the recommendations made by this committee.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have tried to indicate that the Government is showing a lethargic reluctance in dealing with the vital matters which are not concerned with ideological concepts in South Africa. I suggest that we need a change in attitude and, better still, we need a change of Government.</p>

<p>The speech the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) has just made can in many respects be to the benefit of our country and our nation. It is a pity, however, that he dragged in a little politics at the beginning of his speech. He said he was sure if the Government were to go to the country it would not be returned to power. I am sorry for his sake that he said that because that shows that he is completely out of touch with the public outside and he is a member of a party which is equally out of touch with the public. I am perfectly entitled to say that because when I look round this House and I think of all the time I have been here I only see three members here who at that time sat over there in the corner representing the National Party, the party which is to-day in power on this side. There is a big difference between the Opposition of those days and the present Opposition. The United Party of to-day is totally different from what it was in those days. In those days there were members on the Government side who were absolutely South African in the true sense of the word; they differed from us on certain principles but they put South Africa above everything else. In those days it was still a struggle between Afrikaners on the one side and Afrikaners on the other side, in spite of the fact that the old Unionists still formed part of the then United Party, but what has become of the party who sat on this side&#x003F; The 27 members who sat in the Opposition benches in those days have multiplied to become the powerful Government which is in power to-day. With every election and with every session the United Party has decreased in number. I shall tell you why, Sir. It is because there are elements in the United Party which are un-Afrikaans.</p>

<p>It is because there are members in that Party who refuse to take the oath of allegiance to the Republic of South Africa. You may tell me, Sir, that when we were in Opposition some of us also refused to take the oath of allegiance. That is right but there is a big difference. At that time we had to swear allegiance to a person, to her or her descendants, whereas to-day you have to swear allegiance to your country, South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to go so far as to say that if a person refuses to swear allegiance to his country he should not be entitled to sit in this House. [Interjections.] Exceptions were made in those days in the case of persons whose consciences did not allow them to take the oath in certain circumstances, that was why they were allowed to make a solemn declaration. But there are members on that side who do not refuse to take the oath of allegiance for that reason. When they had to swear allegiance to a person they were prepared to do so but when they have to swear allegiance to their country, South Africa, they refuse to do so.</p>

<p>Very well, Sir, then I shall go on to the next point. It is the policy of our Government and our country that there should be separate development between White and non-White. The Government pays subsidies and allowances to universities and many other institutions in this country and you would have expected institutions which received financial support from the Government to carry out the Governments&#x2019;s. policy of separate development in every respect. But what do we find, Sir&#x003F; In some universities attempts are made to undermine the policy of the Government in every respect. Organizations are formed which try to undermine Government policy at every possible opportunity. Here I have Nusas in mind, for example, a body which has gone so far as to plead that White and non-White should be allowed to live in the same hostel, that they should be allowed to mingle freely on the sportgrounds and in the dance halls. I want to ask the Government when they make allowances to universities to take into consideration whether or not those universities carry out our traditional South African policy.

There is another matter I wish to bring to the notice of the Government, more particularly to the notice of the Minister of Justice and that is the use of knives and the murders which are committed where knives or other weapons are used. Practically every day you read in the Press about murders that have been committed where knives were used and about the big knives that are found particularly in possession of the non-White population of South Africa. I want to ask the Minister whether steps cannot be taken to exercise stricter control over the sale of such weapons or to limit the sale of big knives to people who can prove that it is absolutely necessary for them to have them. I think there were eight assault cases over the past fortnight, according to newspaper reports, where knives were used. In some of those cases non-Whites broke into the homes of White persons and had it not been for the fact that assistance arrived they would have used those knives.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is true that it is the duty of an Opposition to criticize and the Government need therefore not be at all concerned about the criticism we have had of the Budget from that side. I put this question to one of the Opposition members in the Lobby: &#x201C;What criticism are you going to level at this Budget&#x003F; I feel sorry for you because it is a good Budget and it cannot be criticized&#x201D;. His reply was: &#x201C;It is our duty to criticize&#x201D;. Well, the Opposition did come forward with some criticism but in the 26 years I have been sitting here I have never heard weaker criticism of any Budget. Never have I heard weaker criticism from the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), the main Opposition speaker in the Budget debate, than on this occasion. I think in their heart of hearts they are very grateful that the Minister was able to present a Budget such as this one. We are often told by the Opposition the Government should not get the credit for the surplus of R88,000,000; that it is purely due to circumstances that the Minister could show a surplus of R88,000,000. Sir, can you imagine what the position would have been had there been a deficit of R1,000,000 or R2,000,000&#x003F; Would they then have said that the Government was not to blame for that&#x003F; No, then we would have been told that the Government was so bad that there was another deficit and that taxation had once again to be increased. I think the Opposition together with us are grateful to the Minister of Finance for this Budget. In their hearts they are pleased that they too, can enjoy the benefits which flow from this Budget and that we have such a good Government.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_ahee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER AHEE</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to say a few words in connection with a divisional council tax which is known in the Cape Province as the land tax. I need only mention this tax, Sir, and my blood pressure threatens to go up, so you can imagine how those people who have to pay it feel about it. It verily does their physical and financial health no good. I may be told that a divisional council tax is a matter which belongs to the Provincial Council but there are two reasons why I am convinced we may also discuss it in this House. I think the mere fact that colossal amounts are spent by the Central Government in the form of loans, subsidies and allowances to the Provincial Councils, gives us the right to discuss the taxes which are levied by the divisional councils. The second reason why I think we have the right to discuss it is that it is for the Government to see to it that the taxpayers over the entire Republic are treated on an equal basis. When the taxation pressure is uneven in the various provinces I think it is the duty of the Government to see to it that a uniform taxation system is applied over the entire Republic. The Provincial Councils have often considered this matter but they either do not have the power or they are unwilling <span class="col_3589-3590" refersTo="page_0487"/>to take action, and we consequently ask the Central Government which places so much money at the disposal of Provincial Councils, to step in and to see to it that we have a uniform taxation system over the entire Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>We are told that if we plead for the divisional councils to be deprived of the right to levy a land tax in the Cape Province it would mean that we were pleading for the abolition of divisional councils. No, we are not necessarily pleading for that, Sir. But if the divisional councils consider their main function to be the imposition of taxes I say they must disappear. In the other provinces, for example, you have road councils and their most important function is to attend to the construction and maintenance of roads. They do not levy taxes yet they carry out their duty. Why then should we in the Cape Province retain the divisional councils in their present form, i.e., with the right to levy taxes&#x003F; I maintain that we can retain the divisional council system if only another formula could be found to finance them. Naturally all taxes are unpopular but I can assure the House and the hon. the Minister that the land tax in the Cape Province is probably the most unpopular tax in the whole Republic of South Africa. It is not surprising therefore that certain parts in the northern Cape Province have already asked to be incorporated with the Transvaal; it is not surprising that a portion of the eastern Cape Province has already asked to be incorporated with Natal. Those people do not mind to which province they belong as long as they can get rid of this land tax we have in the Cape Province. A large measure of unfairness attaches to this particular tax, but one of the most unfair aspects of this tax is the fact that the divisional councils also have the right to impose taxes within the municipal areas. Your municipalities, your township boards, have the right to levy a tax on immovable property; I have no objection to that but when the divisional councils levy an additional tax on immovable property within that municipal area, I say it is unfair because that owner now has to pay two land taxes. But what is most unfair of all, Sir, is that the less privileged people, the aged who have a little house in the municipal area, the people with a small capital, some of whom do not even have a means of conveyance, people who never use the roads, who do not know what the inside of a motorcar looks like, are forced under this system to pay a land tax. I think this state of affairs in the Cape Province is most unsatisfactory and extremely unfair towards these people.</p>

<p>As far as the farmers are concerned, let me give you an example, Sir, to show you what the effect of this tax is. Supposing there are three farmers, one in the Free State, one in the Transvaal and one in the Cape Province. All three of them own property valued at R30,000; all three have two children. How do the taxes they have to pay compare&#x003F; In the first instance, we in the Cape Province pay the highest provincial tax, but I leave that there. The two farmers in the Free State and Transvaal do not pay a land tax while the farmer in the Cape Province, who is in precisely the same financial position as the other two farmers, has to pay a land tax of R165. When you take the provincial council tax and the divisional council tax in consideration, you find that the farmer in the Free State pays R126, the farmer in the Transvaal R135 and the farmer in the Cape Province R315. I may add that the divisional council tax sometimes varies from one divisional council to another, but that is what the picture ultimately looks like. I can assure you, Sir, that there are many farmers in the Cape Province to-day who pay more divisional council tax than income-tax. The divisional council tax may constitute a small percentage of the total tax but it is not sound. What is more, the divisional council tax does not remain static. The divisional councils try to keep pace with the development of the country. In other words the divisional council tax on immovable property is continually increasing. The hon. member for Vryburg has already pointed out that from 1950 to 1962 there was an increase of 152 per cent. In order to complete the picture I want to give you the following figures, Sir: In 1950 we in the Cape Province paid R2,495,000 in the form of divisional council taxes; and in 1962 that was increased to R6,298,000. What makes the posi tion worse from the point of view of the taxpayer is the fact that the divisional councils are from time to time relieved of the responsibility of maintaining certain roads in the magisterial districts over which they have jurisdiction. Where a road is declared a national road the divisional council is relieved of its responsibility as far as that road is concerned. Last year the Provincial Council decided to take over the construction and the maintenance of all main roads from the divisional councils. Then you have the special roads in some magisterial districts. All those are roads for which the divisional councils used to be responsible in the past. They have now been relieved of that responsibility in spite of the fact that the tax has not been reduced; it continues to rise and rise.</p>

<p>The divisional councils have machinery today which called for tremendous capital expenditure. They have large offices and large administrative staffs. The late Mr. Olivier, a former Administrator of the Cape Province, on one occasion suggested that the divisional councils should be centralized in order to effect a saving in that way; that there should be one divisional council for a number of magisterial districts. As a result of that suggestion every divisional council raised a hue and cry because every one of them is proud and jealous of its autonomy. Nothing came of that suggestion. Attempts were then made to save, to reduce expenditure. Mr. Speaker, there are many reasons why I object to the divisional council tax but there is one thing which has lately worried me a great deal as <span class="col_3591-3592" refersTo="page_0488"/>a farmer and that is that from all sides an appeal is made to farmers to provide their labourers with better housing; The farmer is willing to do so; he wants to do so and he also does so, but the moment the farmer improves the house of his labourer or erects a new house for him, the valuator arrives on the farm and; he values the improvement or the new building and tomorrow the farmer received a taxation assessment in respect of the value of that improvement or in respect of the value of that building. That is indeed no encouragement to any farmer in the Cape Province to improve the housing of his labourers. I trust the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development will also give their attention to this matter and at least meet the farmer in this respect. When we complain about this land tax, we are told that the divisional council system is a very old system. Yes, it is very old but it has become obsolete.</p>

<p>To conclude on this point, I think it is the duty of the Central Government to see to it that we have a uniform system of taxation over the entire Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to refer briefly to a second point and that is the excessively high land prices. Land prices to-day are completely opt of all proportion to the value of the product which is produced pn that land.</p>

<p>No, that has not been the position for years. That is an evil which has only reared its head during the last decade. There is no doubt about it that more than one farmer is in financial difficulties today because he paid too much, for his land. Attempts are made by the Government, through the Land Bank and the Land Board, to bring, land prices more in conformity with the value of the product produced on it. We know that the and Bank even goes and values the land when the farmer applies for a bond. The Land Bank valuator values the land on this basis: What is the productivity of the land&#x003F; The Land Bank does not take into account the price the seller asks. Supposing the Land Bank is willing to assist an applicant to acquire land by granting him a 80 per cent bond on the value of that land. The seller, however, wants a price which is far in excess of the Land Bank&#x2019;s valuation and the result is that the applicant can only borrow 50 per cent or less of the purchase price from the Land Bank. In other words, it is absolutely impossible to-day for a young man to return to the land. Of course I am not criticizing the method of the Land Board and the Land Bank of valuating land and granting bonds and loans. On the contrary, I think they are entirely right. Why should you saddle a young man with a burden which he will never be able to shake off&#x003F; Sir, recently a commission was appointed to inquire into uneconomic units and the sub-division of land; I welcome that, but I say in advance that that commission will come up against problems which will practically be insoluble. It is not an enviable task that rests on their shoulders. While there is such a commission; and while we are all agreed that it is not good for the country to have uneconomic units and that land should be sub-divided into uneconomic units, I want to ask the Government also to appoint a commission to inquire into the reasons for these excessively high land prices and to see whether land prices could not again be brought into line with the value of production of that land.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>There is nothing I would, have liked better than to indulge in a discussion on the merits or the demerits of the divisional council rating system but I have other matters I want to deal with so I shall indulge in that, luxury on a later occasion. I do, however, want to refer briefly to the speech by the hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop). He seemed to lay the charge that there were certain &#x201C;on-Afrikaanse&#x201D;, as he termed it, types of universities developing in South Africa. He made the suggestion that the hon. the Minister might consider some form of financial discrimination against those particular institutions. Well, Sir, I know of no such institutions in South Africa. If he wants to discriminate against these institutions does the hon. member not realize that he will be discriminating against his own people&#x003F; Does he not realize that in practically every university institution in this country there is a large and growing proportion of Afrikaans-speaking students. My information is that of the students to-day at the Cape Town University nearly 50 per cent come from Afrikaans-speaking homes.</p>

<p>I refer to the statement made by the horn the Minister of Education over the week-end. He stated very clearly that he was in favour of universities retaining their autonomy. I now want to know whether the hon. member for Mossel Bay is opposed to the policy enunciated by the hon. Minister of Education&#x003F; It certainly seems like it, Sir. It seems as if the county is lucky that we are not, in respect of this discrimination, dealing with the hon. the Minister but merely with the hon. member for Mossel Bay whose utterances are seldom taken seriously.</p>

<p>I also want to refer briefly to the speech made last evening by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). A speech of a quite different character. That hon. member also differed from a member of the Cabinet. He differed from the hon. the Minister of Defence in regard to the policy of manufacturing nuclear bombs. The hon. member for Heilbron called for the manufacture of nuclear weapons to act as a deterrent, as he called it. Sir, Heaven help the people of South Africa when our position gets so desperate that we have to depend on the manufacture of nuclear bombs in order to try to protect ourselves. It is something quite beyond our capacity. We <span class="col_3593-3594" refersTo="page_0489"/>shall in that event be dealing with the giants of the armament world. It is something in which we cannot compete. The hon. member went on to say that unless steps were taken to counter the threats of intervention South Africa would be in danger. There I could not agree with the hon. member more. That is precisely what we have been trying to tell him for the last three or four years. We have been trying to tell him and his Government that our only effective answer to counter intervention is some practical step on the part of the Government to align its attitude more in keeping with world opinion and an attempt to meet the more basic objections to our policies, those policies which are to-day driving South Africa into a dangerous state of isolation. Sir, it is reckless speeches such as that made by the: hon. member for Heilbron last night, that encourage the very intervention he says he wishes to avoid. He went on to say that he welcomed statements like that made by Mr. Harold Wilson in which he threatens to place an embargo on weapons to South Africa, because, he said, those statements encouraged us to become independent and to expand industrially. When he talks about liking people like Harold Wilson he includes Nkruhma of Ghana, Ben Bella of Algeria, or the Emperor of Abyssinia who is to-day taking a leading part in the attempt to drive the Republic out of South West Africa. Are those the people whom he classes as the friends of South Africa, Sir&#x003F; Does he encourage that kind of attitude in order to encourage economic development in this country&#x003F; What a shocking disregard of South Africa&#x2019;s security, Sir! Especially, when it comes from a member whom the hon. Prime Minister has placed in a position of authority on the fringes of the Cabinet, namely, as a senior member of the Bantu Affairs Commission! The position that hon. member occupies makes that statement of his all the more dangerous because it clothed the statement in a, semblance of authority on behalf of his Government. In his absence I want to ask his Prime Minister whether he agrees with the views expressed by his protege on the Bantu Affairs Commission&#x003F; World opinion towards the Republic being what it is to-day, Sir, I can conceive of nothing more irresponsible than a speech of that nature. Generally it would disqualify the hon. member from serving on a village management board, let alone such an important body as the Native Affairs Commission to which the hon. the Prime Minister has appointed him.</p>

<p>I want to deal with certain matters of defence and, on behalf of this House, I am sorry to do so in the forced absence of the Minister of Defence. We are all very sorry that he is not here to-day and we regret the reason. But I had hoped at least that the Acting Minister of Defence would have been present when we discussed such an important subject, a subject which occupies such a dominating position in the very Budget we are dealing with. In fact, if you take the Cabinet as a whole, the Ministers who are more directly associated with defence matters, are conspicuous by their absence. So I shall address my remarks to the hon. the Prime Minister and the Cabinet through those members of the Cabinet who are present, because what I want to say, in general, is beyond the scope of any particular Minister and covers more; something which calls for a Cabinet decision.</p>

<p>I first of all want to deal with the question of responsibility for defence as a whole. The responsibility for the defence of any nation is accepted as something which rests completely on the shoulders of the Government of the day. That, however, does not relieve the official Opposition, as an important part of the parliamentary structure, from the heavy responsibility which the Opposition itself must assume, on behalf of the nation. That is to take every action that it is possible to take, to ensure that, in our case, the Republic is in fact receiving the maximum possible security benefits from the expenditure which Parliament itself authorizes. It is in the acceptance of that principle, Sir, and because we believe there is evidence that in certain important aspects the Republic is not receiving this maximum security value, that, speaking for the official Opposition, I want to examine certain features in our anti-aggression defence buildup and make certain constructive suggestions regarding important defence matters which we believe require the very early attention of the Government as a whole, and not necessarily only the attention of the Department of Defence. To make it quite clear in order to avoid any future misconception may I say that the official Opposition are not opposed to the voting of this R210,000,000 asked for for defence. That goes without saying, Sir.</p>

<p>As has already been said, we are criticizing the fact that the full cost of defence is being charged against the Revenue Account thereby penalizing such a large proportion of the population of the country which would otherwise have benefited. We also object to the practically complete absence of parliamentary control over defence expenditure which is the largest single item of expenditure on the Budget this year. We believe there is evidence to show that changes in the conditions of service, particularly in the Permanent Force, have failed to keep pace with the rapidly changing demands and increasing responsibilities imposed on the personnel of that force by the acquisition of modern weapons and equipment, to such an extent that the Republic is not receiving the full security these weapons could and should provide for us to-day. We believe a substantial increase in the Permanent Force strength has become necessary together with a much more extensive use of women in certain sections of the Defence Force to handle the instruments and equipment which are peculiarly adapted to service by women. This will help relieve the terrific shortage in trained manpower that is affecting all phases of the Republic&#x2019;s economy. In conjunction with that expansion and in the light of the experience gained by the introduction of these new <span class="col_3595-3596" refersTo="page_0490"/>weapons, coupled with the increasing demand for manpower to meet the needs of defence production, by outside industry, of munitions and equipment, a searching reassessment has become necessary of the military trainees ballotee scheme, especially with reference to the nature and the period of the training service, both in the light of the change in military conditions, and the necessity to avoid unhealthy competition between defence and outside industry for manpower in what one might call &#x201C;key&#x201D; munition positions.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the question of parliamentary control of defence expenditure. The proposals made by this side of the House are fully set out in Cols. 3600 and 3606, Hansard of 29 March 1963. A detailed statement in regard to those proposals will be found in Cols. 2504 and 3606. We then called for the establishment of a parliamentary Select Committee for Defence which will have power and authority in connection with defence matters involving the expenditure of funds authorized by Parliament. We asked that it should have power to call for evidence and papers, if necessary. Also that concurrently with the establishment of such a select committee a parliamentary White Paper on Defence should be issued annually, as is done in other Parliaments where defence plays a paramount part in the security of the country, such as it is doing in our case to-day.</p>

<p>The impact of costs and the uneconomic and inflationary nature of defence demands on industry are increasingly making it necessary for such parliamentary control to be exercised. It is also fair to say with regard to the supply of manpower, particularly trained manpower of the type essential to industry, that such additional control and supervision is necessary. These and the other factors which we outlined previously emphasize the wisdom of our proposal, Sir. Even in the year that is past the change in the general set-up of defence and the increased demands and responsibilities which are devolving on defence have made the appointment of such a select committee indispensable. We now say that not only should it be a select committee of this House but it should be a Select Committee on Defence representative of both houses of Parliament so as to spread the control of defence expenditure more widely, something which we believe is necessary in national interests. Since March last and the present date the Opposition have on several occasions repeatedly made this request. Hon. members will find these in Col. 8602 of Hansard of 21 June. On June 24, Cols. 8623-4, the hon. Minister of Defence said he would see that such a White Paper would be tabled in future. I accept it that the unfortunate illness of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s has interfered with that on this occasion. But we do feel that it is essential and we would ask that the hon. the Minister implements that promise of his on future occasions. Such a White Paper should follow the broad principles of those tabled in the United States and Britain but naturally scaled down to the requirements of our own defence and to the extent to which we would require the information.</p>

<p>On 24 June, the hon. the Minister again offered to make defence information available, in confidence, to certain members nominated by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. We, Sir, are unable to accept that offer. In our view that offer imposes a serious responsibility on the official Opposition, through its nominees who are appointed to meet the Minister. It confers no compensating authority to compensate for that responsibility and it confers no official standing to those members. On the other hand, it may well be found to act as a muzzle when it came to defence matters being considered in Parliament. We are quite unable to accept that as an alternative to a statutory select committee of Parliament clothed in the statutary powers which such a committee would have acting under and with the authority of Parliament.</p>

<p>Sir, there can be no question that defence has now moved into such a dominating position in regard to almost every phase of national life and that it has become of such vital importance to the security of the Republic as a whole, that there can no longer be any delay in providing for far more effective parliamentary financial control and contact with defence affairs on the general lines we have so repeatedly proposed, and which, on behalf of the official Opposition, I again now urge should be brought into being without any further delay.</p>

<p>I now want to touch on the broader question of defence responsibilities themselves. I want to start by saying that there are few people outside the Defence Force itself who have any conception of the terrific changes which science, electronic development, radar and all that goes with it. even when applied to the conventional or semi-conventional types of weapon with which we are now re-arming, have brought about in modern methods of defence. Few people appreciate the increased demands which this type of equipment makes on our trained manpower. It demands that both officers and men should have a high standard of technical and scientific education in order to keep pace with the fantastic rate at which these changes are taking place. That phase of defence which is moving into what one might call the electronic age. Allowing for the wide variation in values, dependant on the nature and extent of any aggression likely, outside of that by any major power with which we shall in any case be incapable of coping with, and seen against the electronic and scientific background I have referred to, there are roughly six basic factors which can be used as yardsticks in judging the effectiveness of our defence build-up. Drastically summarized those are: (1) The maximum destructive potential that can be maintained by our air, naval and military weapons and equipment. (2) Adequate provision for their maintenance under the stress of war, any adequate <span class="col_3597-3598" refersTo="page_0491"/>supply of spares and replacements and, under war conditions, the availability of fully qualified, trained and highly mobile supply and service units. (3) Adequate supplies, at today&#x2019;s terrific rate of consumption, of the type of munition necessary to obtain the maximum destructive value out of the equipment which we are obtaining plus adequate strategic munition reserves in such key positions in the country as is necessary to maintain these reserves. (4) A nation-wide establishment, with adequate maintenance and efficiently trained manning-power, of the interlocking network of radar and electronic equipment without which the fighting value of the equipment and weapons that we are obtaining to-day would be seriously impaired. (5) Equally important as all four of these requirements, is the ready availability at widespread points over a large area of the Republic of the large and ever-increasing number of qualified, trained and experienced officers and men, competent to fight with both the weapons and their huge supporting and activating network of equipment without which they become relatively useless. (6) Lastly, a nation willingly mobilized behind the war effort and presenting no strategic problem by reason of unrest or dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Against these six factors I shall attempt to judge what the position is to-day. Those six factors combine into one interlocking defence unit. If any one of them proves to be a weak link the value of the unit is destroyed. It can be accepted, Sir, that in return for its heavy defence expenditure the Republic is and is continuing to receive the type of equipment and weapons, conventional and semi-conventional, which will enable us to resist and perhaps deter any aggression from any of the minor powers who may be foolish enough to attempt that. It will also enable us to render valuable assistance to other powers of the Western world in a time of emergency and to accept the obligations which we carry under the Simonstown Agreement with regard to sea defence.</p>

<p>One of our points of criticism is that despite our massive expenditure to procure these weapons and equipment there has not been a sufficiently urgent and comparable step forward to adapt the conditions of service and pay, particularly in the permanent force, to correspond with the tremendously increased demands imposed on it by its scientific, technical and educational standard of training and the increased personal responsibility which applies to officers and men in this electronic age of defence. The evidence is that all branches of defence are being seriously hampered in their efforts either to obtain or to retain in their service the increased numbers of officers and men of the standard required by to-day&#x2019;s defence forces. There is evidence also that this difficulty is not only due to the Republic&#x2019;s buoyant industrial position and the consequent higher pay in outside industry, but that the policy of attempting to run the fighting services as units controlled by the machinery of the Public Service Commission is equally playing an important part in hampering the expansion of the defence services themselves. Under the present stress in defence, under what approximates to near war mobilization conditions, control by the Public Service Commission, is playing a very big part in the difficulties being experienced. There is a worldwide acceptance of the fact, Sir, that men in the fighting services, by nature of their profession, are largely forced to live an abnormal type of life. They generally live under exacting conditions and they carry individual responsibility which are in no way comparable (without any reflection on the work of the Public Service), with the more orthodox activities or the regular 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. office hours of the ordinary civil servant who goes home after his day&#x2019;s work and is able to spend his evening with his family. This difference, particularly in their individual responsibility, is tremendously increased by the advance of modern equipment. It is costing the taxpayers many millions to train manpower to the technical and scientific standards that is required for national security. It is evident from the dangerously large numbers leaving the forces, at their own request, that substantial and early improvements, including long term conditions of service that will attract people to adopt the fighting services as a life-time career, as well as increased remuneration to meet the increased responsibility and knowledge required of them, are urgently required. In the four months from October 1963 to January 1964 the S.A. Navy lost 133 permanent force officers, petty officers and men, including many with over five years experience who had been trained overseas at high cost, to man our new warships. Ninety-three of them left at their own request; not because they had to leave, but because they wanted to leave. That wastage position can be applied generally to the Defence Force as a whole. It indicates a wastage of trained material the Republic cannot afford. It also indicates the urgent need for the immediate improvements which we on this side of the House have been urging. The situation should be examined and immediate improvements should be effected to make service conditions in the forces much more realistic and such that they will attract and retain the type of person we want.</p>

<p>The growing development of scientific and electronic equipment demands a much larger Permanent Force of officers and men whose constant association with their weapons as intricate and complex as they are to-day, is the only way in which to obtain and retain efficiency. We are moving into a military age where part-time units, or even reserves who are not kept in constant training with the present-day type of weapons and supporting equipment to a large extent being reduced in the value of those part-time forces and military reserves when considered in respect to the build-up of front-line defence of the country. We recommend that the changed position of the Permanent Force should be examined immediately with a view to its commensurate <span class="col_3599-3600" refersTo="page_0492"/>increase in strength as fast as possible to put up a force competent and capable of manning the front-line defences in any time of emergency. At the moment the Permanent Force is largely dispersed in their capacity as trainee instructors in the ballott-trainee field. Associated with that request is the question of the reappraisal of our own existing conscriptive trainee scheme in order to ensure that it forms an efficient part of our defence organization against external aggression. No one queries the fact that the existing training system turns out better disciplined citizens at the end of the nine months, it turns out smarter lads, it turns out people who can parade excellently, who can deal with internal unrest and are trained in the use of small arms. But the period is not long enough; the training is not adequate enough to meet the changing conditions&#x2014;necessarily so because we have not got the facilities, equipment and instructors&#x2014; to fit them for the front-line, where they may be required. It is also becoming clear that substantitally more intensive training is essential for those who are intended to form part of our front-line defence forces involving the handling of the heavier types of modern weapons. Sir, it is an open secret that except in a few centres there was and still is a serious lack of the specialized type of training which was intended to occupy the last three months of their training period, and the traditional fail-back on square-bashing to fill the gap is not meeting the situation as we require it to be met to-day. It is hardly likely to provide the specialized unit nor the training necessary; nor can it be justified by its cost. The fact that those men are also desperately needed in the economic life of the country as well as the lads&#x2019; own need to get back to their own employment, support our request for an examination to make certain amongst other things that defence is not competing with industry by calling up men for military training who in time of war will not be available to the Defence Force, because they will be key men in the munitions industry upon which Defence itself will depend for the weapons and equipment it requires.

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I first want to deal with the few points on which I agree with the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). I wish to confirm what he said when he expressed his regret that the hon. the Minister of Defence because of his illness could not be present today. On behalf of this side of the House I want to say that we miss him. We are also sorry that the hon. the Minister was not here to listen to the important speech which the hon. member for Simonstown made here this afternoon I agree with the hon. member where he said that the Opposition played a particular role in our defence programme. He said &#x201C;It is the task of the Opposition to come with constructive suggestions&#x201D;. There is nothing on which I agree with him more, Mr. Speaker, than on that statement of his. As far as his suggestions were constructive, therefore, we on this side of the House welcome them. But I do not agree with hint 100 per cent where he said the responsibility for, the defence of the country rested entirely on the shoulders of the Government and nowhere else. I think the defence of a country like South Africa is the responsibility of the entire population and not that of either the Government or the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised many points where I do not agree with him. I shall deal with a few of them. In the first place I just want to say this to him: He attacked the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) because the latter had mentioned the names of certain African states. He suggested that that was extremely irresponsible on the part of the hon. member for Heilbron. But the hon. member for North East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) did the same thing last year. When we were discussing the threat to South Africa and from which quarter we could expect it, the hon. member for North East Rand got up and said it was not necessary to mince words and that it could only come from one quartet namely the African states. But when the hon. member for Heilbron says that, he is very irresponsible and somebody with whom the hon. the Prime Minister will have to deal, The hon. member raised another point. He said the time had arrived when a Select Com mittee of both Houses of Parliament should be appointed to supervise defence matters, That reminded me of the suggestion made by the hon. member last year when he said they did not get sufficient information. The hon. the Minister then told him he was prepared to make certain information available to members on that side of the House. I thereupon said that I did not think those hon. members would accept it because that would place them in a difficult position and that was precisely what the hon. member admitted to-day, name ly, that the Minister had indeed offered to make such information available to them but that they refused to accept that offer because that would place them in an embarrassing position. I want to ask this question: If we were to appoint such a super committee of both Houses what more can that Committee do than the Minister is already doing with his staff&#x003F; However, hon. members can give us more information in connection with that matter. But if the hon. member alleges that &#x201C;there is a complete absence of parliamentary control in our defence budget&#x201D;, I maintain that that is surely not true. Just as every account of any Department is subject to parliamentary control every cent spent on defence is similarly scrutinized through the magnifying glass of parliamentary control, and the hon. member knows that. He also knows that the accounts of the Department of Defence are examined by the Auditor-General and the Select Committee on Public Accounts can go into those matters, and do do it, and report on them and those matters can be discussed under the Defence Vote. To allege that there is no parliamentary control over defence expenditure <span class="col_3601-3602" refersTo="page_0493"/>is so much nonsense. The hon. member also said he wanted to put forward certain suggestions in connection with the ballottees. It is a pity he did not make those suggestions. We would have liked to hear them. He is probably not the only one who is not completely satisfied with the training system which is being followed to-day. I do not think it is right that only some of our young men should be ballotted and that only they should be trained and not the others. But the hon. member knows as well as I do that the training is expanding fast and that many more of our young men are receiving the necessary training, and as the necessary facilities become available more ballottees are being taken in. It is necessary, however, first to provide the necessary facilities. The hon. member knows about all the buildings which had to be erected first before those people could be accommodated. He knows we have to have the necessary staff. I would, however, have liked to have had some suggestions from him in connection with this matter. However, I do not see the necessity of training women while there is such a large percentage of our young able-bodied men who cannot be trained yet. When we have reached the stage where we can train all our young men I shall agree with him that we should also train the women.</p>

<p>I would have liked to have discussed this matter with the hon. member but I want to deal with another point raised by the hon. member when he said we required the best possible scientists in our defence to-day because the defence pattern had changed the way it had. But surely we have those scientific brains for defence at our disposal. Surely the hon. the Minister has all the scientific organization in South Africa at his disposal and he has already drawn upon them. He has already drawn upon the Atomic Energy Board and upon the C.S.I.R. and he can also draw upon other scientific sources. The hon. member knows that the Military Academy has the necessary scientifically trained staff. I do not for a moment suggest that we have enough of them but in what respect do we have enough trained scientists and technologists, and which country has enough of them&#x003F;</p>

<p>I now come to the point where I really differ from the hon. member and that was when he once again stated, as numerous other members opposite have done, that they had no objection to this huge amount of R210,000,000 being spent on defence but that this expenditure would not have been necessary but for the policy of this Government.</p>

<p>Yes, I knew that would come. They have been harping on that string all along. When I read the <i>Cape Times</i> on 17 March the day after the hon. the Minister introduced his Budget I knew they would harp on that string because I have, on a previous occasion, said that what the <i>Cape Times</i> wrote in the morning was accepted by the United Party in the afternoon as their policy. On 17 March the <i>Cape Times</i> had the following criticism to offer on the Budget&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This economic progress plus the familiar technique of under-estimating revenue has produced the thumping surplus of R88,000,000 which can be transferred almost holus-bolus to the Defence Account, thus masking to the taxpayer the financial penalty of the Government&#x2019;s reckless internal race policies and incompetent handling of external relations.</block>

<p>When I read that I knew we would hear the same thing from the Opposition and when the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) moved his amendment he used the same words and one member after the other likewise used those words, including the hon. member for Simonstown. But then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition went to the Eastern Transvaal last week-end where he held two meetings, one at Belfast and the other at Middelburg and I knew he would also harp on the same string. What did he say there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Referring to what has been described as &#x201C;the isolation Budget&#x201D; Sir de Villiers Graaff said that the huge sums of money that had been allocated for defence were necessary only because of circumstances created by this Government.</block>

<p>Let us test that statement against the facts and the truth. The first evidence I wish to submit is what Sir de Villiers Graaff himself said at those two meetings. He was speaking about this matter and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Explaining why he felt that South Africa&#x2019;s international position was worsening, Sir de Villiers said one important factor was the steady southward movement of the independent African states. With an independent Northern Rhodesia and developments in the Portuguese Territories, the pressures may become greater. In every case the movement is southwards. Our northern frontier no longer seems to be so secure and these processes must build up with a mushrooming of African-controlled states inside our borders.</block>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition himself spoke about how the borders were moving southwards and he referred to the fact that Northern Rhodesia no longer had a White Government. As far as I am concerned he could just as well have included Southern Rhodesia. I am glad the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is back in the House. In Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Dupont, the Minister of Justice said the day before yesterday that there was a state of emergency and that a state of emergency would probably be declared.</p>

<p><span class="col_3603-3604" refersTo="page_0494"/>Many countries in the world are spending large sums of money on defence but do the Oppositions in those countries say those Governments should change their policies in which event there would be no further trouble and it would no longer be necessary to spend those sums&#x003F; A few days ago India provided for R814,000,000 for defence in its Estimates. Is there anybody in India who says that if India were to change her policy in connection with the Moslems or the Hindus it would no longer be necessary to spend such a large amount of money on defence&#x003F; Is there anybody who makes such a stupid suggestion&#x003F; However, I wish to turn to America which is so often cited as an example. We know what America spends on her defence. There have been discussions in an attempt to try to curtail the huge amounts which every country in the world spends on defence and America has had similar discussions at a disarmament conference; I want to read the following from an American news letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Soviet Union accepts the American proposal that the two nations transfer nuclear material to peaceful uses, the United States alone would contribute enough for 370,000,000,000 kilowatt hours of electricity &#x2026; Put another way, the American contribution would convert to peaceful purposes enough fissionable material for 1,000 one-megaton nuclear bombs, the equivalent of one-third of a ton of T.N.T. for every person on earth.</block>

<p>So I can go on, Sir, giving you <i>ad nauseum</i> the large amounts which one country after the other spends on defence. I can refer to their concern about the terribly keen competition which goes on to obtain the best brains and the best scientists; about the unrest which exists because of the terrific amount of harm being done to humanity, to show that all the countries feel these amounts are astronomically big. But when we in South Africa spend money on defence, because we feel it is necessary to safeguard ourselves, we have an Opposition which says if we change our policy this expenditure would not be necessary. Is that not ridiculous, Sir&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let us see how we would have to change that policy in order to be safe. I now have in mind the attempts which have been and are still being made to isolate South Africa, to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition. A conference has been sitting at Geneva yesterday and to-day on which 124 countries are represented; I think there are about 1,500 delegates. The first reports are to the effect that the first thing that trade conference will attempt to do will be to prevent South Africa from taking part and to kick South Africa out. That is how South Africa is being kicked out everywhere because of her colour policy. Now the Opposition says: Change that policy and then everything will be rosy in the garden. This Opposition has a colour policy which they tell us about across the floor of the House and which they present to the electorate outside. That policy is to make concessions; the first concession is to allow eight White members to sit in this House to represent the Bantu and also to give the Coloureds representation in this House, together with the Whites, but only to those Coloureds who were on the Voters, Roll before 1954; in other words the male Coloureds over 21 years of age who have acquired certain voting qualifications. Those are the people to whom they will give representation in this House. Now I ask you, Mr. Speaker: do you think that will influence UNO; do you think that will influence the Addis Ababa conference and that it will influence the conference which they are to-day having at Geneva; do you think less pressure will be exerted on South Africa because of a meagre, ridiculous representation in this House of eight Whites for 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 Bantu in South Africa&#x003F; Will that make any impression on America; will it make any impression on UNO&#x003F; If the United Party intends going further than that they must tell us how far they want to go because when we get to the platteland and tell the public they want to make concessions they are quick to say that is the only concession they are prepared to make. If they want to make further concessions than that they should tell the electorate otherwise they are misleading the electorate. They would be in precisely the same position as we are if they followed the policy they advocate across the floor of this House and in South Africa, namely, that they are prepared to give the Bantu a meagre, miserable representation of eight White members in this House and six representatives in the Senate. There is a party in this House whose policy, I think, will satisfy the world outside and that is the Progressive Party. I think the world outside will be satisfied with the policy of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman).</p>

<p>Yes, I think the Chief Whip has hit the nail on the head; that is ultimately also the policy of the United Party. If the policy of the hon. member for Houghton were carried out and if representation were given in this House to the Bantu, the Coloureds and the Asiatics, as she desires, then the defence expenditure on the South African Estimates would be spent for purposes other than the purpose for which it is spent to-day; then it would be spent on maintaining law and order as they are to-day doing in the Belgian Congo and in Kenya and in Zanzibar and other African states. That is the position in which you will find yourself, Sir. The hon. member for Houghton is not here at the moment but I just want to say this to her: She said the other day the artillery of the world outside would be concentrated on South <span class="col_3605-3606" refersTo="page_0495"/>Africa if we did not change our policy. She said if ever South Africa were to experience anything like another Sharpeville we could be sure of it that the world outside would exterminate us. Sir, nobody is anxious to have another Sharpeville in South Africa; we shall do everything in our power to try to prevent that but I want to add that nobody would like to have another Cato Manor in South Africa either, nor do we want another Bashee. If we have to tolerate a Sharpeville in order to avoid a Cato Manor or a Bashee, no matter to what extent the artillery of the world outside is directed at us in an attempt to annihilate us, we shall continue to maintain law and order in South Africa. All we ask of the Opposition is this: Assist us to maintain law and order. This amount of R210,000,000 for which provision is made in these Estimates is not intended to maintain internal law and order. We do not need R210,000,000 for that. We shall maintain internal order and we shall see to it that justice is done to every racial group but the Opposition must help us to maintain that order. However, we also want to play our part, as far as the Western world is concerned, if that should become necessary.</p>

<p>I just want to make this one further remark: Last week we took delivery of our third frigate, the <i>President Pretorius.</i> An amount of R20,000,000 was spent on that. We purchased that frigate in compliance with the 1954 Simonstown Agreement, an agreement which we all respect and which we carry out. So far we have spent a large amount on our Navy and if hon. members of the Opposition tell me that had we changed out policy it would not have been necessary for us to spend that amount in order to fulfil the Simonstown Agreement, then surely, Sir, you cannot do otherwise than tell them they are talking through their hats. What I found interesting was this; when we took delivery of the <i>President Pretorius,</i> Sir Eric Yarrow, head of the shipbuilding firm, in a short speech to the crew said, the bonds between his ship building yard and the South African Navy were strong enough to withstand all political or economic tensions. I commend that for consideration to those people who come here and tell us that if we changed our policy it would not be necessary for us to spend these huge amounts on defence. If the Opposition wish to tell the electorate that they have a policy which will comply with the demands of the Western world and in terms of which it will not be necessary for them to take precautionary measures or to spend money on defence, they should also tell the electorate how many concessions they are prepared to make. However I do not think the electorate will believe them, just as they refuse to believe them in respect of other matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset (East) (Mr. Vosloo) will pardon me if I do not follow him in this debate. There are some other matters of very great importance in my constituency which I intend raising in the very short time at my disposal. Sir, We are glad that the hon. the Minister of Finance was in a position to announce a considerable surplus. On the other hand it is to be regretted that that money could not be given back to the taxpayers and that we necessarily have to spend so much on defence. But, sir, there is an issue which I have raised from time to time ever since my election as a member of this House and which as a result of circumstances brought to my notice recently I feel constrained to raise here again. I sincerely hope that my plea in this regard will not fall on deaf ears. Sir, from time to time whenever I have had the opportunity to do so I have raised the question of the pensions paid to Coloured people, whether old-age pensions, war veterans&#x2019; pensions, blind pensions or disability grants. In 1960 I raised the issue again with the then Minister of Social Welfare, and I discovered then that when old-age pensions were originally instituted they were instituted on the following basis: 12 points for a White pensioner, six for a Coloured, five for an Indian and two for a Bantu. Increases were granted from time to time over the years and when White pensioners were granted an increase of, say, R1, we found that the Coloured pensioner was given an increase of only 25c. The result was that the 12:6 ratio was completely disturbed.</p>
