<p>Clause, as amended, accordingly agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 16,</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This is the Clause which provides for a prescriptive period within which any legal proceedings in relation to expropriation under the relevant Section of the Act are to become prescribed. The period of prescription for which provision is made in this Clause is one year. In other words, if you have any rightful legal claim arising out of any expropriation and you don&#x2019;t make your claim within one year you lose forever any legal right you may have in respect of the land that has been expropriated. I think one must view very warily any Clause which prescribes the right of action in law in respect of any right, especially any property right, one may have. I know there are many <span class="col_2579-2580" refersTo="page_1304"/>provisions in our laws relating to prescription but here the provision is only for a year. I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister why he has chosen the period of a year. It is no good the hon. Deputy Minister laughing; I want to know why it is a year. It may well be that some prescriptive period should be provided for but why one year? Why not two years; why not five years; why not twenty years? One of the reasons why this becomes more important than it usually does is that it is provided that notice can be given of expropriation proceedings by notice, for example, in the <i>Gazette</i>, provided, according to the Act itself, the State President may, where the owner cannot be found, provide for the serving of a notice in some other way. So you have the position, Sir, not only that the owner only has a year within which to make up his mind whether or not to institute legal proceedings, but that the owner may not even be aware of the fact that his land has been expropriated. If he is not aware of the fact that his land has been expropriated because notice has been served on him in some other way, as for example, by a notice in the <i>Gazette</i> or in a newspaper, a notice which he may not have seen, all the legal rights that he may have in respect of that expropriation are expunged completely a year after the expropriation has taken place. It is all very well for the hon. the Deputy Minister to say that he will be sympathetic. He cannot be sympathetic because this Clause provides that in no circumstances may the owner get an order of Court after one year. Perhaps the Deputy Minister will tell us why he has chosen the period of one year and perhaps he will also tell us how he proposes to deal with those land-owners who have not had any notice that there will be an expropriation because they did not see the notice and whether he is not prepared to make some sort of an exception in their case.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks why we have chosen a period of one year. We have done so because we regard it as a fair period. That is the only answer I can give the hon. member. It is considered to be a fair period for the introduction of these processes, otherwise things might be dragged out interminably. That has been our experience in the past. In the interests of all parties concerned it is not desirable that things should be dragged out interminably in this way.</p>

<p>I am sorry, the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot just toss off this question like that. I asked him a simple question. I think it is an important question. In 1958 the Government considered it necessary to amend this section which is being amended in this clause and it amended it to provide as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Governor-General may by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> prescribe the procedure whereby notice shall be given to any person whose whereabouts cannot be ascertained and to whom notice is required to be given under paragraph (a).</block>

<p>The notice that is required to be given under paragraph (a) is a notice to the effect that his land is about to be expropriated. Many of the lands that are dealt with belong to Bantu people, and it very often belongs to a deceased estate. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows very well what complications arise in a Bantu deceased estate, as to where the dominium resides and as to how the person is to be found. In 1958, because they could not find the owners of the land, they brought in that amendment to the effect that the Governor-General could provide for some other way of giving him notice&#x2014;a fictional notice. A fictional notice, not a real notice. In other words, the owner may not get notice, but in law he is deemed to have had notice if it is put in the <i>Gazette</i> or in the newspaper. That is why I ask the hon. Deputy Minister: If this was necessary in 1958, then I think one is entitled to assume that there are a lot of people who cannot be found and whose land is expropriated. The hon. Deputy Minister says that a year is considered to be a reasonable time. Sir, is it a reasonable time in respect of these people who cannot be found? The hon. Deputy Minister cannot say that there are not any people who cannot be found. Otherwise the amendment in 1958 would not have been necessary. What about those people? Surely you cannot prescribe a right of action in respect of something they know nothing about. They must know that land is expropriated, but here they may not know. There may be no evidence at all that they know about this step being taken, and if they have been done down, as is quite possible, in all good faith&#x2014;this happens very often in expropriation proceedings&#x2014;then after one year, they lose all right and they cannot go to the courts, although they might have a good case. That is the sort of person that I am referring to, and in relation to that sort of person it seems to me that a year is too short. It may be a very reasonable period in relation to someone who has had notice that his land is going to be expropriated. There I agree with the hon. Deputy Minister. If he gets one year within which to make up his mind whether or not he is going to challenge the expropriation order, that is quite reasonable. One year is enough time for a man to decide after expropriation whether he is satisfied or not. But will the hon. Deputy Minister please consider a concession to the sort of person who has been served with a notice under the 1958 Act.</p>

<p>The position is very simple. This legislation is expropriation legislation as far as land under the Bantu Trust is concerned, and it brings the position into line with the position under our Water Act which <span class="col_2581-2582" refersTo="page_1305"/>contains similar provisions. The Housing Act also has similar provisions. I think the only reason why it has been framed in this way is that we have such a time limit in connection with all our expropriation processes.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. member for Heilbron has attempted to explain this, but it seems to me that that is no answer to my problem. Because we have it in other laws, is no reason why we should have it here. Because they have the sort of labour bureaux that are provided in this Bill in Russia, surely is no reason to have them here. What kind of argument is that? I accept that we have this sort of thing in our water affairs laws, but do we have in the water laws a provision whereby you serve notice on someone without serving notice on him at all by putting a notice in the <i>Gazette</i> or some magazine? That is the person we are referring to. Now surely the hon. Deputy Minister had them in mind when he proposed this amendment, and if he did have them in mind and he does not intend this clause to have the effect it is going to have, he should do something about it. Or is this going to be investigated at some stage, and will he make some concession? We are only drawing the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this and we want him to tell us whether he is prepared to look at it, to consider it and to take into account these people.</p>

<p>With all due respect to you, Mr. Chairman, I want to point out to the hon. member that the amendment that is being proposed here has nothing to do with the procedure in regard to the way in which people have to be notified. If the hon. member regards this procedure as inadequate, he is at liberty to move amendments in this regard. If he thinks that the time limit which is being laid down here is wrong, he is also at liberty to move an amendment in this regard. We are not dealing here with the procedure laid down in the existing legislation. We are quite satisfied with the procedure in regard to the notification of individuals and authorities and tribes and so forth. I said specifically a moment ago that we have found in the past that the institution of claims may result in lengthy, protracted proceedings and it is for this reason that we have introduced a time limit. That is the only thing that is relevant here&#x2014;whether there should be a time limit for claims or whether there should be no time limit at all. We thought that a year was a fair period. As the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has pointed out, there are precedents for this step. The methods of notification remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The amendment in this clause substitutes Section 25 of the Trust Act and deals of course with Chapter IV. This is really the forerunner of all the clauses which follow and which deal with the amendments leading to the amendment of the farm labour tenant system. Now, Mr. Chairman, we do not want the farm labour tenant system interfered with in this way. We do not want the rural areas to become prescribed areas; we do not want the Urban Areas Act to be made applicable to rural areas, to all labour not only farm labour. All labour can ultimately be interfered with by the labour bureaux. I am not dealing with the fact that a labour bureau will be brought into being. But I am dealing with the fact that they will then deal with all farm labour, even including domestic labour, and this is the forerunner of the interference with the labour tenant system, and I do not support this clause.</p>

<p>Although I gave an explanation on this point, when I replied to the second reading debate, I am quite prepared to give a short summary of my reply at that stage. I want to inform the hon. member that what he fears may happen under these amendments, can actually happen to-day. But the case is not that it will happen to-day, because we would not be so unwise as to proclaim the ordinary rural areas as areas where the local labour bureaux can be made applicable. So what the hon. member fears for the future is really something that can happen to-day. But our experience in practice so far is the best safeguard that it will not happen. Therefore also in future under the new system of prescribed areas we will not proclaim the whole of the rural areas, with ordinary farms, to be included under the prescribed areas. We would only cause trouble for ourselves. We could have done it to-day if we had been unwise, and if we are so unwise as to do that in future, we will be looking for trouble. As I say, we could have done it already to-day. I think that is a misunderstanding on the part of the hon. member and he need not have fears in that connection.</p>

<p>On Clause 19,</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>This is a very far-reaching clause from the point of view of the farmers. I am particularly looking at the last paragraph on page 29, where it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It shall be no defence for an owner of a farm to allege or aver that such Bantu are on such land without his approval, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that he has instituted and is actively pursuing an action for the ejectment of such Bantu from the land.</block>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. Deputy Minister is aware of the habits and ways of the Zulu <span class="col_2583-2584" refersTo="page_1306"/>people. I do not know whether he is aware of the fact that they are in the habit of holding big prayer meetings for rain for instance, and not necessarily will the owner know about it so that he could give them permission and get permission from the Secretary, because that is quite an involved procedure. Now the hon. Minister says that he would not be so foolish to act under the previous clause. But to me the amazing thing is: Why do we put these things on the Statute Book unless we intend using them? You see, all these assurances from the Deputy Minister that he is not going to use this, raise the question why be so stupid as to put it in the Act? I am thinking of Zulu weddings. I speak about the Zulu because those are the people whom I know. I speak their language and I know them very well indeed. In regard to Zulu weddings they train for weeks before the wedding night. You could call that a congregation. There is singing, there is dancing. It could create a nuisance. And the owner of the land can then be prosecuted, unless he has gone through the lengthy procedure of getting permission for them to do so, and he must be able to prove that he has been trying to put a stop to it. Otherwise he will be found guilty in a court. I have said that this can create a nuisance, it can be a nuisance to the next-door farmer, it can be a nuisance to the owner of the land, but it is a long established custom and we, the farmers of South Africa, put up with it. There are many things we have to put up with. But under this provision if a farmer does not like his next-door neighbour, he can use this as a weapon, especially if he has not got satisfactory labour himself. Sir, the worst farmer is usually the one who has not got labour. He is probably a man who is not kind to these people and does not treat them decently. They are the people who are jealous of their next-door neighbours and this gives them a weapon. I think this has very far-reaching results. I have a farm which is actually engaged in farming, but is 18 miles away from my own. How am I to know that there is going to be a Zulu wedding at that particular place? How am I to know that they are going to have a prayer meeting on a little koppie which they use for that? They usually use a piece of high-lying land for that purpose. Under this Bill I can be prosecuted, and I want to say to the hon. Deputy Minister that the people who have drawn up this particular clause must have done so without knowledge of the customs and the habits of the Zulu people.</p>

<p>I am sorry but here too I must differ from the hon. member. I do not think the hon. member can say that this clause was framed by ignorant people, people who have no knowledge of Bantu customs. The hon. member must remember that this sub-paragraph (b) of sub-section (4) must not be read on its own; it must be read in conjunction with the whole of the proposed clause and the hon. member should read it in conjunction particularly with sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) which state specifically which types of Bantu may be on farms under this system. Take the case to which the hon. member referred of visitors who come to attend a wedding. Sub-paragraph (g) clearly refers to &#x201c; <i>bona fide</i> visitors&#x201D; who may visit a lawful occupant of the land if they have been given permission to do so. The hon. member says that she lives 18 miles away from a farm which she owns, but I am sure she left someone in charge of that farm. There is someone there who looks after her interests in her absence and that person can give standing permission or <i>ad hoc</i> permission to the Bantu occupants in respect of particular occasions. Most of us have grown up on farms and I think the hon. member will admit that we do have some knowledge of the circumstances of the Bantu on farms. I think in putting the position in the way she did the hon. member exaggerated it altogether. I do not share her objections at all.</p>

<p>I agree with all that the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) has said, and I want to point out to the hon. Deputy Minister that the Secretary may at any time withdraw approval of your arrangements with your farm labour. You can see what it can lead you into when you have heavy commitments in the middle of reaping, say timber, wattle, which can only be stripped at certain times of the year. Many of us in the wattle area, particularly in Natal, need much more labour at one time of the year than another. Most of us have contracts with farm tenant labour to make sure that we have the maximum amount of labour over a given period of the year to cover the period of stripping and the carting not only of bark, but also of timber thereafter; in addition you have your fire-breaks to clean, and such-like. You are compelled by law to clean your fire-breaks today and under soil conservation you are compelled by law to do this, that and the other. If the Secretary has to have the power because you have perhaps offended in some little way, you may have committed some technical offence under this amending Act, and he can cancel or refuse his approval of your contract, you are going to lose a large amount of your labour just at that particular time, and I want to know from the hon. Deputy Minister how one can continue farming under such circumstances. It is going to be quite impossible. In those areas everybody requires seasonable labour at the same time, and at that particular time your labour bureau will just not be able to supply surplus labour. They cannot carry that surplus labour on hand at that time. Everybody will be shouting out for labour. Surely it is much better for us to have our own contracts and to carry extra labour, perhaps a few more than a labour bureau might deem necessary, until you require that labour. I think it is essential to see that the farmer is not interfered with in his contracts.</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>With all due respect, Mr. Chairman, the fact that the Secretary can withdraw his approval can bust the farmer, but I go on to sub-sections (3) and (4). Here a farmer is presumed to be guilty until he proves his innocence. Mr. Chairman under the other clauses, and this fits in with them, he is presumed guilty and if he is questioned by the head of the labour bureau or the Secretary for Native Affairs in an area, he has got to answer or he is liable again&#x2014;he is presumed to be guilty and he can be asked questions that may incriminate him. Is that democratic? Is that in the best interests of the country that we start passing laws such as this and make a man a criminal and say he is a criminal until he proves himself innocent? We are getting more and more of this type of legislation on our Statute Book, and I think that it is bad law and that it is absolutely wrong that this House should pass legislation that says that a man is presumed to be guilty until he proves himself innocent. The proof should be on the State, and under sub-sections (3) and (4) he is presumed guilty until he proves himself innocent. There may be a technical offence only. There may be a minor offence, but when there is a second offence the penalties are quite heavy and I think unfair. This very fact that he has to prove his innocence in my opinion is a very bad law and I do not think that this Committee should agree to those provisions. When you take the kind of crime that is dealt with in this clause, you find, as the hon. member for Drakensberg has said, that an inspector, a so-called liaison officer,&#x2014;he can be of any race&#x2014;coming onto your property without your permission, going to some part of your farm, or your lands and he finds Bantu living there, or residing there, or only perhaps staying there temporarily and you have not got a permit, he can cause trouble. You as owner of the farm may not be employing the Bantu, you may not know that he is there, and you know what Bantu are. If the Bantu is in trouble, the first thing he says is &#x201c;I have got permission to be here&#x201D;. He is going to get out of it if he can. And then you have got to go to court to prove your innocence. You have got to bring proof that you did not know that he was there. This is going to take quite a lot of proof. It is only your word against his. There is a Native found on your farm who says &#x201c;I saw the kosaan on the road and he agreed that I could spend the night, or spend two or three days in a kraal on the farm&#x201D;. You know nothing about it, and you are not defended by a lawyer in a court of law, but you go before a Native Commissioner or the Secretary as the case may be, and he can cancel all your permits, his approval for you to have labour and in respect of those residing on your farm. If you are going to be found guilty under those circumstances, I think it is grossly unfair, and I think this is a bad Bill.</p>

<p>I cannot understand why hon. members on that side of the House object so much to the provision in this clause relating to control over offences committed on farm property. It is stated very clearly in the first portion of this particular Section 26 that the owner of the land has certain obligations to fulfil. It goes on to say that no owner of land in respect of which the provisions of this Act apply shall allow Bantu to congregate upon or to reside upon such land. But subsection (2) provides very clearly that the prohibition contained in sub-section (1) shall not apply in the case of the Bantu &#x2026; and then we come to the provision to which the hon. member objects so much. The farmers on the platteland welcome this legislation because over the years we have had to deal with this problem of unlawful congregations of Bantu on farm land and we have not had the power to take action against these people. The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) referred to marriages and so forth. But the position in fact is that these congregations take place on certain pretexts and we will now be able to take action in terms of this Bill against an owner who does not exercise supervision over the sort of gatherings referred to in these provisions. He will now be compelled to do so. But he also has the right and the privilege to defend himself and to prove that he did not give his permission in this regard wilfully or deliberately or in order to promote the very thing that we want to obviate. Since the owner of the property has the right to defend himself and prove that he was not co-responsible for this unlawful congregation, I cannot see why hon. members have any objection to this legislation. I want to give the House the assurance that we as farmers welcome this measure wholeheartedly.</p>

<block name="quote">It shall be no defence for such owner to allege or aver that such Bantu are on such land without his approval unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that he has instituted and is actively pursuing an action for the ejectment of such Bantu from the land.</block>

<p>In other words, the owner of the farm is guilty when there is a congregation of Bantu on his land unless he has instituted an action; that is to say, that he has made a statement to the police and has not simply left it at that but has made sure that the police are taking active steps against the people who are congregating on his farm. That is a horse of a different colour. The hon. the Deputy Minister treats this matter very lightly. He says that I can give general permission for people to be on my farm. He points out that the farm will not be left without supervision and that there is <span class="col_2587-2588" refersTo="page_1308"/>bound to be somebody on the farm looking after it. But that is not what is provided for in the Bill. It is not simply a question of my giving permission or getting the permission of the man who looks after my farm.

<block name="quote">Provided that the court making such order of ejectment or removal is satisfied that there is suitable employment for such Bantu and accommodation for him and his dependants, if any, at such other place.</block>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-section (2) of the proposed new Section <i>26bis</i>; to omit all the words after &#x201c;(1)&#x201D; in line 45, up to and including &#x201c;postponed&#x201D; in line 56, and to substitute &#x201c;the Bantu concerned shall be permitted to remain on the land where at the time he resides&#x201D;; and to omit sub-sections (5) and (6) of the proposed new Section <i>26bis</i>.</block>

<p>I think I should explain what the intention of my amendment is. As it stands, the new Section <i>26bis (5)</i> provides that in addition to any penalty imposed on an African unlawfully occupying land, the court may also order his ejectment and the removal to any place outside the prescribed area. My amendment seeks to change this so that the ejectment and removal can only be ordered if no other penalty has been imposed. It seems very hard indeed that not only can a penalty be imposed, but also the ejectment and removal. Therefore my amendment seeks to change this so that the court making the order will be able to send the African to a place within a prescribed area as well, as it seems to me that the opportunities of alternative employment are much more likely to be found in prescribed areas than in other rural areas or the reserves. I want to remove those two possibilities. He must either be penalized or removed, and not both, but if he is removed he must have the opportunity to seek work elsewhere, and my contention is that there is more opportunity for him to find work in a prescribed area than anywhere else. I want to make quite sure that before removing this man and his family at least the court will make sure that he has employment to go to, as well as accommodation, and that he will not just be turned off the farm, with nowhere to go to. As it stands now, there is no such obligation on the authorities making the removal order.</p>

<p>Sub-sec. (2) gives the Bantu Affairs commissioner the right to order the removal of a Bantu and his dependants where the court has not done so, and there is no provision here either whereby the commissioner must first ascertain whether there is work or accommodation in the place where he is sent. When he reaches the place where he is being sent, he can be shunted on again in terms of sub-sec. (7) by the Bantu Affairs commissioner from that particular place if there is no employment. This is already happening with people who enter the urban areas illegally. They come in either from the reserves or from another town, where incidentally they do not have the right to return to anyway. They come into the urban area and get booted out by the local authority whence they came, and very often they find that they have no place to lay their heads there either. I know of a man who came into Cape Town from Queenstown where he was born, but he had left Queenstown long ago. He had certainly been away much longer than the period of a year, which is the period in which he could normally return, and he had lost his right to reside there, and he had no legal place to go to. This sort of thing, where we are now going to move people in the rural areas without first placing the obligation on the court or the Bantu commissioner at least to make sure that there will be work and accommodation for him in the place where he is sent, will create a great class of displaced persons who have no legal place to go to. This is, what my amendment seeks to avoid.</p>

<p>Sub-sec. (3), which I also seek to amend, provides that pending the removal the African concerned can be detained in a prison, police cell, lock-up or any other place which is considered suitable. My amendment is intended to enable him at least to remain where he is before he is removed. Why should he be put into a police station or prison? Let him remain where he has been probably for a long time until alternative accommodation is found for him.</p>

<p>Sub-sec. (5) provides that the Africans themselves can be made to pay the cost of their removal out of any funds they may have. Sub-sec. (4) already makes provision for costs to be recovered from the employer, and the White Paper in par. 11 on page 35 states that the cost of the removal of the Bantu may be recovered from the person who unlawfully accommodated him, and it does not mention that the Bantu can be charged for that removal. My amendment seeks to make sure that at least this charge will not be placed on him. Briefly, that is the tenor of my amendments, and I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to accept them.</p>

<p>We on this side are opposed to this whole clause. This clause subjects the rural Bantu to the same regulations as those to which the Bantu in the urban areas are subject. Hon. members must remember that the personal contact that there is at present between work-seekers and employers is going to be removed in terms of the clauses that we still have to deal with. That means that the farmers will be deprived of the right which they have had up to the present to employ a farm labourer who approaches them for work. Farmers will now have to make application through the labour bureaux in order to obtain farm labour. This clause provides that a person who is found guilty under the previous clause and who has appealed against that finding, can be sent away to his last place of residence or to a rural town or settlement or rehabilitation centre outside a prescribed area. This provision does <span class="col_2591-2592" refersTo="page_1310"/>away with the freedom of movement that we have had up to the present. I want the hon the Minister to remember that the most peace-loving non-Whites in South Africa are those on the platteland, and they number nearly 3,000,000 people. They are content to stay on the platteland. Most of the farmers are also satisfied&#x2014;and here I refer to those employers who treat their employees properly. [Interjections.] The regulations will now be applied to those people who have been quite happy up to the present moment. There are many grounds on which an inspector may say that a farmer is keeping a Bantu illegally on his farm and that farmer may then be found guilty. It is provided here that if the Bantu has the money, he will have to pay the costs connected with his removal himself; otherwise the farmer is responsible for the removal of that person and his family and he has to pay the costs connected with it. We are very strongly opposed to this clause. I cannot see why the Government should interfere with those Bantu who are the most contented of all the Bantu in this country.</p>

<p>As far as the amendments of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) are concerned, I think we are all aware that they are unacceptable to us but I just want to refer to a few of the points made by her. The general trend of all her amendments, of course, is to keep all the Bantu there&#x2014;all those who are there now and as many as want to go there of their own accord, whether there is employment for them there or not. The hon. member nods her head affirmatively. Well, that is so obviously a wrong attitude to adopt that even the United Party do not hold that view. The obvious intention of the Bill is to institute the necessary measure of control on the platteland, on the farms, so that those Bantu who ought to be there can stay there permanently. But the hon. member for Houghton wants all the other Bantu to be allowed to stay there as well, those who are not there to work, and that is not acceptable to us. In addition to that she wants those Bantu whose presence on the farms cannot be justified to be taken away to the prescribed areas, and the heart of every prescribed area is a thickly populated residential area, a city or a town. In other words, she wants the Bantu who are taken away from the platteland to be able to go to the towns.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>No, it will aggravate the problems that arise from unemployment because the fact that there are too many Bantu offering their services in the cities, the towns or on the farms, will give rise to all the other disadvantages of unemployment&#x2014;unduly low wages, bad housing, crime and so forth. The hon. member knows the arguments in favour of influx control; she knows that influx control protects the Bantu as far as his wages are concerned. That argument of the hon. member is completely wrong therefore and I cannot even see how she can justify it in terms of her own political ideology. I can assure the hon. member that in practice we have had a great deal of administrative experience over a long period in regard to the removal of people to places where they ought to be. The proposals in this clause are not entirely new. They do appear in existing measures in an amended form for other areas, perhaps not for rural areas but for urban areas. They are not entirely new provisions therefore. These provisions are based on past experience.</p>

<p>The other point which she raises is that if the Bantu is not allowed to be on the farm and has to be removed, there should be no such thing as detaining that Bantu until such time as he can be removed; he should be permitted to stay where he is until it is possible to remove him. But what guarantee can the hon. member give us that that Bantu will wait there until we can remove him? By the time people turn up to come and fetch him, he will have disappeared and he will be hiding in some other place. I understand the argument of the hon. member. In her view it is logical that there should be complete freedom and that no steps at all should be taken to ensure that one can implement what one has in mind, and that we should simply face the consequences. She welcomes those consequences; we do not. That is where we differ.</p>

<p>The hon. member is also opposed to the provision that the cost of removal may be recovered from the Bantu. This again fits in with the hon. member&#x2019;s view of the position. The hon. member admitted just now that I was quite correct in saying that she wants the Bantu to be able to come in freely and to be present on the farms and in the cities in excessive numbers. That does not matter to her. The more Bantu there are there the better it suits her. [Interjections.] Do not let us have two speeches at the same time. She still continues to interject, Mr. Chairman. I know of only one such woman and I think you know who it is, Sir. [Interjection.] She still persists! The hon. member does not want us to be able to recover the removal expenses from the Bantu concerned. Well, if he does not have the money, we know where that money will come from, but why should we not be able to recover it from him? He went to that particular place without approval; he is there unlawfully and he is not needed there. Unless we can apply this sanction against him, unless we can at least make him pay the cost of his removal, it will simply encourage more Bantu to stay on farms unlawfully because they will know then that we have to bear costs connected with their removal. That fits in, of course, with the views of the hon. member and that is why I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p><span class="col_2593-2594" refersTo="page_1311"/>I come now to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) who has once again contended that the right of the farmer to employ a Bantu who offers his services at the farmhouse is being removed. But that is not so, as I have probably said about ten times already. I have referred to the four different ways in which farmers on farms outside the prescribed areas can obtain Bantu labour. I am not going to repeat what I said because I dealt with this in detail. I do not know why the hon. member does not want to believe it. One of those four methods is the very method which the hon. member now contends will no longer exist and that is that a Bantu may approach a farmer or his foreman and say that he wants employment. The farmer can then employ that Bantu if he wants to do so but the contract of service has to be registered at the district labour bureau, and that can be done by post. I do not know why the hon. member persists in saying that farmers will no longer be able to employ these Bantu. The hon. member will now say that we are going to make many farms prescribed areas and that then it will not be possible to do so. I dealt with this point too and I said that our advice was that farmers should not employ Bantu who simply walk up to the farm-house and ask for employment but that we did not exclude that as a method of personal contact between a potential employer and employee. If a Bantu calls at a house in a prescribed area&#x2014;not on a farm&#x2014;he first has to go to the local labour bureau to get the necessary approval and if the Bantu qualifies he can be employed. In other words, the hon. member is wrong in both her suppositions. But that is quite possible outside a prescribed area. If a farm falls within a prescribed area because it is very close to a town, that possibility is not excluded either but then the labour bureau first has to be approached. I do advise against that method within the prescribed areas but the hon. member must not say that I advise against it on all farms. In the case of farms situate outside the prescribed areas I do not advise against the method that we knew in the old days whereby the Bantu seeking employment was given his trek-pass by his employer and then set out to find another employer. It can still be done in that way but thereafter the contract of service must be registered. I hope the position is clear now to the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that we are interfering here with the most peace-loving Bantu in South Africa, namely those on the farms. It is probably true that the Bantu on the farms are amongst the most peace-loving Bantu in South Africa but I deny that we are interfering with them. We do not interfere with those who want to work. We do not interfere with those who have the approval of the farmer to be on the farm. We only interfere with those who are not working there and who do not have permission to be there. These Bantu are not contented Bantu; they are mostly people who try to stir up discontent.</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister has not yet told us where he will find sufficient land to take these surplus Bantu. We raised this in the second reading and the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) has just raised it here now. The Minister knows that in the last two years representations were made to him and that he cannot remove Black spots because he does not have sufficient land to remove the Bantu from the Black spots in the White areas, and to place them on suitable land. Now he is taking wholesale powers under this clause to remove a great number of Bantu who are not working on the farms but are just residing there. According to him, there are a tremendous number of surplus Bantu in the rural areas who are not working, and therefore they must be taken to the Bantu reserves or the Bantu area. We want to know where he will put them? The Bantu reserves are already overcrowded and there is tremendous erosion. What will he do with all the livestock these Bantu own on the farms from which they are removed? We know what trouble we have when we try to restrict the number of livestock of the Bantu. Our economy has been built up by the law-abiding Bantu in the rural areas. We could not live there if they were not law-abiding, but we live in peace and harmony with our Native labour because they get a square deal, otherwise they would not stay there. We do not want them to be interfered with and upset, but if you are going to start forcing this so-called surplus labour, according to the ideas of one or two people, back into the reserves, if they are going to be forcibly removed, there is going to be a tremendous upheaval. We know that already the reserves are overstocked, and I would like the Deputy Minister to tell us what he is going to do with these Bantu who are forcibly removed from the urban areas when he exercises the powers which he is taking in this clause, because then we are going to upset a very big proportion of the Bantu in this country who are law-abiding. We said during the second reading&#x2014;and we got no satisfactory reply&#x2014;that there are hundreds of thousands, millions actually, of Bantu on farms. According to the Deputy Minister there are hundreds of thousands of surplus Bantu in the White rural areas of the Republic who have to be removed to the Bantu areas. Sir, as I have said, if the Minister exercises the powers which he takes in this clause there is going to be such an upheaval that I foresee tremendous trouble. It is not as though the Government can offer these Bantu who are forcibly removed from the urban areas alternative accommodation that is going to be so good that the Minister can say to the Bantu, &#x201c;Here I am offering you beautiful grazing and lovely lands.&#x201D; As a rule, even when you offer the Bantu conditions of that kind they object to being removed from the area in which they <span class="col_2595-2596" refersTo="page_1312"/>have lived perhaps all their lives because their friends are there and their pride is there. Anybody who knows the rural Native knows that if there is one thing to which he objects it is to be uprooted from his own region and removed to another region. As a matter of fact that is one of the most severe punishments that can be meted out to a Bantu who has perhaps led riots or caused trouble amongst the Bantu in the urban areas. Sir, I ask the Deputy Minister to give us a full explanation as to what he proposes to do with these so-called surplus Bantu in the urban and rural areas because he has not got sufficient land to accommodate these people. Quite apart from the land which has to be acquired for the Bantu under the 1936 Act, the Government will have to acquire millions of morgen of additional land to accommodate the large numbers of surplus Bantu in the White areas about whom the Deputy Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development have been telling us from time to time.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>In pursuance of what the hon. member who has just sat down had to say, I just want to refer to the inconsistent attitude adopted by hon. members of the Opposition. The hon. member contends that a tremendous amount of land will be needed to accommodate what he called the hundreds of thousands of Bantu who in his opinion cannot be sent to the reserves because the reserves are already over-populated, but yesterday the Opposition voted unanimously against Clause 15 which makes provision for further released areas in which these surplus Bantu can be accommodated. Sir, when are we going to have an Opposition which can adopt a consistent attitude in connection with these matters? The hon. member wants to know what the hon. the Minister is going to do with the large numbers of Bantu whom he described as surplus labour in the White areas. Let us explain the position to the Opposition for the umpteenth time. Those Bantu who have no work in the White areas and who cannot obtain work must return to their homelands. In the first place, provision is made for those Bantu in the homelands; secondly, provision is made for them on a large scale on the borders of the homelands. Those people whom we do not need in the White areas, who have no employment there, whose labour is not needed in the White areas, have no other place to which they can go; they must return to their homelands, and provision is being made for them, firstly, under the five-year plan, within the homelands, and, secondly, in the border industries on the borders of the homelands. But the Opposition want us to regard these surplus Bantu in the White areas as permanent residents with their roots in the urban areas. That is something which we on this side do not admit.</p>

<p>I come now to another point to prove how inconsistent the Opposition are. Yesterday the leader of the United Party in Natal did not want to hear of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s sending these surplus Bantu in the White areas back to their homelands. No, he wanted them to stay here. When we told the Opposition that it was their official policy to allow the Bantu to buy land in the heart of the White areas, the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) denied that that was their policy. I want to ask now for the umpteenth time: Where do we stand as far as this Opposition is concerned? When we want to remove the surplus Bantu from the White areas to their homelands and provide employment for them there, the Opposition object, and when we say that we must have full control over the Bantu in the White areas because they are only here as labourers, the Opposition object to that too. When we make provision for the proclamation of further released areas so that provision can be made there for the surplus Bantu from the urban areas, they object to further land being purchased in order to make up the full quota under the 1936 Act, and they come along with the cry which they raise in Natal: &#x201c;Not another square inch&#x201D;. Let us be perfectly clear on this point. There is not one single piece of legislation of this Government and there is not a single statement made by the hon. the Minister to indicate that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to purchase a single square inch of land for the Bantu over and above the amount of land that has to be purchased to make up the 1936 quota.

[Laughter.] Let me make it clear once and for all that there is no truth in the story that is being spread in Natal by Opposition members that it is the intention of the Government to purchase land in excess of the 1936 quota. That is our attitude but the Opposition refuse to take a stand in this matter. Yesterday they again raised the old cry, &#x201c;Where will the boundaries be?&#x201D; We want to ask them now for the umpteenth time: What will they say if the Government comes along to-morrow and declares the released areas to be the permanent boundaries?</p>

<p><span class="col_2597-2598" refersTo="page_1313"/>There is no reply from them. We have made it abundantly clear that where further land is purchased for the Bantu, after both Houses of Parliament, by resolution, have declared further areas to be released areas, it will not be in excess of the 1936 quota; it will still be within that quota. It is simply a question of exchange. But the Opposition continually advance the false argument that we want to purchase land in excess of the 1936 quota. We want the people of Natal to understand that. Natal is the province which has the biggest problem in this regard and that is only natural because it is a small area and is more thickly populated than the other areas.</p>

I want to conclude by saying once again that I have the greatest respect for those people because they have proved conclusively that they want to comply in an honourable way with the provisions of the 1936 Act. No fault at all can be found with their attitude in regard to this matter and I think they are an example to the rest of South Africa.</p>

<p>When one hears how innocently and naively the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M.

Mr. Chairman, this Bill has been framed by people who do not know the problems of our great hinterland. This Bill has been framed to deal with the problem of the surplus Bantu labour in the urban areas and the Government is now trying to apply the same provisions to our great hinterland. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether my interpretation of this clause is correct and I want to put the position to him in this way: Take the case of a congregation of Bantu labourers on the property of a certain person&#x2014;or let me go even further and take the case of these migratory Bantu labourers moving along the roads of the great North-West and who find themselves on the property of an owner who has not given them permission to be there. They are then guilty of an offence and the owner is also guilty of an offence.

<p>The hon. member says that the Bantu are not accused, but if he reads sub-section (2) he will see that provision is made for certain places to which these poor people can be sent. Of course, we are not objecting to the fact that we must have legislation in terms of which action can be taken against Bantu who are unwilling to work or who are criminals, but what we do not want is the sort of legislation that makes life difficult for peace-loving, law-abiding people who have been living in the Bantu areas for generations and generations.

<heading>SOUTH AFRICA&#x2019;S STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM</heading>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>The motion I wish to move reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, in view of the serious onslaught of Communism against the Republic of South Africa via Africa and elsewhere, this House is of the opinion that the Republic&#x2019;s capacity for resistance can be further increased by strengthening its spiritual, scientific and physical resources.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the Parliamentary Library there are approximately 250 books dealing with Communism. I do not include books in which only certain chapters deal with Communism. Much has been written on this subject. Lenin&#x2019;s book &#x201c;State and Revolution&#x201D; has been translated into more languages than any other book in the world. Communist literature has come to the ears of more people than the teachings of Christ have reached over a period of over 2,000 years, and that in only half a century. It will therefore be impossible for me to make a detailed analysis of Communism this morning. I must take it that all of us in this House know what the essence of Communism is. I want to try to prove this morning, within the limited time available to me, that the Republic of South Africa is in fact concerned in this great attack made by Communism, and I want to show that this attack on our fatherland comes via Africa. We should not forget that we in South Africa form part of the West, and are regarded as such by the communists. Allow me therefore to read one of the basic statements made by Stalin in 1924, in which he very clearly revealed the programme of the communists in so far as their attacks on Africa and on the Republic of South Africa were concerned. In a lecture he gave at the Sverdloy University in April 1924 Stalin said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Formerly it was tacitly assumed that the victory of the proletariat in Europe was possible without a direct alliance with the movement for emancipation in the colonies. Leninism has proved that the road to victory in <span class="col_2601-2602" refersTo="page_1315"/>the West lies through a revolutionary alliance with the liberation movements of the colonies and dependent territories. This does not mean that the proletariat must support every national movement. Cases occur when national movement in certain oppressed countries come into conflict with the interests of the proletarian movement for national movements must be examined from the point of view of the interests of the revolutionary movement and not from the point of view of rights.</block>

<p>This basic statement by Stalin directly affects us in Africa in so far as the objects of Communism are concerned. There was a time when Stalin also said that the road to the West runs through China and the East, and I am not inclined to differ from him much in this respect.</p>

<p>We are faced here with two dynamic powers which are to-day trying to mobilize world opinion, two dynamic powers, the one possibly stronger than the other; the one more aggressive and the other more defensive. These two dynamic powers recognize no borders in their struggle. This struggle cuts right across continents. It recognizes no colour; it affects the family circle; it knows no calendar; it is opposed to all religion. The soul of the human being has been involved in this struggle. The culture of nations has been involved. The creation of God is involved. I mention that because Marx, who is accepted as the founder of modern Communism, stated: I wish I could push away God with my hand; then I will be known as the creator of a new being! Communism, in its dynamic struggle against us as a Western Christian civilization, is aimed at bringing into being a new human being. In this struggle every living person has become involved. It is a universal struggle. It is a struggle which is being waged on all fronts and at all levels. I see that a Church Congress which is to be held in April proposes to concern itself particularly with the various fronts on which Communism has joined issue with Christianity. It is not only the battle terrain which is important, but also the philosophy behind these two conflicting powers; the philosophy on the one hand is that of Christianity, which has certain basic concepts inherent in it, which I can summarize in three main points: Christianity, and the Christian who recognizes his link with God, his national links, and his links with his country. As against this great concept of Christianity there is the communist with his communistic atheism in which he does not seek God. His whole object is to deny God. He has no fight with hell; he ignores hell. Communism, seeks to overthrow Christianity with its basic moral concepts as we know them and on which the whole of our civilization is based, by means of a revolution, not so much a revolution based on military power and the force of arms, but a revolution in the spirit of humanity, so as to uproot man and to separate him from his basic concepts, from all the things which he regards as sacred.</p>

<p>Two thousand years of Christianity, as opposed to 50 years of communist infiltration and attack, has brought the world to-day to the stage where Communism has infiltrated into the highest councils of the world. It influences international politics and the economy, and has forced the West, ourselves included, to make use of its parliamentary institutions to pass one protective measure after the other against Communism.</p>

<p>It is not only these basic philosophies which differ from each other. They also have weapons. Here we are faced with the disconcerting fact that Communism has at its disposal the most devastating weapons man has ever evolved. We, on the other hand, also have those weapons. They make use of science, and so do we. In this titanic struggle they have the object of getting into their hands the economic balance of power. Hence, in the pattern of Communism and its attack on the Western world, this relentless struggle waged by Communism, in which use is made of science and technology, to gain the upper hand economically over the Western world, its great opponent, by means of a programme of erosion, through exhaustion, and by spreading the battle over the four corners of the world. These weapons, the atom, science, the economic weapon, dominate our thinking; they affect our deliberations. It can so easily lead to clouding our vision in regard to what lies behind the use of those weapons. It can so easily lead to our underestimating the power which handles those weapons.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this strategy of the communist, apart from his weapons, is again countered by our strategy. In other words, each of these two great powers has its strategy. One cannot understand the communist ideology, the communist attack on the Western world, unless one makes a thorough study of the foreign policy of the communist. You will allow me just to state this briefly, because it is really along that road that we come into conflict with Communism in Africa and in South Africa. The foreign policy of Communism explains its advent in Africa. I want to take hon. members back to what happened in recent years in Western Europe. Russia emerged from the war loaded with prestige and popularity; they played their part in the great conquest. They received so much support from the West that Roosevelt said that communist expansion was much less dangerous than British imperialism. The war gave Communism as a philosophy, its leaders, its philosophy, the opportunity for the first time to extend beyond the borders by which it had been confined up to the Second World War. It enlarged its boundaries; it immediately brought Communism into the international sphere. Russia, as the father of Communism, as the leader of the communists, made an onslaught on the impoverished nations of Europe by means of communist parties which played their role in non-communist Government. &#x2026;</p>

<p>You do not understand the background at all! It attacked these impoverished, these war-ravaged nations, with various weapons. But then there was a reaction. America intervened. First there was the Truman philosophy; then we had the Marshall Plan. That was the reaction against this deliberate attempt by Communism, true to the teaching of Marx, to exploit the differences in the economic sphere and the prevailing conflicts to its advantage. When this reaction came the communists changed their strategy. They came together in Poland and established the Conform. In that Conform three important resolutions were taken. The first was that Russia would be recognized and accepted as the central, co-ordinating leader of Communism throughout the world. Secondly, for the first time the communists divided the world into two groups&#x2014;the imperialists and, according to them, the peace-loving peoples of the world, the communists. These Conform resolutions resulted in the position of checkmate and the great division which came about in Western Europe. As the result of the reaction of the West, and the financial assistance which was given, Russia and Communism called a halt in regard to their foreign policy. Their tactics were changed. Russia changed its tactics and concentrated more on subversion and the use of its communist parties, which it now withdrew from participation in non-communist Governments. It concentrated on various fronts. It implemented in Europe this universal, revolutionary idea of Marx&#x2019;s. At Potsdam and Yalta, Stalin achieved precisely what his new strategy demanded. He was given a free hand in Eastern Europe, which led to the annexation of Poland, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, etc. He got a free hand in China, particularly in Manchuria, where a bitter struggle was being waged between the Chinese communists and the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek. Communism obtained territories; it obtained a base; it obtained a say. We saw it clearly emerging in the experiment made by Communism in Korea, where it waged a limited war, not making use of its own military powers but of others, assisted from communist sources. We participated in that Korean struggle.</p>

<p>What is important is that this parallelism between the foreign policy of Communism in Europe and in Asia did not continue. It passed over to a new battlefield. It was transplanted to South America. We know how Communism knocked at the door of America and how the Monroe doctrine was completely destroyed. We know what unrest was caused in Southern and Latin America. We know what the position is there to-day. We know how Communism did everything in its power to get a foothold in the Mediterranean, not making use of its own army but of revolutionary methods according to the basic philosophy of Marx. We know the history of Egypt. We know of the 1956 debacle. We see how the picture unfolds of Communism gradually taking over one strategic position after another in the world and entrenching itself there. The latest example is the communist <i>coup d&#x2019;etat</i> in Zanzibar. We see how Communism has gained a foothold in the Atlantic Ocean and is now making its appearance in the Indian Ocean. True to the strategy of their foreign policy&#x2014;I have not the time to go into all of it&#x2014;we find Communism in Africa. Here it is already firmly entrenched, with a multitude of trained, specialized subversive agents who receive financial assistance. I mention Holden Roberto, who in Angola is launching the attack against the Portuguese. We see that Communism is active in Africa on the economic front, with financial support, supplied with weapons, and led by trained men. We see it in international associations and in cultural organizations; we see it in the youth movements and in the women&#x2019;s organizations; we see it on the economic front. We see the one state after the other, powerless and primitive as they are, becoming victims of this great communist onslaught.</p>

<p>We should not forget that the Republic of South Africa, is part of Africa. The Republic of South Africa is at the moment different from Africa. In our difference lies the basis of our enmity towards Communism. We constitute the last bastion of Christianity in Africa! Communism comes to Africa with a well-tested strategy which has been applied to the old cultured countries; established and consolidated in Western Europe, consolidated in Asia with a mighty communist giant, China; entrenched South-Eastern Asia; assured of Western ineptitude and inability as the result of unrest in Latin America; with a British policy which lies in fragments in Africa; with American manpower which is spread over the four corners of the earth to fight it! Here Communism comes to Africa with the powerful support of one of its basic strategies, namely a mighty military machine, to apply the necessary force on the various fronts. Mr. Speaker, Communism comes here to Africa where there is a primitive throwing-together of nations not according to class differences, but a stratified division of populations; populations which, in regard to religion, have more than 4,000 different religious sects. We have 400 here in our own country. This religious disruption is eminently suitable to the pattern of attack of Communism. It also lands here in Africa in the midst of four great streams. The one is the liberal stream, the typical post-war Liberalism as we know it; it comes to Africa in the midst of the Pan-African stream, and it comes here in the midst of the stream represented by the Republic of South Africa. The fourth is linked up with the first one I mentioned, viz. the great wave of humanism which is flowing over the whole world&#x2014;yes, this sentimental, sickly humanism. We have many examples of it. So here the communist giant arrives in Africa. The essential prerequisite <span class="col_2605-2606" refersTo="page_1317"/>for freely sowing its seeds on this continent and for achieving success is the elimination of the only remaining stable, order-loving and law-abiding population, namely the Whites in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>I want to say this: We in the Republic of South Africa are automatically the enemies of Communism because we are the protagonists of democracy based on the philosophy I have stated. We know that our freedom is based on merit and labour. The Uhuru of the communist is not based on merit and labour and achievements in the field of labour; its Uhuru is based on and aimed at one thing only, namely to implement the resolutions of the Conform, viz. hatred of imperialism and of the White man who is associated and made synonymous with the imperialist. Mr. Speaker, now we are becoming afraid; we are becoming concerned. We are impressed by the mighty military machine which is being built up; we are influenced by the homage paid to these great military and scientific achievements; we see how this Pan-Africanism is closely linked with Communism, and we see, as I have said, how in their immaturity they are being used by the communists. We see how these liberals in our fatherland, treacherous as they are, hypocritical as they are, appear as the allies, the vanguard, of the communist, revolutionary idea. Then we ask ourselves: What are we to do? And the reply is simple. It is not such a difficult reply. I want to read the reply to you, Mr. Speaker. I want to read to you what our reply is. Our reply lies in the following little story. There is an old Swedish legend which Zelma Lagerl&#x04E7;ff tells in one of her books. A farmer one day went to a wise old woman who could predict the future and asked her whether she could predict what the future would be of the area in which he lived. She then told him that she saw how this area became increasingly prosperous, with churches being built and other large buildings, with iron mines being developed and roads being built, together with a power-station and large factories. But the farmer just kept nodding his head. &#x201c;Those are all transitory things,&#x201D; he said, &#x201c;and that is no guarantee for the future&#x201D;. The old woman then became impatient and told him: &#x201c;I shall mention one thing which shall always remain the same, and that is that such proud, hardworking farmers as you are will be in this country until the end of the world.&#x201D; &#x201c;Now I am satisfied,&#x201D; replied the farmer. &#x201c;If there will always be farmers here who are honourable and stand by their principles firmly, I know this country will retain its glory because only those who become bent by perpetual labour can preserve the prosperity and honour of this country for all time.&#x201D; That is a simple reply. We must realize the meaning of labour anew; we should not just stare at the dangers of Communism and just serve the cause of freedom because Communism is the enemy of freedom. Where Marx wanted to make a new man, we should&#x2014;and I am serious in this appeal&#x2014;form a new being from the creature which God has already created, and which was good. It is good, but we should start forming a new man in our schools, not according to the image of Marx but according to the image of the Creator. I hope the hon. member who speaks after me will develop this point.</p>

<p>I want to say something else. I want to direct an appeal to the Government. I want to ask the Government to initiate the establishment of an independent, anti-communist organization in South Africa which can serve as a brain centre where the educationist and the Church leader and the cultural leader and the simple farmer can obtain information based on specialized study and close analysis of the heart and the essence of Communism. Then only, when one understands Communism, does one begin to realize what a monster Christianity is faced with. Hence our great concern.</p>

<p>Hitherto in our foreign policy we were forced to emphasize the more negative aspects. Can we not project a new image of ourselves? Africa regards us as the protagonists of the apartheid from which results all the evils of the world and of humanity. Can we not, parallel with the image of apartheid as the world sees it, create another image of ourselves? Think of all the millions of anti-communists in Africa, and all the millions and millions of anti-communists spread all over the world! Can we not give them an image of South Africa as the Christian bastion against Communism? Mr. Speaker, we are part of Africa! When this romanticism of Communism <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the primitive nations has come to an end, we shall inevitably at some time or other have to find a bridge to the heart of Africa. Can we not make a start, making use of this tremendous gulf which exists between these two dynamic opposing forces, to build a bridge to reach all the millions of anti-communists north of our borders and depict the Republic of South Africa not only as the guardians of the Christian faith but also as the inexorable enemies of and the fighters against this philosophy which for ever wages such a bitter war against us, and which is based on everlasting conflicts, which interprets peace only in terms of a victory for Communism, and which is ruthless; and which is not only ruthless, but which is aimed at the basis of our whole existence.</p>

<p>I thank the House for having listened so attentively to these few humble thoughts.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>If a general wants to achieve success against his enemy he should try in the first place to determine as accurately as possible who his enemies are; in the second place, how strong his enemy is and in the third place, what strategy his enemy will probably use against him. In other words, he should determine where his real danger lies. Because it is only when you have established who your enemies are that you are able to determine who your allies and potential allies are. It is only when you have established <span class="col_2607-2608" refersTo="page_1318"/>how strong your enemy really is that you are able to decide what weapons to use against him. And it is only when you have determined what strategy your enemy will probably use against you, that you will be able to decide what the best counter-measures are and how you should prepare your own attack or defence.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that none of us in South Africa can be indifferent to what happens in Asia and Europe. Because what happens there also affects us here. But in the nature of things those areas fall under the watchful eye of America and Britain and other leading Western countries. Our first concern as South Africans&#x2014;not only in the interests of ourselves but also in the interests of the entire West&#x2014;is the Continent of Africa. It is in Africa that our main responsibility lies. In Africa this country of ours will have to be, as indeed it is, the supreme commander in the struggle against Communism. I believe therefore that we should act like a leader. In the first place therefore we must be correct in our judgment as to who in fact is against us in this struggle, who our real enemies are in this sphere, and who is not our enemy. First of all therefore we must make a correct evaluation as to what the position in Africa is. And I am afraid that in this regard the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) made a dangerous mistake. He reveals a tendency which is to be found fairly generally in South Africa, and that is to ascribe to Communism everything that happens in Africa and that is not to his liking. The result is that when a Black state in Africa accepts a dictatorship, he immediately blames it on Communism, but when a White leader of the West such as France accepts a dictatorship, then there is nothing wrong with it and then it is not Communism. When a Black state trades and does business with Russia or China, it is said that they are pro-communist; when the same thing is done by Western countries, even by ourselves, then it has nothing to do with Communism. When a Black state condemns our policy of apartheid, he attributes it to the influence of Communism, but when the entire West condemns that policy, then we seek other reasons for it. When a Black state introduces a socialistic system, we regard it as a sure sign that it is becoming communistic, but when Britain does the same thing, then we call it a welfare state. When there are disturbances and strikes in Western countries, we attribute them to economic difficulties; when an African state is involved we attribute them to the influence of Communism. Sir, I could mention many such examples, as well as examples from the speech of the hon. member for Ventersdorp, to show that we are inclined, when dealing with Africa states, to generalize, to apply a double yardstick and to judge superficially. Let me tell you, Sir, why I regard this as an extremely dangerous practice. The danger is that in doing so we alienate the sympathies of nations and countries which differ from us on our racial policy but which are really our allies and ought to be our allies in the struggle against Communism and that we in fact drive them into the camp of our enemies. The simple truth in connection with Africa is that in this struggle against Communism&#x2014;because that is what we are discussing in this debate&#x2014;we have more allies and potential allies in Africa than we ourselves realize. In his book, &#x201c;Africa in World Politics&#x201D; (1963) Professor Vernon McKay (one of the best judges of Africa affairs in the world today, a man who is so thorough in his work that when he was here in South Africa he learned within a month to speak and to read Afrikaans better than some people who were born in this country) gives a summary of the scope of the communist movement and influence in Africa, and it is remarkable how many countries in Africa have in fact banned the communist party. The communist party has been banned in Algeria; it has been banned in Egypt; in the French African states on the West coast there is no organized communist party; in Morocco it has been banned; in the Sudan it has been declared unlawful; in Tunisia it has been banned, and in most other Africa states there is no Communist Party, nor is there any organization which openly professes to be a communist organization. Professor McKay issues the warning that we must not under-estimate the possibilities and the openings which exist for Communism and he then goes on to say (page 191)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because the turmoil in post-war Africa proved ideal for communist exploitation, many observers jumped to the false and dangerous conclusion that it was caused by communists. It was a false conclusion because Africa&#x2019;s protest movements were primarily a natural reaction to foreign domination. It was dangerous because confusion over the causes of political agitation handicapped the West&#x2019;s ability to develop an effective policy.</block>

<p>And then he adds (page 192)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us distinguish between the expansion of Communism in Africa on the one hand and the rising influence of the Soviet Union as a great power in Africa on the other.</block>

<p>The first point I want to make therefore is that we must guard against the tendency to judge events in Africa superficially. The hon. member mentioned Zanzibar here. I wonder whether we have complete clarity as to precisely what happened in Zanzibar. I recall that in 1954 I had the privilege of paying an official visit to Zanzibar and of meeting the Sultan and various political leaders there, and the British Resident Commissioner told me that while the old Sultan, who was loved by his subjects, was alive, there would be no trouble on the island but that the moment his son (and this was in 1954), who was a good-for-nothing type like King Farouk, took over, <span class="col_2609-2610" refersTo="page_1319"/>there would be a revolution on the island. I was not surprised therefore when I read about the revolution recently. The point I want to make is that the position is not so simple; one cannot simply hang a label on things. There are certain complications and we must guard against generalizing when we talk about Africa and we must guard against judging events superficially, because in doing so we describe as our enemies people who, while condemning our racial policy, actually feel about Communism must as we do and who can really be our allies in the struggle if we set about things in the right way in Africa.</p>

<p>The second important point on which we ought to arrive at a correct judgment is what the actual strength is of our enemy, Communism, in Africa at the present time so that we can determine where our struggle lies and where our danger lies. I say again that it is dangerous to under-estimate Communism but it is equally dangerous for a general to overestimate the strength of his enemy because if he over-estimates his strength he may very well make the mistake of using valuable energy in the wrong direction and wasting it; and above all one must not go and look in the wrong place for dangers which threaten one. I am afraid that is a second mistake which the hon. member for Ventersdorp made. He hopelessly exaggerated the success achieved by Communism in Africa. He talked about one country after another having succumbed to Communism but he mentioned no names. No, the fact of the matter is that Communism is faced with tremendous problems in Africa.</p>

<p>Is there no Communism according to you?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Communism, while itself rejecting Nationalism, is up against the growing Nationalism of the Black man; it is up against the fact that Christianity and Islam are inherently opposed to the doctrine of Communism; it is up against the fact that there is a classlessness in Africa which is not to be found in other countries where Communism has obtained a foothold. There must be class distinctions in a country if Communism is to make any progress there. And more than anything else Communism is up against the Black man&#x2019;s hatred of colonialism and the knowledge of the Black man that Communism has its own brand of domination which in fact is worse and more stringent than the domination to which they have been subjected in the past. If the hon. member for Ventersdorp does not want to believe me, let me read out to him what our own Africa Institute had to say with regard to the position in Africa. After having made a study of Russian diplomatic action in Africa it said this (Bulletin, 15.3.1962)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The weaknesses and shortcomings of Russian diplomacy have seldom been revealed as clearly as they were revealed by recent events in Africa.</block>

<p>It then mentions, amongst other things, the closing of Communist Embassies in the Congo, the expulsion of the Russian Ambassador in Guinea by Sekou Tour&#x00E9;, and it interprets these events as &#x201c;a series of setbacks, or even failures of the Russians&#x201D;. That is what our own Africa Institute says. The Institute then issues the warning that Western political observers must not make the mistake which is made by the communists and that is to place the wrong interpretation on events in Africa. The Institute goes on to say&#x2014;and Mr. Wennie du Plessis was the director of the Africa Institute&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As yet there are no really effective militant communistic groups in Africa.</block>

<p>The Institute also finds that another fact which makes confusion worse confounded for the communists is &#x201c;that communistic doctrines clash with both family ties and religious beliefs which are still held very dear in Africa&#x201D;. I could mention a great deal of similar evidence given recently by authorities on Africa. I mention this for one reason and that is that I believe that we must realize that we are not lacking in allies in Africa in the struggle against Communism. In saying that I am not referring only to countries and nations which are allies; I refer to allies in the shape of circumstances which are in our favour. We as Westerners have more circumstances in our favour in Africa than the communists have in their favour. All we have to do is to make use of these circumstances to retain this advantage we have.</p>

<p>That brings me to my final point, and that is this: Where does our real danger lie&#x2014;the danger to us, to Africa and to the West? Where is it situated? I think the real danger lies in the openings which we ourselves give to Communism and the way in which we ourselves play into the hands of Communism. Whether we like it or not, the fact of the matter is that in this era in which we are living we have undergone and are still undergoing a social, economic and political revolution which is drastically changing human relationships everywhere in the world and which is influencing the lives of millions of people in all parts of the world. Since World War II this revolution, which is going on throughout the whole world, has manifested itself in an aversion to all forms of colonialism and all forms of domination, and secondly, in an even stronger aversion to all forms of racism. Sir, in this modern world it is no longer regarded as permissible to injure any person in any part of the world in his human dignity or to hinder him in his process of self-betterment on the ground of race or class or colour. It is in this respect that we are more vulnerable than any country in the world. While other countries in the world, where racial discrimination has been lawful or permissible, have started to do away with it, we in this country, with much ado, have moved in precisely the opposite direction. Race and colour have become <span class="col_2611-2612" refersTo="page_1320"/>our yardsticks in everything and we have callously started to build up a structure which from top to bottom is based on race and colour. What has the effect of this been on Africa? It has had a twofold effect. It has aroused against us and indirectly against the White man the indignant wrath of the whole of Africa. Secondly, we have placed our White Western allies in a painful dilemma, and this is where Communism sees its greatest opening.</p>

<p>When business was suspended I was pointing out that by following our present pattern of race relationships we were in fact giving the forces of Communism their greatest opening in Africa. It has always been the strategy of the communistic ideology, where it has not been able to establish itself under its own colours, to infiltrate and to associate itself with every popular movement, even though it does not itself support the aims of that movement. That is why it tries to infiltrate into every freedom movement, even though it does not agree with the aims of that freedom movement; that is why it tries to infiltrate into every movement which is against colour discrimination, even though it has its own form of discrimination; and that is why it tries above all to infiltrate into every nationalistic movement, although it itself is not in favour of nationalism. It creeps into these movements and pretends to be the most ardent advocate of causes which it does not advocate itself.</p>

<p>That is where our danger lies, and that danger is becoming greater by the day, because in the last few years we have allowed ourselves to be manoeuvred into a position where we can no longer set foot in the upper parts of Africa; where we no longer have an official representative in the most important Africa States to make our voice heard and our influence felt, and where the air space has even been closed to South Africa. We have been more effectively excluded from the continent of Africa than any country in the world has ever been excluded from any continent. I think it is a tragedy for ourselves, it is a tragedy for Africa and a tragedy for the West that we, who are the strongest State in Africa in every respect, who are in the best position to give a lead and to assist in Africa, and who in fact have or ought to have powerful allies in this struggle against Communism if we set about things in the right way, have been excluded entirely from practical participation in Africa affairs. We have been excluded physically, we have been excluded militarily, we have been excluded politically, we have been excluded socially and we have been excluded culturally. Sir, I call this the greatest tragedy of our time because we form part of Africa; we live here together with the Black man and for 300 years we have had the practical experience of living here together with the Black man, and we ought therefore to be better equipped than any European country to play the role of helper and leader in Africa. I found it interesting to read what was stated not so long ago in an article, which appeared in the supplement of the Burger (8.6.1963), by the foreign editor, Mr. J. J. J. Scholtz. He referred in that article to Tom Mboya as a &#x201c;Boerebewonderaar&#x201D; (admirer of the Boers)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a Press interview three years ago Mboya said that he admired the Afrikaners of South Africa. &#x201c;There is no difference at all,&#x201D; he said, &#x201c;between the struggle which they waged for freedom years ago and the struggle that we are waging to-day &#x2026; Our struggle is precisely the same as that of the Boers. The desire to be treated with respect is nothing new. There was a time when the Afrikaners too fought to obtain the same thing for themselves.&#x201D;</block>

<p>But then he comes to what he describes as the tragedy of South Africa. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa could have been the buttress of the new and independent Africa &#x2026; The emergent nations would have looked for assistance and leadership to this country as a sister State above all others. It is a tragedy that with such a vast potential at the southern tip of our continent, we should have to turn elsewhere for assistance.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what is even worse than that is that in following the rigid racial policy that we do we are driving the West step by step into a position where, unless they do something, the assistance of Russia and China will be accepted against us by people who in other respects are as strongly opposed to Communism as we are.</p>

<p>The position is that we have no objection to the motion of the hon. member for Ventersdorp; we subscribe to it, but it does not go far enough. Moreover, he did not touch at all in his speech on the crux of the problem as I have stated it here, and he did not do so because it did not suit his party political book to do so. To a large extent therefore his speech was unrealistic. <span class="col_2613-2614" refersTo="page_1321"/>If we are sincere in our struggle against Communism, if we believe that the supreme danger to us to-day is Communism, we shall have to start thinking more deeply and we shall have to accept a role which represents the greatest challenge that South Africa has ever accepted in its long history. In the first place we shall have to put our own house in order. We shall have to move away from racism, as far as it is possible to do so; we shall have to stop passing legislation which shocks the conscience of the entire West. We shall have to stop adopting the attitude which the hon. member for Ventersdorp adopted here; we shall have to get away from the nonsensical practice of calling everybody, who differs from our racial policy, a liberal and a humanist, and of equating Communism with humanism.</p>

<p>That is what the hon. member did. He equated Communism with humanism. Does he want to suggest to this House that Communism is a humane doctrine? Does he want to suggest to this House that Communism is a liberal doctrine? No, Sir, it is just the opposite, and what the hon. member actually did to-day, without intending to do so, is that he began by attacking Communism but he ended by praising it. It was not his intention to do so, but how can one render a greater service to Communism than by telling the world that Communism is equivalent to humanism and liberalism? Sir, it is a striking fact that in the history of the world every reformer of repute has been called a liberal at some stage or other by small-minded people. Martin Luther was called a liberal; the founder of the Christian religion himself, because of his opposition to orthodox traditions, was attacked on the same ground. The hon. member talks about the &#x201c;sickly sentimentality of humanism&#x201D;. I do not want to be too hard on the hon. member but that was not a very intelligent remark. It is to these humanists that we owe every forward, progressive step in the life of man. If it had not been for this &#x201c;sickly sentimentality of humanism&#x201D; the hon. member and I would still have been living today under the terrible conditions of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Lastly, if we want to check Communism, we will have to stop creating seed-beds for the growth of Communism through our own actions. We will have to stop breaking up family life on a large scale in our cities; we will have to stop refusing to give people the right to own property and refusing to give them the feeling of security and stability which can be created by property ownership. We will have to do more in the sphere of education. We will have to stop refusing to give people economic opportunities to improve their lot. It is these things which are actually responsible for the fact that in spite of all the laws that we have passed against Communism we are really the only country in Africa where Communism has made any appreciable progress in recent years. We on the Opposition benches feel so strongly about these particular points that we have incorporated them in an amendment, and the various points will be dealt with by speakers who follow me. I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with a measure of hesitation that one dares to enter into this broad debate to make a short speech of 15 minutes and that is why I do not want to enlarge much on what previous speakers have said. I must, however, congratulate the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) for the manner in which he has stated his case. I think that must serve as the broad basis for this debate. He has placed it on a high level and I had hoped that speakers on the other side would also have kept the debate on that high level.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) adopted the basic attitude that the mistake we were making was to view everything that was happening in Africa as communist inspired and he tried to suggest that all those historical and political developments in Africa were just for show. Then the hon. member went so far as to say that what happened in Zanzibar was nothing but eyewash; that that was not Communism at all. One would have liked the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to have gone somewhat deeper into the matter and that he would at least have paid attention to what Western leaders have had to say about those happenings. One would think he would at least listen to speeches by Okello, the leader of the revolution there who received his training in Cuba, a communist country.</p>

<p>I have tried to summarize the dangers of Communism and then we had a speech by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in which he said that one of the basic dangers of Communism in South Africa was that we did not recognize it when we saw it. If we want to <span class="col_2615-2616" refersTo="page_1322"/>fight Communism one of the first prerequisites is that we should recognize it and call it by its name. The hon. member tried to set the mind of the world at rest and he tried to create the impression that what was happening to-day in Africa had nothing to do with Communism. Let me tell the hon. member that by doing that he has made a valuable contribution towards Communism in South Africa. I think if you want to estimate the value of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech he should one day qualify for a medal of honour from the Kremlin.</p>

<p>In the time at my disposal I want to adopt a purely scientific approach towards Communism. It is of no avail getting emotional over this subject. Communism is a science which has been worked out in its finest detail, and one must view and fight it in that light. In the time at my disposal I want to make four basic statements and then I shall sketch the real dangers of Communism as it is found in broad outline in Russia and throughout the world.</p>

<p>The first point I wish to make is that Communism as an economic concept&#x2014;and I specifically say &#x201c;an economic concept&#x201D;&#x2014;is much older than the doctrines of Marx, and Lenin and Stalin. To be quite honest, you can trace the idea of communal land ownership and property ownership back to the days of the Bible. For example, in the Acts of the Apostles where the Apostles Peter and John laboured amongst the converted in Jerusalem it is summed up in Act II, verse 44 as follows: &#x201c;And all that believed were together, and had all things common&#x201D; and verse 45: &#x201c;And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That is the economic concept of Communism but if we read verse 46 we see what the broad difference is between that economic concept and the political concept of Communism as we have it to-day. Nor was Karl Marx the first one to have written about Communism. There were a great many who did so before him, such as Jean Meslier, Babeuf, Mably, and Rodbertus the German, particularly in his book &#x201c;Zur Erkentnis unserer staatswissenschaftliche Zust&#x00E4;nde&#x201D; and in other books of his. But the real Communism as a political ideology has existed since the period after Karl Marx, a Jew who studied in Berlin.</p>

<block name="quote">Firstly, is he entitled to say just anybody is related to me and secondly, can he refer to me as &#x201c;Gorshel&#x201D;?</block>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>My second point is that Communism as a political ideology in the full meaning of its dialectical materialism is this, namely, that all ideologies, including literature, the desire for knowledge, art and culture, are controlled by an economic Uberbau or the supreme value of a definite period. That ideology emanates from Marx and his followers but the idea of Marx cannot nearly be reconciled with Communism as we find it to-day. As a matter of fact, there are only two doctrines in Marx, except his economic concept, which conform to present-day Communism, and that is firstly that the material factor moves faster than the political economic ideology and that the latter must therefore be adapted to the former even if it calls for a revolution. The second doctrine of Marx&#x2019;s Communism which is still true to-day was what he said in those simple words of his and on which he wrote his whole thesis: &#x201c;In simple truth I harbour hate against all gods.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I wish to make the third point and that is that in the politics of the world Communism has to-day become a philosophy of life which you cannot ignore, Sir. There are only two extreme points in the politics of the world to-day, democracy on the one hand and Communism on the other hand and between these two extreme points you find a whole series of political concepts, but every one of those concepts stand in a certain relationship with one or other of those two concepts. All of them are on the road either to democracy or to Communism. And that does not only apply to political parties, it applies to societies, to organizations and even to the individual. There is not a single individual in this House who does not occupy one or other position between those two points, between Communism and democracy. The one may be nearer to democracy than the other and the other nearer to Communism but every one of us is on that specific road.</p>

<p>The fourth point I want to make is that the biggest threat to Communism is not force of arms. It is a very delicate science that has been worked out in very fine detail and it has a specific pattern. That pattern is infiltration via certain organizations&#x2014;I do not want to go into the methods which are employed&#x2014;a softening process, riots, processions, demonstrations, and ultimately revolution. Force of arms is only resorted to in the last instance. Before that you have a kind of peaceful infiltration. When you think of it, Sir, that with the assistance of an amount of not even R1,000,000 from the Kremlin, China with its population of over 500,000,000 people has turned communist in the short period of 19 <span class="col_2617-2618" refersTo="page_1323"/>years. You appreciate what a danger Communism is. Had you revealed it as a hostile force which had to be tackled by force the Western nations would long since have disposed of it. But for the very reason that that is not the method it employs, for the very reason that it does its work by infiltrating into organizations and parties, which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout does not want to realize, he is as dangerous as it is.</p>

<p>Many dangers attach to Communism but I just want to mention four in the short time at my disposal, and I address my remarks to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in particular who, it seems to me, has no idea whatsoever of the real danger of Communism. I want to be very scientific in this respect because I have had the privilege of making a study of the communist system as it works in Russia and when I make a statement I shall prove it by quoting from the Russian Constitution.</p>

<p>The first danger of Communism is its conception of democracy. The communist conception of democracy is that all power, legislative, judicial and executive power rests in the hands of the proletariat, the masses, the working classes and these forces are described by Lenin as &#x201c;unlimited by law and resting on force&#x201D;. There is no law which defines or limits those powers. That is why only the workers have the vote in Russia. No businessman or minister of religion, middleman or employer has the vote. That is why 3.5 per cent of the population of Russia do not have the vote. This dictatorship by the proletariat is the crux of the communist system. This proletariat is given the right to do away with all institutions which are a danger to itself and not to mind what methods it uses. Force of arms, fraud, perjury are justified towards that end. What is also interesting is that in terms of Section 125 of the Russian Constitution only the proletariat have freedom of speech, the freedom to demonstrate, freedom of the Press, etc., no other individual has that freedom. They put it this way that the proletariat constitute the dictatorship; they have the freedom and nobody else. You can appreciate what a danger that conception of democracy is to the Western world to-day, Sir. It is only when you think of Africa with her vast mass of Black people who are illiterate and uncivilized to a great extent, that you realize the danger, but you can talk about that for a whole day, Sir.</p>

<p>Another basic danger which I see in Communism is its conception of the administration of justice and I want the hon. member for Wynbeg (Mrs. Taylor) who will follow me, to listen very attentively to this. It is not only the communist conception of the administration of justice but of the law itself. Andr&#x00E9; Vyschinsky who is probably the greatest jurist the world has ever known gave this definition in his well-known book &#x201c;The Law of the Soviet State&#x201D; which is to be found in this library&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Marxism-Leninism gives a clear definition, the only scientific definition, of the essence of law. It teaches that legal relationships and consequently law itself are rooted in the material conditions of life, and that law is merely the will of the dominant class, elevated into a Statute.</block>

<p>How is this administration of justice interpreted in Russia itself? The Judges in Russia are not nominated as independent persons. The Judges are appointed and dismissed by the Presidium, a body consisting of 33 members which is the supreme authority in Russia. They nominate the Judges in terms of Section 105, and the Presidium, not the Judges, interpret the law in terms of Section 49 (c). Not only does that supreme authority appoint the Judges but they also appoint the Attorney-General and they dismiss him if he does not act in accordance with the will of the proletariat. Who are the masters of the so-called Judges in Russia? We know what their political structure is and I do not want to expatiate on that, because my time is fast running out. In Section 141 of the Russian Constitution it is provided that the Communist Party and it alone may take part in elections in the Soviet. What is the position in general? Of the more than 208,000,000 inhabitants of Russia there are not more than 6,800,000 enrolled members of the Communist Party. That means that only 3 per cent of the total population can take an active part in an election; and what is more disturbing is the fact that of those 6,800,000 no fewer than 868,886 stood as candidates during the last election. The rest of the population have no say whatsoever in their legislative bodies.</p>

<p>A further danger of the communist system is the policy as defined in the Russian Constitution, that the only road to Communism is via revolution. They envisage no change of policy within the framework of an existing form of government. They have one object only and that is the complete overthrow of that form of government and the introduction of the communist system. The pattern they follow in this process has been worked out in detail. The first step in that process is to advocate political and economic equality, but in reality that ends in a dictatorship by the proletariat. What is important in the communist system is this. One may ask oneself of what benefit will it be to Russia if the communist system spreads throughout the world? The communist system is based on this that the ideal position will be attained in the world when all the countries are communist and not before then. That attraction is held out to them; you may not be faring so well to-day but just persevere till the whole world is communist and then it will go better with you. In other words, it is a process which will only come to an end when the whole world is controlled by the communists.</p>

<p>The final danger of Communism which I want to refer to, and this is contained in Section 122 and Section 124 of the Russian Constitution, is the total destruction of the human soul, of all its aspirations, its honour and its integrity. According to Section 121 family life <span class="col_2619-2620" refersTo="page_1324"/>is wiped out completely. The woman is placed on an equal footing with the man and she must go and work. The children are placed in institutions; they are only individuals. This part of the communist system is very necessary because if the soul of the person is not destroyed that person will not be prepared to accept Communism. According to Section 124 the school is separated from the State and the Church which means broadly that the State is concentrating on wiping out all religious teachings. It is an offence to teach any religion to any person under the age of 18 years. But they have gone much further. In 1918 all religious teaching was banned and in 1922 the Russian Government established a newspaper, called <i>Bezbozchnik</i>, which has concentrated on wiping out all forms of religion in Russia. In 1925 the Government called a body into being, the Association of Militant Atheists to continue wiping out religion and it is still doing so to-day particularly by way of the radio.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into the question of what fertile soil for the spiritual ruination of the human soul will be found in South Africa when you think that more than 3,400,000 of our small nation do not belong to any Church at all and that of that number no fewer than 14,000 are Whites apart from the atheists and those people who admit that they have no religious convictions.</p>

<p>My time has nearly expired and I want to conclude by saying this. What can we do to fight Communism? I just want to mention three things. In the first place we must recognize it and call it by its name and we must not overlook it as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout does. We must recognize its pattern, its methods and its followers and we must enlighten the nation in those respects. We must continue building up our spiritual and scientific ability to defend ourselves so that we can fight it in all its facets. Only then shall we be able to give Communism the fatal blow in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>It is not my intention to deal at any length this afternoon with the dangers of Communism that exist in Africa. I think that ground has been adequately covered. I have the privilege of being the first speaker here this afternoon to bring the matter a little nearer home. It is very interesting to me that the motion moved by the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) deals specifically with the dangers to the Republic. I have a good deal of sympathy with the hon. member for Ventersdorp, but I think it is very sad that the hon. member and his colleagues have failed to see that what Sir Roy Welensky saw and predicted about the Continent of Africa many years ago is true. He said that the one thing the communists wanted was the disruption of the African Continent into small, powerless, economically vulnerable states in conflict with each other. By creating, as our friends on the Government benches are intending to do, eight Bantustans in the Republic, and proposing to create another ten in South West Africa in terms of the Odendaal Report, we are in fact inviting Communism; we are giving an open invitation to Communism to come in and to do its work. May I say that the hon. member on my left correctly states that Communism moves in very strange places. It exploits the poor and the underprivileged and it inflates their grievances, but he was quite correct in saying that some of the people behind it, even in the Western world, control millions of money and that many of them are in very high places indeed. There I agree with the hon. member entirely, but the irony of it is this, that here in South Africa we are better equipped than any other part of the Continent to deal with this particular menace. We have a stable and flourishing economy. We are a law-abiding people and we have an electorate with many years of democratic experience behind it. It seems to me to be tragic and ironic that we should find it necessary at this stage to come along with this sort of motion that the hon. member has put on the Order Paper to-day in relation to South Africa itself, because the hon. member for Ventersdorp and the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe), the only two speakers on the Government benches so far, have dealt only with the theory of Communism. They travelled the globe from Russia to Algeria and Cuba, but neither of them got down to tintacks and dealt with the terms of the motion which talks about the danger of Communism in the Republic of South Africa itself. I intend to bring the matter a little closer home. In view of the gravity of the subject under discussion, I can think of nothing more depressing than having to listen to the type of speeches we had from those two hon. members opposite. The hon. member for Ventersdorp indulged amongst other things in all the tired old clich&#x00E9;s about liberals and humanists and suggested various ways in which their activities could be exposed&#x2014;he did not like their ideas in fact. Sir, we know very well that there are plenty of people in the world to-day, not only in South Africa, who hold sickly sentimental views about certain things. We know perfectly well that there are many Left-wing intellectuals in every country of the world, not only in South Africa, who have always adopted these tactics, who have made it their business to infiltrate associations and organizations for the purpose of taking them over. We know that that is a recognized communist tactic and that that has been so for many, many years. But that does not mean to say that every humanist is necessarily a communist, and it is a very stupid and generalized equation to make, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout rightly pointed out. But, Sir, when all these things have been said about humanists and liberals, how far have we got with regard to the situation here? Where does it get us when in fact this Government itself creates conditions in which Communism can be expected to flourish?</p>

<p>The real basis of communistic thinking is, of course, that the State is of greater importance than the sum total of the individuals of whom it is composed. That is the basis of all authoritarian thinking anyway. The hon. member for Ventersdorp is bitterly opposed to Communism, and we agree with him entirely; there is no difference of opinion on that score, and yet some of the methods proposed by our friends in the Nationalist Party as to how to fight Communism seem to us to be perilously similar to the methods used by the communists themselves. Sir, the hon. member is quite correct when he says that Communism is entirely materialistic. In fact, it represents as he says and as I say, nothing more than a bid to take over the soul of man to-day. He is quite correct. Its techniques of indoctrination which threaten to change the whole of the human psyche seem to me to be quite the most sinister threat in modern times. The threat, of course, is to condition a man&#x2019;s approach to everything in life; that is their object. In other words, the plan is to remove from him the one God-given faculty that he has that distinguishes him from the animal kingdom, and that is his right to freedom of choice. Sir, when we speak in this country of the value and the dignity of the individual we refer specifically to that one right which gives man any dignity and gives him any status&#x2014;your right and my right to decide what kind of people we are going to be and what kind of lives we are going to lead&#x2014;and yet my hon. friend has come here (and I have heard this from many members of the Nationalist Party before) and pleaded for greater indoctrination in our educational institutions, for more and more control over the minds of our young people with regard to these matters.</p>

<p>When one thinks what this Government is doing to suppress the outer manifestations of Communism with force and determination on the one hand and practises inhuman policies which actively encourage its growth on the other, then one can only be astonished at the political na&#x00EF;evet&#x00E9; of the hon. member who spoke previously in favour of this motion and some of the things that he said. The hon. member for Durban (North) here in the House the other day referred to a speech made by the hon. the Minister of Community Development, and I want to refer to it again. It was a speech made on 28 February just a week or two ago, when he addressed the Economic Institute in Cape Town, and this is what the Minister had to say: He specifically related settled family life with Communism. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The importance of suitable and attractive homes, especially for those in the middle and lower-income groups, could never be over-emphasized if South Africans wish to maintain their way of life and to defend themselves successfully against Communism, said the Minister of Coloured Affairs and Housing (Mr. T. W. Botha), when he addressed the Economic Institute in Cape Town last night.</block>

<block name="quote">Quoting from <i>Izvestia</i> the Minister said the realization of Communism demanded a constant battle against property and one&#x2019;s own house because this favoured the middle-class mentality and militated against the development of the communist way of life.</block>

<p>He admits therefore what we have been advocating for years, the need for creating a settled, stable property-owning middle-class. We have pleaded for it for the Europeans and we have pleaded for it for the Bantu people and we have been laughed out of court.</p>

<p>Sir, it has nothing to do with where they own that property. The Minister has made a statement and he quotes it as being a means of combating Communism.

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2623-2624" refersTo="page_1326"/>Future South African cities and towns should therefore be planned in such a way to promote happy family lives.</block>

<p>Sir, when this motion first appeared on the Order Paper the hon. member for Ventersdorp had it in a different form. I was very interested to see that he thought fit to change it. He did make a passing reference in the course of his speech to the subject of education; I have no doubt that there are other speakers who are going to deal with that a little bit later. But, the hon. the Prime Minister as far back as 1961 made a statement in Pretoria, a statement which was recorded in the Press, that &#x201c;The Central Government is not only interested in the education of children after they leave school; it is interested in the child from birth onwards because the future of the nation is at stake&#x201D;. Since the hon. the Prime Minister, when he refers to the &#x201c;South African nation&#x201D; by his own definition, which is not ours, means only the White race, he is here concerned with the preservation of the position of the White man in South Africa. In the original motion of the hon. member for Ventersdorp &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Well, we on this side of the House&#x2014;and I have no doubt the whole House&#x2014;are in favour of the preservation of the White man in South Africa because we know quite well that South Africa would not survive without him. But if the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. member for Ventersdorp were correct in saying that the future of the nation really is at stake, then of course the hon. member for Ventersdorp is quite correct in saying that we must do something about the educational position and learn how to work. There I agree with him entirely, but I want to say also that anything that can be done in the educational field with regard to our young people should, of course, be done but that no legislation in that sphere can hope to improve the position with regard to communistic activities in South Africa. No legislation will help that situation. The only way in which we can assist is by providing real safeguards. We will never do anything in the field of indoctrination. If, as the hon. member for Ventersdorp suggested, we are determined to maintain the highest possible educational standards in South Africa, academic, vocational, scientific and agricultural, to see that we ourselves can continue to give a dynamic lead, that is important, but it is equally important to see that facilities are available for the other races in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>It is part of our amendment, and I am entitled to make obvious statements if I like. But, Sir, those standards must be maintained not only for us but for other races. That is equally important in this battle against Communism, because with those standards must go increasing opportunities for non-White people, and I would like to suggest that these standards can only be maintained&#x2014;and I issue this as something of a warning in view of what has been said in educational circles in the past&#x2014;in an atmosphere of freedom, diversity, evaluation and adaptation, and any attempt whatever that is made in South Africa to condition the thinking or the approach of the European community in our schools or other institutions is bound to be disastrous because we will then be adopting methods which are similar to the manner in which Communism functions itself. We are all agreed that training in citizenship here in South Africa&#x2014;and I am talking about young people&#x2014;is a very laudable idea but I feel obliged to warn hon. members, if they have been thinking along slightly different lines, of the very grave danger involved when such an ideal comes to be interpreted, as has often been done in the modern world, for educational purposes, in terms of the policies <span class="col_2627-2628" refersTo="page_1328"/>or the interests of those who are in power for the time being. Sir, while I agree with the hon. member on my left on the dangers of Communism in Africa generally, I think there are certain things we should not forget, and one of those things is that any society&#x2014;and it applies very much to ours at the present time&#x2014;that organizes itself too elaborately, that is over-governed, as I think we are to-day, any society that organizes itself so elaborately that it tries to control every aspect of the lives and activities and even the thinking of its citizens will be compelled to go on and on until it reaches a state of rigidity which in fact is the hallmark of the very Communism which we ourselves are seeking to destroy.</p>

<p>May I say finally that the use of violence and suppressive measures never resolved any deep-seated political or social grievance anywhere, and our thinking of these matters must be positive and not negative. Where our non-White people are concerned, those who have become a prey to these doctrines, our thinking must be both understanding and realistic, and that is why we have phrased our amendment in these terms. We do not need to be on the defensive in South Africa if we handle the situation intelligently. There is so much in the positive field that is crying out to be done, if only South Africa had a Government intelligent enough to see it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mostert">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to state my ideas very briefly&#x2014;I have 3&#x00BD; minutes&#x2014;on the spiritual, scientific and physical forces of the nation and how those forces will become armour-plated and strengthened in this struggle against Communism.</p>

<p>Before I start I want to express my regret that we have deviated somewhat in a debate on a private motion, a debate which is a private members&#x2019; debate and which gives hon. members the opportunity of expressing their ideas, and I just want to say to the previous speaker that I am very sorry that she was disturbed when she made her speech, unnecessarily so, I think, after the mover of the motion had enjoyed quietude in which to make an excellent speech, a speech which I want to describe as a masterpiece. We listened very attentively and with respect to the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, everything to which human thoughts aspire, human achievements, the whole direction in which he strives is along a dual track. The one track is the idealistic, the sublime and the philosophical; the other track is the more practical, the realistic and the scientific track. If we divide our thoughts according to those two, then Communism definitely forms part of the philosophical and not of the scientific. In other words, when we approach and appreciate it we must do so not according to experience gained by scientific experiments but we must do so in terms of our appreciation of it in order to determine certain values based on our own criterium. I say that because I want to apply my own criterium and not that of somebody else or of any part and least of all the criterium of the State; I am talking for myself. Those scientific and philosophical values are determined in the first instance, as far as science is concerned, by way of experimental experience, but this extensive subject cannot be measured by the norm of experimental experience and for that reason we have to apply spiritual values to what we say. The spiritual values which I am going to attach to it are my own spiritual values, and where I have listened patiently to other members, particularly the speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as well as the previous speaker, I hope they will give me an honest chance to say what I want to say on the subject. As has already been stated Communism definitely has a whole group of related disciples, or call them doctrines, but it has been clearly stated that there is room between Nationalism on the one hand and Communism on the other hand for practically every shade of thought and when I refer to humanism and liberalism and progressivism and existentialism it does not mean that I think those things are Communism. They have their own names and they stand apart from Communism, but I wish to indicate that Communism is a pole which attracts certain trends of thought to it like a magnet and on the other hand you have Nationalism which attracts certain trends of thought to it like a magnet and so you find that socialism, syndicalism or whatever it may be belongs to the communist pole but they are not in the same group. The one is a progressive trend of thought and the other is a searching orthodox trend of thought. My Nationalism is orthodox. It is not liberal and it is not progressive. Therefore in approaching this matter I am doing so in the orthodox idea of Nationalism. Nationalism tries to attain its object by stability&#x2014;by labour, as has been stated&#x2014;Zelma Lagerl&#x00F6;ff. Communism realizes and attains its object by revolution. Revolution is the overthrow of existing principles and we want to keep the existing principles of the National Party, of Calvinism and of the Western civilization stable. We do not seek other principles, and therefore not revolution. Communism uses force; we achieve our object by means of inspired dedication. We seek planned order and action, irrespective of what is said about our actions. Slogans are usually attached to that planned order and those slogans have already acquired a hollow tone. As soon as action is taken against us, whether it be from the communistic side or from the liberalistic side or whatever it may be, you have to listen to certain invalid slogans. I think of the first one for instance: We must accept the challenge, &#x201c;the challenge of a changing world&#x201D;. Those are hollow sounding words. Mr. Speaker, I should like to refer this matter to the education and the training of our country. I am not going to teach our children to accept challenges but to issue challenges to others themselves and the time has arrived for Nationalism to issue its challenge to Communism, <span class="col_2629-2630" refersTo="page_1329"/>in spite of the ideas which have already been expressed here. The challenge and the initiative should come from us. Reference is so often made to the changing world. We are not the object of a changing world; the world must not change us; we must change the world as we want it to be. That is why we teach the child to interpret and to control his environment and that is why he should not subject himself, when he is an adult, to the demands of a changing world but he himself must change the world as he wants it to be. In other words, there should not be any question of adapting yourself to circumstances. Youth must be taught to meet those circumstances and to control them.</p>

<p>We now come to the question of discipline. Those three, the spiritual, the scientific and the physical forces, must be disciplined in the struggle against Communism. That discipline must take the form of positive education. It must be so positive that it carries the child with it and fills his whole mind. It must bring a message to that child; it must be of value to that child, as I have so often said before in this House, but it must in particular ensure the individualism of that child and his personality and the identity of his personality. Our education should aim at that. We were told this morning how the communist gives the human being a number and makes an item of him; he has a number, he has no name. He is not an identity he is a nonentity. The entire object of education in South Africa is to counter that tendency of Communism and to confirm the individuality of man. Communism creates mass psychosis. That mass psychosis is exploited to aspire to revolutionary directions.</p>

<p>I want to conclude; my time has expired. I want to ask the Ministers who are present to assist and to see to it that the matter is tackled in our education. The machinery has been created. The Department is there. The advisory boards are there. Why they do not make a start I do not know. This is the eleventh hour, Sir, they must make a start. They must give us an educational system which realistically faces up to those things against which we were warned this morning. They must give us a realistic educational system that will harness the spiritual strength of our youth and form it in such a way that it will deliberately aim at those things which we have set up for ourselves as being the most holy. When I say &#x201c;the most holy&#x201D; I do not hesitate to say what is holy to me: That is my Christian faith and confession of faith, my Calvinistic convictions and my national politics. They must not touch those. And when I as a parent want to impart those things to my child they must not stand in my way because those things ensure my safety against the dangers of Communism. There are two words; the one is &#x201c;discrimination&#x201D; and the other is &#x201c;indoctrination&#x201D;. Why should I not discriminate in favour of that which belongs to me, in favour of my home and my children and my nation and my language and my religion? I discriminate therefore. Why should I not indoctrinate my children in my schools with doctrines that are holy to me? My friend over here says &#x201c;hear, hear&#x201D;. Why don&#x2019;t we do it? Because we are afraid to say that from every platform. We are afraid we may hurt one another. I therefore say it here to-day, Mr. Speaker. It stands recorded in Hansard. Unfortunately my time has expired. I just want to say that we should start to indoctrinate; we should continue to discriminate and we should develop and strengthen our own people, our own White civilization, our Christian civilization and our national civilization so that we can ward off that tremendous wall of Communism which hangs over us. We should split fewer hairs over the small political ideologies we have in the different parties in this country. These are my private views.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>The first thing that occurs to me this afternoon is, that in a debate of this kind, one would have expected that, if it were as serious a matter as it is alleged to be, the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs might have been present. But I see we have the hon. the Minister of Justice in his stead. Sir, I am wondering whether, by discussing a matter of this kind in the way it has been discussed, we are not doing the wrong thing. We are giving Communism and communistic organizations all the publicity in the world; we are giving them all the credit for the know-how and how to spread their theories and their philosophies.</p>

<p>As I see the position, we in this country could, if we wished, set an example of a country where Communism could not prosper nor thrive. The United Party has moved an amendment to this motion. I want to give the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) full credit for his speech. He has done a lot of research; he has canvassed the history of the activities of Communism from the beginning and I think it can be accepted that what he has said is true. What is not true, of course, is this: The deductions he has made, as to the influence and infiltration of Communism on the African Continent are not anywhere near as bad as he described them to be. I think the Government is more aware than any private member of this House as to what the actual position really is, and I am quite satisfied that they will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time to deal with such a menace. Nevertheless, we contend and I submit, that we have to do a little bit more than suggested by the hon. member for Ventersdorp, which was to set up an anti-Communism Committee. I think this is a matter that should be dealt with at the highest possible level by the Government. He mentioned that we should marshal our spiritual resources, our scientific resources and our physical resources. He omitted to say, however, what we would be expected to do with them. I put that down to the fact that he was limited in his time. We go further, and say, that a pattern of living which is based on a settled family life&#x2014;I am not going to argue whether that family be in <span class="col_2631-2632" refersTo="page_1330"/>area A or in zone B&#x2014;for all people in this country is prerequisite number one. The living wage we suggest, is one where everybody in the country should be paid his worth; in other words, the rate for the job. The third point we make is, that there should be adequate educational facilities for all people; that opportunity should be made available so that every man or woman and every boy or girl, no matter who they may be, can make the best possible use of the ability with which they have been gifted.</p>

<p>Finally, one aspect that has not been stressed, is, that we should take active steps to encourage and cement the ties with the Western nations.</p>

<p>That is a matter of opinion. I believe we should promote that actively.

I believe that we here in the Republic, could be the leaders of the whole of the African Continent, if we made up our minds so to be. But, we have to change our pattern of thinking; we have to consult with each other and we have to reason together. Not only are we to reason together <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> White and White but we have to reason together with Black and Coloured, and Chinese and Indian and everybody else who has been cast in this country by the grace of God.</p>

<p>So I say, Sir, that this motion which has the merit of an attempt, first of all, to ventilate the problem, but with no solution offered as to what we can expect this place to be years from now, has basically and fundamentally much to commend it. I therefore say in good spirit, on behalf of this side of the House and those who subscribe to the amendment, that the mover could accept it. This could then go to the Government with the full knowledge that the people in this country of all political opinions are deeply conscious of the menace of Communism in the world to-day and that solutions are there to be found if we would but pursue them. But in doing so, we must realize that the word &#x201c;indoctrination&#x201D; is anathema. If we persist in using the word &#x201c;indoctrination&#x201D; we are then beginning to subscribe to what the communists do. That is the fundamental thing we seem to forget. Indoctrination of any kind is evil. Training, education and learning are good. I am quite convinced, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) has pointed out this morning, that if we behaved as a country, in an adult manner, realizing that all men are entitled to a share in the sun, we could be the salvation of the world. We have thrown together with us here, every caste, colour and creed. We have a tremendous field in which to work.</p>

<p>We of the United Party believe, that the solution is there to be found, if we apply our minds to the finding of it. I just want to say finally that nobody has said what a communist really is. A communist is one who has yearnings, for equal division of unequal earnings.</p>

<p>I want at the start of the few remarks that I have to make in this debate, like other speakers before me, to express my congratulations to the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) on the way in which he introduced this motion, and not only on the way in which he introduced it, but also on the way in which he put his case. The manner in which he put this case testified to a very thorough study of this matter on the part of the hon. member. It was not only the thorough study which the hon. member had made of the subject which impressed me personally but it was the way in which he applied that knowledge and the way in which he sketched world conditions for us. I want therefore to congratulate the hon. member for having initiated the debate on a particularly high level. After the hon. member for Ventersdorp the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) got up to speak. He also maintained the debate at the highest level possible for him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having listened to this debate to-day and having watched the machinations of Communism in practice, which is my daily task, it is very clear to me that no matter what may be said and what is said in the world about the academic communist, Communism in its essence and as it has also revealed itself in South Africa, is very definitely two things: It is very definitely anti-Christian and it is very definitely anti-national. It is very clear that the man&#x2014;the colour of his skin is of no importance&#x2014;who is the easiest victim of Communism is the man who has cut himself adrift from his religion and he is the man who has cut himself adrift from his own people, no matter who they might be. One sees this every day. That is why I can say that Communism in its essence is anti-Christian and anti-national. Because it is anti-national and because the liberals, not only in South Africa but throughout the whole world, reject nationalism, it is obvious to my mind that the people in South Africa who are not only primarily the victims of Communism but who, particularly because we have declared Communism to be unlawful and do not give it an opportunity to show its true colours, are easily, wittingly or unwittingly, the prime promoters of Communism, are the liberalists. I do not want to say for one moment that all liberals are communists. I have said repeatedly that this is not necessarily the case but I do not know of one single communist who has not at the same time pretended to be a liberal.</p>

<p>Listening to the speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout one would think that there was no communist danger to the rest of the world but only to South Africa and also, that if one wanted to combat Communism in South Africa successfully, the only thing to do was to vote United Party and then all danger <span class="col_2633-2634" refersTo="page_1331"/>would be avoided. I want to criticize the speech of the hon. member in this regard.</p>

There are African leaders who are not communists but I am very painfully aware of the fact that there is scarcely one single African state at the moment which does not have a leading communist in a leading position in its Government. The hon. member himself gave us the reason for this. The reason is that the communists infiltrate into all sorts of organizations. That is why it would be a very silly thing, from their point of view, if they did not also infiltrate into the Governments of the various Africa states. That is precisely what they are doing.</p>

<p>I am not exaggerating. The hon. member quoted from a document but he carefully avoided giving us the date of the document from which he quoted. No, I am not interested in it; I was only interested to know why the hon. member omitted to give us the date. He omitted to do so because he is aware of the fact that conditions have to a very large extent changed in Africa; they have deteriorated. If the hon. member is not aware of this fact then it is very difficult for me to imagine that he has any knowledge at all of affairs in Africa.</p>

<p>What is the position, Mr. Speaker? Every person who looks at the map of the world and who is at all interested in present world conditions knows what it is. If it is true&#x2014;and Western leaders warn us about this day and night&#x2014;that the danger to the world is the possibility of a conflict between East and West or, to bring it closer home, between Communism on the one hand and the Western world on the other hand, then surely it is obvious to anyone that Africa will have a specific part to play in that conflict. It is obvious that the nation or group of nations controlling Africa in that struggle will have a distinct advantage over any other nation or group of nations. That is why one is not surprised that the communists are going out of their way to try to obtain a foothold in Western Africa. The communists are now trying to obtain a foothold in East Africa and it is obvious that they will do everything in their power to gain possession of South Africa in order to achieve their goal in this regard. It is obvious that South Africa is the pearl of great price that they are presently striving to possess and if they do get their hands on her, they will have great expectations if that conflict which we all hope will not take place eventually does in fact take place. One can understand therefore why they will spare no expense and will make use of the services of their best organizers in an effort to win South Africa for Communism. When one sees the position in this light one can well understand why certain upheavals are taking place in South Africa today.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, in the opinion of this House, all statutes, proclamations and other enactments under which citizens can be deprived of their liberty without recourse to the courts of law, should be repealed.</block>

<p>It is perhaps particularly fitting that the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper should follow the debate which took place this morning. I want to say at the outset to hon. members who have been engaged in the previous debate, that it is one thing to fight Communism and quite another thing to identify <span class="col_2635-2636" refersTo="page_1332"/>Communism with liberalism, as is so often done in this country, and also to identify it with everybody who opposes apartheid. I sometimes wonder whether hon. members realize what a service they are doing to the cause of Communism by so doing &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member must not discuss the previous motion; she must now come to her own motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am leading up to my own motion. They assist the cause of Communism by telling non-Whites to identify everybody who opposes any measure, such as apartheid, with Communism. It is one thing to oppose Communism but it is another thing, however, to make assaults on the basic rule of law. My objective in placing the motion on the Order Paper, is to point out that it is another thing that in apparently fighting Communism one should go so far to the other side as to destroy the very meaning and basis of the rule of law in South Africa. My objective was to draw the attention of this House and the country as a whole to the tremendous inroads that have been made into the fundamental concept of the rule of law in South Africa, more particularly over the past 15 years. This motion is an attempt to call a brake on the disastrous destruction in South Africa of all the basic democratic values and to return, if possible, to the philosophy expressed so aptly by Burke when he said &#x201c;Liberty is a good to be improved, not an evil to be lessened&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I suppose that in this House where we usually speak two languages in more than just the literal sense, it is essential that I define my terms. In its broadest sense the term &#x201c;rule of law&#x201D; must, of course, be equated with civil liberty and all the implications meant by that term, i.e., freedom of movement, of thought, of speech, of religion, of assembly, of the right to acquire property, to take up employment and so on. These basic freedoms are accepted universally by democratic nations, subject, of course, to the one obvious limitation which I, like any other freedom loving person must accept, namely that one&#x2019;s own freedom must be limited in so far as it impinges on the freedom of other individuals.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this discussion, I shall, of course, have to boil down my definition to its very essence. Because if I tried to cover the broader definition it would take far too long. Our Statute Book is bursting with restrictions on mobility, like the pass laws, with restrictions on the acquisition of property, like the Group Areas Act, with restrictions on association, like the Separate Amenities Act and the Separate Universities Act, with restrictions on the right to take up employment, like the Job Reservation Act and so on, not to mention all the purely political Acts which inhibit these particular freedoms. All these are breaches of the broad rule of law. Many of these statutes, I might say, also embody discrimination before the law which in itself is a breach of the rule of law.</p>

<p>The purpose of this preamble, Sir, is to emphasize the often forgotten fact that &#x201c;the formal correctness of a legislative measure which is incompatible with the basic principles of human rights, makes it devoid of those ethical values that in the last analysis distinguishes it from the arbitrary exercise of power&#x201D;. Into this category fall laws like the Criminal Laws Amendment Act, the Bantu Amendment Bill, which we are discussing in the House still, and the Group Areas Act. All these deprive individuals of rights by the due process of law. This is a very important fact which should be emphasized. In other words, while there is undoubtedly rule by law, there is no rule of law. This is a very important distinction, frequently ignored particularly by members opposite who usually say &#x201c;he broke the law, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201D; when strong measures are taken against people who have protested against what are in fact unjust laws, laws in the making of which they had no say whatsoever, and against which no legitimate form of protest has been left to them.</p>

<p>I have said that for the purpose of this debate I have distilled the definition of the rule of law to its very essence and I cannot do better than to quote one of the greatest constitutional lawyers of all time, Dicey, who said that the rule of law means that no man is punishable or can lawfully be made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land. This definition implies furthermore that no man is above the law and that every man, whatever his rank, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm, be that person a humble workman, the Prime Minister himself, or indeed a policeman. It implies further that no man should be exposed to arbitrary decisions made by officials vested with arbitrary powers, and it specifically lays down that penalties for breaches of the law should only be imposed by the ordinary courts of the land. This in turn implies public trial before an experienced officer of the court, properly stated charges, properly proved, and the right of the citizen to defend himself and to have the assistance of legal advice. Even in terms of this narrow definition&#x2014;which is the burden of my motion&#x2014;South Africa&#x2019;s Statute Books are crammed with breaches of the rule of law. Even where the measures do not explicitly cut out the right of recourse to the courts of law, they are often so widely worded and they contain such widely worded powers of delegation as to make any appeal useless&#x2014;&#x201c;in the opinion of the Minister&#x201D;, or &#x201c;whenever the State President deems fit&#x201D;&#x2014;these are sentences that are sprinkled throughout our statues, so that although there is not an explicit prevention of recourse to the courts of law, in fact it is there implicitly. Because as every lawyer knows, and as the Minister knows, an appeal on the ground of <i>mala fides</i>, in respect of &#x201c;the opinion of the Minister&#x201D;, is virtually an appeal which can never succeed.</p>

<p><span class="col_2637-2638" refersTo="page_1333"/>Explicitly too, of course, there is a vast body of law which excludes recourse to the courts. It is no exaggeration to say that almost the whole of the African&#x2019;s life in this country is governed by administrative decisions against which no appeal is allowed.</p>

<p>Not all these breaches of the rule of law, explicit or implicit, can, I admit, right away, be laid at the feet of the present Government. Some of these laws date much further back than 1948. But I must say in all fairness that the manner in which they have been implemented, and of course the number that we have of them, has been greatly increased since the Government came into power. The reason is not very difficult to find. It is not, I believe, because the Government aims at despotism for despotism&#x2019;s sake. Although equally it would be foolish to deny that to-day in South Africa there are thousands of people, White South Africans, who welcome an authoritarian type of r&#x00E9;gime, who admire what they believe to be &#x201c;kragdadigheid&#x201D; and who worship the idea of a sort of father figure image. The real reason, however, is not despotism for despotism&#x2019;s sake. The real reason for the spate of laws that infringe the rule of law since the Nationalists came into power is because they are in fact necessary to bolster the structure of apartheid. The normal processes of the law are sufficient only when the majority of people to whom they apply, accept those laws and in fact approve of them. Since this is certainly not the case as far as apartheid laws are concerned, the normal processes of the law do not suffice in South Africa. This has been admirably put by Professor Lewin who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The theory of human equality which inspires the rule of law, and the theory of racial separation which inspires the South African Government, have come into collision over and over again. A Government determined at all costs to enforce apartheid in the teeth of all legal and practical difficulties, will abandon the rule of law.</block>

<p>Sir, the consent of the governed cannot be obtained. So force has to be applied.</p>

<p>Let us examine some of the measures whereby the erosion of the rule of law has been achieved in South Africa. As I mentioned earlier some of these measures were on the Statute Book long before this Government came to power, for instance the Native Administration Act of 1927, which gives powers to the Minister to banish people at any time when he considers it necessary so to do. It made possible orders of removal to remove people from where they were living to some other place indicated by the Governor-General, that is to say the Government. But until this Government actually came into power, the Native Administration Act was seldom used for purely political purposes. It was used on occasion to move tribes, very often because it was felt by the authorities that these people were endangering water supplies, or for other reasons of that sort. It was seldom, however, that the Act was used for actual political purposes. To-day of course the situation is very different. The Native Administration Act as amended is a fearsome weapon used by the Minister of Bantu Administration to remove people from their homes and banish them to distant parts of the country, mostly for opposition to Government policy, either because they oppose the Bantu Authorities Act, and sometimes of course because they oppose the implementation of agricultural improvements. I do not approve of people who oppose agricultural improvements, but I do think that it is a drastic form of punishment to banish such people without any recourse to the courts of law. I might mention that at the present stage over 40 people, according to figures which I have obtained in the House, are still languishing in banishment by the arbitrary decision of the Minister. Some of them have been there for more than ten years. Some have been in banishment for 12 years. There is no appeal to the courts. A man is given no opportunity to defend himself. He is sent away and that is the end of it, until by ministerial edict he may return, and very often when he is allowed to return, he returns under certain strict conditions or on temporary permit.</p>

<p>Then we had the Prohibition of Interdicts Act which was passed of course after this Government came into power, which makes it impossible for an African to stay an order of removal and remain where he is pending any hearing of his case. He has to leave and then he can ask for a stay <i>post hoc&#x2014;</i>a right which virtually has no value at all. But the <i>fons et origo</i> of the most far-reaching powers of course, came on to the Statute Book early after the Nationalist Government took power, the Suppression of Communism Act of 1950, as amended again and again and again.</p>

<p>As succeeding Ministers found their appetites whetted by more and more arbitrary powers, this Act was amended again and again. For power is very much like eating&#x2014;the more you eat, the more you want to eat, and the more power you have, the more power you want to have. This Act started off by giving almost uninhibited powers to the Minister of Justice to deem and list people as communists in terms of the widest possible definition of that doctrine. This is the danger, Sir, of always lumping together Communism with any other &#x201c;ism&#x201D; that happens to be opposed to the Government&#x2019;s policy, even when it comes to diametrically opposed &#x201c;isms&#x201D;, like say liberalism, which is diametrically opposed to Communism. It is at variance and at war with Communism in every possible field one can imagine. Under the widest possible definition, the Minister has the power to deem and list people under the Suppression of Communism Act, and thereafter of course he has absolute power to ban them from belonging to any organization, from attending any gathering, social or otherwise, from leaving magisterial districts. In other words, their freedom of movement can be curtailed and their liberty taken away. It is perfectly true that there is an appeal against decisions to the <span class="col_2639-2640" refersTo="page_1334"/>courts of law, but again implicit in the Anti-Communist Act is the fact that there is no real appeal, because the appeals are against &#x201c;the opinion of the Minister&#x201D;. A person appealing must prove <i>mala fides</i>, that the Minister did not give the matter his entire attention, and that in fact it is not his genuine opinion that such a person should be banned and deemed or listed and restricted in any other way, virtually an impossible appeal. No court can protect an individual against the penalties imposed on people in terms of such powers. Now of course further General Law Amendments have been passed to the original Act and other original Acts, such as the Riotous Assemblies Act, which also gives very wide powers to Ministers. That of course was also passed before the present Government came into power. To those existing powers which were wide enough in all conscience, has been added for instance the Draconian power of house arrest which may, and in fact in some cases has, deprived people of the very right to earn a living. Although the hon. Minister who introduced this particular measure told us that one of the reasons for taking powers in this way was that people should be allowed to earn a living. It was a concession. Instead of locking up people, he was allowing them to stay where they were and they could go out to earn a living. This of course is not the way in which it has been implemented. My information is that at present some 13 people are under 24-hour house arrest. I do not know how people who are under 24-hour house arrest can be expected to earn their living. What I want to point out is that these people have never been charged with any crime. They have never appeared before any court of law. Many of them have not even really been given the real reasons why they have been so confined. This is indeed one of the real powers which the Minister has taken which has precluded any access to the courts that can be of any use. They are not charged, they are not told the reasons for their detention, and some of them are even under 24-hour house arrest. They are there, of course, because in the opinion of the Minister that is where they should be. They do not even get an opportunity to ask the hon. Minister why he is of such an opinion, and they are not given the opportunity to defend themselves against that opinion.</p>

<p>Last year of course the General Law Amendment Act took us furthest along the road to despotism in South Africa. The section which gives the Minister the right to hold people in prison after they have served a term of imprisonment for a crime they have committed under certain political Acts is, I believe, a gross assault on every normal concept of justice. When a man has served a sentence for a crime that he has committed, normally until such a man commits a crime again, he goes free into society. That is the accepted concept. Punish a man for a crime that he has committed, but after that the man should be entitled to be free.</p>

<p>The 90-day detention section of course removes what is considered by most people who love freedom as an almost sacred right, that of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Over 600 people have been detained under this section. Many of those who have subsequently been released have emerged to find their lives in ruin, their jobs gone, their homes lost. This is a natural concomitant to political punishment in South Africa. Even though many of them perhaps were never charged with crimes, or perhaps immediately disclosed any information the hon. Minister may have wanted from them, or have acquitted themselves in such a way that he could let them go at once, they do not simply go back to normal life. Their lives may have been ruined. At the present stage over 70 people are deprived of their liberty under the 90-day section.</p>

<p>What is perhaps sometimes forgotten is that all these vast powers outside the law that have been taken by successive Ministers, are used in ever widening circles, very often against people who were never the intended victims when the law was first made, very often for reasons which were never advanced in the first instance by Ministers introducing the law, and in a manner not even contemplated or actually allowed in the statute. Arbitrary powers which are not subject to public scrutiny in the courts of law have an ugly habit of getting out of hand, of being used more and more recklessly to control any opponents of the ruling power. This has been found to be the case in every country where Ministers take despotic powers, and I must say to my regret that these symptoms are already very much in evidence in South Africa to-day. People had been warned or banned only for the reason that they do what they can for instance to assist people under 90-day detention or because they happen to be against apartheid. They are penalized under the anti-communist Act although in fact they have never been communists and in fact have not the slightest identification with the communists. I can mention members of the Liberal Party who have been warned, and some who have been banned, who by no stretch of the imagination could be considered to be communists. I can give two more recent illustrations, one of a warning by the hon. Minister to a woman to desist from activities which he said would be assisting in the aims of Communism. What she was doing was to assist the dependants of 90-day detainees, and she was also helping to provide legal defence for people who were accused of certain crimes. Now if an hon. Minister of Justice considers that assisting people to defend themselves in courts of law is assisting the aims of Communism, then I believe he does not know the meaning of the word &#x201c;justice&#x201D;. There is the man who was banned recently, Mr. Harris, for championing the cause of multi-racial sport. I consider that a misuse of powers which should never have been given in the first place. To ban a man for championing the cause of multi-racial sports, that is to say <span class="col_2641-2642" refersTo="page_1335"/>something that every country outside South Africa has, Sir, is a gross misuse of power in my opinion.</p>

<p>A further example, and a very serious one, is the way in which the 90-day clause is being used to smash the non-White trade union movement in this country. I can understand that the Government does not want to declare a non-White trade union an illegal organization, because the Government would run into even greater difficulties with the I.L.O. So what it cannot do directly for strategic reasons, the Government is doing indirectly by means of the 90-day section, and literally dozens, I believe, at least 35, trade union officials have been detained under the 90-day law. As far as I remember when the hon. Minister introduced the 90-day clause, he gave all sorts of blood-curdling stories about sabotage and murder, etc., as the reason for the introduction of this clause. Poqo was the main reason why it was introduced. I wonder if the hon. Minister could explain to us what non-White trade unionism has to do with murder, sabotage and Poqo?</p>

<p>Finally on this particular issue I want to repeat that these powers have the habit of getting more and more unchecked as they are used, and there is no doubt whatever that the 90-day clause lends itself to great abuses. I want to make one accusation for instance. The hon. the Minister gave us his assurance in this House during the Committee Stage of the General Law Amendment Bill last year that he was limiting the period of detention to 90 days. His very words were that he was limiting it in that way, because he realized the danger he would run in confining people in solitary confinement for any length of time. He said &#x201c;Note well, I am limiting this to 90 days&#x201D;.</p>

Minister was replying to a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition who pointed out the danger of solitary confinement for any length of time. There was an interchange between the hon. Minister and the Leader of the Opposition when he referred to his sufferings under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime during the war years. I am quite prepared to admit that that took place. But at a later stage when the hon. the Minister was defending this clause and the fact that he knew that this could break people, he staked his reputation and that of the Government that he would not break people mentally under this clause and he said &#x201c;Note well, I am restricting this to 90 days&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am prepared to submit the whole discussion to any impartial judge the hon. the Minister cares to name, to see whether it was used in the context in which I am giving it now or not. There is not the slightest danger of confusion. The hon. the Minister was discussing at that stage the danger of lengthy solitary confinement, and he gave this House the assurance that it was not going to be used for longer than 90 days. That assurance has been broken. There are people who have been in confinement for as long as 238 days. I know of one case, although he is out now. At the present time, according to the Minister&#x2019;s answers to my questions, there are two who are in for a second term, and two who are in for a third term of 90 days. I will take one example that we all know, Advocate Sachs&#x2014;the hon. Minister has stated that he would keep him there until he divulges the information that he knows he has got. I want to know at which stage is the hon. Minister going to decide that it is no use keeping this man locked up in solitary confinement? Will he keep him for ever may I ask? Is it an indeterminate sentence? These are the points which I have to raise here, because I am trying to show that not only was it a bad law when it was passed originally, but the Minister has himself allowed this law to be abused, and I am quoting chapter and verse, how this has been done.</p>

<p>Then there are the alleged assaults which have taken place because this sort of thing cannot be under proper scrutiny. I do not believe that the hon. Minister has ever given us a good reason for refusing a commission of inquiry into the whole question of assaults that have taken place, assaults which I believe have taken place throughout the country at different police stations, according to the evidence I have. Indeed, in view of the case which is on at the moment, the hon. Minister should institute an entire inquiry into this whole question of methods which are used by the police&#x2014;I do not say normally used, but which are certainly used in isolated cases.</p>

<p>Now perhaps the saddest fact of this whole sad story is that thousands upon thousands of White South Africans have become conditioned <span class="col_2643-2644" refersTo="page_1336"/>to all sorts of inroads on basic freedoms. They are punch drunk after 15 years of sustained attacks on basic freedoms. One measure after the other has been introduced and less and less reaction is encountered. One has only to read the Hansards on debates of contentious issues, on measures depriving persons of their normal rights of recourse to the courts, to see what a decline there has been in the whole calibre of opposition in this country. Correspondingly as Ministers have sensed this reaction, they have become more brazen every time when introducing legislation.</p>

<p>Five years ago our own Office of Information put out a pamphlet, 100,000 copies of it, boasting that nobody was subject to arbitrary arrest or detention in South Africa. To-day Ministers boast of the powers they have taken to do this very thing.</p>

<p>Temporary measures which were introduced to cope with emergency situations, are retained permanently as Ministers get addicted to the powers therein. Proclamation 400 remains in the Transkei though the hon. Minister has told us that conditions are perfectly peaceful there. The 12-day No-bail law which was introduced for an emergency situation is still retained, and the Minister has told us that there is peace and quiet in South Africa. Things are under control says the Minister, but he has already told us that the 90-day law is going to be retained.</p>

<p>The conditioning of the public of South Africa has been quite deliberate. Every available propaganda medium such as the Government Press and Government-controlled radio has been used. Listen to Radio South Africa: Every single disaster on the African continent is played up; every disturbance in this country is used to instil the fear of God into the White community and to condition it to accept further assaults on the rule of law. Sir, there was a lot of talk yesterday about creeping paralysis as far as the Land Act of 1936 is concerned. I say there is a creeping paralysis of McCarthyism in South Africa. The hon. member who spoke this morning made that fatal error again by identifying liberalism with Communism. Anybody who speaks up against the Government &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I want to tell the hon. member that they are diametrically opposed. He does not understand the meaning of liberalism. In any case the point is that people become intimidated in South Africa, they are frightened of being dubbed communists when they speak up against apartheid laws, and people who should speak up, are in fact intimidated into silence. People who should be speaking up do not speak up because they are frightened of losing their jobs, they are frightened of losing their passports, they are frightened of losing their import permits. In short there has been a most dangerous decay in normal value judgments in this country, characterized by all the easy justification one hears these days for the introduction of laws which would have been received with a howl of protest by most people only a few years ago. &#x201c;Law and order must be maintained&#x201D; people say. Quite right, but they should not be forgetting that laws must be just if order is to be maintained. &#x201c;Laws are necessary for self-preservation&#x201D; they say. They forget, as William Pitt once said: &#x201c;Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants. It is the creed of slaves.&#x201D; They forget too that self-preservation is the law of the jungle, not of civilization.</p>

<p>What used to be a freedom-loving nation, is now to a very great extent a nation of indoctrinated people, drunk with the heavy brew of baasskap, and flattered into acquiescence by the clever propaganda that they are a small heroic little White nation at the foot of a hostile Black continent, threatened by enemies who aim to destroy White civilization. They even say that South Africa is misunderstood by a sick world.</p>

<p>I believe that the time has come for us to take stock, to put a halt to the tragic decline in civil liberties in our country, because I believe that if the present trend is allowed to continue, South Africa will not only have lost civil liberty, she will have lost her soul. I move.</p>
