<from>Mr. PLEWMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Coloured Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) <ol>

<li>(a) What was the amount of the profit or loss of the Coloured Development Corporation, Limited, for the financial year 1962-3 and</li>

<li>(b) what is the estimated profit or loss for the nine months from April to December 1963;</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) whether the objects of the Corporation have been extended in terms of Section 3 of the Coloured Development Corporation Act, 1962; if so (a) when and (b) in what respect; and</li>

<li>(a) in how many cases and</li>

<li>(b) to what aggregate amounts were capital funds advanced by the Corporation to Coloured persons and Coloured companies, respectively, for business purposes during (i) the financial year 1962-3 and (ii) the period April to December 1963.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs" to="#plewman">

<from>The MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>The undermentioned figures refer to the Coloured Development Corporation&#x2019;s financial year, which extends from 1 October to 30 September and which does not coincide with the State&#x2019;s financial year.</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) <ol>

<li>(a) With provision for questionable loans (R10,000), the Corporation&#x2019;s net loss for its financial year 1 October 1962 to 30 September 1963 amounted to R24,788.</li>

<li>(b) An estimate of the Corporation&#x2019;s profit or loss for the nine months April to December 1963 would be extremely arbitrary and, therefore, unreliable. The Corporation&#x2019;s directorate considers, however, that its financial year 1963-4 would also close with a deficit, due mainly to the cost of after-care, which is not recovered.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(2) No&#x2014;but in terms of Section (2) of Act 12 of 1963, &#x201C;industry&#x201D; has been defined to include mining and fishing and any other activity which the State President may by proclamation declare as such.</li>

<li>(3)

<ol>

<li>(i) During the Corporation&#x2019;s financial year 1 October 1962 to 30 September 1963 capital funds were advanced&#x2014;<ol>

<li>(a) to 46 Coloured persons and 15 Coloured companies,</li>

<li>(b) to the amount of R230,160 and R236,700 respectively.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(ii) During the period 1 October 1963 to 31 December 1963 capital funds were advanced&#x2014;<ol>

<li>(a) to 14 Coloured persons and nine Coloured companies,</li>

<li>(b) to the amount of R77,300 and R150,770 respectively.</li>

</ol></li></ol>

<p>The grand total of 84 cases amounting to R694,930 is, therefore, in respect of the 15 months 1 October 1962 to 31 December 1963.</p>

<heading>Establishment of Consultative and Management Committees</heading>

<question by="#plewman" to="#minister_of_community_development">

<num>*III.</num>

<from>Mr. PLEWMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Community Development:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any consultative and management committees have been established in terms of Section 25 of the Group Areas Act, 1957; if so (a) when and (b) in which areas; and if not, why not; and</li>

<li>(2) whether any local authorities have been established in terms of Section 25<i>bis</i> of that Act, as amended by the Group Areas Amendment Act, 1962; if so (a) when and (b) in which areas; and if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_community_development" to="#plewman">

<from>The MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No. During the debate on the adoption of Sections 25, <i>25bis</i> and <i>43bis</i> of the Group Areas Act, 1957, I indicated that I would agree to ordinances by the respective provincial councils embodying the same principles as the afore mentioned sections. All four of the provinces have since adopted ordinances in terms whereof the Administrators are empowered to establish such committees. In the Transvaal two consultative committees were established on 15 October 1963 in terms of the relative ordinance in the Coloured areas of Eersterus at Pretoria and Alabama at Klerksdorp. Approval was also granted in principle for three consultative committees to be established in the Indian areas of Laudium at Pretoria, Lenasia at Johannesburg and Primindia at Brits. In the Cape Province approval in <span class="col_545-546" refersTo="page_0287"/>principle was granted for the establishment of three management committees in the Coloured areas at Bellville. Goodwood and Paarl as well as for ten consultative committees in the Coloured areas at Aliwal North, Fort Beaufort, Fraserburg, Moorreesburg, Piketberg, Prieska, Richmond, Saldanha Bay, Victoria West and Vryburg. The establishment of further committees is being considered.</li>

<li>(2) No. The desirability of establishing local authorities in terms of the provisions of Section <i>25bis</i> of the Group Areas Act, 1957, can be considered only in respect of areas where management committees already exist. In terms of the aforementioned ordinances, the powers in this connection are also vested in the respective Administrators. Such committees will, however, be established in due course.</li>

<block name="quote">That, in view of the fact that South Africa, the stronghold of Western White civilization in Africa, is to an increasing extent being threatened by a flood of malicious propaganda from outside and by subtle misrepresentations and false reports from within our own borders which are calculated to undermine our Christian way of life and continued orderly existence, this House pays tribute to the South African Broadcasting Corporation for&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_571-572" refersTo="page_0300"/>(a) its truthful, impartial and highly responsible reporting; and</li>

<li>(b) its important service to all sections of the South African population by disseminating knowledge and correct information in order to expose falsehoods and counteract malicious influences.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I gave notice of this motion on the 17th the Opposition laughed. It was a hollow laugh. I asked myself this question: Why do they laugh? I can come to no other conclusion than that the Opposition do not realize that we in South Africa constitute the bastion of Western civilization and that we are being attacked from outside by a flood of malicious propaganda, that we are subject to subtle misrepresentations and false reports from within our own borders which are aimed at creating chaos and to undermine this country without the Opposition realizing that this was happening. Sir, I can well understand why they do not realize that; they are too stupid and that is why they are still sitting in the Opposition benches to-day. Their eyes are closed; they cannot see these things and that is also why they will continue to sit in the Opposition benches.</p>

<p>I maintain that South Africa is indeed the bastion of Western civilization in Africa. I do not think anybody in his right mind would doubt that, except of course the Opposition. When we see everything that is happening around us in Africa there is no doubt that this statement of mine, namely that South Africa is the bastion of Western civilization, is correct. In view of that I want to prove that we owe a debt of gratitude to the S.A.B.C. for their sense of truthful, impartial and responsible news reporting and the important service they are rendering to all national groups, including the non-Whites as well as members of the Opposition, by the dissemination of knowledge and correct information in order to expose those falsehoods and in order to combat those malicious influences from outside. The policy of the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation is to provide the public with factual and unprejudiced news over the transmitters, news of a national, regional, international and general character. It is true that all news and information are offered in an objective and impartial way and because of their factual news value. All sides of a controversial issue are emphasized equally strongly.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Nonsense!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visse">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VISSE</person>:</from>

<p>Who is saying it is nonsense? I say anybody can try to refute that. If you cannot see anything then everything is nonsense but I maintain that you cannot see anything and that you cannot see any good in anything and for that reason everything that you do see is nonsense. I repeat that all the news and information are offered in an objective and impartial way and because of their factual news value, and it makes no difference to me whether the Opposition says it is nonsense or not. They talk nonsense.</p>

<p>Comments in the form of statements or explanations are only broadcast when they emanate from somebody in authority. Statements made by a recognized expert or authority in his official capacity and on behalf of an organization or body are broadcast. That is why anything the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) says is nonsense because he is no authority and the S.A.B.C. takes no notice of statements made by him. Nor is he an official person in his party and that is why nothing he says is broadcast and that is why the hon. member is so against the S.A.B.C. [Interjections.] Nothing that the S.A.B.C. broadcasts is in conflict with the laws of the land or with provincial ordinances. It would have been a fine thing had the S.A.B.C. broadcast anything that was in conflict with our laws or ordinances. Every business in the country and every individual is expected to observe the laws and ordinances in this country. If we do not observe the laws of the land there are laws which punish us for the offence we commit. The S.A.B.C. also complies with that; it does not contravene the laws and ordinances of the land. The S.A.B.C. complies with this norm and we on the Government side are satisfied with the way in which it does it. Although it does not propagate the policy of the Government&#x2014;I should have liked it to do so&#x2014;it is at least expected not to act contrary to Government policy and that is precisely what makes the Opposition dissatisfied. They will only be satisfied if the S.A.B.C. were to act contrary to Government policy but can you imagine what would happen, Sir, if the S.A.B.C., which is absolutely impartial, were to act contrary to Government policy and were to condemn everything the Government did? It would create chaos in the country and what is happening in other countries will happen here too, namely that every now and then a different Government will come into power by the use of force.</p>

<p>Political news of a controversial nature is only broadcast if it is authoritative and of a factual nature. As I have said the hon. member for Orange Grove is not a person who has authority in his party and I can therefore understand why he is dissatisfied when something he says is not broadcast. That is why he is always attacking the S.A.B.C. The S.A.B.C. does, however, broadcast positive statements of policy by political parties which are represented in Parliament provided they do not compare themselves with or comment on the declared policy and actions of other South African political parties. As I have said the parties must be represented in Parliament and it is only then that their policy statements are broadcast. Parties which are not represented here cannot have their policy statements broadcast over the radio. That is why no reference is made to the Liberal Party and other parties which are not represented here. That is a very sound policy of the S.A.B.C., otherwise where would it end if the policy <span class="col_573-574" refersTo="page_0301"/>of every small party were to be broadcast over the radio? Nor does the S.A.B.C. use political arguments. News that is broadcast on religion, good taste, crime, sensation, suicide and advertising is all strictly subjected to the news code. Just as well that they do so because the Press sees to that. Sensational reports appear in the Press and you do not want to hear those over the radio to which small children are continually listening. That is why it is a good thing that this type of news about crime, suicide, etc., is not broadcast over the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I state in my motion that we are being overwhelmed by a flood of malicious propaganda from outside and that there are misrepresentations and false reports within our borders. At a later stage I shall prove what attacks are made on us from outside. In the meantime I just want to add that the news items contained in the bulletins broadcast by the S.A.B.C. have three sources, namely, the staff of the S.A.B.C. itself, the regional news reporters and the corps of correspondents throughout the country. They provide the regional news which is broadcast after the main news. I do not know whether the hon. member for Orange Grove also objects to that. Secondly, they get their news from four international news agencies, namely, United Press International, Reuter, Associated Press and the French Agency and last but not least, also our local agency, Sapa. The S.A.B.C. cannot broadcast all the news it gets from these three bodies because that would probably occupy the whole day. That is why it is understandable that the staff of the S.A.B.C. go through the news they get from these three bodies very carefully to make sure that it is in accordance with S.A.B.C. policy. This news is then tested to see whether it does not offend general good taste and the public&#x2019;s sense of decency, with due regard to the cultural, social, educational, religious or economic circumstances and whether it complies with the legitimate aims of our language and cultural groups. If it complies with those requirements it is broadcast as news. I have no doubt but that the news which is broadcast by our radio complies with those requirements. It is truthful, impartial and highly responsible. It does not conflict with the laws or ordinances of the country nor does it offend religious feelings or hurt the racial groups.</p>

<p>I said I wanted to refer to the news broadcasts over overseas transmitters in connection with our internal political set-up and I want to ask the House to judge whether they comply with the demands with which the S.A.B.C. complies. I quote from an extract from a report over Radio Berlin International on 7 December 1963. Radio Berlin is in the East German Sector. A meeting was held by the German-African Friendship Society at which a certain Mr. John B. Marks was present. This Mr. John Marks is described by the East German Radio as a leading representative of the South African Liberation Movement. This Mr. Marks says, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have chosen to deal with one particular aspect of the political situation of South Africa, and that is the vicious policy of apartheid. You know that in 1948 a Nazi-inspired Government came to power in South Africa under the leadership of Dr. Malan, who was a great admirer of the late Herr Hitler, and as time went on the leadership was taken over by Strijdom, yet another great admirer of Hitler. Now it is under Dr. Verwoerd, who is a direct descendant of Hitler.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of news you get. You must ask yourself this, Sir: Is it true, is it impartial, is it responsible? It is most certainly not. But that is not all. I also have an extract here from a report broadcast over Radio Peking on 15 September 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa, the White settlers are now thinking of arming their women to fight the African Freedom Fighters. Verwoerd is now so scared that he will even send children to fight for his racial ideologies. This is but a sign of fear on the part of the White racialists against the rising forces of African Nationalism.</block>

<p>When you analyse this report, Sir, you will see that its object is to incite a certain section in our country against the Whites who are called &#x201C;settlers&#x201D;. Is that responsible, is that being impartial? It is most certainly not. As to whether it is true or not, it is certainly far from the truth. I wonder what the hon. member for Orange Grove thinks of this report? But I want to go on reading what Radio Ghana broadcast on 18 September 1963 following upon this report they had just heard over Radio Peking. They follow upon this report by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa a man named Balthazar Vorster, who carries the laughable title of Minister of Justice, confirms the fact that most White women living under the Verwoerd r&#x00E9;gime are receiving instruction from police officers on how to shoot Africans.</block>

<p>You see they go further, Mr. Speaker. Radio Peking only said that Dr. Verwoerd was arming the women to fight against the African Freedom Fighters but now it is stated that the women are shooting the Africans. [Laughter.]</p>

<block name="quote">All these acts of aggression are directed against Africans and those of African descent.

<p>Is that responsible reporting? I know we on this side of the House say it is not but I am sure the hon. member for Orange Grove will say that it is indeed responsible reporting and that it is true.</p>

<speech by="#visse">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VISSE</person>:</from>

<p>He will say it, as we shall hear in a moment. I go on and I read what Ghana says in connection with prison labour in South Africa. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa one-third of the male adult population is arrested every year for pass law offences. There are about 1,000 arrested daily for the pass laws. There are 44 jails in South Africa, and the most notorious of them are all those in the built-up areas. Those who are arrested under the pass laws after being sentenced are sold to farmers. Most of these farmers are the rich imperialists, or those of White-Dutch origin. Punishment under the pass law offences range from 18 months to two years. The well-known farmers are mostly situated in the potato-growing area of Bethal. From four in the morning till six in the evening with only ten minutes lunch-time, prisoners work in the potato fields, they are brutally assaulted and daily shambucked with a cane during the working hours. The farmers buy prisoners very cheaply, and the prison department of South Africa get a lot of money in this exchange of human currency.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, again I ask you: Is that responsible reporting? This is the sort of attack on South Africa from outside that is refuted by the S.A.B.C., by giving us a truthful, impartial and responsible news service. But the Opposition does not want to believe that. What does the Broadcasting Corporation do in order to combat this sort of news broadcasting? Before I deal with that I just want to say this: Last year during the motion of no-confidence debate the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) levelled certain attacks at the Minister of Justice and she made the allegation that detainees who were held under the 90-day provision were ill treated. When I prepared this motion and investigated these reports from overseas I discovered certain things and now I no longer believe what the hon. member said in connection with the so-called ill treatment of detainees. It was arranged beforehand by those people who get their training overseas that, in order to gain sympathy here in South Africa, not only from their supporters here but from those overseas and in order to arouse antipathy towards South Africa, they would all say that they had been assaulted and that they were given electric shocks after a cloth had been put over their heads. That is what certain detainees allege. I am sorry the hon. the Minister of Justice is not here at the moment. I just want to read what Radio Berlin International broadcast on 19 October 1963. This news item came from a Mrs. Finkelstein from South Africa who was on a visit there. She says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the main features in South Africa presently is the situation of police brutality and the oppressive laws being taken by the Verwoerd r&#x00E9;gime against the people&#x2019;s liberation struggle on the one hand and the mass of the people on the other. We have increasing and alarming reports of brutality which is growing and increasing every day. Hundreds and hundreds of people are arrested. I can give some statistics of the arrests that have taken place in the country. In March of this year, throughout April and into May, there were something like 3,500 arrests at least throughout the country. &#x2026; All these people were held in gaols through the country and left in goal just to languish there, until they were finally brought to trial.&#x2026; Up to about a month ago at least 300 people had been held against the 90-day detention Act, and it is known that increasing use of torture and brutality is being made. The Minister of Justice has just announced in Parliament that 165 people will be tried in the coming month &#x2026;</block>

<p>This report was broadcast on 19 October 1963 and we were told that the information the hon. member for Houghton had was obtained subsequent to that. I think she saw the Minister of Justice on 31 October. It is clear, therefore, that that report did not come from South Africa at all. The object was to gain the sympathy of the world outside for the detainees and to arouse antipathy towards South Africa. What does the S.A.B.C. do to counter this type of news service? They go into these reports carefully and then they invite responsible people to give talks on subjects such as Communism, for example. The S.A. Broadcasting Corporation does not dictate to the people who give these talks on Communism what to say. They are responsible and prominent people, people who would not allow themselves to be dictated to. We in South Africa will never tolerate people telling us what to say. These responsible people then give talks in which the facts and our policy are set out. But the Opposition object to that. The newspapers cannot combat that type of news because if they published such a report and then simply repudiated it the public would not read it. The radio, however, reaches everybody and because the news service of the Broadcasting Corporation is truthful we can take notice of it and in that way get behind the truth.</p>

<p>Last year the Opposition launched an attack on the Minister of Justice and alleged that the Rule of Law no longer existed in <span class="col_577-578" refersTo="page_0303"/>this country. The allegation that the Rule of Law no longer existed in South Africa was broadcast to the world outside where it was also alleged that we were no longer a democratic country. I only mention that as an example of the type of news that goes out to the world and I want to tell hon. members what the Broadcasting Corporation is doing to combat it. The Broadcasting Corporation asked the hon. F. N. Broome, a Judge, to give a talk over the radio on the Rule of Law. I cannot imagine a Judge allowing himself to be influenced by any person in the S.A.B.C., not the chairman and not even the Minister.</p>

<p>Yes, I did not even want to mention that because I do not want to associate a Judge with any political party. Let me read what this Judge said in his radio talk to counter the type of reporting to which I have referred&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No country will be able to resist the pressure of Communism for long unless it has something better than Communism to offer its people. If it has, the advocates of Communism will not make any impression; if it does not, the dark and secret aggressors will infiltrate and multiply, and sooner or later, in spite of the laws and the police and the armed forces, they will overthrow the Government.</block>

<block name="quote">Well, have we something better than Communism to offer our citizens? I think we have. Here we have the Rule of Law.</block>

<p>He then deals with the Rule of Law and he asks: What does the Rule of Law mean? It is not necessary for me to go into the meaning of the Rule of Law.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have entered into an agreement that the mover of a motion will have half an hour and the main speaker on the Opposition benches half an hour as well. I do not want to break my agreement with the Opposition. I shall consequently conclude on this note. I just want to add that I have no doubt but that the Broadcasting Corporation complies with the requirements of a truthful and impartial news service. I want to conclude by paying tribute to the S.A.B.C. and to thank them for the excellent service they are rendering to all national groups in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid that the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) missed the whole point of our criticism of the S.A.B.C. He would have seen what it actually was if he had properly read the amendment which I intend to move and which is printed in my name. He will see that in that amendment we on this side of the House deprecate and reject ill-informed broadcasts coming from overseas, but at the same time we say that the way in which the S.A.B.C. is tackling the matter is entirely wrong. One does not contest and defeat misinformation by misinformation of one&#x2019;s own. The reply to communist slanting is not Nationalist slanting&#x2014;and that is where the S.A.B.C. has broken down.</p>

<p>Sir, actually it is with a certain measure of diffidence that I rise to dispel the illusions of the hon. member for Prinshof&#x2014;the illusion about what a wonderful organization the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation is. No one can say that the hon. member for Prinshof does not deeply admire the S.A.B.C. In fact, I can even picture him, whenever the news comes on in the morning and at night, salaaming to the totem pole on Brixton Hill and expressing his view that there, after all, was the fount of all truth, and that great is The Hendrik and Albert is his prophet! Sir, I can understand that the hon. member for Prinshof feels that if you wanted the truth, you must go to the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation&#x2014;for the Nationalist truth, the traditional truth, if not the factual truth. I can quite understand that if the hon. member for Prinshof were looking for facts, he would advise us to go to the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation, which is prepared to manufacture such facts as will fit in with his theories. I can quite imagine him telling us what a wonderful organization for cleanliness and moral purity the S.A.B.C. is. In fact, he might commend the S.A.B.C. as one of the best laundering devices for brainwashing that we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, this motion of the hon. member for Prinshof is not a motion, it is a poem, it is a fragile tribute to the S.A.B.C. It is an expression of everlasting devotion to the Broadcasting Corporation. Listen to some of the words: The S.A.B.C., he says, is truthful; it is impartial; it is highly responsible; it disseminates knowledge against malicious influences. Where on other occasions we often find motions in this House thanking the Minister, this motion goes further. It does not only thank the S.A.B.C., it pays tribute to the S.A.B.C.&#x2014;tributes with rare incense and myrrh, rich gems and karosses, I presume. Sir, I think that, even at the risk of wounding the hon. member for Prinshof, I have to propose an amendment to his motion. I am afraid I cannot agree with anything in that motion except the first word, and I therefore wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;in view of the often ill-informed and slanted reports on South Africa from outside and the vital importance of giving a factual picture of events, both inside and outside South Africa, this House is of the opinion that the South African Broadcasting Corporation has failed to provide an efficient, responsible and impartial broadcasting service and consequently requests the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a commission to inquire into the matter and to recommend <span class="col_579-580" refersTo="page_0304"/>suitable measures for a complete review of the policies of the Corporation.</block>

<p>This House further&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) deplores the one-sided presentation of political material by the South African Broadcasting Corporation in news broadcasts and political talks on both the ordinary and Bantu programmes; and</li>

<li>(2) demands that equal opportunity in such broadcasts should be given for the expression of responsible opposition points of view&#x201D;</li>

</ol>

<p>Sir, I shall not seek to match the wide-eyed adulation of the hon. member for Prinshof with a completely unrelieved denigration of the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation. In fact, I am perfectly prepared to say that in many respects, outside the political talks and broadcasts, the S.A.B.C. is doing a good job. Some of the entertainment material that we get is outstanding. We have had original programmes produced in South Africa, in the studios of the S.A.B.C., of a high quality. Many of them have shown originality and initiative. The technical staff, the technical department of the S.A.B.C., has indeed done excellent work. But everything in the S.A.B.C. that is good is being destroyed by the fact that through its news broadcasts and the political talks the S.A.B.C. has been sold, body and soul, to become a slanted, vicious, petty, servile propaganda lackey of a political party. It has become a spineless, abject puppet for a sinister secret organization. It has become a robot with an automated parrot inside it. Sir, the S.A.B.C. is its own worst enemy.</p>

<p>Let us look at the motion of the hon. member for Prinshof. He claims, first of all, that the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation is truthful. Sir, when you take an oath to speak the truth you take an oath to speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I submit that the S.A.B.C. fails on all three of those counts. Does it speak the whole truth? We have heard wonderful broadcasts about the events in the Transkei, broadcasts which suited the Government&#x2014;but were we told about other events in the Transkei, since it became independent, which contradict those wonderful reports? Why was there such a terrific silence about the rather strange career of the present Minister of Justice in the Transkei, Mr. George Matanzima? The S.A.B.C. told us very little about that. When a Sabra conference is held, we hear reports of the speeches made; when an equally important conference of Institute of Race Relations is held in Cape Town, where speakers such as Professor Dr. Hobart Houghton, a member of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own Economic Council or Dr. Frans Cronje, who is by no means a leftist or a liberal, deliver speeches they are not considered fit for reporting by the S.A.B.C.</p>

<p>When a bulletin of the International Commission of Jurists was broadcast over the S.A.B.C., we heard from that bulletin how the Commission criticized racial disturbances in the United States of America, but practically the very next paragraph, in which criticism was made of South Africa, was left out of that broadcast. Some publicity has been given to the challenge issued to the hon. the Prime Minister on the Broederbond, but somewhere along the line an instruction must have gone out to the S.A.B.C., because I am told that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s words about Anglo American were never even mentioned over the S.A.B.C.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof spoke about South Africa being attacked, and about our enemies abroad. Does he realize that at one stage the S.A.B.C. actually had to apologize to the United Nations for a wrong broadcast? I have the full particulars here. The head of the News Service of the S.A.B.C., Mr. J. E. van Zyl, told the United Nations that a radio report quoting a petitioner to the world body as calling for an armed invasion of South Africa, may have been inaccurate; if it was, the Corporation regretted it. The Corporation had to apologize to a body which another speaker in a talk on the Corporation called &#x201C;a monstrous organization&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, let us next analyse whether, as the motion of the hon. member for Prinshof says, the S.A.B.C. is actually impartial. I think the motion itself condemns the hon. member because the motion in fact calls on the S.A.B.C. to be a propaganda organ, a partial organ, to be one-sided even if it was only to give the one side of the Nationalist Government. If the hon. member does not believe that, may I quote to him the words of a news broadcaster on the S.A.B.C. only a few weeks ago? These are the words of Mr. Hugh Rouse, whom I think we all know. In addressing the Johannesburg Junior Chamber of Commerce in November, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Perhaps I speak too freely&#x2014;but there should be someone to speak up.&#x201D; Mr. Rouse appealed to South Africans not to become prejudiced and narrow-minded but &#x201C;to look into a widening perspective of life&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Then Mr. Rouse went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was, therefore, most undesirable for a public utility such as the S.A.B.C. to represent any one particular point of view.</block>

<p>But if that does not yet satisfy the hon. member for Prinshof, let me quote to him the words of the S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s Director of Programmes, Mr. Douglas Fuchs. He wrote a letter to a certain Mr. R. Lamb, which was handed to the Press, and in that letter the Director of Programmes said this (in October last year)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think it needs to be made clear that impartiality is a fine thing, but are there no limits to its application?</block>

<p><span class="col_581-582" refersTo="page_0305"/>The Director of Programmes of the S.A.B.C. therefore believes that limits should be set to impartiality! Actually the Director was replying to criticism made of a series of political talks delivered by a certain gentleman, Mr. Ivor Benson, who regularly broadcasts over the S.A.B.C. network. I think I should say something more about this gentleman, because his talks have constituted one of the main bones of contention which ordinary listeners have had with the S.A.B.C. Mr. Benson was at one time a reporter on the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, and then he became a Nationalist. It might be <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i>, but in any case I am not saying that. Nor am I associating myself with all the attacks made on Mr. Benson. I have heard one or two of his talks which are to a certain extent acceptable. I found a talk of his in which he exposed some of the South Africans broadcasting behind the Iron Curtain most interesting and factual. But having said that I should say that the talks of this gentleman have shocked the feelings of all those who believe that the airwaves should not be sullied, as they are by Moscow or Peking, by one-sided propaganda. Mr. Benson has torn the mask of impartiality from the face of the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation, revealing it as a shameless trumpeter of Nationalist Party propaganda. There is no denying the fact that on occasion those talks have been biased, argumentative, illogical and unfair. I have here a booklet sent to me by the S.A.B.C. containing the talks of Mr. Benson. It is unbelievable, Sir, but actually they are now publishing those talks in a booklet. Sir, you would never believe me, but it was actually printed by <i>Dagbreek</i>. Let us look at some of the things said by this gentleman, Mr. Benson. The hon. member for Prinshof claims the S.A.B.C. is impartial and unbiased. Listen to Mr. Benson, their propagandist, himself. He says this, about himself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your news commentator is a highly biased individual.</block>

<p>Mr. Benson calls himself a highly biased individual; how can the hon. member for Prinshof say there is impartiality in the S.A.B.C.? Here is an example of the reporting in those political talks. He said on one occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So as not to keep you too long in suspense, let me say that one news story of the last 24 hours, which made so strong an impression on me, was that dealing with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s triumphant break-through in English-speaking Durban.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to judge from that news talk one would have thought that Durban had gone Nationalist, that the Durban City Corporation had a Nationalist mayor and a Nationalist City Council and that all seats would be won by the Nationalist Party. But as Mr. Benson says himself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The point I have always tried to make is that there is nothing wrong with bias as such.</block>

<p>I can go on, Sir, and point out how he made an entirely unwarranted political attack on the Christian Institute which he associated with Mr. Soapy Williams just as he associated the World Council of Churches with the communists. This was what Mr. Benson said in one of his talks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Therefore the big question that needs to be thoroughly explored in South Africa, where the Christian Institute plans to launch a great campaign for membership is this: Who is behind it? Who is planning to use it? And for what purpose?</block>

<p>This is an employee of the S.A.B.C. talking&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Part of the answer we should be able to get for ourselves without much difficulty. We also know that some of our newspapers, like Mr. Soapy Williams, see &#x201C;a spark of hope&#x201D; in the new institute, and already the <i>Sunday Times</i> is campaigning for it vigorously.</block>

<block name="quote">So it is safe to say that what the institute stands for, that also the <i>Sunday Times</i> stands for.</block>

<p>In another talk he attacked the Christian ecumenical movement, the movement which tried to get the churches of the Christian faith closer together. He attacked them in these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The communist front has virtually captured the modern ecumenical movement. This means that a movement which has always had as its aim the bringing together of all the churches of Christendom in a closer unity of faith has passed into the hands of men whose dominating motive is revolutionary political change, aimed at bringing all mankind under the sway of a single centre of power.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is an unfair attack on 99 per cent of the Christian churches that belong to the World Council of Churches; it is an unfair attack on Christians accusing them of being influenced by and being taken over by communists. If that is not unfair, Sir, I should like to know what is.</p>

<p>But why listen to what I have to say? Why do we not read some of the condemnations out of their own mouths? South Africa&#x2019;s premier Nationalist columnist&#x2014;I admit he is&#x2014;is Dawie of the <i>Burger</i>. He complained about the politics of the S.A.B.C. I shall read what he wrote in translated form. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Political opinions are once more being broadcast by Radio South Africa. The difference is that these opinions are not being expressed by outsiders of differing points of view but by Radio South Africa itself without contradiction.</block>

<p><span class="col_583-584" refersTo="page_0306"/>Dawie went on and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By doing so Radio South Africa has taken upon itself the role of saying what it thinks about what appeared in certain English newspapers on political issues These are strong and decisive opinions and therefore most controversial and there is no opportunity for discussion or refutation.</block>

<p>Is that a defence of impartiality? Then Dawie says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want strongly to advise the radio authorities to quit as soon as possible the field of everyday politics in which the radio is a traditional amateur.</block>

<p>And so say all of us.</p>

<p>The third part of the motion of the hon. member for Prinshof states that the S.A.B.C. was highly responsible in its broadcasts. May I ask the hon. member for Prinshof, or any member on that side, whether the incidents connected with the broadcast of the opinions of the Reverend Beyers Naud&#x00E9; were a highly responsible act, when it was followed by an interruption of the ordinary programme by a special announcement from the Broederbond denying what Reverend Naudd had said&#x2014;with no opportunity of refuting that accusation after wards?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) cannot be here to-day. He wrote to Mr. Fuchs, the Director of Programmes, about this interruption of an ordinary broadcast to announce a special statement by the Broederbond. Mr. Fuchs replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is nothing contrary to normal practice in amending programmes for the inclusion of these statements which were of highly topical interest. As to whether we were right in amending the programme, the test is quite simple:</block>

<p>Can it be justified on the ground of public interest?</p>

<p>Is the defence of a secret society, a non public society, of public interest in South Africa? Did the S.A.B.C. find out who the spokesman were of the Broederbond? Did they find out what authority there was behind that statement? Was it issued by the secretary? By the chairman? By the High Council? By the chairman of the S.A.B.C. itself? Mr. Speaker, that, too, shocked the <i>Burger</i> and Dawie, its columnist. Dawie said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Broederbond documents are unfortunately not as worthy as they are interesting. Sometimes it seemed to me that people who should have known better were busy playing a sort of cowboys and robbers game.</block>

<p>The S.A.B.C. was not being impartial, it was not being responsible. Its own newspapers say they were playing cowboys and robbers in that particular broadcast. Dawie added this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Imagine&#x2014;ordinary radio programmes were interrupted with statements and counter-statements about the Broederbond, as if a national emergency had suddenly arisen. Does not this indicate a potential dangerous lack of emotional balance? We have reason to feel heartsore over a lack of wisdom in certain high circles.</block>

<p>As I wish to adhere to the agreement as regards the length of my speech, I cannot go into many other details and give further examples that I have of the highly irresponsible actions of the S.A.B.C. I could have mentioned the attack made by the hon. the Minister of Justice on Nusas without the latter being given an opportunity of replying. I could have told you about the very strange case of Mr. Eric Louw&#x2014;I beg your pardon, Sir, Dr. Eric Louw&#x2014;we seem to have left behind those good old colonial days when even a witchdoctor had to study for his degree&#x2014;attacking the S.A.B.C. for having placed him in an embarrassing position by having attacked the United Nations radio. The Minister of Foreign Affairs said, and it was published in the Press&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of the attitude taken up by the South African Broadcasting Corporation and the consequent newspaper publicity I have been placed in a very embarrassing position.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, embarrassing Mr. Eric Louw&#x2014;well! You might as well try to make Miss Keeler blush.</p>

<p>I want to make some positive suggestions as to what should be done. We on this side are concerned about the fact, that the programmes of the S.A.B.C., particularly the English programmes, are losing their listener-ship on a vast scale. A recent survey has shown that eight times as many Afrikaans listeners listen to the A-programme news as those who listen to the B-programme news in English. What are the reasons, Sir, for this criticism throughout the whole of the country? First of all, I believe the news sources are inadequate. The hon. member mentioned many news services. Did he mention the fact that his own Minister had attacked Sapa which is one of the sources of news of the broadcasting service? I believe it is entirely wrong that there should be such close ties between the Department of Information, the Cabinet, and the S.A.B.C. And I believe it is undesirable, highly undesirable, that Government Departments, such as the Department of Bantu Administration and the Department of Information, should be represented directly on certain important S.A.B.C. bodies.</p>

<p>I object furthermore to the fact that there is too close a tie, not only indirectly but directly, between the S.A.B.C. and that underground secret society, the Broederbond. If you want to know where the tie is, where the link is, Sir, you need only look right to the top, to the chairman of the Broederbond who <span class="col_585-586" refersTo="page_0307"/>is also chairman of the S.A.B.C. I also say there is too close a tie between the S.A.B.C. and certain large newspaper interests in South Africa. I am not accusing the hon. the Minister of using his position in any way unfairly as a member of the board of directors of one of the country&#x2019;s great newspaper companies, but I do say that the appearance of impartiality must be there. There is one thing that he must consider and that is to resign his directorship of that newspaper company, particularly after a statement he had made in which he said that if television were to be introduced the Afrikaans newspapers would lose a great deal of their advertising.</p>

<p>Sir, there are specific remedies that I wish to recommend. First of all I recommend that it be laid down in the licence which the hon. the Minister grants under Section 15 of the Broadcasting Act to the S.A.B.C., that its news should be impartial. It should be laid down as a condition of that licence that political broadcasts of a controversial kind should not be permitted. That, Sir, is part of the licence issued in Britain to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Why can that not be done in South Africa? Why should the licence of the S.A.B.C. not also contain a prohibition on broadcasts of its own opinion on current affairs and public policy? Surely that is a fair request? Why can it not be stated in the licence? Why can it not be stated in the licence of the S.A.B.C. that it is not allowed to broadcast its own opinions on controversial issues? And, if it insists on broadcasting on controversial issues, it gives the other side an equal chance. That is my second recommendation: If the Minister does not agree to laying down those conditions let him then at least see to it that Nationalist-orientated speeches are balanced by speeches from a responsible Opposition point of view.</p>

<p>Thirdly I recommend that the S.A.B.C. should be made subject to the fine code of conduct of the Press Board. Is the S.A.B.C. afraid to subscribe to that clause in the Code of Conduct that news should be impartial, that it should be truthful and that it should not be slanted? Why are they afraid to sign that Code of Conduct? Fourthly, let the direct ties with Government Departments be cut. Fifthly, let the hon. the Minister himself break those close ties of association that he has with the big newspaper companies. After all the S.A.B.C. is a competing medium of news. Sixthly, let the listeners who pay for the S.A.B.C. have the way in which their money is being spent on news broadcasts regularly investigated. Let the books of the S.A.B.C. be subject to control by the Auditor-General. And seventhly, do as we ask in this amendment&#x2014;appoint a Commission of Inquiry into all these matters.</p>

<p>I want to say in conclusion that nothing would have given me greater pleasure, had we had a broadcasting corporation of the character that all of us on this side of the House desire, than to have seconded, albeit in less flowery language, the motion of the hon. member for Prinshof. But I believe the South African Broadcasting Corporation has failed and to my regret, I therefore move this amendment which is standing in my name.</p>

<p>A second attack was launched against the S.A.B.C. in regard to the broadcast about the Broederbond. I want to deal with that for a few moments. The hon. member&#x2019;s attack amounts to this, that the normal services of the S.A.B.C. were interrupted to broadcast this minor squabble in the Broederbond. That is his attack at the moment.</p>

<p>I say the hon. member said it. Now I want to rectify that immediately. The programmes of the S.A.B.C. are drawn up at least six weeks before the time and sent to the printers so that the S.A. Radio Bulletin can be printed. It is logical that when one draws up a programme six weeks beforehand, and it is the task of the S.A.B.C. to disseminate information from day to day and to remain <i>au fait</i> with developments, it cannot adhere to that programme, otherwise it will be an inflexible institution. The result is that the S.A.B.C. from time to time interrupts <span class="col_587-588" refersTo="page_0308"/>its programmes in order to broadcast serious and urgent matters of interest. That was not the first time that a programme was interrupted. Surely the hon. member knows that. There was an interruption when President Kennedy was buried. The English programmes were interrupted for the whole of that day in order to broadcast that funeral.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall continue, Sir. Now I want the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) to listen. The S.A.B.C. interrupted its programme on 10 December at 6.5 p.m., to broadcast to pay a tribute to the late Senator Fagan. I challenge the hon. member to ask again: Do you want to compare that? The S.A.B.C. did so because the late Senator Fagan was a poet and a figure in Afrikaans cultural life. It interrupted its programme on 15 December when the programme &#x201C;Die Mag van die Melodie&#x201D; was cancelled in order to broadcast &#x201C;Die Opmars van die Sprinkane&#x201D;&#x2014;a programme in regard to how the locust plague was being combated. The suspension of programmes in order to broadcast current events is therefore nothing new, and therefore it is not relevant. That portion of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument therefore falls away.</p>

<p>The second part of his argument is that the Broederbond question was an insignificant matter and that it was not necessary to broadcast it. Then he says that the case for the Broederbond was put by the Broederbond organization. I have the information here. It is quite clear that this programme which was broadcast in connection with the Broederbond was based on reports received from Sapa. They were not received from the Broederbond, but from Sapa-Reuter. The statement made by the Rev. Beyers Naude was received, and also the reply to it by the Broederbond, as news reports sent by Sapa to the S.A.B.C. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Secondly, Dr. Beyers Naude was not an insignificant figure. He was Moderator of the N.G. Kerk in the Southern Transvaal, the Church with the most White members in the whole Republic of South Africa. He is therefore a prominent figure, and when he makes a statement in regard to a certain matter and there is a reply, and Sapa regards it as being newsworthy, then the S.A.B.C. would be neglecting its duty if it did not broadcast that news. Tremendous prominence was given to this matter in the newspapers, particularly in the north. I was not in Cape Town then and I do not know what happened here. The S.A.B.C. must keep pace with events; it must give the information, and it gave the information. It broadcast the verbatim statement of the Rev. Naude and the reply to it by that organization. The hon. member says that was an unimportant matter and that the S.A.B.C. was put at the disposal of the Broederbond. Both sides of the picture were given. The hon. member mentioned the example of N.U.S.A.S. I do not even want to discuss that. That was another instance where the programmes were interrupted to broadcast both a statement by the chairman of N.U.S.A.S. and one by the Minister of Justice.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>The attack and the reply were given. The hon. member knows that if once the one side has replied, then the other side wants to reply also. When must it stop then? I think the hon. members of the Opposition are obsessed with the Broederbond these days. The Broederbond is dragged into every debate holus bolus, whether it is relevant or not.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the task of the S.A.B.C. is to reflect the daily life of South Africa in the light of the dynamic, energetic development which is taking place in terms of our national policy. I state clearly that that is its task. In the radio we have a mighty medium to perform this task, of one remembers that the radio in fact is in contact with the whole of the world. There are more than 10,000 radio stations in the world, and 400,000,000 radio sets, according to an estimate which was made. In South Africa alone there are more than 2,000,000 receiving sets by means of which it is estimated that approximately 5,000,000 people listen in. At the moment there are 1,250,000 paid radio licences in South Africa, of which 128,000 are non-White licences. Talking about non-Whites, I may just mention in passing the tremendous power of the radio, the talks given over the Bantu news services, and the influence it exerts. A year ago the S.A.B.C. received 20,000 letters from Bantu every month. It is a mighty method of communication, and therefore a tremendous responsibility rests on the S.A.B.C., and also on those who attack it, to be reasonable in all respects in approaching these matters.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; objected to the fact that the S.A.B.C. interprets and depicts the way of life in South Africa, as it is at present. I want to ask the hon. member whether he objects to this mighty medium exercising all the influence it can to build up South Africa in this country and overseas? Does he object to this body being used to propagate South Africa&#x2019;s way of life and its culture, both in this country and overseas? Does he object to its being used to protect South Africa against attacks from outside by giving people the correct information? The hon. member uses the argument that it is a crime against South Africa for the S.A.B.C. to be partial to and to make propaganda for the Government, as he says it does. Let me tell him this. If it is a crime to promote the interests of South Africa within the framework of accepted conventions and customs in the Republic, if it is a crime to try to promote sound relations between all population groups of the country, White and non-White, if it is a crime to reflect in all its programmes that which is sound and noble in the way of life and the culture of every population group, if it is a crime to refuse to vilify South Africa and to weaken the confidence in the country, to foster unrest and to encourage subversive groups by giving publicity to their activities and their meetings, if it is a crime to refuse to promote agitation against laws passed by the democratically-elected representatives of the people, if it is a crime to give information in regard to Communism and one sided, distorted Press reports, thereby to restore the balance on the part of the public so that they, with all the facts available to them, can form their own opinions, if it is a crime to be pro-South Africa, then the S.A.B.C. is definitely guilty of that crime. No, Sir, if it promotes the interests of South Africa in the mind of the listener, then the S.A.B.C. is really a law-abiding citizen who does his duty towards his country and his people, and then the criminal sits over there in the bench of the hon. member for Orange Grove, who is fomenting unrest and is being an instrument in the hands of people who subvert South Africa. According to those hon. members, the Government is being benefited. What is the policy of the S.A.B.C.? I cannot deal with everything, but what is the policy of the S.A.B.C. in respect of political matters?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I said that if what I say is true then that hon. member is the criminal who vilifies South Africa. If he does not do so, then he is innocent. He himself can decide whether he is guilty or not. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) has now wasted my time. I hope I get injury time.</p>

<p>The next point I want to mention is the advantage derived by the Government through the S.A.B.C. I want to say immediately that the S.A.B.C. has a specific policy in regard to political matters. That policy is that only people clothed with authority to talk on behalf of those whom they represent, and who in fact have the power to put their policies into effect by democratic and constitutional means, are accepted by the S.A.B.C. as policy makers. During the referendum in 1960 there was a circular in which the S.A.B.C. stated its standpoint very clearly. I have the English version of it here, and they put it as follows&#x2014;and that will give the hon. member an idea of whom the S.A.B.C. regards as leaders and as policy-makers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The political leaders will include only the following: From the Nationalist Party side the Prime Minister and the other members of the Cabinet. The Deputy Ministers are not members of the Cabinet and any statements of policy by any of them must be referred to the acting head of the news before they are used. On the United Party side: The Leader of the Party, Sir de Villiers Graaff, the provincial leaders of the provinces &#x2026;</block>

<p>In those days it was still the late Mr. Swart&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Tucker. Further we have three chairmen of the party&#x2019;s departmental committees, Mr. Marais Steyn (information), Dr. Louis Steenkamp (youth affairs) and Mr. Higgerty (finance). No other Nationalist or United Party speakers will be regarded as policy makers. No notice will therefore be taken of speeches or statements by other party speakers.</block>

<p>The hon. member should therefore achieve some status in his own party before he can receive the publicity he would like. In his own party he does not enjoy the necessary attention. Sir, in so far as impartiality is concerned, in regard to the General Laws Amendment Bill, 9,590 words were broadcast by the S.A.B.C. to state the Government&#x2019;s standpoint, and 9,850 words to state the standpoint of the Opposition. In other words, I think we are really the people who can accuse the S.A.B.C. of favouring the Opposition and of giving them more publicity than they deserve. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Impossible? Let me put it this way, that I do not find it necessary to reply, because what the hon. member said was of a personal nature, was extravagant and not correct. Mr. Speaker, you yourself had to call the hon. member to order, and I think it is necessary that we should draw the attention of this House to the language used by the hon. member. In referring to the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan), the hon. member said that the hon. member for Orange Grove would have to acquire more importance in the eyes of his own party before his words would be broadcast. May I lay those very same words at the door of the hon. member for Randfontein, that he should gain in importance in his own party. According to what he himself quoted in regard to the Broadcasting Corporation, he is not important enough to be heard over the radio. The hon. member spoke about what happened at the time of the referendum for the Republic, but may I remind him that at that time there was still a semblance of impartiality in regard to the S.A.B.C. May I remind him that at that time the &#x201C;News from Parliament&#x201D; was a good service enjoyed by everybody, and may I remind him that during this present Session when the no-confidence debate was opened here, the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation instead of broadcasting what the Leader of the Opposition, whose motion it was after all, had to say, they started off by dealing with the tedious speech of the hon. the Prime Minister who bored the House for three solid hours. Sir, that was a no-confidence debate. If that was an example of impartiality, then I have nothing further to say. Is that impartiality that when a no-confidence debate is broadcast, you start off with the reply of the hon. the Prime Minister?</p>

<p>He was worried about what he stated had been said by the hon. member for Orange Grove, but it is to me so evident that the hon. member for Randfontein has not even got ears to listen, or he has no brain to take in what he hears. The hon. member for Orange Grove was quoting from the <i>Burger</i>. He was not expressing his own views at all, but was quoting what &#x201C;Dawie&#x201D; of the <i>Burger</i> had said.</p>

<p>I want to say that the part that the South African Broadcasting Corporation should play in South Africa is the most important one of any public body in this country. I want to say that because of our peculiar position, this is even more true in South Africa than in any other country in the world, as I shall show. In the rest of the world people get news services from all sources; they have television, they have many more newspapers than we have in South Africa. I am thinking of the big cities in America for instance where you have the choice of seven morning papers and seven evening papers. Here if you want an English-speaking paper in the morning, you are limited to one. And the same applies to the Afrikaans-speaking newspapers. In other countries there are independent radio services that are competitive with one another, and so people listen to a variety of news and viewpoints and they can form their own opinion. In other countries religious parties as well as political parties have the right to put their points of view over the radio, because, as I have said, there are many radio stations that are privately owned and therefore independent. Here in South Africa we are very limited, and it is because of that that the Broadcasting Corporation should in its news services and its talks be entirely independent and it should not put over only Government policy. Because I want to state here categorically that South Africa is so unpopular overseas because of Government policy, and the only redeeming feature in regard to South Africa in the world to-day is the fact that there is still a strong Opposition.</p>

<p>What do we find? We find attacks on other people and on other nations, and we find that the S.A.B.C. is not even willing, as the hon. member for Orange Grove has said, to limit itself to the Press code which it itself has said is so good. There is a provision in the Press code that where people and institutions are attacked, they must have the opportunity to reply through the same medium. What have we here? We have a one-sided presentation of news, favouring the Government, and attacking anybody who differs from the Government. We have got news services and talks about &#x201C;Apartheid&#x201D; and race relations, news services that talk about &#x201C;so-called Progressives and fellow-travellers&#x201D;. We had the story that it is the duty of the Press and the S.A.B.C.&#x2014;and the hon. member who introduced it said it, as well as the hon. member for Randfontein&#x2014;to protect the South African way of life. I agree. It is the duty of the S.A.B.C. to protect South Africa, but not by preaching Government policy, because, as I have said, that is hated by the whole world. It is most interesting to see how quick the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation is to criticize anybody else who from their point of view does not do justice to this Government&#x2019;s ideas and points of view. I was interested to note that the hon. member for Prinshof quoted all sorts of radio broadcasts, from Peking, from Ghana, from heaven knows where, he spent most of his time in telling us what other broadcasting services of the world do. He spent very little time telling us what our own broadcasting service is saying. But this is what the S.A.B.C. had to say, speaking about the British broadcasting service&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In &#x2019;n radiopraatjie gisteraand oor die Engelse en Afrikaanse senders van die <span class="col_593-594" refersTo="page_0311"/>SA.U.K. is &#x2019;n kort opsomming van die B.B.C. se beleid insake die nuus wat hy aanbied, uitgesaai.</block>

<p>Then they continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Volgens mnr. Boshoff het die B.B.C. in die tyd 54 keer kritiek teen Suid-Afrika toegelaat en net tien keer is die geleentheid gebied om die ander kant van die saak te stel.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, they gave at least ten opportunities. But what happens in South Africa? We do not even get the chance to get one minute for our side. Other speakers have pointed out that the news that is presented by the S.A.B.C. is not always correct either, and I want to quote two examples. The one is that when the hon. Minister of Justice in this House discussed a newspaper report about &#x201C;accepting briberies in regard to liquor licences by M.P.s&#x201D; and when the hon. Minister stated that that particular report had been published in the <i>Vaderland</i> or <i>Sondagblad</i>, what happened? The S.A. Broadcasting Corporation brought this news but they omitted the name of the particular paper. Their version was that the offending report had appeared in a Johannesburg Sunday newspaper. Knowing full well how all the time they are accusing the English language Press of wrong information, why did they not in that instance say very clearly what paper it was? Because this was a most serious matter, because it impugned the honesty of members of this House, and it should at least have been stated which newspaper in particular was responsible for this statement.</p>

<p>I want to quote something else. We have had from the Government side lately a great wooing of the English-speaking people of South Africa.</p>

<block name="quote">Whether or not the order issued against her was too strict, is therefore purely a matter of opinion.

Punishment without trial is without doubt a violation of the Western concept of justice. On the other hand, it is a violation which is not confined only to South Africa.</block>

<p>Of course it is not true and the British Government stated emphatically that it was not so. But why give incorrect information? The English Government has stated that people had been gaoled after having been tried for being in possession of explosives, or committing sabotage acts and things like that, and it was stated that at that particular time there was not one single person in goal in that connection. Sir, this was misleading information, misleading information about people who have their origin in Great Britain &#x201C;the English-speaking friends&#x201D;, the hon. member for Cradock is talking about. Sir, I regret but I have to say that I must vote in favour of the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Orange Grove which says &#x201C;in view of the often ill-informed and slanted reports on South Africa&#x201D;, we ask that a commission of inquiry be appointed to go into the whole matter.</p>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members of the Opposition are undoubtedly very grateful for the new rules which now apply to this debate and in terms of which they have only a certain time in which to talk, because thus far all the speakers on that side have said that they lacked the time to give certain facts. Sir, the facts we have been given so far are all so-called facts which we have already heard in this House before, old matters they are raking up, and no new facts have come to light. The hon. member for Orange Grove said that the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) probably made his salaams to the Hertzog Tower every morning when the news was broadcast. I want to tell the hon. member that not only the hon. member for Prinshof salaams the Hertzog Tower, but all the hon. members opposite, and all the inhabitants of the Republic will still one day bend down to salaam the Hertzog Tower as a mark of gratitude for the guidance it gave in broadcasting news impartially and in putting matters impartially to the people of the Republic of South Africa, in such an impartial manner that we will have peace in this country, and we will make our salaams to them because they are responsible for the rapid development we are experiencing <span class="col_595-596" refersTo="page_0312"/>at the moment. If it were not for the impartial manner in which the S.A.B.C. has acted, we would surely have had great dissatisfaction and race riots already in the Republic of South Africa. But those hon. members come here to-day with a few isolated instances. One would have expected the hon. member for Orange Grove to come along with new attacks, but he again dragged the ex-Minister of the Interior into this matter, and he spoke about things which have become so sawn off already that nobody wants to listen any longer.</p>

<p>Let us take the amendment moved by the hon. member for Orange Grove. His complaint against the S.A.B.C. is that it is not efficient. He himself admitted that it was efficient, and every member of this House and every person outside will tell the hon. member that it is nonsense to say that the S.A.B.C. is not efficient. On the contrary, it can be proved that there is no similar organization which is as efficiently organized as the S.A.B.C., and we want to give it all the credit for that.</p>

<p>I come to the second point. He says that the S.A.B.C. is irresponsible. Sir, can the hon. member mention a single case to this House and to the outside world where the S.A.B.C. has acted irresponsibly? I will deal in a moment with his allegation in regard to news broadcasts which are biased. Sir, what is the task of the Broadcasting Corporation? Is it not to educate, to inform and to amuse its listeners? Is that not its most important task? And I want to allege to-day that the S.A.B.C. has succeeded in a masterly fashion in acquitting itself efficiently of those tasks entrusted to it. The S.A.B.C. has to-day succeeded in reaching the masses in South Africa. Just as in any environment we find that the local daily newspaper exerts influence and that the subscribers to that paper pay heed to what it says, in the same way the S.A.B.C. has spread its wings further and wider over the Republic, and it has instilled confidence into the inhabitants of the Republic, irrespective of their language or religious beliefs or political convictions, and the people have begun to trust in the guidance given to them by the S.A.B.C. to-day.</p>

<p>The S.A.B.C. has a very difficult and unenviable task to perform. Its task is different from that of the daily newspaper which appears every day. The newspaper has its subscribers who accept its views, but the S.A.B.C. must satisfy everybody, irrespective of their language, their religion, or their superstitions, whether they be young or old, rich or poor, clever or stupid, educated or illiterate. It must comply with the needs of everyone. And it must not satisfy those needs for a few minutes only, but for many hours every day. Has not the S.A.B.C. in masterly fashion succeeded in performing that unenviable task of satisfying all these different people? But if we are to believe the hon. member for Orange Grove, the S.A.B.C. has not succeeded in doing so, because he says it has not broadcast the views and standpoints of the various political parties. I want to say that the S.A.B.C. has succeeded in broadcasting to the inhabitants of South Africa from time to time the views of the various parties. We found that during the recent session the standpoint of the United Party was broadcast to a greater extent than the views of members on this side of the House. But did that benefit the Opposition in any way? No, they lost two members. Therefore my advice to them is that the less we hear about them, the better things will go with them.</p>

<p>Now the hon. members for Orange Grove and Drakensberg say that the S.A.B.C. is prejudiced in the views it broadcasts. I want to ask any hon. member opposite: Did any of those hon. members during the past session receive letters from their White voters objecting to the prejudiced broadcasts of the S.A.B.C., and do they have those letters in their offices so that they may be produced? And, secondly, did they receive any letters from Bantu in the Republic objecting to the biased broadcasts of the S.A.B.C.?</p>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>If there are any hon. members who have such letters, I should like them to produce them. The first hon. member opposite who follows me can say whether they have such letters.</p>

<p>I go further. In 1961 a report appeared on the front page of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>. The matter really started on 19 April 1961 in the <i>Star</i>, in which the following was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The campaign against politics over the air, the use of the S.A.B.C. for political propaganda, was taken a step further to-day.</block>

<p>Then they say further that a meeting was held and that they would ask the people to set in motion a chain-letter reaction to write to the Ministers in connection with the matter. On 1 December 1961 we found a report on the front page of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> to the effect that the Black Sash had started drawing up petitions right throughout the Republic. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has ever received any of these letters, and how many petitions he received from people objecting to the prejudiced broadcasts by Radio South Africa. I should be glad to get this information from the Minister in view of this tremendous campaign waged against the S.A.B.C. Did anyone take notice of it? Was anyone interested in it? What was the result of these petitions? Was there any reaction on the part of the ordinary listeners?</p>

<p>There is something which hon. members opposite do not understand. They do not realize what the task of the S.A.B.C. is. Its task is to achieve racial peace and to preserve it in our multi-racial country, by providing complete, balanced and true information for its listeners. I allege that the S.A.B.C. has succeeded wonderfully in this task entrusted <span class="col_597-598" refersTo="page_0313"/>to it, and I say further that the great majority of the listeners in the Republic, and the great majority of the inhabitants of South Africa, with the exception of a handful of agitators who sit there and tell us all this nonsense, and who talk about malpractices in the S.A.B.C., are highly satisfied. The rest of the listeners are quite satisfied with the services they receive, and we thank the S.A.B.C. for the wonderful services they render in such an impartial manner.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>As requested by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout), I commence with a salaam to the Hertzog Tower. I hope that that satisfies him. I accept the challenge that he issued in regard to what I think can be called the exchange of letters. I put it to him this way: Providing he is prepared to exchange with me any file on any one subject about which he has received letters, or I have received letters, that affect the government of South Africa, including the broadcasting system, I accept that challenge&#x2014;on the undertaking that he will publish the letters which I have received and that I have permission to publish the letters that he has received about Government policy. I am prepared to accept such an offer now, because if he were to go through his files&#x2014;I do not expect him to confirm or deny what I say&#x2014;he will find so many letters complaining of the S.A.B.C. and other aspects of Government policy, that he will not venture to mention the subject again. The difficulty we have here is that, as usual, we have to discuss this question of the S.A.B.C. and its policy in regard to news and talks, in a sort of vacuum. There is no comparison that we can make with any other system in this country, by virtue of the very cosy monopoly which the S.A.B.C. enjoys, and which, in regard to the news and talks that it offers to the public, it abuses. I agree entirely with the hon. member for Orange Grove when he says that in other respects the S.A.B.C. renders excellent service. We may differ about the type of music it plays from time to time, but tastes differ; and we can perhaps find minor criticisms of some of its educational activities&#x2014;but other than that, and leaving out completely the question of the news services and those talks which come under the heading of news, we do not quibble with the efficiency and the good intentions of the S.A.B.C. it is when we come to the question of opinions, which should be used to give a fair cross-section of opinions in all parts of South Africa and of all political parties, that the impartiality of the S.A.B.C. breaks down completely. To-day we have the position where it voices the policy of the Prime Minister and the Government to the exclusion of any other policy, and of any other point of view. If I were asked to point to the evidence of that, I dare say that I might be challenged on the basis that the S.A.B.C. does not actively indulge in bringing to the microphone people who will say: I am a supporter of the Government, and now I am going to talk to you on the subject for half an hour. It is done in a far more subtle way than that. They present their spokesmen in the course of these talks which are broadcast in order to inform the public, and I will deal with that in due course. I dare say that the S.A.B.C. started off with good intentions and really intended to carry out the policy expressed in the last report available, for 1962, in these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the past the Board of Governors has laid down a policy that Radio South Africa should, to the best of its ability and discretion, supply exhaustive, balanced and truthful information and take care that broadcasting is not abused &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now, had it stopped there and carried out that part of the tenet, of its creed, the position would have been very different; but it goes on to say</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026;is not abused to undermine the safety of the country.</block>

<p>While no one denies that it is necessary to prevent anybody from undermining the safety of the country, the question as to whether it is the function of the S.A.B.C., in regard to news and talks, to prevent the undermining of the country is a moot point, because the more we are told in truthful terms about the attempts to undermine the country, the better we will be able to combat those attempts. But that is not what we are told. We are rather fed on the political point of view of those who support the Government, to the exclusion of any contrary point of view, despite the fact that the contrary viewpoint, has nothing to do with undermining the Government, and despite the fact that outside the National Party there are hundreds of thousands of White South Africans who are as loyal and as determined not to allow the country to be undermined, as they are. But where do they get a voice on the S.A.B.C.? This, Sir, has become known in some quarters as &#x201C;The Voice of Verwoerd&#x201D;, in line with &#x201C;The Voice of America&#x201D;&#x2014;the difference being that in the United States&#x2026;. [Interjection.] Sir, I ask myself how does one silence that perennial practitioner of political perversion in these parliamentary precincts? You, Sir, tried last year. Now, in terms of the regulations that govern the use of this very important medium of public communication in the U.S.A., it is clear&#x2014;and if anyone doubts it I have an official publication here to prove it&#x2014;that &#x201C;the U.S. Government does not conduct radio or television programmes for domestic consumption&#x201D;. Those are all provided by private enterprise, to the extent that in the U.S.A. there are some 4,500 radio stations independently and privately operated, and there are 150,000,000 radio sets to receive the programmes from these stations, with no interference from the Government or from any utility corporation which is a quasi-Government organization. An opportunity is given to <span class="col_599-600" refersTo="page_0314"/>the listener to get every and any point of view about any matter of public interest, including Government policy. Anyone who has been to the United States could hear for himself how many times a day the policy of the U.S. Government, whichever party is in power, is attacked by this, that or the other radio station&#x2014;not once, but hundreds of times every day. If the S.A.B.C. claims that it is in fact carrying out its objective of ensuring impartiality, not only would it allow a contrary point of view, but it would go out of its way to encourage contrary points of view to be stated. I would like to ask any hon. member opposite whether he can point to a single broadcast in 1963 where the point of view of any political party other than that of the National Party was heard on any transmission of the S.A.B.C? Just give me one solitary example to show this balance, this impartiality. I challenge them, and I will contribute to any charity that hon. member names if he can prove to any reasonable jury or body of persons that there was one broadcast which truly and objectively gave the point of view of any political party, except the National Party, in 1963.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says I must tell him about Finkelstein. I know what the slant of that kind of remark is, and I am well aware of the intention behind that kind of statement&#x2014;but then they have been trained to think that way, Sir, and you must forgive them; it is not entirely their fault. The reason why they agree with the kind of views expressed over the radio is found in their own temperament and character. That is why they see nothing wrong in the speeches made by a man called Ivor Benson, to whom the hon. member for Orange Grove referred. Anyone who habitually speaks over the radio can achieve immortality in only one way, and that is by having his speeches printed for posterity. They do not print everybody&#x2019;s speeches. I have spoken over the radio, but nobody has ever printed a speech of mine. But in the case of Mr. Ivor Benson, we have no difficulty at all in having his speeches left for posterity. [Interjections.] Here you have a series of talks, &#x201C;Know Your Enemy&#x201D;, and he points out that the enemy is Communism. Fair enough&#x2014;but if you, Sir, were to read these speeches, let alone listen to them, you would discover to your surprise that Communism is equated with any point of view that opposes the point of view of the Government, just as we hear in this House when we argue on some aspect of Government policy that someone says, &#x201C;Communism, Communism&#x201D;. So he, for example, suggests that the entire population of the U.S.A. have become communists. That is all in his printed talks. I have some of them here. Although I have not heard all of them, I can read them, and so can anyone else. He says this of a friendly country in regard to which we are always screaming about our allegiance and our friendliness, that we belong to the West. But when it comes to denigrating America, we have plenty of time and money on the S.A.B.C. to allow Mr. Benson to do so. He talks about the Bolshies in America, and he talks about the Columbia Broadcasting System, and says in effect that it is a communist organization&#x2014;and this is one of the three largest television and broadcasting systems in the U.S.A! But further than that, he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is hard to see Russian influence behind the action of Mr. Robert Kennedy, brother of the President of the United States, in receiving a fugitive from South Africa like Patrick Duncan.</block>

<p>He says it is hard to see Communism behind that, but according to the tone in which he says it, and even when you read the words in cold print, he says in effect that this man, the Attorney-General of the U.S.A., is an associate of communists. According to Mr. Benson, the whole of the Government of U.S.A. consists of communists. Then he comes to another aspect of Communism and says in effect that those who are anti-communist are on the one side and those whom he calls the &#x201C;anti-anticommunists&#x201D; are on the other side&#x2014;in other words, those who fight the people who fight Communism. Therefore those who are anti-anti-communist are pro-communist. This is the deadly logic that Mr. Ivor Benson produces, and he is paid to indoctrinate the innocent listeners on this subject. He talks about the anti-anti-communists like the C.B.S. and the <i>New York Times</i>. He refers to the <i>New York Times</i> in another context by saying that it is alleged to be a leading newspaper in New York. This is what I call tendentious comment. In other words, he suggests that it is not a leading newspaper at all. Of course, the fact is that he is talking about the largest television chain in the United States, and when it comes to the <i>New York Times</i>, which he attacks in a very scurrilous way, he says this of a newspaper which is referred to very differently in an official American publication&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What dailies are considered the (American) nation&#x2019;s outstanding newspapers? Among the outstanding daily newspapers are the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> and the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>.</block>

<p>Those are the outstanding newspapers in the U.S.A., according to this official publication of the U.S. Government, but through the S.A.B.C. those people who do not know much about newspapers in America are told that the <i>New York Times</i> is a communist organ, and similarly the C.B.S. And if anyone would attempt to correct that impression, I think he would receive short shrift from the S.A.B.C., as I can tell by my own recent experience.</p>

<p><span class="col_601-602" refersTo="page_0315"/>Having had occasion to travel through the U.S.A. last year, I came back with a number of tapes of television and radio programmes which very clearly reflect American opinion and the American point of view, and I offered them to the S.A.B.C. for free use, to show exactly what people in the U.S.A. think of South Africa and what our answer should be; but so far nobody has taken the slightest trouble to avail himself of that opportunity, and I am prepared to give six to four now that these tapes will never be played on the S.A.B.C., because they may represent a point of view contrary to that of the Nationalist Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have such a short time at my disposal that it will unfortunately be impossible for me to deal with all the problems that have been raised here to-day and that is why I shall concentrate on the most important ones. We on this side of the House have often made it very clear that nobody objects to criticism. Nobody objects to justifiable criticism. I think it is the right of every one of us to criticize but where you criticize, particularly where an important institution is concerned, not only inside South Africa but also outside South Africa, it behaves every one of us to make sure of your facts and to make sure that your criticism is justified. It again struck me to-day that the flood of criticism we had was not only unbalanced but based on inaccuracies and on gross misrepresentations. Let me give you a few examples.</p>

<p>Let me start with the last speaker. The hon. member said in so many words that Mr. Benson had supposedly stated in his talks that the Columbia Broadcasting System was a communist organization. But he did not say that. Let me tell the hon. member what Mr. Benson said. Mr. Benson said the peculiar thing was exactly this that there were large institutions, like the C.B.S., in America, a mighty organization, an organization which distributed films like &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D; and which distributed it not only in England but made special editions in order to distribute it in the outermost corners of the world&#x2014;&#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D; which glorifies communist agitation throughout the world. He went on and said that the C.B.S. had supported Castro while Castro was organizing against his opponent, while a communist was organizing against his Government and that it did everything in its power to promote the case of this communist. Not only did it do this, Mr. Benson said, but the C.B.S. went so far as to send photographers to Cuba where they made films of everything they found favourable&#x2014;not of the normal things, not of anything that was unfavourable to Castro, but they merely sought out those things that were in Castro&#x2019;s favour. Mr. Benson said it was peculiar that such a body should promote Communism.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that Mr. Benson had gone so far as to say that the <i>New York Times</i> was a communist organization, but nowhere does he say anything of the sort. What Mr. Benson did say about the <i>New York Times</i> was that it followed precisely the same policy as the C.B.S. and that it glorified Castro as an &#x201C;agrarian reformer&#x201D; and that it had ultimately in that way attuned the American public to view Castro in a favourable light. Now Mr. Benson says this: Is it not peculiar that such a newspaper should promote Communism in a country which is involved in a death struggle with Communism? But then the hon. member for Hospital came here with distorted and untruthful allegations.</p>

<p>He asked me how many were in favour of it and how many against it and that he would tell me how many were against it. Let me give the hon. member the facts. Seven hundred letters were received following upon the &#x201C;Know Your Enemy&#x201D; series by Mr. Benson, more than in respect of any other programme, and 15 of that number were against it. But let me go further.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove adopts the same attitude and I must unfortunately say that he does so annually. Sir, you expect everybody in this House who carries a responsibility to adhere very closely to the truth. I want to give a few examples of how the hon. member has acted. He quoted from what Hugh Rouse is supposed to have said against the S.A.B.C., namely, from a report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of what Mr. Rouse is supposed to have said to the Junior Chamber of Commerce. But he did not add that two days later Mr. Rouse denied the report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of what he was supposed to have said and that he pointed out that the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> had distorted all the important things he had said when addressing the Junior Chamber of Commerce. The hon. member did not tell us that.</p>

<p>Let us go further, Sir. In this respect the hon. member for Orange Grove was a little <span class="col_603-604" refersTo="page_0316"/>more reasonable. He said Mr. Benson is supposed to have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The ecumenical movement has come under the influence of Communism.</block>

<p>Well, I must say that is correct; Mr. Benson did say that, but now he says that is not true; he says Benson is telling an untruth if he says they have come under the influence of Communism. Mr. Benson points out at the same time that at Evansten where the World Council of Churches met they refused to pass the following resolution: &#x201C;There is no affinity between Christianity and atheistic Communism.&#x201D; They refused; in other words, the Churches refused to express themselves against their arch enemy, Communism. They refused to say that there was no affinity between them. Is that not a very serious charge against those Churches? Is that not proof that that organization is already under communist influence if they refuse to express themselves against their arch enemy, Communism? That is typical of the kind of attack which we get annually from that hon. member and members of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I want to take it further. I shall probably return to a number of specific points at a later stage, but I want to return to an attack made by the other side of the House. I want to refer to the broadcasting of the statements by Mr. Beyers Naude and the Broederbond. The hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) has dealt very effectively with that. He pointed out the facts. He pointed out that the programmes of the S.A.B.C. were continually changed. When important events take place the programmes are changed so as to reflect those in the broadcasting service of the S.A.B.C. The complaint is that the S.A.B.C. interrupted its programme at a certain stage in order to broadcast the statements by Mr. Beyers Naude and the Broederbond. The hon. member for Orange Grove rose very proudly to his feet and said as he has repeatedly said in this House: &#x201C;On what authority did they do it; who gave them authority to do it?&#x201D; But, as the hon. member for Randfontein has also said, that is simply ordinary procedure. What happened was that the statement by Mr. Beyers Naude and that of the Broederbond were given to Sapa. The S.A.B.C. is a member of Sapa and from the nature of things all the important news consequently come to the S.A.B.C. The S.A.B.C. regarded the statement as important and that evening it can-called a less important musical programme in order to broadcast the two statements. I might just add at the same time that it took them one and a half times as long to read the statement by Mr. Beyers Naude than it took them to read that by the Broederbond.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to refer to the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition and of the Opposition. Why all this fuss about something which is nothing but ordinary procedure? Mr. Speaker I want to give you the real reasons behind it. Is it not remarkable that they have never as yet objected to the fact that Mr. Beyers Naude&#x2019;s statement was broadcast? Has the Leader of the Opposition ever, outside or inside this House, objected to it and said that Mr. Beyers Naude&#x2019;s statement should not have been broadcast; that the programme should not have been interrupted in order to read the statement by Mr. Beyers Naude? No.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Nobody knows, it was supplied by Sapa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will not get away with it as easily as that. Let me state the position very clearly. For months the entire English-language Press had concentrated on publishing every possible little thing that they could distort against the Broederbond. Columns and columns were devoted to the Broederbond to try to put it in a bad light. Columns and columns were devoted to Mr. Beyers Naude to put him in a very favourable light. This picture was so false and so one-sided that the United Party members and the readers of those papers which support the United Party got the impression that they had a bogey in the Broederbond which they could use to incite the one section of the nation against the other section. The Broadcasting Corporation then came along and gave both sides of the picture, the one side as stated by Mr. Beyers Naude and the other side as stated by the Broederbond. When you read those two statements&#x2014;and the statement by the Broederbond was never in any respect contradicted by Mr. Beyers Naude&#x2014;when you compare those two statements, you get a wonderful insight into the whole position. Mr. Speaker, let me just remind you of what has become evident from those statements. In the first place it becomes evident that the objects of the Broederbond are to promote the interests of the Afrikaner nation, the promotion of a national consciousness amongst the Afrikaners and to instill in him a love for his language, religion, traditions, his country and his nation. Those are noble objects. That is the type of noble object which you find in the case of any organization of this nature. I take it that English-speaking people have similar organizations with equally noble objects. We on this side of the House have never yet objected to that. One fact becomes clear from this principle, namely, that the Broederbond promotes the interests of the traditions of the Afrikaner nation and the great tradition of the Afrikaner nation, apart from its language, is the separate continued existence of White and Black. It becomes clear that the main principle underlying the Broederbond is <span class="col_605-606" refersTo="page_0317"/>separate development. However another principle becomes clear from these statements by the Broederbond and Mr. Beyers Naude and I want to tell you what that principle is by reading what was said by Mr. Beyers Naude himself. These are the words of Mr. Beyers Naude who has now left the Broederbond, who has turned his back on the Broederbond. His words were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would be disloyal to my sense of justice if I did not express my sincere thanks for all the beautiful things the Broederbond gave me&#x2014;my love for the Afrikaner people or language, or country, our land, the readiness to serve at all times without seeking reward, the joy of sacrificing for the sacred convictions of righteousness and justice.</block>

<p>That was not said by the Broederbond; those words were uttered by Mr. Beyers Naude himself. Mr. Beyers Naude says in his statement that he was a member of the Broederbond for 22 years. He was also chairman of a branch of the Broederbond. In other words, he is somebody with a sound knowledge of the Broederbond; somebody who consequently knows what principles underlie the Broederbond and who accepted all those principles; somebody who knew that the main principle of the Broederbond, apart from the Afrikaans language, was the separate development of White and non-White. Then we had the tragedy and that tragedy was that Mr. Beyers Naude came under the influence of the Liberals. The Liberals thought, rightly or wrongly, that they had a weakling in him, a weakling whom they could use to undermine the principles of the Broederbond and a large section of the Afrikaner nation and the White people of South Africa. They then formed the Christian Institute and used it as an instrument to undermine the leaders of the Afrikaner Churches spiritually, because they knew that if the Afrikaner Churches in South Africa came to fall, a great deal of the power of the White man in South Africa would disappear&#x2014;not only the power of the Afrikaans-speaking people but the power of the White man in South Africa. In these circumstances it is understandable that one of the first reports issued by the Christian Institute after its establishment was that Soapy Williams, that person who said a year or so ago that &#x201C;Africa was for the Africans&#x201D; and that it was only for them to choose when to take Africa over, had stated in America&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Now there is a new spark of hope.&#x201D;</block>

<p>&#x201C;A new spark of hope&#x201D; that the Black man will be able to be the master in South Africa, and that &#x201C;new spark of hope&#x201D; was the Christian Institute. In other words, Mr. Beyers Naude had now become the instrument of the Liberals and of Soapy Williams. All these facts become clearly evident from the statements by the Broederbond and by Mr. Beyers Naude. The tragedy then developed further.</p>

<p>The position as head of the Christian Institute was offered to Mr. Beyers Naude. As chairman of one of the branches of the Broederbond he went to the home of the secretary of his branch and while the secretary was away he removed all the documents and handed them over to a bitter enemy of the Broederbond, a man by the name of Professor Geyser. His excuse was that he did so in order to get advice. But that excuse of his does not explain why he also gave the names of all the members to Professor Geyser and that notwithstanding the fact that he had taken an oath when he became a member, and had confirmed that oath, to keep all the documents of the Broederbond secret because he knew that the minute it became known that somebody was a member he was persecuted just as these members always try to persecute Afrikaner members of the Broederbond. Attempts are always made to belittle them. That is the reason why it is kept secret. Mr. Beyers Naude, did not hesitate, however, to go so far as to hand over all his friends to the mercy of those people. I ask myself this question: Had a member of the Freemasons done that or had a member of the United Party caucus done that, had somebody like that secretly handed over their secret documents, documents which could harm them, to an enemy, what judgment would they have pronounced on such a person? They would have despised him. Nobody would have had a good word to say about that person. Let me go further. I want to refer to everything that is apparent from these documents. Shortly after wards, in spite of the fact that Mr. Beyers Naude had resigned from the Broederbond, he was chosen as moderator of the Southern Transvaal Synod. Mr. Speaker, do you not find that remarkable? Had the Broederbond been an organization which, as it is alleged, interfered with the election of members to other bodies, how did it come about that the Broederbond allowed Mr. Beyers Naude who had turned his back on them and become a liberal, to become moderator of the Southern Transvaal Synod? Is that not proof that the Broederbond does not interfere in matters of that kind? Surely that is proof positive. But did any member opposite take the trouble of pointing this out? Let me go further. Do you know what Mr. Beyers Naude did then? He received a letter from the chairman of the Broederbond congratulating him on his election and then he replied to the chairman&#x2014;all this is revealed in this statement&#x2014;stating that he would observe the oath of secrecy he had taken. Here we have a man who says he will observe his oath of secrecy while he had already, a few days previously, handed over the documents to an enemy of the Broederbond for publication. That is Mr. Beyers Naude. My question is this: Why is the United Party and the Leader of the United Party and the United Party Press still continuing to side with Mr. Beyers Naude and placing the side of the Broederbond in a bad light? There must be a reason for that.</p>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, in view of the importance of the agricultural industry in the South African economy and the necessity for the maintenance of a strong farming population, this House urges the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a commission to inquire into all branches of the industry in order to determine how the industry can be given its due share in the prosperity of South Africa.</block>

<p>You will see, Mr. Speaker, that the motion is couched in wide terms. We ask for an investigation into all branches of the agricultural industry. By this we do not wish to suggest that all the various branches of the agricultural industry are experiencing difficulty, but we have framed the motion in wide terms so that hon. members, particularly hon. members opposite, will have the opportunity of discussing any branch of the farming industry. We realize that there are certain branches of the industry, for example, the sugar industry, the wine industry and the wool industry, which are not so badly off, although even they in my opinion are not enjoying their rightful share of the prosperity of the country. I believe that even their income does not compare favourably with the income of many other branches of our economy. There are undoubtedly many farmers in our country to-day who are not receiving their rightful share of the economic prosperity that we are experiencing to-day. The position of the farmer is at best always uncertain. He runs the risk of droughts; he has to run the gauntlet of floods and hail and diseases and pests and we are so inclined, when we talk about the farmer&#x2019;s income, just to think of the good years and not to take into consideration the many bad years that the farmer has to contend with.</p>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>When this Government came into power the position of the farmer was far better than it is to-day. There are of course those farmers who have large farming units, who do not have mortgages and who therefore do not have to bear the burden of interest payments. They make a good living but they are very much in the minority. It is the small scale farmers and the farmers who have heavy debts who are experiencing difficulty in the country to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the farming population is of the most vital importance in our national life. Apart from the value of the role that they play in the economic sphere, they play a very important part in our national character. I am sure that I cannot put it any better than the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development put it recently when he opened the congress of the South African Agricultural Union. On that occasion he had the following to say (translation.)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Farming, both as regards the human factor and the farming factor as such, is one of the most important sources that systematically enrich the life of a nation. The farmer is the most important conservative factor in our national life. The inflow of people from the ranks of the farmers is to our nation like the water that is used to irrigate the wheat-lands. They dampen the modern spirit of superficialization. They are the heaven that enriches our people spiritually. It is therefore of the most vital importance that as many people as possible remain farmers to enable us to have a balanced national growth.</block>

<p>The Report of the Commission on the Depopulation of the Platteland also reported in the same vein. They emphasized the great value of a large and strong farming population in our country and in our national life. That is why it is our duty to ensure that the farming community remains as strong as possible both numerically and economically. By this we do not mean that the man who is an inefficient farmer and who is a failure must be kept on the platteland at all costs. If he is inefficient he must make way for a man who can farm efficiently.</p>

<p>The small man must go!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>There we have it again that the small man must go; that is the policy of the Government. We have heard it over and over again. This is not something that we are hearing now for the first time. We have been hearing it said now for the past few years that the small man must go. If he farms efficiently then he is of just as much importance in our national life and in our whole economy as the large-scale farmer is. The small-scale farmer is just as important and we must do everything that we can to keep the small-scale farmer on the farm provided that he farms efficiently, and if the large-scale farmer cannot farm efficiently then he must make way for the man who can farm efficiently. But the present tendency is that he does not make way for another farmer; he makes way for a Black man. That is what is happening to-day and that is what we must put a stop to. We must do everything we can to keep our farming population as strong as possible.</p>

<p>This report to which I have already referred points out that over a period of years before the report was submitted, the farming population decreased by 28,000 and the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs said recently that over the next five years there would continue to be a decrease. In other <span class="col_609-610" refersTo="page_0319"/>words, we are faced with the prospect of having an ever-decreasing farming population and an ever-increasing number of Bantu on the farms. Mr. Speaker, the farmer does not leave his farm to move to the city simply because he can make a nicer living there. He leaves his farm because economic factors compel him to do so. If he is not forced to leave his farm he will not do so. There are too many farmers to-day who are experiencing difficulty, farmers who find it extremely difficult to make a reasonable living. As my authority for this I refer to the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) and what he said here in this House two years ago.</p>

<p>Last year the price was raised slightly. The prices of certain agricultural products have increased but they have not risen in proportion to the increase in the production costs, and it is for that reason that our farmers are experiencing difficulty. We are producing more and more to-day because we are using better methods. The volume of production rose last year by 5 per cent, but the price of agricultural products rose by 3.8 per cent only.</p>

<p>Yes, they did increase generally. The price of wool rose and the price of sugar rose. The price of wine also rose, but those are branches of the industry in which as I have already said things are going well. If one looks at the income tax paid by the farmers it is clear that conditions in the farming industry are deteriorating. In 1957-58, 17 per cent of the farmers operated at a loss. Three years later 23 per cent were operating at a loss. In other words, things have deteriorated. Mr. Cilliers, who is now the Director of the South African Agricultural Union, made the following remarks in November 1962 during a talk for organized farmers &#x2026;</p>

<p>We all agree with the hon. member; Mr. Cilliers is a good man. If he were not a good man I would not quote him. He said [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From this it appears that in the case of all White taxpayers, nearly one-third of them fall into the income group between R2,000 and R4,000, while only about one-third of those who also practise agriculture fall within that group. It is also a significant fact that while 13 per cent of all White taxpayers have a taxable income below R600, nearly 40 per cent of those practising farming fall into this lowest group. Furthermore, it appears that about 60 per cent of <i>bona fide</i> farmers have a taxable income of less than R1,000.</block>

<p>The farmer in this country is not receiving his rightful share of the prosperity that we are enjoying in our country to-day. According to the report of the Land Bank, mortgages increased from 1961 to 1962 by R7,000,000. I take it that it is possible that certain mortgages were taken over from other institutions by the Land Bank and that the figure rose so sharply because of this fact. But what is the position in connection with arrear installments? In 1961 the amount was R3,800,000 and a year later the amount was R4,529,000, an increase of almost R750,000. The amount in respect of arrear mortgage loans was almost doubled. In 1961 the amount was R736,000 and in 1962, R1,453,000.</p>

<p>There is no later report but the position has not improved. The arrear debt of the farmers has continued to increase over the past four or five years. The farmers have always been proud of the way in which they have repaid their debts. There have been few cases in the past where the farmers have <span class="col_611-612" refersTo="page_0320"/>not fulfilled their obligations in this connection. Under present circumstances, however, they find it all the more difficult to meet their commitments towards the State. We read in that report that 76 farms were sold by the Land Bank in 1961 and 93 in 1963. Nearly 50 per cent more farms were sold in 1963 than in 1961. Maize production increased by 62 per cent and the net value by only 32 per cent. Agricultural production increased generally by 25 per cent from 1954 but the gross value by only 20 per cent, although production costs increased by about 49 per cent. So we can see how the position of the maize farmer has also deteriorated.</p>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think that the hon. member for Cradock knows very much about maize. I am not trying to suggest that I know a great deal about it but I think that he knows just as little as I do. Two years ago the price of maize was reduced by 27&#x00BD; cents per bag when the crop amounted to about 60,000,000 bags. The price was raised slightly last year when the crop was about the same. [Interjections.] That strengthens my argument. I did not want to express it in that way. The maize price is higher to-day. In other words, they failed hopelessly in the previous year when they made the price too low. When they saw that the price was too low they raised it. They made a completely wrong estimate and robbed the farmer of the share that he should have had. Mr. Speaker, this year maize is being sold abroad at a far better price. We know that profits have been made on some of the sales. I hope that the farmers will be paid an &#x201C;agterskot&#x201D;. I can go on in this way. The poultry farmer is also experiencing difficulty. Things are not going too badly with the large-scale poultry farmer but the small-scale farmers are experiencing difficulty. The lucerne farmer is experiencing difficulty. Along the Orange River the lucerne farmers have failed in large numbers because a maximum price was the only price fixed for them. The tobacco farmer is experiencing difficulty. The small-scale tobacco farmer is leaving his farm and seeking work elsewhere. The canning industry is experiencing difficulty. Let me read out these headlines: &#x201C;Hardship for the Canning Industry predicted&#x201D;, says Mr. J. F. Krone, chairman of the Apricot and Peach Growers&#x2019; Association. &#x201C;Future of Deciduous Fruit Uncertain&#x201D;. What is the position of the milk farmer? The milk farmer is experiencing very great difficulty to-day. Prices were lowered and production costs increased.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>The price was increased but not to the same extent as the production costs rose. Why was the price originally reduced? The price was reduced because there was a surplus. The price was then reduced to such an extent that the farmers could not make a living and stopped producing. Because the farmers stopped producing the price was increased to encourage them to start producing again. Two years ago when we had a surplus production of milk, the following article appeared in the <i>S.A. Friesland Journal</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our humble opinion the surpluses have arisen as a result of low profit margins. The farmers whose incomes were so small as a result of the profit margins that they could hardly make a living, simply had to increase their milk production in order to increase their income. In our opinion, milk surpluses are therefore the very logical result of the financial pressure that has been brought to bear by the low profit margins.</block>

<p>And then, because there was a surplus they reduced the price and so made the position of the milk farmer untenable.</p>

<p>We are grateful for the amount that the State has contributed. It is still paying a subsidy. That is quite correct but the State is not contributing enough. The State is not contributing enough to enable the farmer to make a living. What do we find to-day? Mr. Crous, President of the East Coast Agricultural Union had the following to say the other day in Port Elizabeth (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the milk distributors found that they were not receiving 10 per cent return on their capital investment, the Marketing Board simply reduced the farmer&#x2019;s price and gave the difference to the distributors to enable them to receive their 10 per cent.

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member for Cradock stops asking &#x201C;What is the solution&#x201D;, we will find the solution. Now milk prices are being raised by the trade but the farmer will have to look after himself. He cannot make do on the price that he is <span class="col_613-614" refersTo="page_0321"/>receiving to-day. Here is another headline: &#x201C;Serious crisis in the Milk Industry as a result of low prices&#x201D;. &#x201C;Milk Shortage likely. The President of the East Griqualand Dairy Farmers&#x2019; Association claims that they are losing 2 cents per gallon&#x201D;. I can continue in this way. Mr. de Villiers had this to say recently (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The report of the South African Reserve Bank for the past year shows that our country is at present experiencing a very prosperous period in the financial sphere, that our commerce and industry are experiencing an economic revival and that the real national income continues to rise. Statistics of agricultural production and exports also give the impression that there is economic progress in agriculture but yet it appears that individual farmers are in general not receiving their rightful share of this economic prosperity.</block>

<p>That is the position of the milk farmer. Industries are protected. If we want to establish an industry in this country that industry is protected against competition from abroad. That is quite correct but it should not be protected at the expense of the farmers. It should not be protected because it has to be fed cheaply and the farmer should not have to pay for it. The consumer, not the farmer, must be subsidized in order to keep the price of food as low as possible.</p>

<p>We are told that higher technical and economic efficiency is the solution. That is quite right. That is what we need. We must farm more efficiently. But in order to do so we do of course need people to convey this information to the farmers. [Interjection.] I shall probably again be told all about the war and how Grootfontein was closed, but I do not have the time to deal with those matters now. There has to be greater efficiency. The Government has to ensure that the necessary technicians are available to disseminate this information. There is a shortage of trained technologists everywhere we look. The Northwestern Development Union stated in Beaufort West the other day that there is a very great shortage of veterinarians. That shortage is continuing in all respects; it is not being met adequately. I know that the Department is creating posts but that shortage is continuing and we do not have the technicians to give the farmers the necessary information to enable them to farm more efficiently.</p>

<p>I have said that industries are being assisted. The Government is responsible for the present difficult position in which the farmers find themselves. The Government is responsible for the fact that we have surpluses to-day. The Government is responsible for the fact that we are not enjoying an increased consumption of all products. The Government is responsible for the fact that the farmers are not flourishing. The Government is responsible because we do not have an additional 1,000,000 White consumers to-day. The Government is responsible for the fact that large-scale industrial development has not taken place in our country. The Government is responsible for the fact that the purchasing power in regard to products is not far larger and the Government is responsible for this fact in that it did not follow the immigration policy of the United Party. If this side of the House had been in Government, the White population would now have numbered an additional 1,000,000. Then there would have been great industrial development in the country; then the purchasing power of the public would perhaps have been twice as large as it is to-day; then there would not have been surpluses and then the position of the farmer would have been just as sound as that of the other population groups to-day. For these reasons we want to move that a commission be appointed to make a thorough investigation into what has to be done to give the farmer his rightful share in the economic revival that we are experiencing in this country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) wandered about to such an extent that I did not know what he was trying to say. I want to give an example. The hon. member mentioned a number of matters and he said that the Government was responsible for all those things although a few minutes earlier he had quoted the President of the South African Agricultural Union as saying that the Reserve Bank report indicated that there was progress in the industrial sphere and in the commercial sphere. He forgot that he had referred to this fact and then he said that the Government was responsible because there was no progress in the industrial sphere. The hon. member continued to contradict himself in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we analyse the hon. member&#x2019;s motion and his speech we find that there is one important question that has to be answered and that is: Are the United Party trying to avoid the provisions of the Marketing Act? Do the United Party no longer accept the Marketing Act as the machine that takes proper care of the farmer? The hon. member for Gardens spoke about the decrease in the price of maize. It is a dangerous thing for that party to speak about a decrease in the price of maize because notwithstanding the fact that the control board and the marketing board recommended an increase in the price when the United Party were in power, an increase based on the formula under the Marketing Act, the United Party reduced the price. The hon. member for Gardens should not have raised that matter. The present Government is continuing to apply the provisions of the Marketing Act in regard to the recommendation of prices based on production costs plus an entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage and has never deviated from it. Now the hon. member for Gardens wants to quote the price of maize as an example. The question is: Is that party trying to avoid the provisions of <span class="col_615-616" refersTo="page_0322"/>the Marketing Act? I want to mention another example. The hon. member for Gardens said that the hon. member for Cradock and the Government had said that the small-scale farmers had to go. He wanted to make propaganda in the country by making that remark. Does the hon. member not know that in the years 1929-39 the Department of Lands, which played a most important part in establishing the small-scale farmers, experienced a 33&#x00BC; per cent failure on the part of those people who had been granted land? Does the hon. member not know that between 1939 and 1948 when they were in power, 12.3 per cent of the small-scale farmers whom they placed on the land were failures? It was only from 1948 to 1960 that the position improved and that the number of failures dropped to 4.1 per cent. That was the way the United Party looked after the small farmer. The hon. member must not accuse the Government of saying that the small farmer has to leave. It has been this Government primarily that has taken care of the small farmer. When we speak of a small farmer we mean that man with a small piece of land who can produce economically on that small piece of land.</p>

<p>No farmer has to get out. It is the United Party that are leaving, just as they are now leaving Natal. As far as we know, those are the only people who are leaving.</p>

<p>When I analyse this motion of the hon. member for Gardens I find that it reflects one thing and one thing only&#x2014;a lack of confidence in the organized farmer; a lack of confidence in the South African Agricultural Union; a lack of confidence in all the commodity divisions of the South African Agricultural Union like the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association and others. The South African Agricultural Union has always been acknowledged and respected by the Government as being the spokesman of the farmer and the body that puts the case of the farmer in the right way and with the necessary responsibility. But that is not all. The South African Agricultural Union and, as it happened, the United Party, together with the wholehearted co-operation of other parties, was the originator of the Marketing Act as we know it today. This is the machine that is the appointed channel of assistance to the farmer in our economic set-up. The United Party want a Commission of Inquiry. Have they ever put their ear to the ground to try to find out the views of the South African Agricultural Union in this regard? Can they point out one place to us in regard to which the South African Agricultural Union and its commodity division has said: Do away with the Marketing Act; do away with the control boards? Is it not a fact&#x2014;I want the hon. member to reply to me in this regard that organized agriculture in South Africa makes use of that spokesman and recognizes it as means of assisting to set up the control boards under the Marketing Act and to tell the control boards about the problems of the farmers and how the farmers&#x2019; products should be marketed and what the price level should be? Do the farmers not make use of that spokesman to put their case to the Department and the Government? No, the hon. member for Gardens now tries to run away from them. He has no confidence in them. It is convenient for him to quote the President and the Director of the Agricultural Union and to do so out of context in order to win a debating point. It appears to me that the United Party have no option. They no longer have any representatives from the platteland in that party. Gardens and Green Point now have to put their case on agriculture for them. They have to get people from Hillbrow and East London (City) to put their case for them. That party no longer has its finger on the pulse of agriculture in the Republic. That party is no longer accepted by the farmers and by the platteland. Now people from the urban areas have to put their case on agriculture for them. This is the reason why their case is such a poor one. Their whole case points to a lack of confidence in the farmers&#x2019; organizations in South Africa. I wonder what the members of the congress of the Agricultural Union will say when they hear how little notice is taken of them by this so-called official Opposition?</p>

<p>Because this is the case, I want to move the following amendment to the motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House regards organized agriculture with all its ramifications as the mouthpiece of the farmer for consultation with the authorities, and in addition reaffirms its confidence both in the various control bodies under the Marketing Act and special legislation, and in the other essential services of the Departments of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, of Agricultural Technical Services, of Lands and of Water Affairs, as well as the State Advances Recoveries Office.&#x201D;.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members there only have a Sustersbond; they do not have a Broederbond. I feel sorry for them, Mr. Speaker. The hon. member for Gardens, strangely enough&#x2014;and when the Budget debate comes along hon. members opposite must remember this&#x2014;acknowledged the phenomenal prosperity that we are experiencing in South Africa. He made quotations to show that we are experiencing a wonderful era of prosperity in South Africa but that the farmer was not receiving his rightful share of it. Of course, they cannot do otherwise but admit that there is this prosperity because every economist or industrialist or banking institution of repute is of the same <span class="col_617-618" refersTo="page_0323"/>opinion. Now they say that agriculture has been stagnating. Let us analyse the true position in regard to agriculture. If we look at the value of our farm production we find that in 1948 it amounted to R376,000,000. In 1962-3 it had risen to R882,000,000, two and a half times the 1948 figure. If we take the index figure for the period 1947 to 1950 at 100, we find that it was 95 in 1948 and 223 in 1962-63. In other words, no person has the right to say that agriculture has stagnated. Agricultural production has increased and it has increased at the same dynamic and phenomenal speed as has the economy of South Africa. Hon. members must not try to take matters out of their context. We frankly admit that the value of the other products has increased to a larger extent and that the percentage of agricultural production of the whole economy of the country dropped from 13.5 to 10.1. This is true but it does not give the true picture. We must remember that in every country in the world that is developing industrially, that is experiencing an industrial revival as South Africa is, the balance must gradually change. When we go back 50, 60 or 70 years we find that agriculture was the largest source of income to South Africa. But as a country develops industrially, the pendulum swings and gradually industries become a larger source of revenue. But when we reduce the position to individuals and investigate the circumstances of the workers in industry and in the building industry and in labour and in the Railways, and we analyse their income per head and compare it with that of the farmer, we find that the farmer has no cause for complaint and hon. members opposite have no cause for complaint either. If they do complain they will be causing agitation amongst the farmers and they will make the farmers dissatisfied by quoting figures that are not correct. Hon. members should not argue in this way.</p>

<p>I say again that this motion is nothing less than a motion of no confidence in organized agriculture, in the bodies that are the spokesmen of the farmers, in the bodies that are recognized, in the bodies that look after the marketing of the farmers&#x2019; products. It is a motion of no confidence in the Marketing Act. I think of the hon. member for Cradock. He has always said that the Marketing Act is the Magna Charta of the farmer. That is his opinion of the Marketing Act. The United Party must tell us whether they are trying to avoid the provisions of the Marketing Act by means of this motion. What is the position of the farmer? We have 17 control boards under the Marketing Act which control 73 per cent of our agricultural products. The organized farmers have set up those control boards to control the marketing of 73 per cent of their products. I want to give a few examples to show how the farmer himself exercises that control. Let me take the Potato Board with its 18 members. Eight of them are appointed by agricultural unions&#x2014;a complete majority for agriculture. Take the Wheat Board with its 21 members. Eight of them are appointed by the farmers&#x2019; own co-operatives and three are appointed by the agricultural union. In other words, 11 plus the three representing the millers&#x2014;and many of the small-scale millers are also farmers&#x2014;give the farmers a complete majority there as well. I can also refer to the Mealie and Kaffir Corn Board. Of the 21 members of the Board six are nominated by the co-operative producers, six by the agricultural unions to represent the non-co-operative producers and one by the producers of stock feed. In other words, of the 21 members, 13 are appointed by the farmer in order to look after the interests of the mealie and kaffir-corn farmer. No wonder the hon. member for Gardens told the hon. member for Cradock that he also knows nothing about maize because if he had known something about maize he would not have used maize as an example. This was an unfortunate example as far as the United Party was concerned because they should be ashamed of themselves for what they did in regard to maize. This proves that the farmers themselves are responsible for the actions taken by these respective control boards. In other words, the organized farmer ensures, through the South African Agricultural Union that the price level of his products is carefully watched. Do the United Party maintain that these boards are too incompetent to look after the interests of the farmers? Is that what their motion means? Or do the United Party say that the South African Agricultural Union is too weak to select the right people and nominate the right people to sit on these boards? That is all that this motion can mean. I said that 73 per cent of the farmers&#x2019; products are marketed by these boards and marketed according to a sound formula that is accepted by South Africa, the Departments and by all parties as the only sound economic and practicable formula to give the farmer stability and security for the future as we see it. And now the United Party is running away from it! Sir, there are other products. Seventeen per cent of farmers&#x2019; products are dealt with in terms of special laws, such as the Sugar Act and the law in connection with the wine industry. Are things going badly with these people? Things have never been better for the sugar farmers in South Africa than they are at the moment, and the same thing holds good for the wine farmer. These people are satisfied. When one tries to buy a small piece of land in the wine-producing areas one finds that one cannot buy it for R2,000 per morgen. In other words, 73 per cent of our agricultural produce is marketed by the Marketing Board and 17 per cent under special laws. Only 9 per cent or 10&#x00BD; per cent of our agricultural produce is not under control. That is why I say that this motion is to my mind nothing less than a motion of no confidence in the organized farmer in South Africa. I think that it is time that the South African Agricultural Union realized this fact because I think that it is an unforgiveable sin. It encourages those people who stand coldly and aloofly towards organized agriculture to continue acting in that way <span class="col_619-620" refersTo="page_0324"/>and to ride on the back of the South African Agricultural Union. I think that I can say without fear of contradiction in this House to-day that most of the advantages that the farmer in South Africa has received have been due to the fact that the farmers have been united in an organized fashion in the South African Agricultural Union and have through that agricultural union received the right to elect the right people to the control boards to handle the products of the farmer there.</p>

<p>The hon. member tried to make out a case for saying that the solution was better methods of farming, better technical and scientific farming, and so forth. I want to ask him whether the United Party can give us an example of where the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing or the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, or of Water Affairs or of Lands or the State Advances Recoveries Office or the Land Bank&#x2014;which renders enormous financial assistance&#x2014;has ignored the South African Agricultural Union. Has not the opposite been the case&#x2014;that they have continued to co-operate and that the South African Agricultural Union has at every congress that it has held adopted a motion of thanks in which it has not only thanked the Departments but congratulated them on the wonderful work that they are doing and the manner in which they are promoting the interests of agriculture? At those congresses they have congratulated the Departments on their ability to adjust themselves to circumstances and have thanked the Government and the Departments for the timeous steps taken to overcome possible problems. We have never said that things are going well with all the farmers because we do not have control over droughts and foot and mouth disease and because we have no control over hail storms and other natural disasters.</p>

<p>This Government realizes only too well, as do the control boards, that the risks the farmer runs are entirely different from those run by the ordinary industrialist and manufacturer, and, because this is so, we have this specific formula under the Marketing Act which does not summarily fix a price without having regard to a possible profit but takes the position over the past year into consideration, the question of production costs, the question of the costs of containers and that sort of thing, and on this basis works out the price for the next year. These control boards that are under the supervision of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and which do this work on the advice of the Department, have continued to keep one fact in mind and that is that what the farmer in South Africa asks for is security, and security for the farmer means that he must be assured of a price for his product in the future. Because this is so these control boards have built up a stabilization fund to give the farmers the necessary security. A stabilization fund amounting to R57,845,000 has already been built up amongst these 17 control boards. If we add the fund for wool we find that the figure is more than R82,000,000. This is a nest-egg for the producer and gives him a feeling of security for the future. The hon. member for Gardens with the support of his party, said: I do not trust organized agriculture. They do not recognize organized agriculture as the spokesman of the farmers; they do not trust it. This motion asks for an inquiry. Why does the motion not mention investigation into specific matters&#x2014;we have these control boards; we have the South African Agricultural Union that is investigating these matters from day to day. They have their special study committees and the committees submit formulated and motivated proposals to the congresses of the South African Agricultural Union after those proposals have been submitted to the provincial congresses and to the commodity conferences. Those proposals eventually become the subject of a congress resolution and that congress resolution is submitted to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services or the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, or whatever Department may be involved, and those resolutions are then given effect to as far as possible. If they cannot be implemented, the Government and its Ministers have always been honest enough to state frankly: This proposal is not practicable. I want to say this to the hon. member for Gardens: Mention one of these subjects that you want to have specifically investigated and that the Departments have not yet given their attention to. The hon. member is silent because we no longer get roses from the Gardens, only weeds!</p>

<p>I do not want to weary the House with statistics. I have already said that the increase in the value of agricultural production is keeping pace with the increase in the economic development of South Africa, reduced to a <i>per capita</i> level. When we look at the percentage contributions of the most important economic sectors to our net internal production, we find that the figure for agriculture, forestry and fisheries stood at 13.2 per cent in 1955-56, climbed to 14.1 per cent and then started dropping to 11.4 per cent, 11.3 per cent, 11.1 per cent until to-day it is 10.7 per cent, while the figure for mines which was 12.5 per cent rose to 13.5 per cent. This has not happened because the mines receive more but because the volume has increased to such an extent and because the mines have to accommodate and feed and remunerate so many more people. When we look at the figure for industry, we find that it was 23.9 per cent in 1955 and that it is now 24.1 per cent. Does the hon. member contend that the factories in South Africa should stagnate or should expand just as slowly as possibly agriculture? Does the hon. member not realize that because <span class="col_621-622" refersTo="page_0325"/>of the thousands of immigrants, whom they so much want, because of the great labour campaign that is in operation to-day, it is not possible to absorb everyone in agriculture; they have to be absorbed in industry and in the factories, and once they have been absorbed into those spheres of activity, the percentage income in those spheres of activity increases. Hon. members must see the picture in its true perspective and be realistic.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the various departments concerned with agricultural matters have ensured that the farmer has kept pace with the rest of South Africa. For that reason this motion is nothing less than a motion of no confidence in organized agriculture in South Africa, and I move my amendment accordingly.</p>

<p>If I correctly followed what the hon. member said, then I must say that I have seldom listened to a speech in which so much nonsense was uttered and in which there was so little substance. He challenges the United Party and says that it is running away from the Marketing Act and that it is expressing a lack of confidence in organized agriculture and in the South African Agricultural Union. Mr. Speaker, it has been clearly stated time and again that this Opposition believes just as strongly as the Government does that the Marketing Act is the Magna Charta of the farmer and we believe that the Marketing Act has done wonders to stabilize our agricultural industry. But we also know that within the broad framework of Government policy and in an attempt to keep the cost of living as low as possible, it is the policy of the Government, in respect of products and commodities which are only consumed locally and the surplus production of which is not exported abroad, to keep prices as low as possible, because otherwise the cost of living will rise. They want a low and balanced price. If the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) does not know this then I wonder what he does know. The hon. member says that the 17 control boards are doing wonderful work. I agree. But does the hon. member not know that through the control boards, supported by the South African Agricultural Union and the commodity committees, prices are often recommended to the Government which are not adopted by the Government? Does the hon. member not know that? Why then does he talk about agricultural matters? He knows that this sort of thing is happening all the time. He also knows that in 1962 the maize price which was fixed by this Government was not the price recommended by the Maize Board &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; just as little as the meat price which is recommended from year to year is always the reserve price fixed by the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that this motion was tantamount to an accusation against organized agriculture, a motion of no confidence in organized agriculture. Sir, this side of the House is not afraid to approach organized agriculture and to say that we want a commission of inquiry to be appointed to determine why the farmer is not being given his rightful share in the prosperity of our country. I should have no hesitation in approaching the South African Agricultural Union and telling them that we have moved a motion of this nature. I predict that the South African Agricultural Union will welcome a commission of this kind.</p>

<p>He may perhaps have squeezed in 1955, but the hon. member spoke so softly that I could not hear him very well. Let me give him a little assistance. What has the position been in regard to agricultural production over the past four years? What was the difference between 1962 and 1963? In 1962 the gross value of our total agricultural production was R854,000,000, and in 1963 this figure rose to R882,000,000. The point that I want to make is that from 1962 to 1963 there was an increase of R32,000,000 in the gross value of agricultural products. But that increase of R32,000,000 can be ascribed entirely to the increased prices for wool and sugar and two other commodities. In other words, from 1962 to 1963 the gross value of agricultural products rose by scarcely one cent. And if it did not rise by one cent, what was the position in commerce? Was it equally static? Can we honestly say that the farmer is receiving his rightful share in the economic upsurge and that he should be quite satisfied?</p>

<p>I maintain that the agricultural industry has not received its rightful share; that the capital invested in agriculture is subject to most risks in this country. There is no other industry in which one invests one&#x2019;s capital which is as vulnerable to drought, hail and pests and so forth and which is exposed to as many risks as the agricultural industry. If it were not for the appreciation in the value of the farmer&#x2019;s property over the years, together with the improvements that he has effected, farming would not have been profitable. Farming does not pay the dividend or interest that one ought to draw on one&#x2019;s investment. It has not paid for the last five years and it will not pay. The farmer would not be able to continue farming if his capital investment did not appreciate. This capital appreciation has slowed down considerably over the past year or two <span class="col_623-624" refersTo="page_0326"/>and every practising farmer opposite knows that this is true. We know that from 1950 to 1961 the appreciation in the value of property was considerable.</p>

<p>What about 1962 to 1963?</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>You will find that in 1960 the capital appreciation in the case of agricultural small holdings was less than it was during the preceding ten years. A property purchased in 1955 had almost doubled in value by 1962. There may have been an increase from 1962 to 1963 but it was not at the same rate. The point that I am making is that the rate of capital appreciation has slowed down and it will become slower as the international position deteriorates. If we exclude the increase in the price of wool and the sharp rise in the price of sugar we find that from 1961 the tempo has slowed down considerably. It remains an equally irrefutable fact, as far as commerce and industry and other activities are concerned, that they made rapid progress during that period. Surely then we are entitled to say that in our opinion the farmer has not received his due share in the prosperity of the country and we think that a commission of inquiry will be able to do very good work in this regard. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom challenged us to say which branch of agriculture should be investigated because, after all, there were so many control boards. Those control boards do the best they can.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member for Cradock want to tell me that things are going well with the perishable fruit and vegetable industry for example? I think he should keep quiet. Indeed, I want to bring this fact to the attention of the hon. the Minister for the umpteenth time. At this stage I am unable to suggest what should be done in regard to perishable fruit and vegetables. This produce is brought to the municipal markets in the large cities. We also have to contend with continual surpluses, and we find that truck-loads, tons of this produce, cannot even be sold. I am not being critical, but some plan must be made to keep the farmers informed and to bring about a balance in the farming industry in an effort to avoid the sort of situation where 500 truckloads of water melons, for which there is no market, find their way to the Johannesburg market in one week. How can the farmers make a living under these circumstances? Hon. members opposite visit the Johannesburg and the Durban markets and other important markets just as often as I do. When I see the boxes of peaches and the boxes of plums and apricots that the farmer has struggled the whole year to produce and then has to struggle to sell, I feel that things cannot go on in this way. The box costs the farmer anything from 5 to 7 cents; the woodwool costs him something and his labour costs him something and then he has to sell at 15 cents per tray. Three weeks ago I saw rows and rows of trays being sold for 15 cents each. I am convinced that the hon. the Minister will agree with me that an inquiry is needed and that this motion is not a motion of no confidence in organized agriculture. This is a motion of no confidence in the Government. A certain amount has been done by the staff available and the organizations that we have but we will have to do better or otherwise agriculture will not make the progress that it should make and it will not receive the share that it should receive in the prosperity of the country. How can we improve the position without having a commission to ascertain in connection with these activities whether the policy of controlling agricultural products to keep the cost of living as low as possible is not being exaggerated; whether some relief cannot be given and, if so, how this can be done? In the second place it must investigate what can be done in connection with the products for which we have no control boards and in regard to which things simply take their course. What can be done in this regard to alleviate the position? I myself was concerned in this. It is not an easy thing to say what should be done in connection with the marketing of perishable products. But something must obviously be done otherwise these farmers will not be able to make a living.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation at all in wholeheartedly supporting the motion of the hon. member for Gardens which asks the hon. the Minister in a friendly way to appoint a commission of this nature. He is not an unreasonable Minister when it comes to agricultural matters. I ask him to accept this motion.</p>

<p>I have never seen the Opposition so much at sixes and sevens as they have been to-day. Here we have a motion which is tantamount to nothing less than a motion of no confidence in organized agriculture. We on this side have always said that we believe in organized agriculture, that the Marketing Act is our Magna Charta as farmers, and what whoever interferes with that Magna Charta interferes with farmers of South Africa. I remember the days when the farmers were not organized; when we had to approach a buyer to pay us the price that he wanted to pay. But it was organized agriculture which made orderly marketing in South Africa possible. That is why we deprecate the fact that hon. members are moving a motion of no confidence in organized agriculture.</p>

<p>They have also moved a motion of no confidence in the boards and in the hon. the Minister in connection with the fixing of prices, according to the hon. member who has just spoken. Of course, he does not have the faintest idea what he is <span class="col_625-626" refersTo="page_0327"/>talking about. He has produced evidence to prove his statements that the Government has consistently reduced the proposed prices. The Government has always listened to sound advice and, together with the farmers, has fixed prices in the interests of the farmers. That argument of the hon. member holds no water. I know of many cases where proposals regarding the determination of prices have been accepted by the Government. I predict that this good Government and the Maize Board will continue to look after the interests of the maize farmers. The Maize Board has done a great deal for us and has demonstrated to us this year that maize can be exported. Why then should we investigate that board? It would be tantamount to a motion of no confidence in a board which has done its work well over the years. We also have the Wool Board, a body which has really proved to be the salvation of the wool grower from time to time. The wool growers began as a disorganized group of people but over the years a wonderful organization has been built up. The Wool Board was established by organized farmers and the International Wool Secretariat was brought into being. The wool farmers can be very thankful that they are at least receiving world prices for their wool which they never received under the old United Party Government.</p>

<p>I want to come back for a moment to the question of maize about which those hon. members had so much to say. What did they do in regard to maize? Have they forgotten the days when maize was rotting on the stations under tarpaulins? That was during the period of office of the United Party. Have they forgotten the days when the price of maize was reduced from 21s. to 19s. 3d.? Have they forgotten what happened the year after the war? The price of maize rose and a profit of &#x00A3;5,000,000 was made but the United Party paid the money into the Treasury. It was only when Minister Havenga could take action at a later stage under the National Party Government that part of the money was paid over to the control boards to be kept as a nest-egg on which to build up their future reserves. Can the United Party mention any occasion during their period of office when they did something for the farmers? What did they do? They gave our wool away. The highest price that we ever received for our wool under the United Party, the highest amount for the whole wool clip, was &#x00A3;16,000,000 under the so-called British scheme. In the next year the price rose to &#x00A3;36,000,000. What has the United Party ever done for the farmers? That is why all their members represent urban constituencies. They are trying now to return to the platteland but the farmers know them too well. They say that the farmers are not receiving enough. Let them work out a better scheme. The hon. member made a number of vague statements here, and we still do not know precisely what they want. One can only assume that they are dissatisfied with organized agriculture and with the boards.</p>

<p>They want to change over to the old system that we had under the United Party Government when we had to give our products away. They have no constructive plans for improving the position. I shall be pleased if they can do so although the hon. member made no constructive suggestion. The hon. member said that the agricultural unions would not mind if a commission was appointed. Why should a commission be appointed? The boards are doing good work and the farmers have confidence in them. Does the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman), that great general of the O.B., really think that the farmers will move a motion of no confidence in the agricultural unions and welcome a commission of inquiry into the agricultural industry? That is too ridiculous for words and I do not think he means a word of what he says.</p>

<p>This side of the House stands by organized agriculture and we have full confidence in the agricultural organizations. There is good co-operation. I want to tell hon. members that there are some branches of farming in which prices can be improved, but that can be done through the boards. It cannot be done through the United Party which has no policy. They do not have the slightest idea how to go about it. We reject the sneering remarks which the hon. member made about the small farmers. We on this side will look after the small farmer and ensure that he does not move to the cities as unskilled labour and become a burden there on the State. We will ensure that he is placed on a sound basis. That is why the Government is tackling important schemes like the Orange River scheme which will place thousands of morgen under irrigation and enable the small farmer to make a reasonable living. What have the United Party ever done for the poor man or the small farmer? Nothing. This Government realizes that the platteland is becoming depopulated, but by means of these great schemes which are going to be undertaken and which will continue for the next 30 years, provision will be made for sufficient people to remain on the platteland to feed the cities. That is the policy of our party. It is constructive and it is something of which we will be proud in the future. We on this side have nothing against industrial development. We welcome it because we know that it gives us a market for our products. But this Government has always been a farmers&#x2019; Government and it will always protect the interests of the farmers. For that reason we reject the motion of no confidence in the farmers that the United Party have moved here.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was amusing to listen to the two hon. members on the opposite side who have spoken so far, the hon. members for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) and Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker). They reminded me of what the Bible tells us about tinkling cymbals and sounding brass. That was all it amounted to. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom said that it was <span class="col_627-628" refersTo="page_0328"/>strange that the hon. members for Gardens (Mr. Connan) and Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) should state the case for the farmers here, but has the hon. member forgotten that he now lives in Volksrust and that he is no longer farming? Has he forgotten that the hon. member for Gardens is one of the leading farmers in the north-west and that the hon. member for Hillbrow is also a practising farmer? It is very easy for a man who has sold the land of his fathers and who now lives in town to discuss farming matters and to try to score political debating points. The hon. member for Cradock has already forgotten how to farm. If he did not have a son to farm for him I do not know what would become of his farm.</p>

<p>He spoke about the time when we had to give our wool away for nothing. Where was that hon. member during the depression when we received 2d. and 4d. for our best wool and when we could not even send our unwashed wool away but had to throw it away because the price we were paid for it was less than the railage that we had to pay? [Interjections.] The hon. member says that that was during the period of office of the United Party. He does not even know in which time we are living. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom said that this Government was the friend of the small farmer and the hon. member Cradock repeated his remarks parrotwise. The friend of the small farmer, and to-day we have 28,000 fewer farmers than we had 10 years ago! The hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs said that 2,400 farmers must leave the platteland every year. He said that the number of farmers was decreasing at the rate of 2,400 per annum, and that in 1968 we would only have 93,000 farmers left out of 128,000. What sort of an argument is this&#x2014;that things are going so well with the farmer, that this Government is the friend of the farmer and yet the number of farmers decreases? The Nationalist Party conveniently forgets that they are so much a friend of the farmer that even the hon. the Prime Minister had to sell his small farm because he realized that farming was not paying. Hon. members have said that this motion is tantamount to a motion of no confidence in the agricultural unions. Have you ever heard such nonsense? The agricultural unions insist on an enquiry and at every single congress that is held reference is made to the critical position of the farmers. The agricultural unions are doing excellent work. All we need is a better Government and a Minister who realizes that the farmer is a permanent asset to the nation. If only we had a Government which realizes that a farmer has to be a scientist, an economist, an engineer, a manager, an ordinary worker and permanent student! I have here a pamphlet issued by a co-operative society. What does it say? The hon. member for Cradock spoke about maize. It was many years ago that the hon. member for Wakkerstroom last produced a few mealiecobs except for those that he might perhaps still cultivate on his plot. This pamphlet states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nitrogen fertilizer can give a big increase in corn yields and many mid-western farmers pile it on, often forgetting about phosphorous and potassium.</block>

<p>They go on to say on the next page&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The major insect pests of maize are wire-worms, tiger worms, cutworms the dusty maize beetle, the stalk borer maize aphids&#x2026;.</block>

<p>The farmer has to combat all these things. I have explained all these things a farmer has to be but he has also to be an insect-killer. I have said that the farmer is an asset to the country and the trustee of the soil, but what is the attitude of the Government to the farmer? All I can imagine is that they hate the farmers. (Laughter.) What does this mean? It means that any agricultural debate in this House degenerates into a political debate. I remember that last year when we discussed the agricultural position in South Africa the <i>Burger</i> stated that agricultural politics had now become Native politics. They said that Mr. Vosloo had told Dr. Moolman that the United Party wanted to adapt South Africa&#x2019;s policy to the A.N.C. in order to be assured of agricultural surpluses, and Minister Uys agreed with him. No wonder the farmers say that they would rather have the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development as Minister of Agriculture. It was not surprising that they asked him to open the congress of the Agricultural Union this year. These are the signs of the times. The agricultural debate is converted into a debate on Native Affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, year after year the hon. member for Wakkerstroom comes and rattles off a series of figures. He simply takes the reports of the Departments of Agriculture and writes down the figures on paper. I noticed that he congratulated one of the officials on having presented such an excellent report on which he was able to base his speech. I am surprised to hear the hon. member for Cradock say that the Government is the best friend the farmer has ever had. We have just had a report tabled in Parliament in terms of which the Government aims to spend R284,000,000 in 10 years on half a million people in South West Africa. Why do they not give our farmers a small share of that money?</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs has <span class="col_629-630" refersTo="page_0329"/>said that 2,400 farmers have had to leave the platteland each year. Where can they go and what can they do? [Interjections.] What is the Government doing to prepare them for a new life? But they are willing to spend R248 million in South West Africa on 500,000 people. But what is the Government doing for the White farmers of South Africa? We are continually being told what happened during the period of office of the United Party Government and how maize was given away for nothing, but in those days more people became farmers and they did not leave the land. [Interjections]. Does the hon. the Minister want to deny that we already have 28,000 fewer farmers on the platteland? During the depression the farmers had to build roads under this Government and they received &#x00BE;d. per lb. for their unwashed wool. This Government has only one thing to say and that is that the farmers themselves are responsible for it if things do not go well with them. I want to quote what the hon. the Minister said here in this House last year. He said that the best use should be made of our natural resources and manpower. He said that the Government accepted the principle of private enterprise but that no Government could guarantee fixed prices to the farmers, and that if the farmers produced far more of a certain product than could be absorbed by the local market, they would have to be satisfied with the overseas price. He also said that farming operations should be adapted to meet changed conditions. I do not have the time to read everything but I would like to quote the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The maize crop is going to be a Frankenstein, says Nel. A real danger exists that the maize crop which notwithstanding the drought is a record one, can develop into a Frankenstein monster created by scientific methods of agriculture in general and soil conservation in particular.</block>

<p>That is just what I have said for many years. The increased production in agriculture is due to the ability of our farmers and the improved methods which they are applying and which they grasp with both hands if they are given information and guidance. But this is all in spite of the Government. If we had a better Government the farmers would be in a far better position.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have just listened to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). What did the hon. member really say? All she did was to fulminate against all and sundry, including the Prime Minister because he sold his farm. She attacked the hon. member for Wakkerstroom because he lives in town. She talked about the report on South West Africa and asked what was being done for the poor farmers. Did the hon. member ever examine the Estimates last year to see how much was being paid out in subsidies on various commodities? Why does she not mention that? What proportion of the administration costs of the control boards is being paid by the State? But the hon. member mentions the report of the South West Africa commission and suggests that that report is scandalous. I leave it at that. Sir, what I found very interesting was the fact that the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) referred to the reasonableness of the Minister. While he was doing so I thought immediately of the motion introduced last year by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) in which he asked that the two Ministers of Agriculture should resign. But to-day the hon. member says that the Minister is very reasonable and he therefore makes his appeal to the Minister. But the second thing which he admits is that economically South Africa is faring well. The hon. member for Gardens says that that prosperity must be shared. Sir, one of the easiest things to do is to propose the appointment of a commission to tackle a task as soon as it becomes a little difficult. The hon. member says that the present prosperity must be shared with the farmers, but he puts forward no proposal. He simply says that a commission should be appointed to investigate the position. Must the consumers be subsidized? No, all he says is that a commission should be appointed.</p>

<p>But to my mind this motion contains another significant admission. It says that farmers who do not farm efficiently must clear out. That is what the hon. member for Gardens said, and I should like to hear from him what he regards as an efficient farmer. I leave it at that. It has become perfectly clear over the years that hon. members on the other side who continually talk about the Marketing Act know little about it or that they have never read the Act. What they read into it is that it is based on the principle of production costs plus a profit. Indeed the hon. member for East London (City) said so. I wonder whether he has ever read the Act. Where does the idea come from that that is the formula of the Marketing Act? The Marketing Act is simply an enabling measure. It gives the Minister the power to do certain things&#x2014;to appoint boards, amongst other things.</p>

<p>Here I just want to refer again to what was said a moment ago about the mealie price by the hon. member for East London (City). The hon. member stated that the price which was fixed the year before last was not the price which the Maize Board had recommended. I should like to know from him where he obtained that information, because that is not correct. For many years, as far as I can remember, the price recommended by the Maize Board has been accepted by the hon. the Minister. That price is worked out on the cost of production plus entrepreneur&#x2019;s remuneration.</p>

<p>Last year&#x2019;s price was lower because the levy was increased. That decision <span class="col_631-632" refersTo="page_0330"/>was taken by the Maize Board. There are three parties who can supplement any short-fall in the price of maize. One can make the consumer pay more if consumption is not going to be adversely affected by it. But does the hon. member want to tell me that the price of maize to the consumer could have been pushed up further? Is the hon. member prepared to say that?</p>

<p>We know that the farmers will use highly subsidized meal instead of maize if the price of maize to the consumer rises too high. And we know that the farmers here in the Western Province will fall back on lupins. The second party who can meet the shortfall is the State by way of subsidy. But does the hon. member realize what a high subsidy the State is already paying on maize in comparison with the subsidy paid on other products? The hon. member referred to dairy products. Last year the State increased the subsidy on dairy products by a considerable margin, but in spite of that the State agreed to continue to pay a reasonable amount to the maize industry by way of subsidy. The third party who remains then is the producer himself who is called upon to meet the balance of the shortfall by way of a levy. The year before last the crop was considerably in excess of the estimated figure with the result that the levy funds were exhausted, and that is why the levy had to be pushed up last year by such a large amount.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>Why was the price increased last year?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Because there was a smaller loss on export maize. The maize farmer did reasonably well because there was an increase in oversea prices. Freight charges also increased but the increase in the oversea price was bigger than the increase in freight charges. Last year the crop was 62,000,000 and this year the crop is just under 65,000,000. With an increase of 3,000,000 bags the position is reasonably good as far as the maize farmer is concerned. Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that the producers have full control through their own representatives on the Maize Board. The Board decides what the maize price is to be and submits its recommendation to the Minister for his approval. In that way the producer therefore exercises control over the price. Sir, I think in actual fact the motion of the hon. member is tantamount to one of no-confidence in the agricultural industry and particularly in organized agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that those industries which he mentioned have not been getting their due share either. Must this commission determine the ratio according to which a specific branch of the agricultural industry must be given its due share? Must it be given its rightful share in relation to secondary industries or in relation to the gold mining industry? With which sector of the economy are you going to compare those branches of the agricultural industry which according to the hon. member are doing reasonably well? There are a few industries which the hon. member mentioned which are doing well at the moment. Amongst others he mentioned the wool industry where the greatest portion of our production is exported to countries abroad; in other words, an industry which depends primarily on an export market. The hon. member&#x2019;s attitude is that the wool industry has not been getting its rightful share in the economic boom in this country. This commission of enquiry is now going to find that the wool industry, in relation to other economic activities, has not been getting its due share. What are we going to do about it? If the commission which he would like to appoint makes such a finding, is his attitude then going to be that such an industry must be subsidized by the State so that it does get its rightful share in the prosperity of South Africa? I should like to hear what the hon. member proposes to do in those circumstances. Let us understand each other clearly. We are now talking about a rightful share for the farmer and how that rightful share can be given to him. It is of no avail simply to institute an enquiry to determine whether a particular industry is getting its due share in the present economic boom. If the commission finds that the industry is not getting its due share, what are we going to do then? Are we then going to say, &#x201C;Unfortunately it is not getting its rightful share?&#x201D; or are we going to <span class="col_633-634" refersTo="page_0331"/>take steps to enable that industry to obtain its due share? If no steps are going to be taken why institute such an enquiry then? I ask the hon. member what steps can be taken to give such an industry its rightful share in the economic boom. But the hon. member must remember that it is not only wool which is largely an export product. Thirty-five per cent of our agricultural products is produced mainly for the export market, and if it is found that those industries have not been getting their due share in the economic boom then surely no purpose will have been served by the appointment of a commission of enquiry. After all, we know what the circumstances are; we know what their prices are. We ourselves can judge whether those people are struggling or whether they are not struggling. But it is no use knowing all these things if you are not going to take steps to ensure that those industries are given their rightful share. What means can be used if one finds that the income of a certain industry which relies mainly on the export market is not high enough? There is only one method which can be used to ensure that its income is sufficient, and that is the payment of a State subsidy direct to that particular producer. Let us assume that we appoint such a commission of enquiry and that it makes such a finding. Is the hon. member prepared to say and is his Party prepared to say that one should subsidize those branches of the industry which produce mainly for the export market? I should like the Opposition to reply to this. If that is not their attitude, then I want to know what useful purpose such an enquiry can serve.</p>

<p>There is no other way. If the hon. member can think of any other way I should like to hear from her what that way is. My question to the Opposition is this: Why should one institute an enquiry to determine whether a specific industry is getting its due share if one is not prepared to say that the Government must use the taxpaper&#x2019;s money to subsidize that industry? But what tests does one apply to determine whether an industry is in fact getting its rightful share in the prosperity of this country?</p>

<p>What test do we apply to-day to our industries to see whether they are sharing in the present upsurge in our economy? In the first instance one looks at the value of the shares in that industry&#x2014;whether the value of the shares is decreasing or increasing. Surely that is only logical. Take the agricultural industry over the past few years; we need not go back more than three years. We know how the price of land has risen over the past three years. Such a commission of enquiry will quite possibly find that one of the reasons why certain branches of the agricultural industry are not getting their rightful share in the present economic boom, is to be found in the enormously high prices which are being paid for land in South Africa. I want to ask hon. members of the Opposition to mention one single branch of farming in South Africa in which there has not been a consistent rise in the price of land in recent years.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that there has been a general rise in the price of land.

Let me put a second question. Let us assume that the commission finds that the reason why the farmer is not getting a good income is because his interest on his capital investment, particularly his land, is too high.

One of the most important bases on which it rests is that it operates in a free economy; it forms part of a free economy. A second important foundation on which it rests is that the farmer operates under a system of free enterprise, and he therefore decides, according to the markets offering for the various products, what he is prepared to <span class="col_635-636" refersTo="page_0332"/>pay for his land, what he is going to produce on it and how he is going to farm it.</p>

<p>The fact remains that if the Government is expected to ensure at all times that certain people or certain branches of the agricultural industry are able to share fully in the upsurge in the economic sphere whether they are producing an export product or a product sold in the domestic market, then the Government will not be able to allow the farmer to operate under a system of free enterprise. Because what determines one&#x2019;s profits? It is not the way in which one farms. The most important factor which determines one&#x2019;s profits is one&#x2019;s capital investment in land. I have already asked, in the case of export products, what one could do if such a commission were to find that a particular industry was not getting its rightful share in the prosperity of this country. Now I want to refer to products which are controlled internally but many of which will gradually have to compete on the export market as far as the surplus portion of the production is concerned. If that commission were to find that in these other industries, such as our wheat industry or our maize industry, the farmers are not getting their due share in the economic boom&#x2014;and I accept and admit that there are certain branches of our agricultural industry which have not benefited to the same extent from the present economic upsurge as many of our other industries&#x2014;if that commission were to make such a finding, we would still be faced with the same problem, and that is that we would be dealing with a product which is produced by our farmers and for which we must find a market internally. We have had a very big maize crop over the past few years. We know that at the price which the consumer is asked to pay, a certain quantity of that maize can be sold in the domestic market. More than that quantity one cannot sell. The maize is available and if the consumer is prepared to pay more, then one can sell more. How can one sell more to him? In order to try to place the farmer in a better position a portion of the production has to be exported or one has to sell more maize at that higher price. What are the methods which one can use to improve the farmers&#x2019; position? We come back to precisely the same problem, and that is that the State will have to intervene by paying a subsidy to ensure that the farmer gets his rightful share in the economic boom.</p>

<p>I do not think that the hon. member who moved the motion made out a good case for the appointment of a commission to investigate these things. The case which he tried to make out, as the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) has already proved, is common knowledge; it is known to all the various organizations in our agricultural industry. These things which are taking place in the agricultural industry are not unknown; it is not unknown that certain branches of the agricultural industry are not doing as well as other branches It is not unknown either that some of our farmers are having a more difficult time than others as a result of climatic conditions. Nor is it unknown that there are fewer farmers in agriculture to-day than there were 30, 20 or 10 years ago. It is a tendency which began to manifest itself many years ago. These are facts which are generally known and they require no investigation. But the fact remains that if we want to rectify those things then we must alter our basic agricultural policy. If we do not want the farmers to leave the platteland or if we want to ensure that there are no fewer farmers on the platteland than there were formerly, then we must change the whole basic agricultural structure. Does the hon. member want to suggest that all the farmers who have disappeared from the platteland, cleared out because they suffered economic setbacks? No, many of the farmers who cleared out of the farming industry gave up farming precisely because there were many other farmers who were doing very well and who were in a position to offer them a high price for their land. The hon. member for Gardens is aware of that. When did the greatest number of farmers give up farming in the sheep areas in the Karoo? Did they do so when wool was reasonably cheap? No, most of them cleared out of the agricultural industry at a time when wool was fetching the highest price because other farmers were able to make high offers for their land. Surely that is a fact which is generally known.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I admit that it is usually the small farmer who does not have such a large income. He gets an attractive offer from a big farmer who is able to pay him more for his land and he then decides to sell. Surely that is perfectly clear. Is the Government expected to take steps to ensure that farmers do not quit the agricultural industry on a larger scale? Must it say to the farmer, &#x201C;You can no longer operate under a system of free enterprise; you may not own any more than a certain area of land; you may not buy out the small farmer&#x201D;? I should like hon. members to state their attitude clearly. I should like to hear their views. Must we place a restraint on the free enterprise of the farmer? Must we prohibit him from buying up the <span class="col_637-638" refersTo="page_0333"/>land of other farmers? It is nonsensical to allege that all the farmers who cleared out of the agricultural industry were people who became bankrupt or who could not make a living. Where drought conditions or other circumstances have made it difficult for the farmer to carry on with his farming, certain measures have been taken by the State to enable him to continue to farm as long as possible. He has been granted financial assistance. If a farmer is approached by another farmer who has accumulated a great deal of capital and who has done so precisely because of the high prices of agricultural produce, and he is offered a price which is far above the income value of his farm, it is only natural that he will sell his farm because he can invest that money more profitably. But let us take another basic principle of our agricultural policy and see whether hon. members of the Opposition agree with it, and that is that the agricultural industry in South Africa must make the best use of its land and its manpower, in conjunction with all the other industries, and if, as the position has been throughout the years, there are certain people employed in the agricultural industry to-day whose services are not being used to the best advantage and those people can do better for themselves in the urban areas or in secondary industry or elsewhere, must the Government forbid those persons to quit the agricultural industry?

<p>Let me put this question now to the hon. member: Let us assume that a farmer who enjoys a high income wishes to buy the land of a smaller farmer at an uneconomic price. Must the Government prohibit him from buying it? There are cases where farmers also clear out of the agricultural industry as a result of other circumstances. After all, we know what the position was throughout the whole of the platte-land in South Africa. Some years ago we had the <i>bywoner</i> (share-cropper) system, and those <i>bywoners</i> were all registered as farmers. As a result of the better wages which they could earn in secondary industry those <i>bywoners</i> gradually disappeared from the rural areas because their labour could be put to better use in secondary industry. Must the Government forbid their absorption in those industries? No, I say that the basic policy in the agricultural industry is to make the best use of both manpower and land, in the interests of the whole economy of South Africa and not only in the interests of the agricultural industry as such.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words now on the question of the prices of agricultural products. Hon. members of the Opposition have consistently argued that the farmer can be kept on the platteland by giving him a higher price for his products, whether it is given to him by passing the increase on to the consumer or whether it is given to him by way of a subsidy paid by the State. They maintain that if the price is better more farmers will remain on the platteland. But even this argument, since there are different categories of farmers, is not correct because the one farmer, on the same prices as that received by the other farmer for his products, makes a good living; he makes money and he makes headway. The other farmer who gets the same price makes a poorer living&#x2014;for many reasons. His farm may be small perhaps; he does not have the overall large income which the other farmer has; he does not have as much initiative as the other farmer; he is not as capable as the other farmer, and he does not therefore earn the same income. Assuming that the price is pushed up still further, then it will still mean that the profits of the big farmer who has more initiative and who has a bigger farm will be much higher than they are to-day and he will be in a very much better position to buy out the small or the poor farmer. This method therefore offers no solution for the problem of depopulation. If we are honestly and sincerely seeking a solution to this problem it will not help us to fight against windmills and to put forward half-baked ideas. We should try to evolve a scheme which will offer a solution.</p>

<p>The argument has been used here that the percentage which the agricultural industry contributes to the national income has decreased over the years. But that is a phenomenon which one finds not only in South Africa; it is a phenomenon which one finds in all the developed countries of the world. In America, for example, the percentage which the agricultural industry contributes to the American national income is only 4 per cent. But it goes much further than that; in America the policy of the State is to induce 100,000 farmers to leave the rural areas within the next five years, whereas in this country our policy is the very opposite, i.e. to keep the farmers on the platteland as far as possible, and to give every possible aid to the agricultural industry to achieve that end. But even with the provision of this aid we are still faced with the position that the farmer who is in a better economic position will be able to buy out the farmer who is in a weaker economic position. Let me also add that one simply cannot prevent people <span class="col_639-640" refersTo="page_0334"/>from clearing out of the agricultural industry. Just as little as one can prevent a small baker or any other person who runs a personal business from giving up that business, so little can one prevent farmers from giving up farming from time to time. One cannot keep on the platteland all the farmers who are there to-day unless one is prepared to alter the whole basic structure of the agricultural industry, unless one is prepared to say that instead of allowing free enterprise and instead of allowing people to own large tracts of land, one is going to pass legislation to provide that the farming community must consist of small farmers who make their living solely out of their labour on the platteland. If that is our attitude then we must make it known that that is our policy and we must accept it as our policy.</p>

<p>What do you say?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I say &#x201C;No&#x201D;. I have just explained what my attitude is. Our policy is that the farmer as an entrepreneur with a free hand must be able to make his own choice, and if under this system of free enterprise he can make his own choice, we will still find that in certain cases farmers, exercising their own free choice, using their own capital and relying on their own capabilities, will prove failures. If we want to obviate the possibility that some of them may clear out then we must not allow them a free choice because once we do so we cannot stop this tendency. If the United Party&#x2019;s attitude is that that is what we must do, then they should say so. I just want them to state their attitude. I am stating mine here, and I think I do so on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the National Party. We regard the farmer as an entrepreneur with a free hand and our attitude is that he should retain his right to free enterprise. If he wants to retain his right to free enterprise, then it is up to him to take the risk of failure or otherwise. The Government makes available sufficient assistance to the farmer. I do not have the time to-day to go into all the different forms of aid which the Government makes available to the farmer. We have our technical extension services; there is the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board, there is the State Advances Office, there are crop loans, production loans, loans to purchase land, and there are subsidies for various purposes. The Government is doing everything in its power, by means of these different forms of aid, to keep the farmer on the land as an entrepreneur with a free hand. If the farmer, under this system of free enterprise, makes a capital investment in land, an investment which gets him into difficulties, or if, because of his own inefficiency, he cannot make a success of his farming venture, in spite of all the technological aid which is placed at his disposal, then the Government cannot be expected to keep him on the land under a system of free enterprise, at the expense of the whole of the population. Surely that is perfectly clear. These various forms of aid are there to assist him as much as possible. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Lands places many farmers on the land. I extracted certain figures the other day relating to one of our settlements, where land was allotted for R220,000 over a period of 8-9 years from 1950 to 1958, but recognized valuators of the Land Bank and other bodies valued that land in 1959 at R2,000,000. In other words, it has been calculated that actually this land was given to those people for one-tenth of its true value. If a person is unable to make a success of his farming after having been given a smallholding under those conditions, must the State then subsidize and give him further assistance so that he can retain that smallholding? Surely in those circumstances he should quit. He is placed there as an entrepreneur with a free hand. He is under a certain amount of supervision to begin with but later on he has to manage his own business.</p>

<p>I say therefore that at this stage I cannot see that any useful purpose can be served by a commission of enquiry because, as has been pointed out correctly by hon. members on this side of the House, our agricultural industry is organized from top to bottom. The S.A. Agricultural Union knows the position of every branch of the industry and it is acquainted with every commodity problem in the agricultural industry. They are acquainted with every financial problem. There is the Woolgrowers&#x2019; Association which forms part of the Agricultural Union. Then there are the provincial agricultural unions. These bodies do not hesitate to come to the Minister every day to discuss their problems. Apart from these bodies we have our Government Departments. We have our Department of Agricultural Technical Services which passes on information to the farmers, information which formerly they had to pick up from their own experience. I admit that many of our farmers have made a great contribution to our increased production, but on the other hand let us also be grateful; let us recognize the work which is being done by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, by Onderstepoort and by our entymologists. Let us be grateful and acknowledge that they have made a tremendous contribution in promoting our agricultural industry, even though they have done so behind the scenes. Those different forms of aid are all available to our farmers. There are, of course, certain problems with which we still have to cope but research in that connection is being undertaken every day.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that periodically we in South Africa have other problems as well, problems other than economic problems which are caused by poor prices. There are certain parts of our country which suffer enormously because of periodic droughts and many farmers get into difficulties as a result of drought conditions. During the past few years this Government has done more than any previous Government ever did to tide those farmers over this periodic spell of hardship. I say that without any fear of contradiction.</p>

<p><span class="col_641-642" refersTo="page_0335"/>Certain schemes which are of a permanent character have been put into operation to overcome these difficulties and problems. With the organization that we have in the agricultural industry, with the agricultural organization of the farmer himself, with the control boards, with the various departments providing extension services and doing research, I see no reason for the appointment of a commission to inquire into the agricultural industry because I feel that most branches of our agricultural industry have in fact been getting their share in this new expansion and development.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has not told us of any positive steps that have been taken to keep the small farmer on the land. We on this side of the House gave him chapter and verse as to the number of farmers who had left the land and who had drifted back to the towns. The Minister gave a number of reasons the main one being that the fact that farmers left their farms was because of the high price they paid for their land. But who sets the price of land to a great extent in this country, Sir? Is it not the Lands Department, and the Government itself through the Land Bank, mortgage bonds, valuations and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development through the purchase of land over the last few years in many of the platte-land areas? But I do not want to take that any further. I feel the Minister has not given us any positive reasons that we can attack because he has not told us of any positive steps his Government has taken.</p>

<p>I want to come to matters not raised during this debate up to the present, but before doing so, I just want to reply to a point made by the hon. members for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) and Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) when they said that the motion of the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) was a motion of no-confidence in organized agriculture and the Marketing Act. Mr. Speaker, it is no such thing. It is plainly and very simply a motion of no-confidence in the present Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing because the success or otherwise of the application of the Marketing Act must be sought in the final marketing of the products and the prices as fixed by this Minister. I want to deal with a product that does not come under the Marketing Act but under the Dairy Industries Control Act where the prices are fixed by this Minister. There has been a tremendous setback in that industry which forms a great part of the agricultural industry of this country. I refer to the dairy industry of the Republic. Three years ago this hon. Minister saw fit to drop the price of butterfat and industrial milk by 2d. per pound. I and others on this side of the House warned the hon. the Minister of the dangers of dropping the price because there was a very slight over-production at that particular time. We had our quota to the United Kingdom cut because we had left the Commonwealth for one thing and when the quotas were re-allocated we got a lower quota. We were one of the countries affected. Certain Commonwealth countries were affected but we were more affected than Commonwealth countries. Because we had that slight over-production&#x2014;most of our dairy products are consumed in this country&#x2014;the dairy producer, especially the industrial milk producer who had proved through his cost of production figures that he was already working on a non-profit margin, was penalized to such an extent that he was producing at a loss. On top of that he was hit by drought conditions in that particular year. We warned the hon. the Minister that this was going to cause tremendous hardship to the producers of dairy products. But he took no notice and said that one could not disregard the principle of supply and demand and that if the price was brought down there would be higher consumption. On top of that the Dairy Industries Control Board started a countrywide campaign of &#x201C;Eat more Butter&#x201D;, &#x201C;Eat more Cheese&#x201D;. They spent a tremendous amount of money of the dairy products producer on that campaign. They had what was known as cheese weeks and cheese days throughout the country. After spending a great deal of that money, when the public was getting conditioned to eating more butter and cheese, we found that we were in short supply. That was very bad organization, Sir. The result was that we had to import Australian butter and New Zealand cheese. The funds from our levies subscribed by those already hit, and very hard hit, were being used to increase the consumption of products that we were importing from other countries at that stage. If that was not a very poor form of campaign, then I do not know what is. Instead of restoring the 2d. per lb. and also the industrial milk price to what is had been when they were producing on a marginal basis they left the price at below cost of production so that those farmers were left in the position where they were not making a reasonable profit at all.</p>

<p>Then I come to the fresh milk producer who is on a fixed price throughout the country, a price which is fixed not at a minimum and maximum but at a maximum only. The producer in Natal was feeling the pinch very much. Last year we experienced a tremendous shortage in Natal, as I mentioned in this House at the time. For a period they were thousands of gallons of fresh milk short in Durban per day. Permission had to be given to introduce milk from unlicensed premises into Durban, something which was not fair to those people who had produced, at a very high cost, from specially licensed premises, premises which were subject to the very closest inspection and which had called for a high capital investment.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, that is just one side. There are many more products which are not under any control at all. So we need this investigation. There is the vegetable producer.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>At the Conference of Administrators held in Cape Town in 1958 it was decided to appoint a committee to investigate and report on the training of personnel for auxiliary medical services or for the training of staff for paramedical professions and vocations, as it is called in this Bill. A committee consisting of eight members was then appointed, six of which represented the medical profession. They reported in April 1959, and their report was accepted by the Administrators. This committee, <i>inter alia</i>, recommended that paramedical personnel should be trained in special schools established with the object of serving the various provinces, and their intention was that these schools should be established by the provinces in co-operation with their respective hospital services, and that these schools which are to train this paramedical personnel should avoid duplication as far as possible. I mention this fact in order to indicate that the provinces only after very thorough investigation went so far as to approach this House for an extension of their powers, as is asked for in this Bill. The primary object of the establishment of these schools is the training of paramedical personnel for use in the provinces concerned but it will be unavoidable that this staff which is trained by the provinces will, due to the national shortage of such staff, also be used outside the province in which they are trained. They will be used by other provinces, other State Departments and also by private bodies outside those provinces. In addition, it is essential, in order to avoid duplication, that the training given in the various provinces should not all be the same. The desirable state of affairs in regard to the training of this paramedical personnel would be for one province to concentrate in one direction and for another province to specialize in a different direction. So, for example, the Transvaal has now asked, at the request of the S.A. Council for the Blind, that they should be allowed to start with the training of blind physiotherapists. It is easy to understand that, due to the shortage of blind therapists in this country, other provinces will also want to make use of those trained people, but in terms of the present legislation the position is that other provinces cannot make use of persons who will, e.g., be trained in the Transvaal, because the law provides at the moment that such trained persons must be used by a provincial hospital service in that province only. It is therefore being proposed in this Bill that the provinces should be clothed with the power to incur expenditure for the purposes of establishing such schools to train paramedical staff. That will be done in consultation with the Minister of Finance. The Minister of Education and the Minister of Finance will decide on the type of courses which should be provided and where they should be provided. I may just mention that there will be further control. The Minister of Education will exercise further control over these training courses by virtue of the fact that he may fix the period of training in such courses. By granting the provinces this power a national need will really be complied with, because it will ensure there being no duplication or any unnecessary waste of the limited number of teachers. It is proposed that this Bill should be retrospective to 1 January this year. The only object here is to cover, by this retrospective effect of the Bill, any experimental schemes which may exist in any of the provinces and which are not yet covered in this way. We feel that this is an urgent and essential national service, and we do not want it to be delayed by any unnecessary difficulties. It is in the interests of the country for these services to be instituted as freely as possible.</p>

<p>On this side of the House we are prepared to support this Bill and to wish it all success. The hon. the Deputy Minister who has just sat down has dealt with the main provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p><span class="col_645-646" refersTo="page_0337"/>I do not propose therefore to traverse them myself. Sir, he has dealt with the question of duplication of services to some extent. I want to say at once that so far as this side of the House is concerned we are very well aware of the difficulty we are having in finding adequate practitioners, not only trained medical and nursing personnel but the people who in the past used to be called members of the auxiliary services, the people who were associated with the medical profession and who in this Bill are called paramedical personnel. Sir, we are woefully short of such people also. While it is true that the Minister will be able to control any possible duplication of services I hope that he will view leniently and with a very sympathetic eye the extension of services for the training of what one might call semi-professional people. They are professional in a way&#x2014;they undergo very severe training. They have to a very large extent the health and the happiness of people in their hands when they are working, as many of them do, in a physical capacity such as physiotherapists and others. They have the patients under their care and they have to be properly trained. I say we are woefully short of those people. It is right, of course, that the provinces ask for the extension of their powers. While that extension is granted in this particular Bill it is under the control of the Minister to a very great extent and we hope, as I have said, that he will view with great sympathy and understanding the dire shortage of such people in our society and do everything in his power to increase the output of trained people, i.e. trained in their special branch or calling of the medical profession, such as is contemplated in this Bill. We support the measure, Sir.</p>

<p>I rise to ask the hon. the Minister whether the provisions of this amending Bill will apply to the Coloured people of South Africa. There is nothing to indicate that the facilities which are offered here will also be offered to institutions which are now under the control of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs or institutions which may have or will in future be established. I should like to make this appeal to the hon. the Minister and draw the attention of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs to this, that the Coloured people too will be anxious to benefit from legislation such as we have before the House at the moment. I hope the hon. the Minister will, in legislation of this type, legislation which is very welcome indeed and a step forward, ensure that the Coloured people also get these facilities. I hope the two hon. Ministers who deal with the Coloured people of South Africa will try to extend all the facilities indicated in this Bill to such schools or institutions which are solely run by the Coloured people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the support granted to this measure by hon. members opposite, and particularly by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). I can give him the assurance that we are very keen to speed up this training. The only thing that was really lacking was this agreement which was arrived at only in July last year between the various Provincial Administrations and the Department of Education, Arts and Science. That agreement, which is now being put into effect, will certainly ensure the speedy action the hon. member desires.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) that this Bill makes no distinction on the grounds of race or colour. The facilities created here will be for the benefit of every racial group in the country.</p>

<p>Second Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Herbert Ainsworth Settlers Trust Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>I would like to give the House a summary of the developments which led to the introduction of this Amendment Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Ainsworth died in December 1920.</p>

<p>His will provides for certain pecuniary legacies and for the conversion of the whole of the residue of his property into money. The will further provides for that amount to be paid into trust and for the trustees to apply the capital amount of such sum and the interest derived therefrom, in assisting such men of British birth as they may think fit, to come to South Africa from the United Kingdom, to settle here as farmers or market gardeners. I wish to draw special attention to the provision that they should come from the United Kingdom. This is important for the purposes of the amendment and I shall deal with it in greater detail later.</p>

<p>The conditions stipulated in the will are that the advances may be used to cover passage costs, the purchase price of land or implements, or for any other purpose approved by the trustees. Advances at that time were limited to R300 to any one person, repayable over a period of not more than ten years, with interest at the rate of 4 per cent.</p>

<p>By 1934 the number of settlers who made use of this financial assistance had reached a low level and the trustees realized that to be of any use, the maximum amount per immigrant would have to be increased considerably. A private Bill was accordingly introduced and the amount was increased to R1,000 per person.</p>

<p><span class="col_647-648" refersTo="page_0338"/>However, it soon became apparent that the amount of R1,000 was still not sufficient to induce settlers to make use of the scheme and in 1953 the number had dwindled to such an extent that the trustees again sponsored a private Bill and this time Parliament approved of the maximum amount being increased from R1,000 to R10,000 per settler.</p>

<p>The trustees have now made representations to the Government that since 1953 only 12 settlers have been assisted and at present only nine persons enjoy loans from the fund. Since its inception 187 settlers were granted loans from the fund.</p>

<p>In spite of extensive propaganda, advertising and other means of encouraging men of British birth to come to South Africa to settle here as farmers or market gardeners, applications for assistance received during the past ten years, as I have already mentioned, have been few and far between.</p>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Can you tell us how many?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>It is a negligible number. I do not believe it is half a dozen. The trustees are of the opinion that there are three reasons for this namely:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Farming conditions in South Africa are so vastly different from those in the United Kingdom.</li>

<li>(b) The maximum amount of R10,000 which can be advanced is not sufficient under present-day conditions to establish a settler on the land unless he has considerable capital of his own.</li>

<li>(c) With the current pattern of interest rates, the rate at which interest must be charged in terms of the will, namely 4 per cent, is only a minor benefit to a settler, especially as there is a further stipulation that all loans must be repaid within a period of ten years.</li>

</ol>

<p>Provision has accordingly been made in this Bill:</p>

<p>Firstly, for the maximum amount which can be lent to any one settler to be increased from R10,000 to R20,000.</p>

<p>Secondly, for the rate of interest to be reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent and:</p>

<p>Thirdly, for the period in which loans must be repaid, to be extended from ten to 15 years.</p>

<p>Hon. members may be interested to know that the initial amount which was paid over to the fund was R136,000 and that at 30 June 1963 the capital stood at R198,306. There has been a considerable increase. On that date the capital amount owing by settlers was R55,412.</p>

<p>Have there been any losses?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>Not as far as I know.</p>

<p>I shall now deal with the other very important provision in this Bill, namely that the South African trustees shall have the power to assist any man of British birth as they may think fit to come to the Republic of South Africa and settle here as a farmer or a market gardener.</p>

<p>Earlier in this speech I drew attention to the original provision that assistance should be limited to persons who come to South Africa from the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>During the past few years the trustees have had numerous inquiries from persons of British birth who wish to come to South Africa from territories in Africa, especially from Kenya, the Rhodesias and other African countries.</p>

<p>As far as East Africa is concerned, particularly Kenya, the position is well known, but it may be as well that I should restate it here.</p>

<p>Farmers who were in comfortable financial circumstances in East Africa&#x2014;some of them may have been well-off&#x2014;find after they have migrated to the Republic that they have insufficient funds to continue as independent farmers.</p>

<p>They have to leave their countries of origin as a result of circumstances beyond their control. They are unable to realize the full value of their property. Usually they have to accept prices far below the actual value. They are not allowed to bring stock to the Republic and very often machinery and equipment go for a song or simply have to be abandoned because the cost of transport is prohibitive.</p>

<p>Generally speaking these people are very capable farmers. In many cases they are experienced in lines of farming such as sisal, coffee, tea and pyrethrum which are at present being developed in South Africa and may grow into new industries. On the other hand, these farmers usually have had no other training and if they cannot be set up as farmers their placement presents great difficulty. Our experience has been that there are very few vacancies in South Africa for farm managers and foremen.</p>

<p>May I also remind the House that whilst we do not recruit immigrants on the continent of Africa, those Whites who decide to come here of their own free will and are prepared to accept our way of life have been assured by the Government that they would be welcome. Selection on the grounds of occupation is consequently not as strict in their cases as in respect of immigrants from elsewhere. We are morally committed to assist these people.</p>

<p>The offer of the Herbert Ainsworth Settlers Fund to increase the loans and to assist immigrants of British birth who come from countries in Africa is a most generous act for which we are grateful and I trust that the House will agree to the proposed amendments.</p>

<p>Will you tell us who the trustees are?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The trustees are of course changing from time to time. At the moment the trustees are Mr. Ramsay who is the manager of the South African General Investment Corporation, Mr. Ian MacKenzie and Mr. Donald Laing. They are well-known men in the financial world in Johannesburg and they are men of repute.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by saying that I am grateful that you, Sir, allowed this Bill to be introduced as a public Bill, the reason, of course, as you stated in your ruling, being that it is in the public interest, and it was at the request of the trustees. For them to have to promote another private Bill will entail considerable expenditure and there is a measure of urgency in this measure because applications are now coming in at an increased tempo, and applicants have to be turned down from time to time.</p>

<p>I just want to reply to the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). There have been bad debts. For the period 1953-63 the bad debts written off were R8,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I commend this Bill to the House. As I have said it should receive the support of the whole House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are grateful to the hon. the Minister for the details he has given us. I personally want to thank him for the replies he has given me in regard to one or two points. The Bill will have the full support of this side of the House. My mind goes back to something like two years ago when this side of the House made a special plea for a sympathetic approach to the White settlers who were coming down to us from the north and those countries that were in difficulty. May I right at this stage&#x2014;perhaps the hon. the Minister will deal with it when he replies&#x2014;make the point that, as the Minister said just now, there were certain people to the north of us who have had to leave those countries for certain reasons beyond their control. Now, Sir, I suggest that all of them are not of British birth. This Bill only applies to people of British birth. I do not think those people who were born in the countries to the north of us can claim to be of British birth for the purposes of this particular Bill. A person born in Britain who has migrated to one of those countries and then come down here can claim to be of British birth, but I do not think the offspring of people from Britain, offspring that were born in the countries to the north of us, can claim to be persons of British birth for the purposes of this Bill. Perhaps the Minister will explain that when he replies. Not that that would make any difference to our whole approach to this question, Sir. We have, if anything, only a regret that there is a limitation. There are so many good people, not only of British birth but of other European descent, who have had to leave the countries to our north. We are pleased that they feel that South Africa is a place in which they can find a new home, even late in their lives as it is for many of them. We should like to do everything that we can to make them feel that they have indeed come to a new home where they will find that which they have lost up in the north.</p>

<p>The details which the hon. the Minister has given us in regard to the amount of the loan are of great interest. I think we agree with the Minister that the amount which the trustees could advance in the past was probably on the low side. The loans are, of course, not available to anyone coming into the country and who is of British birth. The loans are only available to those who are farmers or market gardeners. Within the four corners of that definition, Sir, it is not clear what constitutes a farmer in South Africa today when you see all who call themselves farmers. But in terms of this Bill only a farmer or market gardener can get a loan from the Herbert Ainsworth Trust. There again it is perhaps a part of our economy which we would like to see strengthened. The testator decided that that was the limitation that he was going to impose in his will. So be it; there can be no complaint about that. We are not objecting to the purpose. I say it is a part of the economy of South Africa that we should like to see strengthened. We should like to see farmers and market gardeners who come here and take up that calling to be placed in a position where they would be viable and where they would have a worthwhile economic future in front of them. We do not want to see them fail. One does not want to pursue the reasons as to why there were bad debts. That is understandable in the circumstances. We are pleased to see that the interest rates have been reduced. That, I think, is a good thing in all the circumstances. So that by and large, Sir, we have small complaint on this side of the House in regard to the provisions of this Bill. We agree that it is in the public interest and that it should be introduced as a public measure. To the extent that the door is now open for the trustees to assist a larger number of people and in a more substantial manner and make their economic future more secure than would otherwise have been the case we are very pleased indeed to lend our support to this Bill.</p>

<p>Yes, they were born in Britain. I do not think we can go too far in completely upsetting a will in which certain terms are definitely laid down. But where it is simply a question of increasing the amount, there is a big fund, and lowering the interest rate and increasing the period of repayment, those are not matters of fundamental importance as far as the provisions of the will are concerned. But when we have to deal with the question of persons of British birth who by the will are entitled to this facility&#x2014;and there is a definite provision to that effect in the will&#x2014;then I think the trustees are correct in not asking that it should be extended any further. I feel that they have gone as far as they possibly can without drastically nullifying the provisions of the will made in 1920. I thank hon. members for their support.</p>

<p>Third Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Price Control Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>When the War Measures Continuation Amendment Act was debated in this House in 1952, the Minister of Finance gave an undertaking that all State Departments still charged with administering the war measures would receive instructions to investigate the question of the further extension to 30 June 1965 of those war measures which were no longer absolutely necessary. Further, the Departments concerned were to investigate the possibility or desirability of embodying in permanent legislation those war measures which still had to be enforced.</p>

<p>In terms of this undertaking, I piloted through this House last year the Import and Export Control Act, 1963 (Act No. 45 of 1963), and to-day I am asking hon. members to approve in principle the provisions contained in this Price Control Bill which will replace on a permanent basis the present price control regulations (Proclamation No. 185 of 1946).</p>

<p>As I have repeatedly stated in this House before, it is the policy of the Government, as and when circumstances allow, to suspend price control on commodities and once having suspended it, not lightly to reinstate it. In those circumstances hon. members may ask why it is now essential to pass permanent legislation, particularly in view of the background against which price control was instituted during and just after the war, when commodities were scarce in relation to the demand, whereas to-day there are no shortages. My reply to that is that although price control is at present being applied to only a few commodities like sugar, coal, firearms, ammunition, etc., it is still necessary to allow the speedy machinery provided by the price control regulations to continue to operate in order effectively to combat the tendency on the part of certain groups to fix prices amongst themselves. I can supply hon. members with a complete list of the commodities the prices of which are still being controlled, if required.</p>

<p>The question has also been raised as to whether the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955 (Act No. 24 of 1955), is not sufficient to deal with this practice where people arrive at price agreements amongst themselves, in cases where that has a harmful effect. My immediate reply to this is that the procedure prescribed in terms of this Act is, from the very nature of the matter, a very lengthy one, and that in cases of price control problems the harm will already have been done by the time all the provisions of the Act have been complied with. Moreover, the provisions of the Monopolies Act are much too one-sided, and this Act was never intended to deal with price control problems in all their various facets.</p>

<p>Therefore, in spite of my statement in regard to the Government&#x2019;s policy in connection with price control, care constantly has to be taken to guard against the natural tendency on the part of businessmen under certain circumstances to want to increase prices. It therefore follows that if there is no price control legislation, the Government will be powerless when such practices are applied.</p>

<p>A final point I wish to emphasize, before saying something about the contents of the Bill itself, is that this proposed legislation is purely of an enabling nature. No enforced or necessarily continuous application of price control is prescribed in the Bill, and any control which may be applied in this connection will follow the pattern of Government policy. There may even be times when, although this enabling legislation exists, there will be no price control whatever. But nobody can make such a prediction with any degree of certainty.</p>

<p>In so far as the contents of the Bill are concerned, I may say that the existing war measure, adapted to present-day circumstances and requirements, is embodied in the Bill. There are no appreciable deviations, and in most cases the differences between the existing war measure and this one merely amount to improvements in the legal language and the omission of provisions which may more suitably be embodied in regulations which may be issued in terms of this Bill. The most important provisions in the proposed Bill, which I merely wish to mention at this stage, seeing that they can more suitably be discussed in detail in the Committee Stage, are the following.</p>

<p>In Clause 2 the Minister is empowered to appoint a price controller, who will perform <span class="col_653-654" refersTo="page_0341"/>his duties subject to the control of the Minister. The Secretary for Trade and Industry, who in the past I entrusted with this task, will also fill this position in future.</p>

<p>Clause 3 empowers the price controller, in turn, to appoint officials in the Public Service as deputy price controllers, price control supervisors and price control inspectors.</p>

<p>In Clauses 4 and 5 the price controller is empowered by way of notice given in the <i>Government Gazette</i>to determine maximum prices of goods and services, and also the containers in which goods are to be packed. In the performance of this function he can use his discretion in the sense that he can fix various prices in respect of various transactions, areas, etc. Read together with these two clauses, Clause 6 provides that the price controller may impose certain conditions on a seller or auctioneer of goods at a sale by public auction. That is a necessary provision in order to apply price control as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>In the application of price control, and in view of the prosecutions which may possibly ensue as the result of it, it is necessary, in view of the onus of proof which rests on the prosecutor, that price-controlled goods should be properly marked with their fixed prices. It is equally essential to have a provision in the Act that, if required, invoices for articles sold be issued and preserved. In the case of goods normally sold in commerce, this obligation may be laid on the seller as well on the purchaser of the goods, whilst the seller of goods may be required also to keep a register containing particulars of the processing, manufacturing or production costs. These provisions are quite logical requirements and need no further explanation.</p>

<p>The proposed legal provisions in regard to the marking-up of prices, invoices and registers are contained in Clauses 7, 8 and 11.</p>

<p>Another aspect closely connected with price control is the tendency which may arise on the part of some traders to sell certain goods the prices of which are controlled only under certain conditions. A trader may, for example, tell the purchaser of price-controlled goods that he will sell him those goods only on condition that he also buys other goods the price of which is not controlled. It is obvious that price control can be evaded in this way, and therefore the necessary provision is made in Clause 9 for the price controller to prohibit this practice.</p>

<p>Clause 10 of the Bill, regarded superficially, may appear to be somewhat unreasonable. Its object, however, in cases where traders under circumstances which may be favourable to them set out to exploit the public, is to enable the price controller to act immediately, and to prohibit the sale of the goods concerned until such time as a maximum price can be fixed for those goods. Although it may very seldom be necessary to apply this proposed procedure, it is an essential provision in order to combat deliberate exploitation of the buying public.</p>

<p>Clause 12 provides, as in many other existing Acts, that the price controller, for the effective execution of his duties, may demand from manufacturers, traders or their employees information in regard to any aspect which may be important in the fixing of prices.</p>

<p>Although Clause 13 deals with the powers of price control supervisors and inspectors, it is to some extent complementary to the provisions of Clause 12. It amounts to this, that such an official may demand from an employer or employee all the information which may be necessary in the course of an investigation in order to ascertain whether the provisions of this Act are being implemented, including any books, registers and other documents. In view of the confidential nature of business information contained in balance sheets, manufacturing, operational or profit and loss accounts, the price control supervisor or inspector may, however, not demand those documents unless expressly empowered by the price controller to do so.</p>

<p>A further important provision, the principle of which although not occurring very generally in legislation is at the same time not a strange one, is contained in Clause 14. In terms of this clause the price controller is enabled to instruct a seller of goods, in cases where he has made a buyer pay a price higher than the fixed price, to repay to the buyer a sum amounting to twice the difference between the fixed price and the selling price. If the buyer cannot be traced, this amount has to be paid to the Treasury. The same provision will apply in respect of services rendered. In the same way the controller will be able to instruct a seller who has sold goods on condition that the purchaser also buys other goods to repay to the purchaser the price of the other goods bought. These provisions are also contained in the present price control regulations, and any order issued by the controller in terms of these provisions will have the effect of a civil judgment after a copy thereof has been supplied to the clerk of a magistrate&#x2019;s court. The advantages of these provisions are simply that minor price control contraventions can be dealt with promptly, in addition to the relief afforded to the courts.</p>

<p>In connection with Clause 15 I just want to say that these exemptions are provided for so that the various businesses, such as large bazaars, self-service shops, caf&#x00E9;s, etc., which make use of adding machines, may in terms of this clause apply for exemption from certain of the provisions of this Bill. That is essential, due to the fact that adding machines cannot put down on the strips of paper all the information which in terms of the requirements of this Bill must be entered on invoices.</p>

<p>Clause 16 provides for the validity of certain evidence in court cases in connection with alleged price control contraventions, while Clause 17 places the onus of proof of his innocence in connection with contraventions committed by employees and other subordinates <span class="col_655-656" refersTo="page_0342"/>on the employer or manager, etc., of a business.</p>

<p>The remaining provisions of the Bill are of quite a general nature and really contain no new principles in so far as legislation is concerned, and therefore I do not think it is necessary for me to expatiate on that.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may perhaps just mention that the South West Africa Administration, which was fully consulted with reference to Clause 21, expressed its approval of the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Minister has done his best this afternoon to create the impression that he is introducing what is really a harmless little Bill. He has assured us that this is simply an enabling Bill and that he is taking no further powers&#x2014;in fact not as many powers as now exist in the existing War Measures Regulations. That may be so in the eyes of the hon. Minister. But the fact remains that price control has hitherto been regarded in this country as essentially an emergency measure. The hon. Minister has frankly said this afternoon that until recently he has repeatedly told the House that very thing, that as late as 1959 he told the House that it was neither necessary nor desirable to incorporate in permanent legislation the War Measure dealing with price control. It is true that in 1962 the Minister very briefly did say something quite different when he said that &#x201C;events have shown that enabling legislation, or enabling authority for certain control measures should permanently be at the disposal of the Department&#x201D;. That was the first intimation that we had that the hon. Minister had changed his mind. Now I listened to the hon. Minister very carefully this afternoon to try and learn what the certain events are that made him make, that made his Government make, such a radical departure in the economic policy which has hitherto been followed, and I am bound to say that I have not heard of any from the hon. the Minister. He has told us that the hon. Minister of Finance asked his Department to examine the position as to which of the emergency measures should or should not continue, and apart from that, he has not mentioned any event at all, and he simply mentioned that although the price control measure has been very little used in recent years&#x2014;and he mentioned the very small number of articles and things which are still under price control&#x2014;there were still traders, merchants who were liable to take steps to make undue profits. That is the sole reason which the hon. Minister has given us for introducing this measure this afternoon at very short notice&#x2014;only at our request was this Bill not dealt with last week before most people had even seen it. We can therefore not be blamed for asking why is it (a) that the Bill is being introduced at all, and (b) why is it introduced in such a hurried manner? We know of course the hon. Minister&#x2019;s personal belief in this question. The hon. Minister is a national socialist. He makes no bones about it. I am not belittling the Minister. The Minister has stated in this House quite frankly, and he is entitled to express it, and I am not criticizing it&#x2014;I am simply stating it as a matter of fact&#x2014;he has told us in this House that in his opinion everything ought to be State-controlled right down to the individual person. That is his ideal of a perfect Government. He is entitled to that view. I am not querying it.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Before he denies that, I suggest that he should read his speech again. He told the House that in his opinion the human person could not possibly reach his highest state of perfection except as a member of the State, and he held forth at great length in that speech on what he generally regarded as what he called &#x201C;Liberalism&#x201D;. It is perfectly clear from that speech that he is in favour of a very large measure of State control over the life of the individual. If the hon. Minister has changed his mind in that regard in the same way that he has changed his mind in respect of price control, let him get up and recant, and I will accept it; but until he does, we are entitled to take that maiden speech of his as representing his political credo.</p>

<p>Our belief on this side of the House of course is quite different. We believe that provided goods and services are in free supply, the ordinary natural laws of supply and demand and free competition are the best means of maintaining reasonable prices and reasonable conditions, both for the supplier, the manufacturer and the consumer, and that measures like price control only become necessary first of all when demand exceeds supply&#x2014;in other words when there is an acute shortage, a considerable shortage&#x2014;in order to protect against the kind of people that the hon. Minister referred to, people profiteering, making undue profits, and the other case is when prices are artificially fixed by combinations of people, or rings or cartels, call them what you like. Of course one has to remember that when these regulations were passed and put into force there was no Monopolies Act at all and therefore these regulations had to be drafted in a very wide form in order to cover actions of that sort which to-day we would regard as monopolistic practices. The hon. Minister has referred to the Monopolies Act and says that the process under the Monopolies Act is a very slow one and that great harm can be done because of the slowness of the machinery. I can only say that we have had some years of experience of that Monopolies Act, which appears to have worked very smoothly, and in most cases has resulted <span class="col_657-658" refersTo="page_0343"/>in it being found that there were not malpractices going on. But if the macinery is slow, I suggest that the brains of the Department should be applied to endeavouring to hasten that machinery up and to make it more effective. Broadly speaking, the Monopolies Act has worked fairly satisfactorily and has not created trouble for anybody, and has, I believe, achieved its object. But if it is too slow, I quite agree that we should try to make it more effective and that we should try to create further machinery which will enable the purposes of the Act to be more efficiently and effectively put into effect, to avoid the damage to which the hon. Minister quite correctly referred.</p>

<p>Sir, at the present moment the monopolistic side is being taken care of the Monopolies Act. The very fact that the Monopolies Act has been in existence as a threat, if you like, over the heads of people, is in itself a very great deterrent&#x2014;I think the hon. Minister will agree&#x2014;in making people think before they indulge in practices which would, if they were inquired into, lead to a conflict with the Government under the Monopolies Act. I think that is probably the most valuable part of the Act, the fact that people know that the Act is in existence and that if they do indulge in those practices, they are liable to get into very serious trouble.</p>

<p>But as to the other part, does the hon. Minister suggest that there is likely to be any shortage of goods or services in the near future? At the present moment, the stores, the shops are packed with goods, domestic factory production is increasing, import control is being further relaxed, and it would look to the ordinary uninitiated person that the last thing one could expect or look for in the foreseeable future, failing accidents, is any kind of shortage of consumer goods. Does the hon. Minister suggest&#x2014;I ask quite seriously&#x2014;that there is any serious profiteering going on? Does he suggest that the public are being fleeced, either by the manufacturer or by the trader? If so, one naturally asks why no steps are being taken under the powers which the hon. Minister already has and which he says would not be increased if this Bill is passed&#x2014;in other words the position as far as that is concerned will be exactly the same (as far as he is concerned, as far as administrative action is concerned) as it is at the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, price control is a very pleasant-sounding phrase and I think the trusting public are rather apt to attach more importance to it than it really warrants, because whilst undoubtedly it has performed a useful purpose in some instances in preventing profiteering, price control also, as we know from experience, has considerable disadvantages. In the first place, price control depends on the price controller fixing a maximum price, and our experience during the war and after the war was that the moment you fix a maximum price, it automatically becomes the minimum price, and we can quote numbers of instances of commodities in general use which in fact were being sold at prices quite considerably below the price which was finally fixed by the price controller as the maximum price, which meant that the price instead of coming down, actually went up. The other thing in price control is that if as a result of price fixation supply diminishes or the supply of goods becomes shorter (and even if it does not) you invariably find a black market developing in that particular line, which means that people pay more if there is a shortage and they cannot get what they want. I am not sure that during the war years and postwar years black marketing did not cause more trouble to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department than the actual administration of price control itself. But in all those cases it is the consumer who suffers. Prices, so far from being reduced, actually tend to go up, and with it up goes the cost of living. So that the price control system is not the unmixed blessing which some people rather tend to think it is. I think at the moment the public reaction to a Bill of this sort is rather liable to be tinged by the apparent beginning of a period of inflation. I think they rather tend to think that price control can prevent inflation. I think the hon. Minister will agree with me that that is an erroneous idea. Price control has very little to do with preventing inflation. Let us take one or two recent examples. Milk went up in price. Milk is controlled by the Dairy Control Board, and as far as I know the price controller has no jurisdiction over it, but it has gone up. Petrol went up and shipping rates went up by 10 per cent. Both these increases were announced by the Minister himself; in other words, they obviously had the approval of the price controller and he was satisfied that these increases were necessary. As a matter of fact, the Government itself has not been backward in contributing to this threatened inflation people are talking about. Take the recent rebate on shirting materials, the withdrawal of that rebate for the purpose of assisting one particular manufacturer in this country who does not pretend to be able to supply anything like even an appreciable portion of the needs of the country. We are told that that will lead to an increase of 40c or 50c on shirts in the near future. That is inflation, and that is being done deliberately by the Government. I can also quote other instances of blanket tariff measures which have been granted to people making things which cannot possibly meet more than a fraction, say 25 per cent or less, of the needs of the country, but in order to give them protection it has had the effect of putting up the price of the other 75 per cent of goods imported. Price control cannot stop that, unless the controller is going to insist on the increased cost due to the withdrawal of the rebate being borne by the manufacturer. If he does that, all I can say is that there will be far fewer shirts made, and then again you will have a black market in shirts. We have had an increase in the price of furniture. I believe that announcement <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_0344"/>was made by the Association of Furniture Manufacturers. In other words, it was an increase announced by the combined trade. Now I do not know whether it was justified or not, but essentially that is a matter, I should say, which should fall under the Monopolies Act for inquiry, and if not under that Act, then under the price controller. If there is any query about it, it can speedily be dealt with in terms of the powers the Minister now has. We were told this morning that the price of coffee and cereals is also going to be increased. That is probably being done by associations of manufacturers as well, which makes it comparatively simple for the Department to inquire into it at very short notice, to ascertain how necessary these increases are. They may be necessary; I do not know, but the fact remains that inflation is due not to profiteering or to charging excess retail prices. As long as goods are in free supply, that really cannot happen, but it is due to increased costs, which the Minister and his officials, when they look into these things and are satisfied that costs have increased, have to agree that prices have to go up. The main reason for the increased costs at the moment, of course, is the shortage of manpower, which is the creation of this Government. It is the Government which created the shortage of manpower which we are suffering from at present. Over many years that has been their deliberate policy, and now the country is reaping what the Government has sown, but in the labour market today there are stories that up to 20 per cent overtime is being worked in some factories to cope with the business. It is said that there is a black market developing for labour in the building trade on the Reef. All that puts up costs and leads to inflation. Neither the existing war measures nor this Bill will help that state of affairs, and it will not assist the public to face the question of the cost of living, if it rises, unless the Minister intends to use the very wide powers contained in this Bill, e.g. the powers granted to him in Clause 4 (1) (c) and (d), which enables him to fix the maximum charge which may be charged by any person for any specific service. Unless he is going to use that as a means of keeping down costs and freezing wages, and uses it as a back-door method of preventing any increase in wages, and in that way to keep down costs and to prevent inflation, this Bill will not take us much further in combating inflation. Up to now these emergency powers were temporary, although temporary is a very stretchable word. It has been what one might call a bi-partisan policy; it was agreed to by all sides of the House that they were in the widest sense of the term emergency powers which were not to be regarded as permanent by either side of the House. As the Minister has told us, price control in recent years has shrunk to very small dimensions. The most valuable work it has been doing has been to establish the practice which has grown up amongst certain important industrialists of consulting with the Department before they do raise prices. I think that is a very sound thing and that is the reason why in many cases the Minister recently has announced an increase, because he was consulted by the people concerned. But I have to say that we on this side need far more information from the Government than the hon. the Minister has seen fit to give us this afternoon before we would be justified in agreeing to depart from what has been a long-established policy, agreed to by both sides of this House, and which has worked very well and from which there has been no demand to depart by anyone.</p>

<p>Our position on this side is quite clear. We believe that price control is essentially for use in an emergency. It was necessary during the war, and how we had to fight that side of the House in order to get that measure through! Still, that was an emergency, and there was no alternative. Of course, since 1948 this country has really been on the brink of an emergency ever since. The country has gone through crisis after crisis, any one of which might have landed us in an emergency, and one or two of which did in fact do so, and as far as we can see, as long as this Government sits on those benches, that state of affairs will continue. I do not think the Minister or anyone else could honestly say that there is not the slightest probability of a state of emergency arising in the near future, as long as this Government is in power, whereby these powers might not have to be exercised at short notice. For that reason, and in the interests of the country, and not in the interests of the Government, we have been willing and are still willing to renew the powers which the Minister now has&#x2014;the powers which the Minister seeks to incorporate in this Bill will not increase his powers&#x2014;from time to time when he comes to Parliament and asks for them to be renewed.</p>

<p>I was the Minister who repealed the War Measures Act, and at that time we said that the existing Emergency Regulations would continue for the present but that we would continue to dismantle them as quickly as we could, and that for such measures as eventually proved to be necessary permanently it might be necessary to have legislation. But that is a very different thing, and we do not believe that a case has been made out for changing the basic policy of this country by making price control a permanent feature of the Statute Book. We believe that price control is there for an emergency and we are quite willing to go on <span class="col_661-662" refersTo="page_0345"/>renewing these powers for the Minister periodically when he asks us to do so. But we maintain that he has made out no case whatever this afternoon for this legislation, and moreover there has been no consultation with interested parties over what is really not a little Bill but a revolutionary Bill. It is a complete change in Government policy. It is a revolutionary piece of legislation and the consumers, the trade unions and commerce and industry have none of them seen this Bill, let alone been consulted. The hon. the Prime Minister has a very important Economic Advisory Council. Has this Bill been submitted to them for their views and their advice? If not, what is the use of that Council? Surely the Minister will agree that people of all shades of opinion and all the various interests are entitled to be heard on a matter like this. It may even be that the Government itself has much better reasons than have been disclosed this afternoon for introducing this legislation, and we are entitled to have those reasons and to have an opportunity to examine them. I therefore want to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the order for the second reading of the Price Control Bill be discharged and that the subject of the Bill be referred to a select committee for inquiry and report, the committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers, and to have leave to bring up an amended Bill&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that the hon. member for Constantia wants to fight but that he does not know what to fight about. We are dealing here with something which exists in practice. He calls this a revolutionary Bill but only two seconds prior to that he said this Bill gave the Minister no further powers than he already had at the moment. These war measures which create the price control machinery have been in existence for nearly 20 years. The Minister has the right to put those measures in operation at any time and the hon. member admits that the Bill does not give the Minister any greater powers than those war regulations give him, yet he calls it a revolutionary Bill. In that case this revolution must have been going on for 20 years, yet nobody has died and nobody will die during the next 20 years because of it. But the hon. member is pining for those war years; his whole heart is yearning for them. I may tell him that those years will never come back. They are gone forever. The hon. member for Constantia himself could not resist the temptation of making a little stupid political remark. He says the Minister is introducing this legislation because he is a National Socialist. The only thing that surprised me was that the hon. member did not say that it was the Broederbond who was behind this Bill! As far as I know the Minister is a member of the Broederbond. What nonsense! The hon. member says that since this Government has been in power we have been through one crisis after the other, but after every crisis they have conjured up we have been more prosperous. First we had the crisis of the High Court of Parliament, then we had the crisis of the Torch Commando, then the crisis of the Commonwealth, then that of the Republic. We go from one crisis to the other yet we are so fat that our eyes are popping out further from our heads than ever before, and economically we are bursting at the seams.</p>

<p>What is this Bill, Sir? All are agreed that we do not want the war measures as a permanent part of our legislation in this country; we are living in peace. Never before have we had greater peace than to-day. Obviously with the passage of time, if you regard the war regulations as essential for the administration of the country, it is better to convert them into legislation. That is the normal thing to do and that is all the Minister is doing. On the evidence of the hon. member for Constantia he is not taking any further powers than those he has under the war regulations. If this legislation constitutes such a great danger why have the war regulations not constituted an equally great danger over the past 20 years and why have the hon. member for Constantia and his party not suggested the abolition of those regulations, and that those great powers should be taken away from the Minister? But they did not do that because they did not regard them as dangerous. It is ridiculous to make a bogy out of this legislation. You can only expect that from people who want to quarrel and who do not know what to quarrel about. This legislation only gives the Minister a weapon that he can use at any time for the protection of the consumer. The hon. member referred to the increase in prices that has taken place recently, increases which the Minister had approved, as in the case of petrol and shipping charges. But the mere fact that we are living at a time in which there are price increases and in which there is a tendency for people to increase their prices, makes this a suitable time to entrench those powers in the law so that when the Minister thinks it necessary to use those powers he will be in a position to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia now asks the Minister to apply the anti-monopolistic legislation in those cases where cartels are formed and where there are unreasonable price increases. Surely the hon. member knows that if ever there was a laborious Act on our Statute Book it is that anti-monopolies Act.</p>

<p>Amend it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>You cannot amend it because all the machinery you can possibly <span class="col_663-664" refersTo="page_0346"/>create to combat monopolies is completely different from the machinery to combat unreasonable price increases. There have been a few inquiries under this anti-monopolistic Act and I do not know of one that took less than a year. I think most of them lasted longer than a year. We had the one into the C.N.S. That lasted two to three years. That is why I say it is a laborious Act, because it is only after the most thorough investigation that you can declare such an organization to be a monopolistic organization and then you have to give it an opportunity of putting matters right within a certain period. It is absolutely impossible to put that legislation in operation against a number of grocers who meet over the week-end and decide to increase the price of flour by 10 per cent from Monday. You cannot let the consumer wait for a year or two while you investigate the matter. The Minister must have the power to act immediately. He must have the power to instruct the price controller to institute an investigation immediately to find out whether there is justification for such a price increase.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia makes the ridiculous statement that the fixing of a maximum price always leads to a minimum price; that the maximum price which the controller lays down automatically becomes the minimum price. But that is only the position during a time of scarcity. [Interjections.] The anti-monopolistic legislation in America is much more effective than ours. You have an increasing tendency to form cartels in this country, just as you have in America; the coming together of certain interests with the object of increasing prices; and the small man is increasingly being ousted, something which is a big factor in free trade in South Africa. One of their members who is a sensible member in this respect has a motion on the Order Paper for the protection of the small trader. Why did he put that on the Order Paper? Is a position not developing in which the small man is being ousted more and more? There is nothing more dangerous in your entire economy than to allow those people the freedom to form rings and cartels in order to exploit the small trader and the consumer. Nor is price fixation something foreign to the free world. It is not foreign to America or to England or to any other free economy. Price fixation is a permanent part of the British economy and legislation and also in the American legislation and all those Governments have the power to put a stop to price increases. Surely the hon. member for Constantia knows that the days of completely free trade with no interference at all on the part of the Government, the days of a free economy where the Government leaves everything to the so-called law of supply and demand, are something of the past. Surely he knows how this old law that supply and demand should regulate everything has been abused and that it has led to the exploitation of the poor man and the small trader. Every country in the world has created some kind of machinery to combat that tendency. The hon. member for Constantia is quite right when he says that there is price control in times of war and scarcity. The hon. member says we are living in another period, but there is nothing to ensure that we will not experience a scarcity in the one or other section of our economy. In these days in which we are living with boycotts and threatened boycotts we do not know whether there will be enough coffee in future. Ghana may decide not to export cocoa to this country. A thing like that happens within 14 days and the price suddenly rockets sky-high. The hon. member now wants the Minister to combat that sort of thing in terms of the anti-monopolistic Act. Surely that is totally unrealistic. You must be in the position, as we were during the war, to create such machinery within a week. That machinery exists to-day; the whole question to-day is simply whether you must entrench that in permanent legislation. The hon. member says you cannot combat inflation by means of price control. I agree with that but when you have inflation you have a set of circumstances in which the unscrupulous person, under the cloak of rising costs and inflation, pushes up prices with one object only and that is of exploiting the consumer and making a quick profit. I agree that price control will not prevent inflation but it is a weapon which the Minister must have at such a time in order to control the position and to prevent any abuse.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know why hon. members are opposing this legislation. The war regulations exist to-day and all the Minister is doing is to make them a permanent part of the law of the land, as the position is in England and in America. However, I want to conclude by dealing with the last statements made by the hon. member for Constantia, namely, that you get inflation as a result of a shortage of manpower. He blames this Government for the shortage of manpower. It is quite clear why there is this complaint about the shortage of manpower in South Africa. A few days ago Mr. Rissik, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, said that this question of a shortage of manpower was grossly exaggerated and that there were a hundred-and-one ways in which we could make better use of our manpower. But it is high time that we realized what the object was of these continual attacks, this incessant complaining about the so-called manpower shortage. This incessant complaining comes mainly from the Chambers of Commerce, mainly from the Transvaal Chamber of Commerce and they are supported by the S.A. Chamber of Industries. The whole attempt to make us believe that this manpower shortage is causing such a serious bottle-neck, that it is ham-stringing our economy to such an extent, is nothing else than an attempt on the part of big industrialists to get us to abandon our policy of job reservation. That is what it is and nothing else. There is not such a serious shortage of manpower. There is a shortage of manpower throughout the world.</p>

<p><span class="col_665-666" refersTo="page_0347"/>It is true that we have a shortage of manpower in this country but what we have in addition, which is much worse, is the inability on the part of trade and industry to make proper use of the manpower at their disposal and now they want to follow the path of &#x201C;least resistance&#x201D;, namely, to abolish job reservation and to allow the Bantu to enter all the various spheres of work. In that case the whole problem of the shortage of manpower will be solved! Mr. Speaker, this is a very simple piece of legislation. The Minister has these powers to-day in terms of the war regulations. The war is 20 years behind us and I think any reasonable person will be of the opinion that the Minister should retain the power to apply them when he deems it necessary. Let us say good-bye to the war regulations and entrench those powers in legislation. The hon. member for Constantia has a remedy if the Minister acts unreasonably. The Vote of the Minister is discussed annually in this House. He is always in a position, therefore, to expose any unreasonable action on the part of the Minister and to haul the Minister over the coals if he has acted unreasonably under this legislation. I think the position is very clear and that it is not worthwhile wasting much time on it. I think this House will gladly give the Minister these powers.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Listening to the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) I wondered whether he was going to take the line that this measure introduced by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs was a measure to control inflation. He went on to say that he knew that this particular measure cannot control inflation. I think he is correct there. Then he went back again and started talking about the wholesalers as against the small man and he came back to the inflation theme again. We do say that this is a revolutionary measure. After all, import control has been a war measure over the last 20 years, and now this Government is making it permanent by placing it on the Statute Book. We do say too that it may be necessary for us to agree to the continuation of this Bill as a measure because, as the hon. member for Constantia has said, we have passed through difficult periods recently in this country of ours and we will possibly continue to have crises from time to time until, as the hon. member said, there is a change of Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging says that it is a slow business to use the monopolistic measures that we have on our Statute Book to control monopolies. I agree with him, but I can tell him that a price control investigation takes about twice as long, and I can tell him that recently price control was lifted on milk in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban simply because the Milk Control Board was not able to keep pace with the investigation of prices in these various areas and had no alternative but to lift control in these areas. That only goes to show how slowly that machinery functions; it is about twice as slow as the machinery under the anti-monopoly measures. The Minister has the power and it is up to him to exercise the necessary control. The industrialist, the man in the street, has become punch-drunk as far as legislative measures passed by this Parliament are concerned, and when new legislation is put forward he simply accepts it under protest or possibly even without protesting. This particular Bill, as the hon. member for Constantia has correctly said, has not been seen by the representatives of industry or labour. There has been no consultation at all as to whether this measure should become permanent. We on this side do not know why it is being introduced. It was introduced by this side of the House as a war measure during the war. At that time it was essential because goods were in short supply; there was a black market in goods and it was necessary to stamp that out. But at the present moment we cannot see the necessity. If goods are in short supply the Minister has the necessary powers in his hands. We have a free supply of goods at the present moment, but if there is a shortage of a commodity which is subject to import control, it is up to the Minister to take the necessary steps; he can lift import control on that item. There are certain commodities which we do not get to-day because of boycotts, but I am fairly certain that indirectly those commodities do find their way into this country of ours, so there is no necessity for any item to be in short supply in this country. The matter rests in the hands of the Minister; he can make every commodity available in this country and he can make them available at competitive prices. As I have said, if any commodity is in short supply he can lift import control.</p>

<p>Sir, the introduction of a Bill of this kind in this House does have its effect on industry outside. The industrialist is not a philanthropist; he is there to make a living, but if he is going to be faced with a measure such as this on the Statute Book he will start to wonder whether the commodities which he produces in his factory are going to be subjected to price control. He tries to produce his articles as economically as possible, but he does not know whether overnight the Minister is going to gazette a fixed control price in respect of his goods.</p>

<p>Yes, I know, but it is now proposed to make this a permanent measure. Are we to understand from the Minister that we are going to live in a permanent state of crisis in this country? Is that why this particular measure is being introduced?</p>

<p><span class="col_667-668" refersTo="page_0348"/>Then there is another aspect. These price control regulations do not only control the prices of commodities in the various shops. Under this measure the price of labour and services can be controlled. The Minister can fix the price of labour or the resale of labour in any form. He can, for instance, control medical fees; he can control attorneys&#x2019; fees; he can control the price of any service that is rendered in this country. He can control any price and he can do so overnight. It may take up to two years to investigate whether the price which was fixed is correct or not. I know because I have had experience of the way in which the price control regulations operate. This measure therefore affects not only the industrialist; it also affects the man in the street. In other words, as a result of price control on his labour, which might very well come, he can have his wages fixed. Sir, we have just had a debate in this House on a motion of no-confidence. The introduction of a Bill such as this at this stage is tantamount to a vote of no-confidence in the Government. It is an admission that this Government has no confidence in the future of this country, a country in which there is a free supply of goods, a country which enjoys a boom in trade and which is on the way up. In introducing this Bill the Government is moving a vote of no-confidence in itself. Look what happened in Germany after the last world war; look at the measure of prosperity achieved by Germany as the result of competition. To-day Germany is one of the wealthiest countries in the world. But this Government lacks the confidence to allow free competition.</p>

<p>This Government have not the confidence in themselves and that is why they find it necessary to introduce this particular Bill. This Government has been so tied up with racialistic policies that it has lost control over labour. The productivity of the individual has gone down because the Government has lost control over it. Sir, if the Government would only investigate and fully use the labour resources of this country it would not be necessary to introduce measures such as price control. The Minister tells us that this measure is necessary, but I would like to tell him finally that this particular Government and this country of ours is suffering in another sphere as the result of price control. We have been trying over the years to make out a case for the removal of the price control over gold or an adjustment in the price of gold. The Minister knows himself therefore what it is to be subject to price control. You can imagine what happens to the industrialist or to the worker when he is subject to the same control which the Minister is trying to impose on us at the present moment. Sir, in conclusion I say that this Bill is nothing but a vote, of no-confidence in this Government. They have no confidence in the future of this country, otherwise they would not bring a measure such as this before the House.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down said that this Government had no confidence in the future and that was why it was introducing legislation of this nature. It is precisely because this Government has confidence in the future and it is precisely because this Government want to do something for the future of this country and its people that we have this measure before us to-day. If this measure is so harmful, it will be of great advantage to the Opposition because they will then be able to attack the Government at the next election for having placed this measure on the Statute Book. Price control was instituted during the war years. At that stage we were fighting a hot war. What is the difference as far as the public is concerned whether it is a hot war or a cold war when the idea is to protect the public? We are fighting a cold war at the moment and as a result of that cold war in the world to-day there are certain circumstances which have their effect on South Africa. If they affect us here, why should the Government and why cannot the Government institute price control? The price control that we are instituting to-day is to a certain extent the price that South Africa has to pay because of the policy of integration that the world is trying to force upon us. We have to protect our country against that sort of thing. Salary increases are forced upon us by this same Opposition and their hangers-on and the people who co-operate with them. Mr. Speaker, an increase in salary which is not at the same time accompanied by an increase in productivity raises the price structure unnecessarily. There are numbers of reasons why prices have risen. Money is plentiful in the country to-day and this position has been artificially created. There are numbers of reasons for it. One reason is the P.A.Y.E. system of income-tax collection that we have put into operation as a result of which the public of South Africa have more money to spend. The Government has taken every possible step to stimulate our economy and to encourage it. One of the complaints made by the Opposition in the past was that this Government was not doing enough to promote our economy and now that the Government is doing just that they do not want this same Government to take steps to control prices so that the poor section of our people will not be exploited. It is quite obvious that price control is not applied in order to harm one section of the people. If the Opposition feel that the public may be harmed by the application of this measure, then I would like them to tell me how the public can be harmed. The poor man and the lower paid person who is not so well <span class="col_669-670" refersTo="page_0349"/>off will be protected by this measure because by means of this measure the Government will ensure that prices will not rise sky high. The hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) said that the Government should lift import control and that if this was done there would be a free flow of goods to South Africa. Will we be able to import fresh milk if the Government lifts import control? I can also mention numbers of other goods. The standard of living of the public must be protected and it is very necessary therefore to apply price control. If price control is brought in, the private entrepreneur, the industrialist, will also be protected because the prices of material will not rise disproportionately either. The hon. member for Salt River also says that labour and service costs can also be controlled under this measure. Why should we only apply price control to commodities and not to services and labour? One buys an article and pays a certain price for it but the labour costs make up the largest portion of that price. Why is it suddenly such a great crime for this Government to want to introduce price control over services rendered? If the person selling a certain article cannot ask more than a certain amount for it, why then should a person be able to ask an unfair price for services rendered? I want to know from the Opposition whether they agree that a person should be able to ask any price at all for his labour&#x2014;an unrealistic price that cannot be paid by the poor man? Are they in favour of it? The Government will now place this measure on the Statute Book permanently and it will also serve as a timely warning to trade and industry to co-operate in order to ensure that price control is not applied to them at a later stage. If they cooperate in time and ensure that their prices are not raised unnecessarily, price control will not affect them.</p>

<block name="quote">I just want to conclude by saying that if the Opposition can mention a few examples to us of factories in South Africa that will be detrimentally affected by this measure, or a few examples of cases in which this measure will not be to the advantage of the country, then we will be able to consider referring this measure to a select committee. But it is quite clear to me, as the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) also said, that the Opposition are fighting but they do not know why they are fighting. They cannot give us any information that might be submitted to a select committee of this nature and which the Department does not already have at its disposal. If it is true that there is certain information that such a select committee can make available to us, then the Opposition must please tell us what that information is so that this House can consider the matter and either accept or reject their motion.</block>

<p>I was interested in listening to the speech of the hon. member for Pretoria (Sunnyside) (Mr. van Zyl), because he said some very interesting things. First of all he confirmed what was said by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) that we had moved from one crisis to another since this Government has been in power, because the hon. member says that we are in a cold war. Well, a cold war and a crisis are very much the same thing. But then he says that salaries should not be increased unless there is increased production. Sir, that is a very wide statement to make. Is the hon. member suggesting that last year the hon. the Minister of Transport should not have put up the salaries of railwaymen? Is he suggesting that there should be no increase in the salaries of teachers unless their already overcrowded classes of 40 or 50 are increased to 60, 70 or 80? Or is he suggesting that Post Office officials should not have an increase in salary unless the poor postman carries 20 lbs. of postal matter instead of 10 lb.? Is that what the hon. member means?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Then he goes on to tell us that we should control prices in order to control the economy. He tells us that we on this side of the House&#x2014;and it is true&#x2014;have been asking the Government for years to take such steps as would make our economy more buoyant, such steps as would bring the increase in our production more in line with the increased production in other countries of the world. He now tells us that we have gone too far and that we should bring in price control so that we can in effect stop increased production. Because price control can stop it. If you fix the price of a commodity you can very easily stop any increased production of the commodity, and it may have very serious effects on the entire wheels of your economy.</p>

<p>But, Sir, to get back to the Bill. The hon. the Minister in introducing this Bill really told us very little. I think the reason for that is that there is a war measure in existence and that there is very little change, except for some deletions, in this particular Bill. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) went on to tell us that this measure had been on the Statute Book for 20 years and he could not understand what we were complaining about. But, Sir, there are some very basic differences between the circumstances at the time of the last world war and the circumstances to-day. When the war measures were originally put on the Statute Book we were then in a state of real crisis. There was a shortage of goods because there was no shipping; there was a shortage of goods because production had been handed over to the national war effort; there was a shortage of goods because manpower was being diverted to that war effort. The circumstances at that time were completely different to the circumstances of to-day. There was hoarding, there was black marketing, there were shortages and there were all the problems which go with a war when a country is throwing its entire weight behind a war effort. Secondly, the <span class="col_671-672" refersTo="page_0350"/>measure was a temporary one. The measure was predicated on the basis that as soon as the war was over, and as soon as the difficult post-war period was over, the measure would be removed from the Statute Book. But perhaps the most important factor was that the measure was brought in without consultation with the people who were vitally concerned. When you have a war on your hands you have not got time for select committees or inquiries; you have not got time for anything more than a discussion here or there with a particular body which may be regarded as speaking for a particular group of persons. Bur, Sir, there is no hurry to-day. The hon. the Minister is now asking us to make this a permanent measure. I honestly do not know what the hon. member for Vereeniging is getting so excited about. [Interjections.] Well, I am perhaps inclined to equate the normal way in which the hon. member addresses the House with excitement. Maybe I am wrong in which case I apologize. We are not asking the Minister to hand over any powers or to do away with any powers which he has today. The hon. member for Constantia has made that quite clear. The hon. member has said, &#x201C;Let the position remain as it is and we will vote for the extension of the war measure from time to time, or alternatively send the Bill to a select committee&#x201D;. Sir, what we are asking for are three very simple things. First of all we ask for consultation. We believe that when any measure which affects large sections of the community is put on the Statute Book they should be given an opportunity of airing their views. I was in Johannesburg this week-end and I found that the Federated Chamber of Industry had not had the Bill; the trade unions had not had the Bill, and it was quite impossible to get from those organizations any idea as to how they felt about this Bill because they had not had the Bill and could not study it. Firstly therefore we want consultation. Secondly we want an investigation. It is true that this measure has been on the Statute Book for 20 years, but I am not at all satisfied, and I am sure most members of the House are not satisfied, that the best method of dealing with the problem which the hon. the Minister envisages, is price control, because some very strange things can happen when you have price control. The hon. member for Vereeniging said that the maximum price under price control became the minimum price only in times of scarcity. That unfortunately is not true. There are many groupings in industry to-day where either prices are fixed or there is an agreement regarding prices. I know from personal experience that where the price of a commodity is fixed and you have any reaction to that price, all you have to say is, &#x201C;but that is the control price&#x201D; and your problems are over. In the case of the particular commodity with which I had a little to do for quite a long while, we found that when we had price control we got a certain price for the commodity, but the moment price control was removed, the price dropped by nearly 25 per cent because the industry was unable to say to people, &#x201C;that is the fixed price&#x201D;, without there being any argument. For two, three or four years after the war the price of that particular commodity was kept high purely because of price control.</p>

<p>But, Sir, there are other factors. We have heard something about the Monopolistic Act this afternoon. I want to ask the hon. the Minister this question: He has lately agreed to an increase in the price of petrol. I understand that petrol is one of his quasi-controlled commodities; it is not controlled in terms of the war measure but it is controlled by arrangement with the Minister and his Department for the common good of the country and with the threat perhaps of the application of the war measures which are still in existence. I want to ask the Minister this; What would the price of petrol be (a) if the Monopolistic Act had been applied to petrol so that there could not be one common price and (b) if there was no price control? What does he think the price of petrol would be? I think it would be very considerably less than the price of petrol to-day. The other fact about price control is this, that every action of the Government where price control has been imposed, automatically increases the price of that commodity. For example when the hon. the Minister of Transport saw fit to put up the price of conveying goods by 10 per cent, where there was not price control a large amount of that increase was absorbed by the different sectors of industry. In some cases, it is true, prices went up to the full degree, in other cases to a lesser degree but in some cases not at all. But when the price of a commodity is fixed, then immediately there is any action by the Government either by way of import duties or by way of an increase in railage rates, or any other action which increases the price of a commodity, the price of that commodity goes up immediately and the increase is passed on to the consumer.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think that the hon. the Minister can tell us in all honesty that the question of price control in South Africa has ever really been properly investigated; that the brains of the country have been brought to bear on this vexed problem. I do not think he can tell us that this House is in a position to say at this moment that there should or should not be price control, and I think he will agree that if this thing is to be properly ventilated and legislation is to be put on the Statute Book which is in the best interests of everybody in the country, then the correct and the proper thing to do is to send the Bill to a select committee where we can look at it and see what is necessary. I do not want to discuss the details of the Bill now; we will discuss them in Committee. There are many aspects that are obnoxious. Let us have the best legislation we can get. There is no hurry, Sir. We have legislation on the Statute Book that can take care of any emergency that <span class="col_673-674" refersTo="page_0351"/>might arise; it only expires in 1965. Let us extend it if necessary, but if the hon. the Minister wants to put new legislation on the Statute Book, let us have a proper inquiry and let us do a real job of work instead of these quick, hurried pieces of legislation that are introduced into this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear to me that hon. members opposite have no case. They have really not advanced any sound argument as to why they are opposing this legislation. The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) also said that they were not opposed to it in principle but that it should first be referred to a select committee. The arguments which have been advanced here are really all arguments which do not merit a serious reply. No single argument has been advanced as to why it is necessary for this legislation to be referred to a select committee.</p>

<p>In the first instance the hon. member who has just sat down has said that he is opposed to the legislation as it stands and that it should be referred to a select committee so that there can be consultation. When we consider what the hon. the Minister is asking for here, we ask ourselves why there should be consultation and who will benefit as a result of that consultation. The hon. the Minister has told us that we have reached a stage where it is necessary in the public interest to fix the prices of certain commodities. That is why he asks that what has already been in existence now for 20 years should be translated into permanent legislation. Who has to be consulted? There is no one who need be afraid of this legislation, except perhaps the individual who wants to misuse the present situation to make more money than he is entitled to make. That is the only person who can actually have any objection to this measure and whose opinion ought to be heard. But the general public can only benefit by a law which seeks to protect them against exorbitant and disproportionately high prices. The argument of consultation therefore falls away. The Opposition really have no argument in this regard. The other point that the hon. member raised was that the matter should be investigated. Mr. Speaker, what should be investigated? The Department has now had 20 years&#x2019; experience of the situation as has developed since the first emergency regulations&#x2014;the original regulations&#x2014;were promulgated. There have been two occasions over the past 20 years on which legislation of this nature has been necessary. The first was when there was a war on and the war created a situation in which there was a great shortage of consumer goods. The production capacity of the country was concentrated upon the manufacture of war material. It was not necessary to import the necessary consumer goods at that time either. And hon. members of that party then had to take action by way of legislation to deal with particular circumstances. The circumstances of the time made it necessary for them to take action where in the normal course of events they would not have interfered. This is the first occasion since then that circumstances have again arisen which have made it necessary for the State to act in this way. In this case the position is reversed. The position is that South Africa is now experiencing a period of very great prosperity and in this time of prosperity it is possible that shortages of commodities may occur, not because factories are not producing but because a great deal of money is in circulation. Because a great deal of money is in circulation we find either that there is a demand for articles for which in the normal course of events no demand would exist or that for some reason or other we cannot import certain articles. For these reasons a situation has again arisen in which somebody has to be protected and that somebody is the general public. They must be protected against individuals. It is not everyone who demands exorbitant prices. The public must be protected against persons who misuse present-day circumstances to demand disproportionately high prices for articles of which there is a temporary shortage. The hon. member who spoke earlier raised the argument of inflation. It is not so much a question of inflation, Sir. The fact remains that production capacity in South Africa is at its maximum. In times of maximum production it does happen that certain articles or commodities are in short supply and that temporary shortages arise. There may be a temporary shortage of a certain article for six months or a year for the simple reason that there is no immediate production capacity to produce that article although there is no doubt that that article will still be produced. Because the hon. the Minister now wants to take action in order to prevent exploitation and the charging of exorbitant prices during these periods of temporary shortage, he is asking for a very normal thing&#x2014;the machinery to enable him to combat this sort of thing. That is all he is asking. When hon. members opposite now ask that the legislation be referred to a select committee to enable the committee to inquire into this obvious attitude of the Government, they have no case. As the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) has said, every country in the world has legislation of this nature for combating prices that are unduly high. I really feel that hon. members opposite are using a forced argument in order to keep the debate going. They have really not advanced a single argument to-day to prove in the first instance that it is necessary to argue against this legislation and in the second instance why the legislation should be referred to a select committee.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has suggested that we on this side of the House have made out no case for referring this Bill to a select committee. He has asked certain questions arising from the speech made by the hon. member who spoke before him. First of all he asks: Who should be consulted? The whole of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument was based on an assumption that we on this side of the House <span class="col_675-676" refersTo="page_0352"/>had asked that price control should be done away with altogether. That was not our standpoint. I suggest that it is time, high time, that hon. members opposite met the case which we have made, which is not that price control should be done away with. What our case has been is that this legislation should not be introduced as part of the permanent legislation of this country without making out a case to show that that is necessary, bearing in mind the fact that both this side of the House and that side have up till to-day taken the stand that price control should remain as a temporary measure and should not become permanent legislation in this country.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that it has been Government policy up till the present that price control should not be a permanent measure surely this change in Government policy makes it necessary for a select committee to consider whether or not circumstances have arisen which now make it necessary for something which up to now has been regarded as temporary should become permanent legislation. When the hon. member who has just sat down asks who should be consulted my answer to him is: All interested parties. To say that is not necessary because the war measure has existed for the last 20 years is no argument at all because it has existed as temporary legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Who wishes to be consulted?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Surely the answer to that is obvious: The people who are affected by the legislation. None of them have had an opportunity of having their say because this Bill has been introduced at such short notice. The hon. member also asks what must be investigated? There again his argument is that the War Measure has existed for the last 20 years so what necessity is there to investigate anything in regard to it. My reply to that is the same as my reply to his previous argument. The measure has up to now existed purely as part of the temporary legislation in this country. The whole approach of the Government has been that this is temporary and should never be regarded as permanent legislation. Surely, Sir, in those circumstances there is every reason for investigating a Bill of this sort before it becomes permanent legislation, particularly in view of the very strong case made out by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) who pointed out the very real disadvantages there were with price control legislation, disadvantages which the hon. the Minister must admit exist and are real. That being the case, Sir, it seems unnecessary to labour the need for a select committee. But in view of the fact that hon. members opposite will insist on suggesting that our case is based on abolishing price control it has become necessary for me to deal with it at some length.</p>

<p>There is in my view a further reason why this should be referred to a select committee and that is the fact that in terms of this Bill it is not only the price of commodities or the price of goods that is subject to price control, but also the charges that can be made for services rendered. In other words, this Bill affects services of people, including professional people. There may be a good reason for controlling by means of a measure of this sort, services of professional people, the wages earned by artisans and so forth, but before a Bill of this sort is introduced or accepted as permanent legislation, surely it ought to be investigated by a select committee to ensure that it is desirable to have a power of this sort to control the cost of services.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging made the point that if we had any complaint against the Minister arising out of the administration of this legislation, we could always raise it during the Budget debate. But, Sir, the hon. member loses sight of the fact that once this Bill becomes part of the Statute law, we cannot attack the principle; we cannot argue that that measure is no longer necessary and should be abolished. Under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, we can only deal with his administration of that measure, whereas under the present position, if it remains as a war measure, it has to be passed by this House from time to time and when the measure is submitted to this House to be passed we have the opportunity of showing that the Minister no longer requires this power and that it should not be renewed at all.</p>

<p>Many of the arguments advanced by hon. members on the Government benches have been based on their contention that we are asking for price control to be done away with altogether. The hon. member for Vereeniging and the hon. member for Soutpansberg made out a strong case why price control was necessary and why a measure to control prices was necessary. That is irrelevant for the purposes of this debate because we have not suggested that the War Measure which exists at present should be done away with. Our case has been that the Minister has the powers which he now seeks in this Bill; he has had them for the past 20 years. Therefore he is not taking any new powers in this Bill; he himself admitted it. So before coming to this House to ask that this Bill should be passed, the least we can expect of the hon. the Minister is to make out a case, not why price control is necessary, but why the War Measure which has existed for the last 20 years should now be made permanent legislation. This he has not done and no member on that side of the House has done that either. Nor have we had any answer to the question put by the hon. member for Constantia when he asked why the Bill was introduced in such a hurry. We have been told that the War Measure has existed for so many years and that the Government is not doing anything new. But as I have pointed out, the Government is in fact making something permanent which up to now has been regarded, on both sides of the House, as merely a temporary measure. The <span class="col_677-678" refersTo="page_0353"/>Government has, in fact, changed its long-existing policy. It often does that, of course, but at least it might justify its change occasionally.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging dealt at some length with the Monopolies Act and he pointed out that under that Act it was necessary to move slowly, that it took time to investigate any complaints and that in the meantime prices might go up to the detriment of the consumers. I would understand that argument if we on this side of the House were asking for price control to be done away with. But how that argument can help him when the War Measure exists and will continue to exist, unless this Bill is introduced to do away with it, I cannot understand.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to reiterate what we on this side of the House contend, that none of the speakers on the Government side has up to now chosen to deal with our arguments. As the hon. member for Constantia has said we believe that provided that goods and services are in free supply, the law of supply and demand should operate. But at the same time we concede that in the circumstances which have existed under the present Government and which apparently will continue to exist, price control may be necessary. That is why we do not ask for the abolition of the War Measure. But, Sir, what we do say is that before this Government can ask this House to change legislation which they themselves have up to now regarded as temporary into permanency, we ought to have from them some explanation. Since we have not had any explanation, the least we can expect is a select committee, particularly in the interests of those people who have not had the time or the opportunity of studying the Bill and making their representations on it&#x2014;I am now referring to people outside this House. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, we are asking that this Bill be referred to a select committee.</p>

For 19 years the Opposition have come to this House and have approved of this legislation each year. They have given it their blessing each year but this year, in the 20th year, they dig in their heels and refuse to cooperate. They make me think of the old song that we always used to sing when we were young: &#x201C;Sewe jaar lank na haar gevry, die agste jaar laat staan sy my.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Hon. members of the Opposition, including the last speaker, raised the question of a free economy in South Africa. I do not think that we on this side of the House believe for a moment that this measure will detract to any extent from the freedom of our economy in South Africa&#x2014;the fact that we have a completely free economy based on the principle of private enterprise and the profit motive in this country. They also suggested that by means of this legislation we were trying to interfere with the law of supply and demand. This measure will certainly not interfere more with the law of supply and demand than it has already been interfered with under our present economic system. We on this side of the House have no wish to harm the law of supply and demand by means of this Bill.</p>

<p>I want to point out that in South Africa we pass legislation to cope with many eventualities. We prepare ourselves to meet many things in this country. The State is introducing a Bill here giving it the power to be prepared for certain eventualities. I cannot understand what the real objection of the Opposition is to giving this right to the hon. the Minister and his Department. The important point made by the Opposition is that there should be consultation. But I wonder whether they are correct in that respect. After all, this remains an enabling measure and in the application of this legislation we will in fact reach the consultative stage about which the Opposition have so much to say; we will in fact have true co-operation with commerce.</p>

<p>Both sides of the House admit that we need something like this Bill. For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I think that the Opposition should assist us in this matter; that the Opposition should help us to give this power to the Department so that when South Africa needs it, we will be able to use it. It does not interfere with free enterprise in South Africa. Nor do we want to interfere with the law of supply and demand in this country as far as it is permitted to operate; all we ask is that this legislation should be placed on the Statute Book so that the State will be prepared and ready for all eventualities in this sphere of our life.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) is another hon. member on the Government benches who has misunderstood us and I am beginning to think that they are doing it deliberately. We have no objection to the Minister having these powers as he has at present on the basis on which they are in his hands at present. To try to impress upon hon. members opposite the real history of these war measures, I should like to give them the following information, Sir. In 1950, just after this Government came into power, they appointed a Select Committee to go into the matter of whether the war measures should remain in force. When they came into power they wanted to do away with those war measures but they decided to appoint a Select Committee. Following upon that Select Committee the regulations did remain in force. A Select Committee decided that, just as we are asking now for a Select Committee to investigate. In 1956 the War Measures Continuation Bill was introduced which extended the regulations <span class="col_679-680" refersTo="page_0354"/>for three years, i.e. to 1959. In 1959 the war measures were again extended and the Minister in dealing with the Bill used this phrase: &#x201C;It was unnecessary and undesirable to embody them in permanent legislation.&#x201D; We approved the extension of three years. Only in 1959 it was undesirable to entrench them. In 1962 the Minister, in dealing with the extension of powers in regard to currency control, said: &#x201C;Events had shown, however, that enabling authority for certain control measures, especially those relating to import and export control and monetary control, price control should be permanently at the disposal of the Department concerned and steps are being taken by the Department to prepare a Bill.&#x201D; We accepted what the Minister said and the powers extended for three years.</p>

<p>Then in 1963 he introduced the Bill dealing with currency control and other matters. We battled with him then to retain the powers on a temporary basis. We asked for two years and alternatively we asked that he should not use the extensive powers that he had unless it was for the purpose of forestalling an imminent threat to the country&#x2019;s declining monetary reserves.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia when he spoke asked for a Select Committee to investigate this matter. He also asked the Minister to tell us what were the reasons why these control measures should become a permanent part of our legislation. This Bill is so wide, if it goes through as it stands at the moment, that there is no shadow of doubt that every phrase of human activity will be watched&#x2014;doctors&#x2019;, dentists&#x2019;, everybody&#x2019;s fees are controlled under this Bill. In addition there is another aspect in regard to which I wonder whether the Minister has given it any consideration. Has it been brought to the Minister&#x2019;s notice that the World Bank issued a document recently which described fixed selling prices by way of permanent legislation as an instrument of discriminatory Government action falling under the heading of &#x201C;Political Risk&#x201D; in the field of foreign investment? From that I would say that the World Bank does not regard this as legislation that should be used except in exceptional and extraordinary circumstances. I hope that if the hon. the Minister refuses to accept our amendment then, at least, he will have the courtesy to tell us of the events which occurred and which made him change his mind since 1959 when he regarded it as being unnecessary and undesirable to embody these war measures in permanent legislation. He should tell us what events occurred to make him change his mind as is shown by this terrible Bill which we have before us now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>This legislation has already been discussed in fairly great detail. I listened attentively to the objections of hon. members opposite and their reasons why they could not support this legislation. For example, the hon. member who has just sat down mentioned the fact that in 1959 a Select Committee stated that at that stage it was not necessary or desirable to embody the war measures in a permanent law. But in my opinion the necessity to have this legislation placed on the Statute Book does exist at the present time. My most important reason for saying this is that during the past 20 years, these measures&#x2014;temporary measures&#x2014;have been used to prevent the public from being exploited, particularly in a country like South Africa, a country of fluctuating climatic conditions, where production can be influenced by circumstances, circumstances like droughts and so forth. Under these conditions shortages may be experienced on our markets from time to time. This was the case recently in regard to lucerne. It was found that there was such a shortage of this product that it was virtually unobtainable. The lucerne that was available was bought up by certain groups. These groups were then able to exploit the public in that they were able to demand whatever price they liked for their lucerne.</p>

<p>In this connection it has been said that we have the machinery of the Monopolies Act, but if in terms of the Monopolies Act an investigation was to be made into the position in regard to lucerne which I have just mentioned, all the farm animals would die before that investigation was completed. In the meantime, those people could continue to make their exorbitant profits. With this in mind I say that measures must be adopted to combat conditions that may arise from time to time. We have such measures in the form of these war measures. I say that because we have used these war measures for 20 years, and because we realize that certain of their provisions are necessary, we can no longer regard these provisions as being of a temporary nature. We must apply them to circumstances that will continue to exist in the future. For this reason the right thing to do is to place a law on the Statute Book giving those powers to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>It must be noticed that no extra powers are being given to the hon. the Minister over and above those he already has. On the contrary, the hon. the Minister already has all these powers. The previous speaker has said that these powers that are being asked for are very wide and almost unlimited. That is true, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the hon. the Minister has already had these powers for the past 20 years. And what is more, these powers have not been misused. In those circumstances I cannot understand why hon. members opposite are afraid that these powers will be misused in the future.</p>

<p>The argument of a free economy has also been advanced. It is said that the law of supply and demand must not be interfered with. But that law is not being detrimentally affected by this legislation and no additional powers are being asked for. What is being asked for already exists. A fact which is particularly important is that powers are needed to protect <span class="col_681-682" refersTo="page_0355"/>the public against exploitation. That is necessary. Another problem is the problem of the formation of groups. It often happens that certain groups amalgamate in order to force the small man out of the trade. These groups then succeed in obtaining an article in short supply and they control its distribution. This measure is also needed in order to prevent this sort of thing. The distribution must be controlled in such a way that the public are not exploited.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, I feel that this legislation is necessary. I have heard no acceptable reason put forward by the Opposition as to why these powers should not be given to the hon. the Minister. The Opposition have asked that this legislation be referred to a Select Committee but in my opinion no logical reason has been given as to why this legislation should be delayed. We are all acquainted with these measures. All of us have had experience of the practical functioning of the old war measures and we know that the hon. the Minister has not misused these powers. All we are asking for here is a perpetuation of these powers and for their conversion into a permanent measure. We agree on the necessity of these measures. But we cannot go on forever with temporary measures; we have to convert them into permanent legislation on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>For these reasons we on this side fully support this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has, I wish to say with great respect, completely misconceived the attitude of this side of the House. He quoted certain circumstances and on the basis of that he said that it was necessary for the Government to have these powers. However, the hon. member should know that in terms of the law as it stands to-day, the regulations under the war measures in other words, the Government has such powers. That being so, it is not, to my mind, a matter for urgency that this Bill should be rushed through this House with unseemly haste. The case of this side of the House is this: Here is a matter of very great importance. The original war measures were enacted in the early part of World War II. The regulations enacted under those measures were amended from time to time and we have had assurances from the hon. the Minister as well as from his predecessors that it was the policy of the Government to seek to do away with these emergency powers as far as that was necessary. Now the hon. the Minister is coming to us and is, in effect, saying that, in his view, there will be a state of permanent emergency in South Africa requiring a piece of legislation of this nature. That is, in effect, the case which the hon. the Minister is putting up.</p>

<block name="quote">But be that as it may. I should like to point out that no single hon. member on the other side of the House, nor the hon. the Minister, has given any reason why this measure should be proceeded with such undue haste. It is admitted on all sides that the present situation is covered by the regulations under the War Measures Act. It is, therefore, clearly a measure&#x2014;and may I say that it is a very important measure&#x2014;over which it is in the interest of everyone that time should be taken in order to ensure that it is duly studied by all the interests involved. There should be created an opportunity for consultation in order to ensure that we shall put on the Statute Book a really effective measure. The only way in which that can be achieved is to send this Bill to a select committee before its second reading. That select committee should be given the power to take evidence from all interests involved in the matter&#x2014;evidence not only from the farmers, producers and traders, but also from the consumers. It is my belief, as well as the belief of this side of the House, that if that course is taken and if this measure is considered to be necessary&#x2014;and I, for my part, have no doubt that the select committee will come to that conclusion&#x2014;then a really effective measure could be placed on the Statute Book.</block>

<p>This then is our plea. The objection to this measure being rushed through is, I believe, very real. I hope, consequently, that the hon. the Minister will heed the pleas of this side of the House. Mention was made of this measure for the first time only a few days ago. As a matter of fact, it was only on 28 January that this House gave leave for the introduction of this measure. Accordingly, it appeared on the Order Paper for the first time on 29 January. Obviously it has been impossible for interested bodies, whether they are representative of the consumers, producers or merchants, to give proper attention to the provisions of this measure, or to make suggestions with regard to it in order to make of it a more effective measure, or to make representations if they so wished to the effect that certain of its provisions are unnecessary.</p>

<p>Sir, I say that it is one of the tenets of democracy that an opportunity should be given to the other side to make itself heard. <i>Audi alteram partem</i> is the old Roman maxim. The position is quite clear: the very foundation of democracy is government by consent. Now, if the Government wants to act in accord with that principle, then this measure should be referred to a select committee where an opportunity will be given to all the interests involved to make representations. There will then also be a far greater opportunity for both sides of this House to consider the provisions of this measure in the quiet of a select committee room. There it will be necessary to come to a decision as to whether it is necessary to have this measure to replace the war measures. If an opportunity to do that is created, then it would be possible to propose a really effective measure instead of having a piece of rushed legislation. Here I wish to say that if the hon. the Minister does not accept our amendment, he will be guilty of rushing legislation through this House unnecessarily because it is clear that there can be no abuse <span class="col_683-684" refersTo="page_0356"/>while the present regulations are in force. At the present time the public is fully protected and I submit that the public will be better protected in future if an opportunity is given for a close study to be made of this Bill and particularly if an opportunity is given to the trade unions, producers&#x2019; organizations, chambers of commerce, and others to study the Bill carefully and to make recommendations. They are the experts in this field.</p>

<p>I can honestly say to the hon. the Minister that I have no doubt that if legislation is found to be necessary, and probably will be found to be necessary, then we can thrash out a really effective measure with the consent of all interested parties. That will then be government by consent.</p>

<p>In the circumstances I hope the hon. the Minister is going to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) opened this debate by making a personal attack on me. He is not in the House now but I want to say that I am very sorry that he has seen fit to make that attack upon me. Remarks such as those that he has made, besides not being true, do not redound to the credit of the hon. member. This sort of thing takes us no further; it merely makes things more difficult. I do not know whether the hon. member was aware of the fact that because his arguments were very weak he tried to ascribe sinister motives to me as far as the introduction of this measure was concerned.</p>

<p>The most important point of the speech of the hon. member was his allegation that I believed that the State should control everything to an increasing extent. That is absolute nonsense. I do not want to deal with it any further except to say that since the start of my term as Minister I have stated in this House every year&#x2014;and I want to repeat it again now, particularly with a view to the false propaganda that may be made both here and abroad on the grounds of the false accusations of the hon. member&#x2014;that I am in favour of free enterprise in our economy. That is what I advocated in my capacity as an ordinary Member of Parliament and since that time I have on every occasion, both here in the House and outside, always advocated the maintenance of free enterprise and the profit motive in our economy. No hon. member opposite can point a finger at the Government and say that we are only paying lip service to the matter&#x2014;in other words, that we have not applied the principle of free enterprise in our economy.</p>

<p>That is why arguments like those of the hon. member are simply intended to cover their own weakness and to harm South Africa&#x2019;s name and her economy. Thanks to the guidance of this Government our South African economy is to-day considered by many countries to be one of the most free economies in the whole world.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked why we were introducing this legislation in such haste. He wanted to know why we had not warned them of our intentions in this regard. The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) spoke about this &#x201C;revolutionary legislation&#x201D;. &#x201C;Why no consultation?&#x201D; we were asked. The fact remains that in 1962 we gave notice of our intention to introduce this legislation. In 1962 my colleague, the hon. Minister of Finance, said that those war measures that could not be abolished would be embodied in legislation. And so this measure is not something new. My hon. friend, the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Tucker), and others spoke as though we had come forward with a revolutionary and completely new idea and said that for that reason we should have had consultation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am still coming to that. Hon. members opposite adopted the attitude that we were introducing new and revolutionary legislation. But I say that this legislation contains nothing new or revolutionary. Perhaps its form does, but as far as its content is concerned there is nothing new. These provisions have stood for the past 20 years in the form of regulations on our Statute Book. Where then is the &#x201C;completely new thing&#x201D;? If we had come forward with a completely new thing, it would have been our duty to consult the Opposition and various other interests. But all that has happened here has been that the war regulations have been embodied in legislation because we feel that it is better to have them in the form of law. Where then does the revolution come in?</p>

<p>Hon. members also adopted the attitude that because this legislation has now been introduced, we will have to contend with price control for all time. But that statement is not true either. Indeed I made it very clear that all that was envisaged by this legislation was that the Minister would be given the power to apply price control if and when he considered such a step to be necessary. In other <span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0357"/>words, this is merely enabling legislation. I also said during my second-reading speech that there would be times when in spite of this legislation there would be no price control. But hon. members have interpreted this legislation as meaning that we will have permanent price control. As I have said, that is not true. All that is envisaged is that the Minister will have the right to impose price control if circumstances arise which justify the taking of such a step. To my mind the attitude of those hon. members is very strange. The Government is always being asked to take action and do certain things. If things go wrong in the economic sphere, we are blamed and it is said that we are not doing what we should do. &#x201C;Too little, too late&#x201D;, is what is said. We hear that said so often. But on the other hand, as soon as we want to take action, no matter what our motives are, we are accused and, moreover, in an unfriendly way, like the way in which my hon. friend the hon. member for Constantia accused us again to-day.</p>

<p>As far as the public generally are concerned, we are not criticized for instituting and applying price control but for not having done so. In other words, the public expects the Government to take action when exploitation must be combated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>And it has that power at present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I wanted to deal with this aspect of the matter later but let me say at this stage that it appears to me that there is great confusion in the minds of hon. members of the Opposition. The last few hon. members who spoke on that side tried to gloss over what was said by the hon. member for Constantia. They tried to tell this House that they were not opposed to price control as such but only to the legislation in that regard. The hon. member for Constantia also alleged the same thing but all his arguments were aimed at price control as such. I made a note of all his arguments. When one analyses them one sees that 80 per cent of them are opposed to price control as such. Other hon. members again said that they were not opposed to price control as such. What they were opposed to was legislation on price control!</p>

<p>Mention has also been made of &#x201C;consultation&#x201D;. I want to ask: With whom and how must we consult? About what must we consult? I think that hon. members will agree with me that there is only one thing on which we can have consultation and that is the question of whether we should have price control or not. But as far as I am concerned I am not prepared to have any consultation in that regard. I am not prepared to do so because, to my mind, the important principle is that price control is necessary in South Africa. Certain of my hon. friends opposite hold certain theoretical points of view in regard to free trade with the outside world, free competition within this country and so forth. But those are purely theoretical, academic and imaginary ideas which cannot work in any country in the world in this modern age. It is very easy to sit opposite us and to talk about the &#x201C;free play of competition within and outside of the country&#x201D;. That we can forget about. There is no longer any such thing as free competition between countries; and there can no longer be any such thing as free competition between competitive forces within a country. These are purely theoretical and imaginary ideas that no longer exist in our modern economic life. They simply cannot exist at a time when groups are being formed, when we have price fixing and other mighty factors that militate against the individual and against the consumer.</p>

<p>Let me tell hon. members that it is also our task to look after the consumer, to ensure that he is not exploited by people who are stronger than he is and against whom he cannot protect himself. Does the hon. member for Constantia really think that we should do away with price control? Should we, for example, do away with control over the price of sugar, or over the price of coal or of arms and ammunition&#x2014;and that in a country where sudden surpluses and sudden shortages can arise? What would the Capetonians say if something went wrong with the transport system up North as a result of which there was a great coal shortage in Cape Town which in its turn gave rise to price increases? Would they be pleased if that happened? What was the position some months ago when we were inundated with demands for arms and ammunition and the prices of these articles rose sky-high? We received requests from people from all over the country asking that prices be controlled. Do hon. members know what is going on in certain parts of the country? Do they know that there are parts of our country where there is very little competition and where certain dealers absolutely exploit the public, a public which cannot protect itself? Hon. members must know that these circumstances arise. We are not merely discussing general ideas on price control. We are dealing with the actual protection of the public at a small place, perhaps at some remote place on the platteland. It is the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to protect the public and that is why we are asking for these powers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia asked me whether I expected great shortages to arise in the future and whether that was the main reason why we were asking for these powers. No, that is not the case. These war measures and regulations are not being transformed into permanent legislation because we want greater powers or because we anticipate greater shortages. That is not the position. But we are living in an age when conditions can sometimes become very difficult. Hon. members themselves have already complained about the recent rise in prices and we do not know when prices may rise again. We do not know what can happen. We are at present experiencing <span class="col_687-688" refersTo="page_0358"/>a phase that can be described as a period of economic prosperity, as a period of growth. Hon. members opposite know that one of the greatest problems to-day in the management of affairs in the economic sphere is to equate economic growth with stable prices. There is a struggle between growth and inflation. This is the position throughout the world. This is something that is experienced in every country. When a country experiences economic growth it always experiences the problem of rising prices.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Are the present powers and provisions in any way ineffective?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. At the moment I am still replying to the arguments of the hon. member for Constantia. I say therefore that we want these powers because we are at present experiencing a period of growth. In a period of growth and prosperity there is always the danger that prices may rise. This is a problem that is experienced throughout the economic life of the world to-day. That is why we also anticipate having to cope with similar problems during the present period of growth in our country. That is the reason why we must retain price control.</p>

<p>Let me reply to the question of the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Tucker) by asking: What difference does it make whether the prices of a dealer are fixed by regulation or in terms of a law? There is no difference. It is a bad thing to allow a war regulation to continue to exist as a regulation 20 years after the war and not to embody it in legislation. This is particularly true in regard to enabling regulations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs and others referred to the legislation dealing with the control of monopolies. In this connection I have already made it quite clear that the legislation against monopolies is not intended to combat developments such as this in our economic life. That legislation is too time-consuming for that. If I arrive at De Aar or Groblersdal and I find that there is a dealer there who is exploiting the public, should I apply the provisions of the Monopolies Act to that individual dealer? Must months and years pass before any decision can be arrived at? That Act is not intended to cover matters of this nature.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) referred to the disadvantages and the dangers of price control. That is true. There are disadvantages and dangers connected with price control as with all forms of control. That is why it is our policy to apply price control as sensibly and as benignly as possible and also as seldom as possible. There are disadvantages and dangers and risks connected with it but this is also the case in regard to all legislation passed by this House. Because this is so, must we shrink away from passing all legislation? I would rather take the risk of having to cope with any disadvantages and dangers that may arise from price control when I apply it sympathetically than face the future without those powers and leave the consumer to the fate that others may mete out to him.</p>

<p>The last argument that was raised here was whether we did not have confidence in the economy of the country. Mr. Speaker, if we did not have confidence in the economic development of our country we would not even need price control because we would then believe in depression and prices would fall of their own accord. But because we have confidence in the future of our country and because we believe that a tremendous period of growth lies ahead of us, a development that is often accompanied by rising prices, as I have said, we need this legislation. We have been asked whether we will be prepared to agree that the Bill be referred to a select committee as provided for in the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia. I am sorry but I cannot accept that amendment. This is where we differ fundamentally from the Opposition. I cannot agree with the argument that has been raised by the hon. members opposite that we are introducing a completely new principle here&#x2014;&#x201C;revolutionary&#x201D; was the word used&#x2014;and that price control is really a bad thing. That is why I cannot accept the amendment.</p>
