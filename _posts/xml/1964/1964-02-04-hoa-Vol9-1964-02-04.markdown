<ol>

<li>(1) Whether there is a shortage of housing units in the Republic; if so, what is the estimated shortage in (a) the Republic,(b) Johannesburg, (c) Cape Town, (d) Durban, (e) Port Elizabeth, (f) Pretoria, (g) East London and (h) Pietermaritzburg; and</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_housing" to="#oldfield">

<from>The MINISTER OF HOUSING:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) As a result of the accelerated rate at which immigrants are now entering the <span class="col_693-694" refersTo="page_0361"/>country as well as the natural increase of the urban population and also as a result of booming economic conditions an increased demand for letting units for Whites with a rental that can be afforded by families with an income of R180 and less per month has occurred in recent times. However, there is no actual shortage of housing for Whites in general as is evidenced daily by the advertisement columns of newspapers in the more important centres.

<p>The Bantu Housing Board is giving continuous attention to the housing position of the Bantu in urban areas with the result that there is at present no shortage of housing for this group; where building operations take place it is undertaken to provide better accommodation or to effect necessary resettlement.</p>

<p>Some housing for Coloureds and Asiatics is good and some is bad. Great efforts are being made to improve the living standards of families in the last-mentioned categories by the provision of better housing.</p>

<p>According to surveys and estimates the demand for better housing for Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics in the areas concerned is as follows:</p></li>

</ol>

<li><i>(a)</i> A reliable estimate is not available. (As regards the various centres mentioned in the question the following estimate of the number of dwelling units required, is made)&#x2014;</li>

<li>(2) In order to meet the increased demand for accommodation by Whites in the income group R180 and less per month, and to provide better housing for the other groups of the population, the Department of Housing has since its coming into being at the end of 1962 been engaged through its seven fully decentralized Regional Offices and a special liaison section created 15 months ago under the control of an officer with the grade of Under Secretary, in negotiating with all local authorities in the Republic and urging them by means of guidance and assistance at all levels to provide in the housing needs of the inhabitants of the areas under their control by the provision of dwellings out of advances out of the National Housing Fund. In this manner negotiations have already been entered into with more than 270 local authorities.

<p>According to recent statistics it appears that local authorities are engaged with the erection of 900 dwellings for Whites and hostels for youths and other homes to provide accommodation for approximately 700 persons, whilst they are also at the same time erecting 10,000 dwellings for Coloureds and 3,700 for Asiatics.</p>

<p>In addition to this number of dwellings on which local authorities are already busily engaged, several of them are also planning large schemes for Whites in respect of which actual building operations will be commenced shortly; for instance, Cape Town approximately 1,000 dwellings, Durban approximately 2,000 dwellings, the Witwatersrand approximately 1,000, Pretoria several hundred and Port Elizabeth also at least 1,000 units.</p>

<p>All these dwelling units, the purchase of the land on which they are being erected and the provision of essential services such as power, water, etc., whether they are erected by the Department itself or by local authorities or utility companies, are financed by the State out of the National Housing Fund.</p>

<p>In order to augment the efforts of local authorities the Department itself undertakes the planning and erection of schemes in centres where the demand is the greatest, as for example the following projects which are at present being carried out: Johannesburg (Triomf) 1,500 dwellings and flats (building operations on approximately 500 dwellings have already been commenced), Crown Gardens 50 flats, Bloemfontein 50 dwellings, Kimberley 56, Port Elizabeth 100, Cape Town 50 and Durban approximately 100 dwellings and flats. The Department is also planning two townships at Cape Town and Port Elizabeth consisting of 2,500 and 2,000 dwellings, respectively. In all, therefore, more than 10,000 dwellings and flats for Whites in the income group R180 and less per month are being planned for early erection. Apart from the dwellings being provided in these centres, local authorities in the rest of the country are also engaged on the provision of a further 5,000 dwelling units for Whites. These building programmes should provide fully in the near future in any urgent need which may exist at present.</p>

<p>During my recent visit to five countries abroad I gave special attention to prefabricated building units of which fairly extensive use is made there. It would appear that the employment of similar methods in the Republic could contribute towards a speedier provision of dwelling units. Expert investigation into methods of prefabrication has therefore <span class="col_697-698" refersTo="page_0363"/>been authorized and it is hoped that it will be found practicable to employ such methods for the provision of low cost dwelling units on an extensive scale in the Republic.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting the National Housing Commission also resolved to make advances out of the National Housing Fund available for the erection of wooden houses or dwellings of processed wood products on a competitive basis with other building materials. The erection of wooden houses within the areas of municipalities has also been accepted in principle by municipal associations.</p>

<p>In conclusion I must announce that the Government has decided that as it has been found in practice that the functions of the National Housing Commission, and the development functions of the Group Areas Development Board which is at present integrated with the Department of Community Development, are so closely related, and so often have to be exercised in the same locality in such a manner that the two bodies have to supplement each other, that it is desirable that they should function in the same Department of State. The Group Areas Development Board together with the relevant administrative section of the Department of Community Development are accordingly transferred from the Department of Community Development to the Department of Housing with effect from 1 April 1964. With this transfer the necessary coordination of activities between the two bodies will be achieved and they will without any doubt become a very effective combined instrument of State to further effectively the development of residential areas, the eradication of slums and the housing of the less privileged.</p></li></ol>

<question by="#durrant" to="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>Mr. DURRANT</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Immigration:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he intends to introduce legislation during the current Session to permit the entry of juvenile immigrants without their parents; and, if so,</li>

<li>(2) what State assistance will be given to such immigrants.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_immigration" to="#durrant">

<from>The MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No. When the possibility of encouraging juveniles to immigrate to the Republic without their parents was considered, I was informed that the Immigrants Selection Board, which was established in terms of the Aliens Act, No. 1 of 1937, as amended, had always held the view that it did not have the power to consider such applications. A draft Bill was accordingly prepared to make specific provision in the Act for the admission of such persons, but the Government law advisers ruled that the board already has those powers under the existing legislation.</li>

<li>(2) Juveniles who immigrate without their parents are entitled to the assistance which is available to all approved immigrants under the State-aided immigration scheme, namely a maximum contribution of R120 towards passage costs, inland rail transportation and accommodation at State expense upon arrival in South Africa, Customs concessions and, if necessary, assistance in finding employment.</li>

<p>Second Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Electricity Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The necessity for the amendments proposed in this Bill arises in the first place from the development works which may possibly be tackled in the territory of South West Africa, and in the second place from inquiries for the supply of power by Escom which have already been received from some of South Africa&#x2019;s neighbouring states. These aspects are dealt with in Clauses 1 and 2, while Clauses 3 and 4 merely provide for the substitution of the words &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; and &#x201C;State President&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;Union&#x201D; and &#x201C;Governor-General&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In so far as the provision of electric power to and in South West Africa is concerned, it is envisaged that considerable quantities will be required for the development of that territory. It is therefore logical that Escom, which is the greatest generator and distributor of electricity in the Republic, can advantageously be used to supply power in a neighbouring territory like S.W.A., rather than for us to establish another organization of this nature at great expense especially to provide for the needs of South West Africa. In order, however, to enable Escom to fulfil this function, it is necessary to amend the Electricity Act, in view of the fact that the functions of the Commission are strictly limited to the Republic in terms of the existing Act.</p>

<p>It will be noted in this regard that the Bill in the proposed Section <i>4bis</i> (1) (a) (i), as contained in Clause 2, provides that Escom, through any of its undertakings in the Republic, may sell electricity to the I.D.C. on the borders between the Republic and South West Africa, while, in regard to the generation and distribution of electric power in South West Africa itself, and also the purchase of power from a neighbouring state in order to make it available in S.WA. or the Republic, it will act as the agent of the I.D.C. in terms of the proposed Section <i>4bis</i> (1) (b).</p>

<p>I may explain here that this provision has been worded in this way because all Escom&#x2019;s works or undertakings in the Republic have been financed from loans raised locally and overseas, and in respect of which Escom&#x2019;s immovable assets were pledged as security. For this reason it is essential that the financing of the generation and distribution of power in South West Africa should be kept quite separate from that in the Republic. Nor is it correct that loans incurred for works in the Republic, and which are secured by Escom&#x2019;s assets in the Republic, should partially be utilized for the purposes of serving South West Africa.</p>

<p>In so far as the supply of power by Escom on the borders of the Republic to any of our other neighbouring states is concerned, as is provided in Section 4<i>bis</i> (1) (a) (ii), as I have already stated, inquiries have been received from one or two of South Africa&#x2019;s neighbouring states. But once again the problem exists that Escom is not allowed to sell electricity beyond the borders of South Africa. Therefore, before the Commission can initiate any negotiations in this regard, it is essential for it to obtain the necessary legal authorization for such provision of electricity. In this regard it should be noted that Escom will be able to undertake only the supply of power on the borders between the Republic and the neighbouring state which asks for it, and that the neighbouring state concerned must itself see to the further distribution of that power. I must further point out that it is provided in the proposed Section 4<i>bis</i> (2) (b) that electricity will be supplied to a neighbouring state at a price to be arranged between Escom and that neighbouring state, with the approval of the Minister of Economic Affairs. The reason for this provision is that although Escom must supply electric power in the Republic at cost price, from the very nature of the matter it cannot be expected to do so in territories beyond the borders of South Africa.</p>

<p>In connection with the role which the I.D.C. will play in the supply of electricity through Escom, as its agent, I may inform the House that I shall within the near future introduce a Bill to amend the Industrial Development Act, 1944. This Bill is still in the process of being drafted, and I therefore do not want to anticipate its provisions now.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to express the hope that hon. members will agree that these proposed amendments will undoubtedly, directly or indirectly, redound to the benefit of the country&#x2019;s industries, and that they will make a great contribution towards the development of South West Africa, to which the Republic bears a great responsibility.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support this Bill. It is quite obvious that it will probably help us to maintain friendly relations with the Protectorates when they become independent. This applies to the Transkei too. It would be a great pity if the Commission did not have this power when such an occasion arose. We have certain reservations about the arrangements with Escom but they will be dealt with by another speaker on this side. But we support the Bill itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions. The first is whether he considers that the Industrial Development Corporation is the right authority to be used for buying bulk electric power from Escom and redistributing it through South West Africa? I think the time has come where the operations of the I.D.C. want a little closer examination than has been given them in the <span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0376"/>past. The I.D.C. seems to be becoming a greater colossus every year by the additional powers granted to it and the additional undertakings passed on to it, so much so that in many of its aspects it is already interfering with private enterprise. Here we have another situation where the bulk electric power for South West Africa is taken out of the hands of the Electricity Supply Commission and given to the octopus Industrial Development Corporation. I should like to ask the Minister whether he thinks that that is the correct and best manner in which electricity should be handled.</p>

<p>The second question is this. The hon. the Minister has told us that he proposes to introduce a Bill to amend the Industrial Development Corporation Act. Is the position not at the moment that the I.D.C. cannot operate in South West Africa? Are its operations not limited to the boundaries of the Republic? In the Act that set up the I.D.C. and in any subsequent amendments&#x2014;as far as I can see, but I stand to be corrected&#x2014;there is no provision for the I.D.C. to operate outside the borders of the Republic. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on that point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the first question of the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) I want to say that we believe the Industrial Development Corporation could be the best medium for the industrial development of South West Africa. If the hon. member reads the Bill correctly he will see that Escom can be appointed as the agent of the I.D.C. It does not mean that the I.D.C. is going to do the distribution. The I.D.C. can use Escom as its agent to distribute electricity.</p>

<p>In reply to the second question: As the law stands at the moment the I.D.C. is not empowered to operate in countries outside South Africa unless it is directly in the interests of South Africa. We interpret it this way that should the I.D.C. start an industry in South West Africa, an industry which bought, say, all its raw material from South Africa, that would be in compliance with the Act. But this is not quite clear; there are various interpretations and that is why we are going to introduce a Bill into Parliament to make this position quite clear, namely, the circumstances under which the I.D.C. can operate in other territories. That was the Bill I was referring to.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to explain this Bill in great detail, because it is the third time that the second reading of this Bill has been discussed in Parliament. Two years ago I made a second-reading speech in connection with the same Bill. That was towards the end of the session, and at the request of hon. members of the Opposition that the Bill might possibly affect certain interests and that it was necessary that we should not set to work over-hastily, I agreed to let it stand over until last year. During the recess of 1962-3 I felt that we could eliminate debates in Parliament and that it would perhaps serve a very useful purpose if I moved in 1963 to refer the Bill to a select committee after the second-reading speech I would then make. That is what happened last year. The select committee thoroughly investigated all the clauses and aspects of the Bill; they called for <span class="col_725-726" refersTo="page_0377"/>evidence and heard evidence, orally and otherwise, and the views of all interested parties were put before them. The select committee made a thorough study of the Bill and proposed certain amendments. I want to take this opportunity to thank hon. members who served on that select committee for the work they did and for the way in which they performed their task.</p>

<p>Practically all the amendments proposed in the select committee have been embodied in the new Bill now before us. In regard to one or two principles contained in the Bill, there were certain members of the select committee who raised objections, and the members of the select committee were not unanimous in regard to these few provisions, and in so far as that is concerned recommendations were made by way of a majority vote. The most important point of difference was in regard to Clause 24 of the old Bill. That clause made it impossible to obtain registration or plant breeders&#x2019; rights for imported, or shall I say foreign, plants, whether bred vegetatively or from seed, if those plants in the opinion of the Department were not useful plants or served no useful purpose. For that reason, ornamental plants as such, for example, were definitely excluded in the old Bill.</p>

<p>The South African Nurserymen&#x2019;s Association were strongly in favour of the retention of that clause as it stood, but they were divided in respect of the discriminatory factor in that clause. The minority vote on the select committee, as also the minority of the representatives of the growers themselves, felt that this clause should be retained, but unconditionally&#x2014;that there should be no discrimination. My departmental head, <i>inter alia</i>, also gave evidence before the select committee, and he made it very clear that the object of this Bill was in the first instance basic&#x2014;not only to protect the plant breeders in our country, but also to give them the benefit of the breeding of new varieties done in our country. That was regarded as being of great value for the development of horticulture and agriculture in our country. Up to the present it was really the Department of Agriculture, as it was originally, and later the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, which were mainly responsible for the breeding of new lines, whether vegetatively or from seed. I need only mention the big change which was brought about in regard to the cultivation of wheat in our country, the new types and new varieties which are more rust-resistant and more adaptable to the various areas of the country. Those were all varieties bred by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services at its various experimental and research stations. Not a single one of those varieties was bred by a private plant breeder. I am thinking of our fruit varieties, both for the Western Cape, for the winter rainfall area, and for the Midlands or the Transvaal, the summer rainfall areas. As a result of years of devoted service and research and with great tenacity of purpose they bred adapted varieties of fruit, so that the best results could be achieved. With the exception perhaps of one or two varieties, they were all the result of breeding undertaken by the Department. But we simply do not have the resources available to place the full and sole responsibility for the development of our agricultural and horticultural plants on the Department of Agricultural Technical Services.</p>

<p>In other parts of the world it is found that plant breeders and individual seed-breeders play a much more important role and make much greater contributions to the development of new varieties of plants, whether they be decorative plants or useful production plants. In this country we also find that gradually there are many plant breeders who are particularly interested and who also want to play a role in it, and who have already started doing so. It is now felt, however, that no real protection exists which can serve to encourage them. Therefore this Bill mainly aims at giving the right to plant breeders (and that of course includes the Department) to register plant breeders&#x2019; rights in regard to new plants and new varieties in our country, which will be to their advantage if they can obtain such rights. For a certain period royalties will be paid to them in respect of such plants, and that will of course depend on the value of such plants to the country in general. I think that is a particularly sound principle. On going through the minutes of the select committee and the various documents made available to it, and during interviews with interested parties in the industry, I have come to the conclusion that practically no one will he opposed to this principle. Everybody is in favour of it and feels that the time has arrived for us to give greater encouragement also to the individual plant breeders in the country who want to devote themselves in this way to the development of our agricultural and horticultural industries.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel that a case may perhaps be made out in connection with Clause 24 in the old Bill and that it may be said: Why do you now want to discriminate between plants?</p>

<p>That hon. member would very much like to drag politics even into this matter. But perhaps it is a good thing to discriminate under certain circumstances. And it is not only we who sit here who discriminate. Just think of how the general public in our country discriminates in respect of their attitude towards the Government and their attitude towards the Opposition. Surely one cannot expect the public to adopt the same attitude towards both sides.</p>

<from><span class="col_727-728" refersTo="page_0378"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, you were quite correct in putting that question to me, because I think I am now deviating from the subject. But in this Bill we have now completely abandoned the discriminatory factor, and we decided to omit Clause 24 completely, and not to discriminate, and not to grant certain rights in respect of certain useful plants only while not granting rights in respect of plants which we do not regard as being useful plants, because we have existing legislation which we can and will use to take all the necessary precautions in regard to the import of plants or new varieties from other countries which have either been bred vegetatively or from seed.</p>

<p>We have therefore decided to incorporate in this new legislation practically all the recommendations of the select committee, except for this one which was adopted by a majority vote and also another one in respect of which the select committee was also not unanimous and which was also adopted by a majority vote, namely the one which provides for the appeal which is allowed when registration is refused. My Department and I have decided to retain this in the Bill practically as it stood before, because we want to keep the costs of appeal as low as possible. But nevertheless we felt that the recommendation of the select committee that the chairman of that appeal board should be a lawyer was a very useful suggestion, and consequently we accepted it.</p>

<p>The argument may be advanced that we will lose much by passing this legislation because perhaps we will not be able to obtain good new varieties from overseas which may perhaps be very useful in our country. The fact is, however, that there is not much substance in that argument. Take, for example, our good varieties, such as the yellow canning peach, of which last year we were able to announce four new varieties bred in South Africa by departmental breeders, by our Fruit Research Institute at Bien Donne. That was the result of a breeding programme with which they had been busy for between 15 and 17 years, and eventually these results were achieved. We are now convinced that we have a fruit which will undoubtedly retain its character and which will make a contribution to the whole of the fruit and canning industries; it will prolong the canning season, and instead of that season lasting three weeks, as was the case in the past, it will now be extended to almost two months or longer. The economic value of this cannot be measured in terms of money.</p>

<p>Now we have been accustomed to exchanging things with other Western countries. Let me say that in the scientific sphere our experience is that the Western nations, even communist Russia, are quite agreeable to the mutual exchange of scientific information, and as regards agricultural and horticultural plants new lines are constantly being exchanged between one country and another in order to see whether they can adapt themselves and whether they will serve one&#x2019;s purposes. That is the general practice. Until last year the position was that 80 new plants were patented in South Africa, of which only seven originated in South Africa; the rest came from abroad. Only six plants were patented which were not decorative plants; the rest were chiefly roses. Apart from that, almost 90 per cent of the decorative plants patented in South Africa came from two countries, America and France. Experience has taught us that plants which adapt themselves and do well here do not necessarily adapt themselves to different climatic conditions, even though they are apparently comparable to our conditions here in South Africa. I am thinking, for example, of parts of America like California, where the climate is very similar to ours. Perhaps fortunately for us, our yellow peaches do not thrive there at all. When planted there they become something quite different and have not the same qualities. Consequently they have in America not yet succeeded in breeding a competitive canning peach of equal quality. I just mention that as an example.</p>

<p>The fact that in this Bill we do not provide for the registration of plant breeders&#x2019; rights in regard to plants bred abroad does not in the least mean that we cannot import those plants into our country. It is not all the countries of the world which have such patent rights, or where plant patenting is practised, and where, if one allows them to patent and to register here, they must grant reciprocal treatment to us. There are many countries in the world which do not have anything of the kind. There is nothing in this Bill which prevents any plant breeder in South Africa from importing the mother lines. That can be done by a foreign company, and then, with the permission of the Department, if it complies with our demands, in order to keep diseases out of the country (infection, etc.), such a new variety can be crossbred here and it will be possible to obtain plant breeders&#x2019; rights because it was cultivated in South Africa. I therefore feel that this Bill should really enjoy the support of both sides of the House. Much time has been devoted to it and it deserves the support of both sides of the House. I also believe that it will be welcomed as a forward step in the right direction, not only in South Africa, but I want to express the hope that the provisions of this Bill will have the effect of encouraging our private seed and plant breeders in South Africa, because they will be able to derive more profit from their work. I think it will be a greater encouragement to them to develop plants which adapt themselves to our conditions. It will make a contribution to what I regard as the basis on which the whole of our agricultural economy and our development in South Africa rests, namely the breeding of plant material which will result in greater yields per morgen&#x2014;and here I want to mention the example of our hybrid maize and certain other grain varieties&#x2014;plants which are more resistant to disease and plagues, so <span class="col_729-730" refersTo="page_0379"/>that we will be able economically to produce more than we are producing even to-day. I therefore hope that this measure will enjoy the support of the whole House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has expressed the hope that this measure will receive the support of this side of the House. I should like to say immediately that the official Opposition will support the second reading of this Bill. We hope that it will be possible in the Committee Stage to persuade the Minister to agree to certain amendments which we believe will improve the Bill.</p>

<p>This whole question of plant rights is a very vexed one, and as the hon. the Minister said, there is no wide international agreement, and it appears that the countries are following two broad lines. The one is to use the patent laws and to allow plants to be patented in the same way as industrial patents, and the other is to provide for plant breeders&#x2019; rights. The difficulty of the whole subject is shown very clearly by the fact that a British commission which sat for a considerable period and prepared a very well-considered report did not lead to British legislation in terms of that report. The recommendation of that commission was that plant breeders&#x2019; rights should be registered separately and not as patents, but the British Government did not see fit to follow that recommendation. As the Minister knows, different leading countries in the world have taken different lines. I can only express the hope that common sense will in the end lead to the adoption of a common basis of dealing with these matters, but we agree that South Africa cannot possibly stand still and wait until such time as such agreement is arrived at.</p>

<p>This measure is one of a highly technical nature. It has received very careful consideration. It was before a select committee last year for a considerable time. I should like to say to the chairman of that select committee that we who represented this side of the House appreciated the patience with which he dealt with the matter and the time we were allowed to seek to achieve an agreed measure, which unfortunately proved not to be possible. But nevertheless I believe it was a splendid example of how legislation of this kind should be handled, because the aim of this side of the House, as well as that side, obviously must be to get the best possible legislation put on our Statute Book. I hope that when we come to the Committee Stage the Minister will find himself able to accept some of the proposals which will come from this side of the House with that end in view.</p>

<p>The measure as it stood originally, I believe, constituted a breach of our international agreements. That matter has been gone into very fully. The present measure is unquestionably a considerable improvement on the one which appeared before the House last year. There is no doubt whatever, we believe, that for the registration of these rights you should have persons who are properly qualified. We believe that there should be limitations placed on the group from which those persons will come, and we will move appropriately at the appropriate time. This measure, we hope, will prove to be a step forward. Let me say at once that we do not believe that it is a final piece of legislation. We believe that it will have to be watched very carefully. We fully appreciate that it is essential to prevent as far as possible the infection of our soil by the introduction of plants from overseas, and it is therefore necessary that there should be a period of quarantine. But I hope that in principle the Minister will agree with us that it is important that there should be an international exchange and that South Africa should do everything she possibly can to make it easy for us to get the best and most up-to-date plants available, while at the same time taking adequate steps to ensure that our soil is not infested in the process. I believe that most of the points on which there is a difference of opinion will be mentioned by other hon. members on this side, and I hope that when we come to the Committee Stage it will be possible to have a full debate on those points. But we support the second reading. We are very anxious to be helpful in putting a thoroughly good measure on the Statute Book and we hope we will have the Minister&#x2019;s cooperation in that regard.</p>

<speech by="#faurie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FAURIE</person>:</from>

<p>As chairman of the select committee I should like to express our thanks to the members of that committee for the pleasant spirit which prevailed there and for the hearty co-operation that existed there. We did not always view matters in the same light; there were differences of opinion but the spirit throughout was a pleasant one and I think the members enjoyed serving on that committee. We tried to allow every member who wished to put forward an idea ample time to do so, and that applies also to all those who wished to give evidence. We spent quite a considerable amount of time, but it was very pleasant to co-operate with the committee.</p>

<p>A full opportunity was given to the interests most closely concerned with this matter, the plant breeders, to state their views. As you know, Sir, a committee was first of all appointed under the chairmanship of Dr. Anderson, who did the preliminary investigations and took the evidence of interested parties. As a result of that report, a provisional Bill was drawn up which was submitted to the House and referred to a select committee. The members of the S.A. Nurserymen&#x2019;s Association, who testified before the select committee on behalf of their association, also expressed their thanks for the way in which this legislation had been drawn up and for the opportunity given to them to express their views. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Plant Patents Act was placed on the Statute Book in 1952. That Act has been in operation all these years up to the present time and plant breeders, where <span class="col_731-732" refersTo="page_0380"/>they have cultivated new plants, have been able to make use of that Act to register those plants and to place them under protection and to receive additional compensation. But that Act did not entirely comply with the requirements of the members of the Nurserymen&#x2019;s Association and of nurserymen in general, and it was felt that something better should be substituted for it. That is clear from the evidence given before the committee. The secretary of the association, Mr. Basson, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The S.A. Nurserymen&#x2019;s Association has deliberated on this matter at their congress for years.</block>

<p>The outcome of those deliberations was that they asked that a new Act should be drawn up to replace the Plant Patents Act. It was for that reason that the Anderson Committee was appointed which then submitted this legislation. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any case, at our congresses we then decided to ask that patents should be done away with and that something else should be substituted for them.</block>

<p>The representatives of the S.A. Nurserymen&#x2019;s Association also expressed their thanks to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services for the opportunity given to them to state their views, to give evidence and to submit proposals with a view to improving the law. Many of their proposals were accepted by the committee and those proposals are incorporated in this legislation. I just want to quote what the chairman of the delegation said to the committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Generally speaking I can say that with the exception of Clause 24, as I have already indicated, we regard this Bill as an excellent piece of legislation.</block>

<p>That is a compliment in the first place to the department and its officials who were concerned with the drafting of this Bill. For the rest the representatives of the S.A. Nurserymen&#x2019;s Association really had no objection to the proposed legislation. In connection with Clause 18 they simply stated that they wanted information with regard to the conditions which the registrar would impose as far as compensation was concerned when grating a licence. It was possible to satisfy them on that point without the necessity of amending the Bill. In connection with Clause 22 they merely asked for information also with regard to the appeal body. The committee decided to bring about a change, and that change is incorporated in the amended Bill.</p>

<p>The object of this Bill, as has already been stated, is in the first place to encourage our own breeders to concentrate on the breeding of new varieties which are suited to South African conditions and which can yield a better and higher production than the existing varieties. By making provision for plant breeders&#x2019; rights we are giving protection to such a breeder, and once his rights have been registered he will be in a position to receive a royalty and better compensation for the work done by him in connection with the breeding of such a plant. Reference should also be made here to the very valuable services which are being rendered by the Department itself as far as the breeding of new varieties is concerned. The Minister has already referred to it, but I feel that some reference should also be made here to the particularly fine services which are being rendered by officials of the Department. When one thinks of the new fruit varieties which have been cultivated here&#x2014;peaches such as Oom Sarel, Professor Neethling and Professor Black&#x2014;one realizes how valuable these new varieties are to fruit growers, particularly in the Boland, and particularly to the people who grow fruit for canning purposes. But the department does not always have enough officials to cope with all that work and that is why it is essential to give additional assistance and to inspan private initiative also to make their contribution. There are approximately 900 nurserymen in this country but the number of people who really breed plants is very small. There are probably only three or four who are really interested in the breeding of plants. What we want to encourage is the breeding of new plants, and that is what this Bill seeks to do. It is, of course, a slow process. It probably takes from six to ten years to breed new stable varieties from seed plants. In the case of fruit trees it probably takes from 15 to 20 years. It is a lengthy process and people need encouragement to undertake that intensive work.</p>

<p>As a member of the select committee I am rather sorry that Clause 24, as it was originally drafted, was not retained. The committee in general felt that that clause should remain. Other members felt that it should be amended. I just want to refer to the evidence which was given before the Select Committee, orally and by way of memoranda and also in the form of telegrams and letters. Of the 15 persons who gave evidence, nine expressed themselves in favour of the retention of Clause 24 as it stands. Two said it should be deleted; four of the others said that it should be retained but that it should be amended to make provision for plants for human and animal feeding, for industrial plants and plants for medical purposes, as well as ornamental plants. Those who gave evidence against its retention laid a good deal of emphasis on the question of disease-free or virus-free varieties and the adaptability of plants. I just want to say that that argument is not really relevant to the question of the retention or deletion of Clause 24. This measure does not prevent the importation of plants. In other words, the question of disease-free plants can always still be dealt with under the existing legislation. Under the existing Act plants can be tested in terms of the quarantine regulations and the country safeguarded against disease-carrying plants. As <span class="col_733-734" refersTo="page_0381"/>far as the question of adaptability is concerned, we have the same position. Plants can still be imported even if this Bill is not placed on the Statute Book at all, and the adaptability of plants can also be tested without placing new legislation on the Statute Book. We feel, however, that the position may arise that a person abroad&#x2014;there are just a few countries which have plant patent rights (America and France)&#x2014;may breed a plant, an industrial plant, which may be of very great economic value to us and that he may register a plant patent right in his own country and then refuse to allow that plant to be imported into this country unless we give him protection here. There is that possibility, if we had retained Clause 24, then we could have made provision for cases of that kind.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of compensation. We are a comparatively small country. A person who breeds a new variety of fruit or a new plant here which is of great value is unable to make very much out of it, but if he can register patent rights overseas where millions of those plants can be sold in a year it may net him a huge income. It is in the interests of our people therefore to be able to obtain patent rights abroad. We concede that business people are not so fond of this Bill. If they can get a plant which is really good they will buy it, even though there is no protection in the country of origin. Such cases may possibly arise. But the Bill as it stands here is generally acceptable to the people who are most closely concerned with it, the nurserymen, and we want to express the hope that this legislation will help to encourage people to breed plants in the interests of our agricultural industry.</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>I think we are in agreement with the hon. member for Nelspruit (Mr. Faurie), the chairman of the select committee who has just sat down, in that we agree that Clause 24 should not have been omitted from this third Bill which is now before the House. I would say that this third Bill which is now introduced after it has been to a select committee is an improved Bill, but we could not reach complete agreement in the select committee on the amendments that we on this side of the House should introduce. These amendments will be dealt with fully in the Committee Stage and I hope that the hon. the Minister will consider them very seriously and include them in the Bill to improve the Bill.</p>

<p>In the Minister&#x2019;s second-reading speech last year when he introduced this Bill he said that he had already tried to get into touch with and to consult numerous interested parties like the K.W.V. and the Deciduous Fruit Board, and more particularly the S.A. Institute of Patent Agents and the South African nurserymen. It is particularly the nurserymen who wish to see the retention of Clause 24. They would have liked to have seen it extended, and in their evidence before the Select Committee they wish to see this clause retained in the Bill. The Minister admitted last year that certain rights which certain people had under previous legislation, like the Patents Act of 1942, may be affected by this Bill, and therefore he sent it to the select committee in order that evidence might be heard and a new Bill presented to the House. I feel that this 1964 Bill now before us contains numerous amendments and additions which have been put forward by the Department, and others were presented by the chairman of the select committee. One or two small amendments were accepted from hon. members on this side of the House, but I regret to say that the two main points of criticism put forward by this side have not been incorporated in this Bill. The first is the extension of the provisions of the Bill to include new plants originating outside the Republic. Regarding these plants, it has been stated that legislation for plant breeders&#x2019; rights inside the Republic, while excluding plants bred outside the Republic, is contrary to present international law. The aim of this Bill should be to preserve international reciprocity with countries with patent rights or plant breeders&#x2019; rights. It was strongly felt by members of the Select Committee on this side that the legislation should follow those lines and that the principle should be extended to include new plants originating outside the Republic. We on this side advocated this principle of reciprocity, but that was rejected by hon. members opposite, in spite of the fact that South Africa is a participant in the Paris International Convention on Patents and is obliged to exercise reciprocity, as pointed out in a memorandum submitted in 1961 by the Secretary for Agriculture. I refer to the memorandum in regard to this proposed legislation. The Paris Convention, of which South Africa is a member, provides that co-signatories, of whom there are 59, will not discriminate against member countries but will afford their citizens equal rights and privileges in so far as industrial as well as plant patents are concerned. It says in the report that the Department is strongly opposed to this requirement since it allows any member of the Convention to patent plants in South Africa, even though provision for patenting plants does not exist in such a country itself. It was realized at once that in these circumstances the proposed enactment would not be in the interests of South Africa, but such an advanced stage had been reached that the Department could do nothing in the matter. Surely it is obvious from this evidence given by the Department itself that the unilateral withdrawal of reciprocity by South Africa might mean a breach of international agreements, and all this, of course, has been known to the Department and to the Minister and yet it has not found a place in this Bill. I would like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention again to the serious consequences which might follow any breach of the Paris Convention, and the risk attaching to a unilateral breach of the convention by South Africa, which is especially unwise in the light of the present-day international animosity against South <span class="col_735-736" refersTo="page_0382"/>Africa. It would amount to a move to open up possibilities for discrimination against South Africa. I would draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this, and I feel it is important for the Minister to consider whether he can alter the relevant clause at a later stage. I may add that the S.A. Institute of Patent Agents through its president foresees this danger, and in a telegram they have warned that if Clause 6 as it stands now continues to find a place in this Bill without amendment it will make the adherence to the International Convention on Plant Breeders&#x2019; Rights impossible for South Africa. I know that it is considered&#x2014;we have had several reports on it&#x2014;that we should not be infringing international law, but there are certain bodies, including the S.A. Institute of Patent Agents, who feel that we might be doing this. I should like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this and ask him to investigate it, and if necessary, to consider amending the Bill.</p>

<p>I feel also that as far as this Bill is concerned there is a second point, in regard to Clause 3. Members on both sides are very much concerned with the manner in which this new Bill will be applied in practice. I know that the Department has experts available who can be consulted on technical matters, but it is a matter of vital importance that the Registrar, who will exercise the powers and carry out the functions assigned to him by this Bill, should be a man with a legal training. This is not included in the Bill as it stands. Such a man should have the training required for his post, and he can only have such training if he is a qualified lawyer or patent agent. I am sure the Minister realizes that the Registrar will have to make decisions in regard to contentious claims submitted to him and which were formerly adjudicated by the Registrar of Patents under the Patents Act of 1952. His decisions will have to do justice to the people concerned, including the plant breeders. He must be able to exercise all the powers granted to him by this Bill and he should not merely be an intermediary between the public and the departmental expert. The Bill already provides that any aggrieved person can appeal against the Registrar&#x2019;s decision to the hon. the Minister, who in turn will refer such an appeal to an appeal board consisting of three members presided over by a person appointed by the Minister on account of his knowledge of law. Therefore the Minister admits in this clause that the final decision should be given by a person versed in law, and such a person&#x2019;s training and knowledge will only be available on appeal, as appeals involve a great deal of delay and expenditure. While an appeal body is necessary, delays and extra costs should be reduced to the minimum by providing that the officer, the Registrar, who will administer the Bill, should be either a trained lawyer or a trained patents agent. I ask the Minister to give this his most serious consideration, because the whole success of this new Bill depends on the calibre of the men who administer the plant breeders&#x2019; rights. I feel that certain adjustments must be made to the Bill as it now stands, and we hope that the Minister in the Committee Stage will accept some of our amendments. The Bill itself, we hope will be an improvement. We hope that the decision not to incorporate these principles in the Patents Act of 1952 but rather to introduce a new Bill will, prove to be of benefit to South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I heartily welcome and support this Bill. Since listening to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) who has just sat down, I have became more convinced than ever that she and possibly the Opposition as such would like to consider Bills of this nature only from the point of view of lawyers. Even Bills such as this one which deals with the interests of the farmers are often considered from the legal point of view by hon. members of the Opposition while we on this side, and I specifically, wish to consider this Bill from the point of view of the interests of the farmers of South Africa. That is why I want to accept the Bill wholeheartedly as we have it before us, with the exception of the old Clause 24 to which so much objection has been taken.</p>

<p>In order to form an opinion in regard to this whole question of plant breeders&#x2019; rights, it may perhaps be necessary for us to bear in mind the principles that are fundamental to the whole doctrine of genetics. Before the Austrian monk, Mendel, developed his theories on genetics&#x2014;and it is a strange thing that it was a monk who expressed himself in regard to the doctrine of genetics, I always thought they were people who were not hereditary&#x2014;before he developed his theories on heredity, new plant varieties came into being mostly by chance. For example, an observant farmer once noticed that one branch of a particular fruit tree showed certain deviations. About 40 years ago a certain Mr. Page from Fransch Hoek noticed that one branch in an orchard of Inkoos peach trees bore fruit every year which ripened 14 days before the other peaches in the same orchard ripened. He then propagated that one branch by budding, that is to say, vegetative propagation, and in this way a new variety, Early Dawn peaches came into being. This only happened because a particular farmer and plant breeder was observant.</p>

<p>It is a fact in the plant world that by means of vegetative propagation one makes sure that the offspring are true to type, are similar to the parent plant, while this is not the case when one plants the seeds of those plants. We have quite a few examples of these chance new breeds that have come into being as a result of freaks of nature. I have already mentioned Early Dawn peaches. We also have Red Hanepoot, Red Groendruif, Myburgh-nartjies and so forth. I have already said that these varieties came into being as a result of freaks of nature. I do not mean that the hon. member opposite is also a freak of nature <span class="col_737-738" refersTo="page_0383"/>But these new breeds came into being as a result of freaks of nature.</p>

<p>A further source of new varieties was chance crossings. Some kinds of fruit are self-fertilizing; in other words, the pollen of a particular type of fruit fertilizes the pistil of that fruit and then forms fruit the seed of which is also in more or less true to the parent plant. Other kinds again need cross-pollination to become fertilized. Strangely enough, even in the case of self-fertilizing varieties, there may be minor deviations on the part of the offspring. For example, we have found that the famous Kakamas variety which caused quite a revolution in the fruit canning industry in South Africa, came into being from the Transvaal yellow clingstone peach, because the pips of those Transvaal clingstone peaches floated down in the Vaal River and were washed up on the agricultural small-holdings at Kakamas and Keimoes. They germinated there and started to grow and then all that was needed was for an enterprising expert plant-breeder, Professor Reinecke, to discover the good qualities of that type of peach. With the assistance of people throughout the country he collected plant material, amongst others, the material of this Kakamas tree which became the mother tree of the many famous Kakamas peaches that are well-known throughout the world to-day. In this way we were given the famous brothers, or perhaps the slightly less famous brothers, of the Kakamas peach&#x2014;the Keimoes, the Maluti and the Tokane. All of them were merely progeny of the Transvaal yellow clingstone peach and it was quite by chance that we came upon these new varieties. The same thing happened with the famous Boland peach which also came into being simply through the planting of the pips of other parent trees. These are all examples of chance new varieties that have been discovered by observant people.</p>

<p>When one has to deal with cross-pollination the field is wide open for the plant breeders because new kinds of plants can be bred by means of cross-pollination. If, for example, one plants the seeds of a cross-pollinated guava and one obtains 50 saplings from that one guava, one may easily find that one has 50 different varieties. All that one does then is simply to select the best of them and there you are: You have a few new varieties.</p>

<p>Cross-pollination is to-day the most valuable means that the plant breeder has to breed new plants. In the case of plants that are dependent upon cross-pollination the matter is reasonably simple. All that one does is to introduce the ripe seed from the stamens of the one variety into the ripe, receptive pistil of the other variety. Out of the mixture of widely differing progeny one then selects the most promising and in this way one has a few new varieties.</p>

<p>In the case of self-fertilizing plants the process is slightly more involved. Before the pollen is ripe enough to fertilize its own pistil one has to remove all the stamens and close the flowers so that no chance fertilization can take place. When the pistil is right for fertilizing, one places the desired stamen upon it. This is a strictly controlled breeding method which has been used by scientists for the past 50 or 60 years&#x2014;since the time that the monk Mendel developed his theories on genetics. But, as the hon. the Minister pointed out, it is a very gradual process. It can easily take from 15 to 20 years in the case of fruit, as the hon. member there also pointed out, in order to breed a new variety by this means and then to test it out thoroughly before it can be made available to the fruit farmer. But I want to point out that this is the only way in which to make new varieties available to our fruit industry, varieties that have been adapted to our South African conditions.</p>

<p>As far as the old Section 24 to which so much objection has been taken is concerned, in my opinion the days of the importing of promising new varieties are past because it is recognized generally in the fruit World to-day that one cannot breed a universally good type; one breeds a new good type for a very limited set of circumstances. For example, various kinds of grapes are cultivated at the viticultural research station of W&#x00FC;rtzburg on the Main River in Germany that are only intended for the Main Valley. Another research station breeds various types of grapes only for the Rhine Valley and a third one for the Moselle Valley. In this way every plant breeder breeds plants, trees and shrubs for a limited set of circumstances only. A universally good plant no longer exists and that is why it is not necessary for us to import universally good types for distribution amongst our fruit farmers. The reason for this is firstly that climatic differences reduce a very good type of plant that has been very successful in one part of the world to a hopeless failure in other parts of the world. The secret of the wonderful Kakamas family is precisely that it is so well adjusted to our warm, sunny climate. On the other hand, an overseas canning peach, the so-called Tuscan clingstone peach which is such a great success in California is a complete failure in this country. Why? For the simple reason that it has not been adjusted to our climatic conditions. The same thing holds good for such well-known overseas varieties as Duke of York peaches, Burbank plums and so forth. Mr. Speaker, I would like here to tell you a little story about the famous Burbank plums. That well-known Californian fruit breeder, Luther Burbank, bred a large variety of different kinds of fruit and when eventually he bred this wonder plum, he gave it his own name. About 40 years ago the fruit farmers of this country also imported this wonder plum and I would like to ask whether there is one hon. member here to-day who has ever heard of a Burbank plum? It disappeared completely because that wonder plum of Luther Burbank was a complete failure here in South Africa. I think that this holds good for most of the so-called universally <span class="col_739-740" refersTo="page_0384"/>good varieties that are cultivated in various parts of the world. No wonder too, that the leading fruit-producing countries in the world to-day are breeding intensively for their various climatic regions only. I want this afternoon to pay tribute to our Departments of Agriculture and particularly to the one man who has performed absolute miracles in this sphere. I am referring to Mr. Lourens Steyn of the Western Province Fruit Research Station, a man who has bred a large variety of new kinds of fruit-trees and has made them available to us, plants that are fully adjusted to our South African conditions. For example, he bred two new types of strawberries&#x2014;Klara-dyn and Festival&#x2014;that are better than anything in the world to-day. There was a very famous strawberry in Germany, the Sonyana, of which the breeder was very proud. It was imported into South Africa and was a complete failure here. But these varieties, Klara-dyn and Festival, were bred at Bien Donne, Groot Drakenstein, and these strawberries are considered on the Covent Garden Market in London, to-day to be amongst the best in the world. Furthermore, from the hands of that same research worker we have had Culem-borg, Swellengrebel and Van Riebeeck dessert peaches that are absolutely outstanding. I would go so far as to say that a man who has not yet eaten a Van Riebeeck peach has not yet tasted a delicious peach. They have been bred by this particular fruit breeder connected with the fruit research station at Stellenbosch. He also successfully bred the following canning varieties: Oom Sarel, Professor Black, Professor Neethling, Professor Malherbe and Walgant. These are all some of the very best peaches that the canning industry has ever had. I have only mentioned the types that have already been released and made available to the farmers, but there is still a whole series of peach, plum, apple, pear and apricot varieties that have already been bred but which have not yet been tested before being released. I want to go so far as to say that the fruit farmers of South Africa will one day erect a monument to this research worker, this fruit breeder who has done such a surprising amount to cultivate adaptable varieties, not wonder varieties that will perform miracles throughout the whole world, but varieties that are performing miracles in South Africa, varieties that are so adjusted to our climatic conditions that they can be produced profitably because their production per unit is high and because their quality is superb.</p>

<p>I come now to the second reason why I feel that the old Section 24 should fall away and why we do not need it in this legislation, and that is the question of plant diseases and insect pests. In this we are dealing with what is actually the greatest danger.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member should rather discuss the details of the clause during the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>With all respect, Mr. Speaker, that clause is not in the Bill. The reason why we must be so careful to cultivate our own varieties here is because certain varieties are more susceptible to plant diseases than others are. One finds immune varieties, less immune varieties and susceptible varieties and because we still have to deal with a number of varieties that are not immune to plant diseases, we use a large variety of poisons to combat those diseases. Doctor Douw G. Steyn, the well-known toxicologist, stated only the other week that the South African fruit farmer uses far more poisonous substances per unit of production than any other fruit-producing country in the world. This is the case because we have to deal with a number of varieties that are not immune to disease. It is so necessary for us to breed and make available plant varieties that are immune to disease and insect pests. That is precisely what our research workers are doing and I want this afternoon to say a very big thank you to the hon. the Minister for the wonderful work that his research stations are doing in this connection.</p>

<p>It may be argued that our division of Plant Control and Quarantine should ensure that these diseases are not imported into the country together with new varieties, but that is not as simple as it sounds. Climatic conditions may, for example, cause certain varieties which are not susceptible to certain diseases overseas, to be susceptible to specific diseases in South Africa. I want to mention a few examples. In California there is a particular apple, Beverley Hills, which is immune to &#x201C;fire blight&#x201D;&#x2014;this is a virus disease. But three years after some of those Beverley Hills apple trees had been imported into this country and planted at our quarantine station at Rose-bank, it was discovered that this variety was susceptible to that virus disease in South Africa. The same thing happened with a few kinds of grapes that were imported by the Department in 1952&#x2014;Calmeria and Cardinal. These two varieties which had proved particularly promising in California were imported into South Africa and planted under glass at Bien Donne. When it appeared after two years that they were apparently immune to virus diseases and other diseases, they were given to five selected registered plant breeders in the Paarl-Wellington-Fransch Hoek area to be tested out of doors. Only after they had been planted on the lands did it appear that they were susceptible to a particular virus disease. They were not susceptible to those virus diseases in California nor were they apparently susceptible to those virus diseases when in quarantine, but as soon as they were planted outdoors and were exposed to our sunny climatic conditions, that virus infection struck them. That is why it is not so simple for our quarantine stations to ensure that quarantine measures are applied and that those diseases are not imported. Our country is today simply riddled with plant diseases that have been imported with new varieties of <span class="col_741-742" refersTo="page_0385"/>plants and that is why it is so necessary for this legislation to be placed on the Statute Book in order to enable us to cultivate our own disease-resisting varieties and to stop the spread of those diseases from other countries to South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we are dealing with machinery it is very easy to apply the provisions of the Patents Act because a machine will not develop a fault in South Africa that it has not had in America. But a live plant reacts very differently and that is why we need a law that is different to the Patents Act&#x2014;this Plant Breeders&#x2019; Rights Bill&#x2014;to protect our plant breeders and to protect our farmers in South Africa. I want to appeal to hon. members of the Opposition not to insist upon the insertion of the old Section 24.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I think, after having heard the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan), one realizes why it was so instructive and pleasant to serve on the Select Committee. Our representatives on the Select Committee tended to look at this matter from the legal angle, and there are undoubtedly most interesting facts to learn from the farming world&#x2014;as we have heard here to-day from the hon. member for Paarl and as we heard from him on the Select Committee as well. We appreciate that very much. But in other respects too, as one can imagine having listened to the speech of the hon. member for Paarl, not to mention the speech of the hon. member for Nelspruit (Mr. Faurie), the select committee did throw quite a lot of light on the Bill. Many of the suggestions and amendments put forward by the Select Committee have been accepted and incorporated in the Bill. I think the Select Committee did also gain an appreciation&#x2014;I think it was an eye-opener&#x2014;of the size of the problem that one was tackling, and of the size of the subject that one was dealing with here. It is not surprising, therefore, that while improvements have been effected, quite a few important differences between the two sides could not be resolved on the Select Committee.</p>

<p>Sir, we certainly greatly welcome the encouragement that this Bill affords to farmers and breeders to invest capital and to take time and trouble to develop new varieties and breeds of one kind and another, and for that reason we strongly support that aspect of this measure. I think, therefore, we can fairly say that although our representatives on this Select Committee viewed this matter from the legal angle also, we saw it very much from the farmers&#x2019; point of view. Where the Patents Act only gave protection where plants were propagated vegetatively, this measure gives protection and encouragement where the plants are propagated in other ways, for example by bulbs or seeds.</p>

<p>Indeed it is our concern that the greatest possible impetus should be given to improve methods, seeds and plants, that leads us to our first difference with the other side. In other words, we believe that it should be freely open to our farming population to obtain what is best from overseas. That is what we do in the animal kingdom and in other fields, and we believe that this measure will limit that right and perhaps reduce it to a certain extent. If we had fears in that regard they were increased by what the hon. members for Nelspruit and Paarl said: Because, in discussing the old Section 24, they both indicated that they foresaw dangers in introducing new varieties from overseas. For example, the hon. member for Paarl spoke of the sicknesses which were introduced by plants coming from overseas. I think the suggestion was, that, if we keep them out, we will be doing ourselves and our own agriculture a good service. Sir, I believe that they are mistaken. First of all, the very fact that he could quote to us so many cases of fruit types and other types of plants which had been imported and tried out here, shows, I think, how eagerly our farmers do in fact seek to improve their crops and their seeds. And I have little doubt that against these failures which he could mention we can set off many successes. Where he speaks of sicknesses, I have the fullest confidence in the Department that they will be able to devise quarantine methods which are quite able to cope with any sicknesses which may occur. Indeed I am told that plants are kept in quarantine for very long periods for that very purpose.</p>

<p>As I say, the speech of the hon. member for Nelspruit, too, indicated that he felt that because of the omission of Section 24 there would be some barrier on the importation of plants. We, on the other hand, feel that the limitations in Clause 6 of this Bill to offer protection to plants which originate outside the Republic will likewise have a limiting effect on the importation of valuable varieties. We say that for this reason: Whereas at the present time an American, for example, with a fine variety can patent it, can bring it here, and can gain by his discovery because it sells well here. That may well be threatened if overseas people cannot get protection for their new varieties, and consequently those varieties. I believe, will not become available here as much as one would like. Indeed the hon. the Minister in his speech referred to the fact that 80 new plants had been patented under the Patents Act which had come from outside South Africa and only eight from inside South Africa. We would gladly see those figures reversed; we would be very glad to see a very large number patented here. Bearing in mind our relatively small population and the great population outside one must expect more discoveries to be made outside. One would be loathe to see those new discoveries not introduced here because of a side-effect of this Bill.</p>

<p>So I join with what the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) said, that we believe Clause 6 will not only have the effect of keeping out plants and fruit types that can be of value to us, but that it does indeed amount to a breach of our obligations under the Paris Convention. If it is true that it is a breach of <span class="col_743-744" refersTo="page_0386"/>those obligations it could very well be that there will be a chain reaction against us. We are very keen to see that possibility eliminated. It was for that reason that the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) foreshadowed our attempt to get this important amendment accepted when he indicated that he wanted all the best sources available, including sources from overseas, for our farmers.</p>

<p>The other point that I should like to touch on concerns the question of the right of appeal to the courts. This was a matter which we raised in the Select Committee and did our best in that friendly body to get accepted, but failed. We hope that it may yet prove acceptable and I should like to give some instances to this House shortly. It is agreed on both sides that very valuable rights are given or withheld under this Bill, and indeed that very valuable rights of other people are affected by what is given or withheld under this Bill. Where this occurs under the Patents Act there is this right of recourse to the courts. It is said that this question is so technical that the courts will not understand it. But I ask hon. members: Is this more technical than a normal patent involving the most complicated machinery, chemicals and all other kind of matters with which the courts deal most successfully daily? Admittedly a special procedure is devised whereby they have the benefit of expert evidence and the advantage of expert assessors; but that could be made available in this case. Consequently you will have this right, which can be of the greatest importance, being watched over by the courts. Nobody in my experience goes more readily to court for a decision than do our farming community, and in no section of our community is there greater confidence in our courts than in that community. I do not believe that they have been deterred by the costs in the past. If indeed the matter is a puny matter, counsel and they themselves will not resort to the court but settle it out of court or in some other way. So I do hope that here too, the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to bringing this Bill into line with the Patents Act.</p>

<p>Various plant rights which at present are protected under the Patents Act are now to be protected under the Plant Breeders&#x2019; Act. It is represented, and I think very fairly, that it is a more convenient method of giving this protection. There is no suggestion that the plants that have hitherto enjoyed the protection of the Patents Act were not perfectly well dealt with by the courts. It is not suggested that this resort to the courts has proved too costly in the case of plants where it has not in other cases.</p>

<p>This side of the House has raised these few questions and indicated that they were giving us considerable difficulty, the question of limiting the right of protection to plants with their origin in the Republic and, secondly, the absence in this Bill of the right of recourse to the courts. Accordingly we shall move, in the Committee Stage, for an instruction hoping thereby to place the hon. the Minister in a position to remedy those two matters which could be said to be blemishes so that we can have a Bill which gives the encouragement that is wanted and indeed gives greater encouragement; and provides the best possible forum to decide any difficulties that may arise.</p>

<p>Before I say what I want to say about the Bill, I just want to put a small matter right. I just want to tell the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) that the Kakamas peach is really a Free State yellow peach. That peach was cultivated along the Orange River and it eventually reached Kakamas.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we have probably come to the end of the debate. It has been explained in detail how important it is that we should have new plants either by means of breeding or selection. We are living at a time when there is keen competition in the world. We are also living at a time when the economy of every branch of our farming industry has to be considered. The hon. member for Paarl has already, in a very able manner, told us what it had cost to produce these new varieties either by means of selection or breeding.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that it is not only necessary for us to have a good canning peach in the canning industry but we should also have varieties that will prolong the canning period. The canning factories use manual labour and if that period is short it simply means that their production costs are so much higher. That was why they tried in the past, and they succeeded in it, to produce varieties by means of selection and breeding which did not ripen at the same time. The canning period has consequently been considerably extended. I shall not enlarge any further on this aspect. I think we are all aware of the fact that we should produce new plants and new varieties.</p>

<p>I want to return to this point whether the encouragement to the breeders and the growers should lie in this that they should patent their new plants under the Patents Act or under this new Plant Breeders&#x2019; Rights Act. I must really congratulate the hon. the Minister and his Department on once again having taken the lead in the world by placing an Act on the Statute Book which is the only one of its kind. Various speakers have told us that you cannot patent a plant. When you design a cold drink top which has characteristics which no cold drink top has in the world and you patent that and you sell it anywhere, even in the North Pole, it will retain all its characteristics. In other words, you patent it and you can consequently tell the world that you have a top that will always retain its characteristics. But, as the hon. member for Paarl, has explained clearly, you cannot do that in the case of a plant. The South African nation has <span class="col_745-746" refersTo="page_0387"/>really been exploited in the past in respect of plants that were imported into the country. People who were anxious to improve their gardens or nurseries were really deceived. They paid exorbitant prices for those plants without getting the value for their money. The simple reason is that a plant is not a machine; it is not something dead; it is something that breathes, that eats and that is influenced by climatic conditions. That is why I want to congratulate the Minister and his Department which was responsible for the drafting of this Bill on once again having shown the world that we at the southern tip of Africa know what must be done and what ought to be done. I predict that England who tried to pass similar legislation, as the hon. member for Germiston (District) has already told us, will come to South Africa and ask us to let them have our Act so that they can see how to draft theirs. That is why I am proud to know that we in South Africa need not be ashamed of ourselves but that we can give the lead in the world. I support the Bill wholeheartedly. I believe the breeders and the growers will rejoice about this Bill.</p>

<p>I just want to deal briefly with the remark made by the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) namely that they would have liked to see this Bill cast in the same mould at the Patents Act and that when anybody wanted to appeal he could appeal to the courts. As you know, Mr. Speaker, we farmers do not like the courts. We fight shy of the courts; what must we do there? Our place is with the Department of Agriculture and with the Minister of Agriculture. The constitution of that board has now been changed in such a way that somebody with legal knowledge will be the chairman; an official of the Department will be the second member and somebody who is an expert, somebody who knows the commodity concerned, will be the third member. I really believe that the dissatisfied breeder will receive fair and just treatment at the hands of that appeal board.</p>

<p>Once again my hearty congratulations to the Minister. I conclude by saying that we on this side of the House fully support the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) who has just sat down said more or less what appears in the report of the Select Committee. As a member of the farming group on this side of the House I just want to say that I feel this is a Bill which we can support wholeheartedly. When we think of the development that is taking place in South Africa to-day in the field of gardening, agriculture and so forth, and we think of the total income of our agricultural industry, we realize that this is the most important section of our agricultural industry. So much so that an official of the Department of Agricultural Economy and Marketing said recently that there would in all probability be an explosion in the fruit-growing industry in the Western Cape Province in the years to come. So much is already being done in regard to the fruit-growing industry, it is already contributing so much to the total income of our agricultural industry, that you can definitely not ignore it. In other words, just as the breeder assisted to improve our animal stock, as he assisted to improve our cattle and sheep industry in this country, so I also believe that by means of selection and wise breeding and a dedicated desire to improve our plants and trees it is essential for us to place this legislation on the Statute Book to-day.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the Bill I just want to say that I found it strange that the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) should tell us to-day that he personally thinks it is no longer necessary to import new varieties into South Africa. The thought immediately occurred to me whether, when Jan van Riebeeck landed here, the vineyards in the Paarl and Stellenbosch valleys were already there? Were the orange groves of Citrusdal already there? Was the lowveld in the Eastern Transvaal already as developed as it is to-day? Is all the progress we have made in South Africa in our fruit and plant industry not due to the assistance we got from overseas? If the hon. member is no longer in favour of our benefiting by it when they produce good varieties overseas, why does he not apply the same principle to the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) who may want to import a pedigree Friesland bull from overseas? Does the hon. member not know that we have a type of wheat called &#x201C;sokkie&#x201D; (sock). Does the hon. member not know how it got that name? Does he not know that a professor from the University of Stellenbosch brought a few grains of that variety into the country by hiding them in his sock? Is the progress we have made in our wheatgrowing industry not precisely due to the fact that we had the support of the world outside? If we can benefit by varieties produced overseas why should we not gain by the experience of those people? We do not accept those varieties as such. They are brought to South Africa, they are adapted and new varieties are bred, varieties which have been adapted to conditions in South Africa. With the passage of time we accept those varieties as our own and they make an important contribution to our agricultural industry. The hon. member is a fruitgrower but he must apply the same principle in the fruit-growing industry which the stock farmers apply to-day and that is to try to get the best of what is bred by people overseas.</p>

<p>You can accept, Sir, that all breeders of plants and trees are to a certain extent also growers, but you cannot accept that all growers of trees, shrubs and plants are breeders as well. Those people are now given the encouragement in this legislation to do the necessary research and to do the necessary experiments in order to breed improved plants and shrubs and trees. I think everyone in this House must approve of it that those people are given the right to exercise their rights and to register their products. That is why we do <span class="col_747-748" refersTo="page_0388"/>not differ from hon. members opposite as far as the principle of the Bill is concerned. We want to assist so that the breeders of fruit, of vegetables and varieties of wheat will in particular produce a product that will be of still further benefit to our agricultural industry in future.</p>

<p>I know it is a fact that many fruit farmers order thousands of shrubs, trees etc. every year. But how many of them have the assurance that the advertisements and propaganda which precede the sale of such a variety will in due course pay dividends? In other words, that it will produce the fruit it is predicted to produce, because there is no yardstick that you can apply as there is, for instance, in the case of the cattle of the hon. member for Cradock where he can say a cow delivers three or six gallon per day. That is not the case when it comes to the fruit farmer. You must have some kind of control, however, so as to be sure that the product you are going to put into the soil will indeed produce what it is predicted to produce. Because there is no registration to-day, because those people do not have certain rights, the farmer must to-day depend on the breeder who conducts the most effective advertising campaign. If these people can be registered as breeders so that you know that the grower is using the product of the breeder the farmer will, to a great extent, have the assurance that the product he buys will very nearly produce the ideal product he is aiming at. In other words, he will be assured that there will always be an improvement; it will not be necessary for him merely to depend on the advertisements of the breeder or grower on the packets or in the newspapers.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>As a result of this legislation the farmer will to a great extent be protected. He will be protected because he will know that the tree or variety of grain or whatever he buys from a certain grower comes from a good breeder and that it has already been experimented with for a long time and that it will produce the desired product. That is how it will protect the farmer indirectly.</p>

<p>I want to raise two matters which, I think, will affect the stock farmers of South Africa in particular. The one is the question of lucerne. We know that lucerne is still the most important stock feed in this country to-day. We also know that they are doing research work at Grootfontein. We know they are experimenting with various varieties, varieties that will be eminently suited to dryland conditions. The lucerne seed we know is very well suited to land under irrigation; it produces excellent results; there are no complaints in that regard. But I think a great deal can still be done for those parts of the country where they go in for extensive farming to produce a variety of lucerne in South Africa that can be cultivated in drought conditions, in dryland conditions. If we can do that, Mr. Speaker, I believe we shall be making a great contribution to the promotion of our stock breeding industry and we shall also be doing a great deal, not only to increase the carrying capacity of our soil, but also to protect ourselves against the drought conditions which we experience regularly from time to time. That is why I welcome this Bill for one reason in particular, namely, that it will encourage our people, not only the department which is already doing its work, to produce varieties of lucerne which can be grown, not only where the land is irrigated, but also in the drought stricken areas and in dryland conditions.</p>

<p>I also believe that we should be able to grow a type of prickly pear in this country which is not only thornless, we already have that type, but which can be grown in all those parts of South Africa where they go in for extensive farming. That will greatly assist our stockfarming industry. I feel that there is much room for research in this respect. Because this Bill will protect the rights of the plant breeders, I think more research will be done in due course and that the necessary encouragement will be there in the two respects I have mentioned, research that will greatly benefit the stockfarming industry and the Karoo farmer in the country.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>We are pleased that this Bill has been so well received as far as the general principle is concerned. The Select Committee also found, after a very thorough investigation had been instituted by the Department, that it enjoyed the general support of the breeders and of those concerned. There are a few points, however, on which the Opposition and this side of the House obviously still differ. I refer to the point raised a moment ago by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), namely, research in respect of lucerne. Suppose a young farmer or anybody else is encouraged, as this legislation will encourage him, to show enterprise and he ultimately succeeds in producing such a lucerne seed; but before he is successful somebody comes from overseas and registers such a seed in this country. What is the position of that person then? You see, Mr. Speaker, that is where we always differ from the Opposition. We are anxious to encourage our own people and when they produce results we want to give them preference and the benefit of their enterprising spirit. That was also the aspect on which we differed in the Select Committee. Did we or did we not have to make the mistake of not allowing any plants to be imported? The question is whether those plants can be registered under this legislation. Let me again give the example which we have already had, namely, that of roses. Roses have been imported in great quantities and registered under the Patents Act. Those flowers were exhibited at shows, they made a wonderful impression on people and they were then sent into the veld. The result was that it became evident that they simply could not stand up to our climatic conditions and diseases. The public suffered severe losses in <span class="col_749-750" refersTo="page_0389"/>consequence. In other words, we are now taking steps, in the first place, to give our own people the benefit of their enterprising spirit and to breed plants which can be grown here on the same basis as we did in the case of our factories, for example. We protect our own factories, our own people, until they are strong enough. The same principle is applied in this Bill, namely, to stimulate the enterprising spirit of our own people to try to breed new plants and then to let them enjoy the benefit, for a certain period, of their discoveries. As far as this point is concerned, we differ in principle from the Opposition, particularly after what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) and the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) have said.</p>

<p>Let me just refer to one other point which was raised in connection with the Paris Convention. The Select Committee went thoroughly into the matter and they obtained legal opinion as to whether this legislation would have any adverse affect on the Paris Convention. The reply was short and to the point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reply to the above-mentioned contention is that Article 2 of the Convention obviously does not apply to plant breeders&#x2019; rights as envisaged in the above-mentioned Bill.</block>

<p>That answers the whole problem raised by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North.)</p>

<p>I just want to refer to one other point and that is the legal position. We know our people and as far as the registration of plant breeders&#x2019; rights is concerned and the legal procedure to be followed&#x2014;the time factor and the costs involved&#x2014;those are such that it is clear that our people will not avail themselves of that right in the circumstances. That is why you want to make it as easy as possible and the procedure as simple as possible. Hence the steps we are now taking. It is correct, as the hon. member has said, that this is complicated legislation but that does not mean that the courts cannot give judgment on such matter. Where we are dealing with the development and breeding of new plants you want people present who are experts when a decision is made because it is a complicated process. That is why we shall need people with a personal knowledge of this type of undertaking. That is why it is stated in this way.</p>

<p>We are grateful that the second reading of this Bill, at least, has been accepted in this spirit.</p>

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move an amendment for the purpose of clarifying the intention of this Bill. The amendment is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 26, after &#x201C;supplied&#x201D; to add &#x201C;but does not include service rendered by an employee to an employer or service rendered by any professional person to a client or patient of such professional person&#x201D;.</block>

<p>We on this side of the House cannot believe that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to interfere with the wages and salaries of our workers and salaried people through the machinery of price control. Therefore, when we come to put the machinery for price control permanently on our Statute Book, we should examine the mischief of the proposed law very carefully indeed. The original measure flowing from our War Measures had a specific object which is not the object of this Bill. The object originally was to control prices when they tended to rise rapidly and get out of hand as a result of scarcities created by the situation of war. But to-day we do not face a situation where there are artificial scarcities caused by the fact that production is diverted to other purposes than the production of consumer goods. The position we have to-day is that there is a danger of prices rising in South Africa because of inflation. We had one speech after the other from the other side, including the hon. Minister&#x2019;s referring to the fact that in their opinion (and I think quite rightly) South Africa has entered a period of expansion. For that reason there is a tendency for the creeping inflation that we have known for many years to move a little bit faster. Every one that spoke on the other side indicated that for that reason they were keen to have our price control machinery permanently established in the statute law of our country. They do not realize that price control by itself cannot control an inflationary situation. If you control the price of a commodity against the fact that the cost of production of that commodity is rising and has risen, you come to a stage after wards where price control has to give way and allow increases, as is happening under the present price control <span class="col_751-752" refersTo="page_0390"/>regulations. If price control does not give way, you find that people find it unprofitable to produce the commodity in question and production of it ceases; or dealings in that commodity are translated to the black market&#x2014;a vicious situation which I am quite sure nobody wishes to see in South Africa.</p>

<p>One way in which price control could be used to restrict a rise in the cost of production would be that the price control machinery were used to force wages down. I admit at once&#x2014;I would not like the argument to come from the other side&#x2014;that wages are fixed by other legislative means, by our Industrial Conciliation Act, and by our Wage Act, but the fact is that in an inflationary period such as we are experiencing at the moment, most wages are well above those determined under the Wage Act or those agreed upon under our machinery for collective bargaining. When I was in Johannesburg last, I found for instance that in the building industry most wages were 20 to 25 per cent above those agreed upon under the industrial agreement. In such circumstances other machinery can be used to reduce wages to a lower level than would be normal when your consider the rule of supply and demand in that industry. So we on this side of the House would ask the hon. Minister please to consider accepting this amendment of ours. This is one of the things that we were very keen to thrash out in a select committee, but that is not possible now. So I do hope that the hon. Minister will give this his favourable consideration, because I do want to remove any suspicion, I want to remove any doubts about this matter; we do not want to create the impression that we want to embody in our statute something which can militate against the workers and the salaried people of South Africa. And I want to warn the hon. Minister that if he leaves this as it is, pressure will come upon him and his Department and upon the Government to restrict increases in wages. It has been the experience in other countries, especially older countries in the world, that when there is an attempt to control inflation and rising prices, the attempts to control are resisted by commerce and by industry on the grounds that they are under pressure to increase wages, and if wages are increased these increases have to be passed onto the consumer. So they say to the authorities: The only way that you can help us to restrain prices is to control wages and salaries and in that way a real danger arises that price control may be enlisted by interested parties, or that attempts may be made to enlist price control, in order to control wages and salaries. I am sure the Government will consider this amendment in the spirit in which it is moved, namely to remove doubts, and&#x2014;now that we are making this a permanent part of our law&#x2014;to clarify the intention of the authorities completely so that there can be no misunderstanding. I shall be shocked if this amendment is refused. I also hope that the hon. Minister will not cause me and other people who are sincere in their approach in this matter to have suspicions about the intentions of the Government.</p>

<p>A similar argument applies in the case of professional services. There are other people here who are better qualified to speak on this, but our professions are already, through their own organizations, honourable organizations subject to control. I think for example of the medical profession, a profession whose charges very often hurt a man of average means when he has illness in his family; the fact is that the cost of the practitioner&#x2019;s services is, according to the Snyman Commission, only about 20 per cent of the total cost of medical services. If we find that those services are too high, the answer is not to approach the matter through the price controller, but to approach them through social measures by assisting the ordinary family man to meet those medical costs. That is why we keep on pleading for schemes of medical aid in South Africa.</p>

<p>There is one point on both these aspects of my amendment that I want to deal with quickly. It may be argued that it is not the intention of this Bill to include services in the sense of employer-employee relationship at all, that they have not been included in the years that we have had these regulations. But the only definition of &#x201C;service&#x201D; in the Bill is a definition which includes something which is an addition to the normal meaning of &#x201C;service&#x201D;. That means that in accordance with our rules of interpretation we must accept that the word &#x201C;service&#x201D; as used in this Bill has the meaning which normal usage ascribes to it. I have taken the trouble to go through various dictionaries I have got the concise &#x201C;Oxford Dictionary&#x201D; here, because it is the easiest one to handle they are all in accordance on this point and I find that one of the primary definitions of &#x201C;service&#x201D;, certainly the only definition that can be applied to &#x201C;service&#x201D; as it is used in this Bill, is the following: &#x201C;What an employee or subordinate is bound to,&#x201D; and then &#x201C;work done or doing of work on behalf of an employer by an employee&#x201D;. So quite obviously, Sir, in the normal use of the English language and the normal use of the Afrikaans language &#x201C;service&#x201D; means exactly what we want to exclude from this Bill. I hope sincerely, in the interest of clarity, to avoid confusion and to avoid possible future abuse of this Bill when it becomes law, that the Minister will seriously consider accepting this amendment.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that I agree with the hon. member that this measure is not intended to control inflation. You cannot control inflation with a measure such as this. Inflation has to be controlled by other means. But you can control some of the effects of inflation by a measure of this kind, and of course your measure is designed to control rising prices even in times when there is no inflation. I also agree with the hon. member that it is not the intention of this <span class="col_753-754" refersTo="page_0391"/>Bill to give us the power to control wages and salaries, nor professional services. That has never been the case and it is not the intention now that this Bill should control the fees of doctors and attorneys, etc. Just to show that that is not the intention, I am quite prepared to accept the amendment of the hon. member in spirit, but I have not yet had the opportunity to put it to the legal advisers, and there is some question of course in regard to who is &#x201C;a professional person&#x201D; under the law. So I am prepared to consider the amendment in the spirit in which it had been put in the Other Place. In the meantime I will then put it to the legal advisers and then introduce an amendment in the Other Place.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

</speech>

<p>With leave of the Committee, the amendment proposed by Mr. S. J. M. Steyn was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Clause, as printed, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 8,</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 8 gives the controller the right to do three things: (1) To demand that the person selling goods whose prices have been fixed at a maximum, shall give the buyer an invoice; (2) that he shall retain that invoice for a specific period; and (3) that the buyer himself shall retain the invoice which he has received.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the light of the fact that business operations to-day differ considerably from what they were 20 years ago when the original war measures were introduced, it is possible that this clause may give rise to some real difficulties. Let us assume for example that the price is fixed of a simple commodity like coffee if the seller is required to give an invoice and retain it, and the buyer is required to keep that invoice, it will be an impossible situation. Many of the stores do not give invoices to-day. Invoices in the cash business is a thing of the past; the mechanization in modern commerce is such that most things are done by machines. I do not know how this is going to be implemented. The hon. Minister may tell us that the purpose of this particular clause is on a much narrower front and that it will only be applicable to large contracts or sales of commodities which run into a large amount of money, but it also may be that the controller to make certain that price control is being adhered to, might find it necessary to utilize the provisions of this section, and frankly I cannot see how it can be implemented under the modern methods of business as we know them to-day. We would like to hear from the hon. Minister just what is intended by this particular clause on the wider front and how it will be applied.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<p>The intention merely is to make price control more effective. It says: &#x201C;The controller may,&#x201D; and &#x201C;when the controller regards it as advisable, in certain circumstances he can require the buyer also to retain an invoice&#x201D;. It is only to make the control more effective. This clause has worked in the past and it has never been difficult to implement. The hon. member should go back to the regulations that were passed and he will find that the same thing appears in these regulations and we have never experienced any difficulties. So I do not see why they should be unworkable in future.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to ask the hon. Minister to consider the position of a particular commodity in the category of foodstuffs, let us say tea, being in short supply, the price of this particular commodity then being raised without the knowledge of the price controller at a certain stage, but with the full knowledge of members of the public who buy it every day, say through the supermarkets or the chain stores. The point which the hon. member for Parktown made would then be relevant in this way&#x2014;that when you buy goods in a supermarket, especially in the self-service stores, you enter at a turnstile (I do not know whether the hon. Minister is aware of the procedure) and having selected your goods at random as it were, from thousands of different items which are on display, and then having included in that selection, say, a pound of tea, you then leave at another turnstile where by mechanical means the total is worked out on a slip of paper which is handed to you, without any reference whatsoever to any one of these commodities that you have purchased&#x2014;maybe 30 articles. You pay the full amount, and then you exit. I say that since this type of outlet is responsible, certainly in the foodstuffs business, for a very large proportion of the entire turnover in a particular commodity throughout the country, the fact that these regulations worked in the past does not mean that he can possibly expect an invoice to be issued for a specific item in respect of which the price controller has reason to suspect there is overcharging, whilst he has no clue at all as to what is being charged. I doubt whether he will get the co-operation of the public to the extent that the person concerned, knowing that he has entered a supermarket, knowing that no invoice is available to him, will say that he is not going to buy that one item there at all; that for that one item, he would go to another store in order to obtain the required invoice, and thus be able to prove an overcharge. Would the hon. Minister kindly explain how in terms of the modern and mechanized methods of accounting for a purchase, especially in the field of the supermarket, the chain store and the self-service store, which are mushrooming all over the country it is anticipated that this particular provision in regard to the issuing of an invoice, the retention of a copy by the seller and the purchaser, can possibly be applied?</p>

<p>Why is he arguing against it then? If he has an alternative one to suggest, we can consider it, Sir, but he does not suggest an alternative; he is just opposed to the clause. What he is really doing is to ask that a certain section of the people should not be subject to this price control, namely, those people who run self-service shops, because, as he says, it will make their position impossible. But when prices are fixed everybody must observe that price fixation. This clause has been drafted in such a way as to make price fixation effective. The hon. the Minister has just said that, but I do not think it has registered with the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel). If the hon. member has anything to suggest how price control can be made effective, also in the case of self-service shops, we shall be pleased to hear it. I know of no better method than to get one person to write down what he charged the other for an article and that the other person should have proof of what he paid for it. Those, in the long run, Sir, are the two sheet anchors of any purchase contract and that is what is laid down here. The fact that it will cause a little difficulty to those who sell articles which are subject to price control, is just unfortunate. When there is price control everybody is subject to it, and by virtue of what fact should these self-service shops not be subject to it? By virtue of what fact can they plead that it will be impossible for them to observe the law in this way? I should like to know that from the hon. member for Hospital. No virtue attaches to them which makes them different from ordinary people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>The last speaker really must be living in the ages when there were &#x201C;smouse&#x201D; going round selling various things. The self-service store to-day is something that means so much in modern life, but the hon. member does not seem to have any idea of the position. The fact remains that invoices are not made up by the buyer, and the net result of that has been greater convenience for the public and a reduction in the cost of handling those goods, which in turn means a reduction in the price to the consumer. We asked for this Bill to go before a select committee. This is one of the reasons. You cannot interfere with modern methods that have been brought into being to bring down prices and increase efficiency. Does the convenience of the public mean nothing to the hon. member for Standerton? Does the reduction of costs mean nothing to the hon. member? I can well understand with that at the back of his mind, why the hon. member voted against our suggestion that the Bill should go to a select committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Until the hon. member for Standerton spoke I could perhaps have looked at this clause as something that the hon. Minister needed to protect the situation. But after listening to the hon. member for Standerton, what we were afraid of has now become very definite and clear. He has now told this House very simply that in so far as the chain stores and the self-service stores are concerned, they must just fall in line. I accept that. They are in business and if there is a law then everybody must obey the law. But what about the buyer? What the hon. member for Standerton is saying in this House is that if the price controller in terms of this particular clause says that a seller must give an invoice and the purchaser must keep an invoice, every single purchaser has got to keep his invoice for a time to be determined by the price controller. It simply means this that we as the buyers of products in this country, if necessity arises for serious price control under circumstances none of us can foresee at the moment, are going to have to demand an invoice for everything we buy, are going to have to keep that invoice for a specific period, and when we are asked for an invoice by an inspector, we have to produce that invoice. Nobody knows when an inspector is going to ask for an invoice. It is a farcical situation that in modern trading where people are buying more and more for cash, a person can be required not only (a) to give an invoice, but (b) a purchaser to keep an invoice. The situation has been highlighted very clearly by the hon. member for Standerton. I would have been prepared to say no more about it after the explanation given by the hon. Minister, but after the hon. member for Standerton has spoken, and I must bear in mind that the hon. member for Standerton is one of the economists on the Government side, the thing has been put in the right perspective. We now know what to expect and if it should be necessary to implement this clause, every buyer of a commodity in this country is going to be faced with the situation that he will have to be a storer of invoices and somebody who will be able to advise the price controller or his officials what he has paid for a particular product. I submit that it is a completely untenable situation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) addressed two questions to me. I am not offended by the fact that, as usual, he poured his sarcasm on what I had said. In effect he tells me that I must do something that he should have done in the first place, which is to come forward with a measure which is workable. After all the hon. Minister has the &#x201C;benefit&#x201D; (I used that word in quotation marks) of having that hon. member on his side, and as usual he has been too clever by half. Surely it is not for me to tell you how to make that unworkable piece of legislation workable. This legislation did not come from this side of the House. This side of the House argued, as it did yesterday at <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0393"/>the second reading, that there are regulations, that they can be used in certain ways, but that if they are enshrined in our statute, a completely different situation arises. The hon. member for Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie) went out of his way yesterday to point that out. Now the hon. member for Standerton asks whether I am against this clause, and then he goes on to say &#x201C;Yes, the hon. member is against this clause&#x201D;. He knows very well that I did not say a word to the effect that I am against the clause. Both the hon. member for Parktown and I have merely pointed out that since these original war measures were drafted at a time when a totally different set of circumstances prevailed, for example in the distributive trade, if you are going to put them into a law now as a permanent measure, you must take cognizance of the changes that have taken place since the war. The war, as we are often told, happened a long time ago, and you had plenty of time to come up with something workable. Now I want to tell you how this would work: The price controller in terms of his powers may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, publish a regulation concerning, for instance, tea that in future anybody who sells a packet of tea, any quantity, must issue an invoice, and the person who buys it must receive an invoice, and a record must be kept. I say again that in the case of the vast majority of sales effected, in the larger centres certainly, in these commodities, in the case of the overwhelming proportion of the turnover done, in the case of tea and other popular or necessary foodstuff, the turnover is done through channels which no longer have the facility and do not require the facility of issuing invoices, and therefore it becomes impossible for the customer to receive one or the seller to keep one, and for the price controller to keep track of the majority of sales of that particular commodity. Therefore we say that this provision is not practicable, and we ask with great deference that the Minister should give us an idea of how he is going to control the increase in prices in those very common and everyday commodities that are sold in such circumstances that it is not feasible to expect an invoice or to give an invoice. It is not for us to give the answer. The answer must surely come from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I really do not know why the hon. members for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) and Parktown (Mr. Emdin) are trying to make a mountain out of a moleheap. I think they simply want to talk but they are simply talking nonsense. Surely the price controller will not ask anybody to produce an invoice for an article unless he suspects that there is something wrong in that business and that they are over-charging the public. In that case people will be asked to ask for an invoice when they buy anything to show what they were charged for the article. In any case when that trader orders his supplies he gets an invoice. It does not go through a machine; only his sales to the public go through a machine.</p>

<p>The sales to the public are recorded on a strip of paper which shows what the various items cost.</p>

<p>Although it does not, if you have that strip of paper and you have the invoice on which the price appears, you have proof as to what the person had paid. When the public knows that the price of tea is 80c per lb. and somebody sells it at 100c they will soon lodge a complaint and somebody will be appointed to investigate the position in that shop. You are not asking the public here to do the impossible. It will simply not be done. Nobody wants to increase the cost of living when you can keep it low. Everybody wants to supply goods to the public as cheaply as possible and it is only in exceptional cases, in cases where a shopkeeper is circumventing the law, that steps will be taken to demand an invoice and to see that the matter is put right. Sir, these chain stores and supermarkets did not come into existence yesterday. We have had them for a long time and there has always been price control; it exists to-day and this clause operates to-day. How many people have found it impossible to carry out the provisions of this clause in practice? Nobody. This clause is applied every day but only where a trader is exploiting the public. I consequently really do not know why hon. members are making such a hullabaloo about it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to support the two hon. members who raised this matter, and to voice my protest against the hon. member who criticized them. This clause can place a completely unwarranted burden on the public. Will the hon. the Minister perhaps consider doing something about it in the Other Place? There is no justification in requiring members of the public to keep the invoices of the things they purchase. One of the difficulties is the immense mass of papers which gather, particularly in the case of business men. I do not think there is any necessity for insisting on the buyer keeping his invoice. What is essential is that in a properly bound invoice book the supplier must keep a copy of any invoice he issues. If there is any purpose in it, it can be achieved by that simple means without inconveniencing the public.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) made a remark which I honestly did not think a lawyer like him should have made. He advocated firstly that invoices should only be retained by the suppliers and that they should be kept in a permanent book. That is in complete conflict with what his colleague said. We now have modem machinery and one can no longer use those permanent invoice books because it would be impracticable to do so. [Interjection.] But one no longer works with those invoices. Modem invoices are run through a machine <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0394"/>and they are also numbered. The hon. member may know a lot about the law but he knows very little about business methods.</p>

<p>The other two hon. members apparently adopted the attitude that we only have cash sales in South Africa and that there are no credit sales; and that if there are credit sales, invoices are not kept. That is their attitude because they say that no invoices are kept. Most of the business done to-day is done on credit and because it is done on credit, invoices have to be made out. How can one sell on credit if one does not keep a proper record of what has been sold? That argument of the Opposition falls away completely. Secondly, if one sells for cash one must keep records. I would be a little suspicious of those two hon. members if they conducted a business and did not keep invoices. After all, an auditor wants to see what the cash sales have been and that is why proof in the form of invoices is required. It must be proved that the total sales for the day are correct. I am afraid that if I have to audit their work they will be in trouble because they will have to produce that proof. In other words, this proof is already there. No additional burden will be placed upon the public. I should like to put this question to the hon. member for Germiston (District) in regard to the legal aspect of the matter. He said that only the seller should keep invoices and not the buyer. The whole idea of the law is that if the seller has demanded a price that is too high, he can be prosecuted. I should like to know how one would be able to prosecute because one would have to ask the seller what he sold and if he has proof of his sales, and the buyer, who would have to be a witness in the case, would then have no proof. Of course I respect the objections of those hon. members because they have to say something; they cannot allow the Bill to go through without saying something; but I do expect them to say something practical and not to use arguments that have no value at all.</p>

<p>I am surprised at the point of view adopted by the last speaker. A man of his standing ought to know that the argument advanced by this side in regard to new methods of selling for cash means that there are a tremendous number of cash sales for which there is no actual invoice. He may be right when he says that most sales are on credit, but there are still millions of small transactions for cash. This Clause 8 says that any person selling any goods or rendering any service should issue an invoice containing the particulars. Now the definition of the word &#x201C;invoice&#x201D; is a list of goods shipped or sent with prices and charges. At self-service stores you never get a list of goods. So if the Minister wants this control to work, the provisions of the Bill must be workable.</p>

Seriously, we are making a farce of the liberty of the individual by this type of legislation. I can say frankly that when I get invoices for goods I purchase I throw them away. Now it means that I have to clutter up my house or my office with a lot of invoices that I have to keep for the most minor repair or service. Surely the fact that there is an obligation on the man who renders the service to keep a record of it should suffice, but to expect the public to keep a special file or folder for these little invoices is farcical. Not only that, but the penalty is too severe. I think it is sufficient if the man who renders the service keeps the records.</p>

<p>I say this because, as the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) said, hon. members opposite are making a mountain out of a molehill and the reason why they are doing so is because the hon. members for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) and Parktown (Mr. Emdin) argue on the premise that this side of the House, when it has a discretion in regard to doing something, will always do the wrong thing. And so, when the price controller is given a certain authority he will demand the impossible and he will do the wrong thing and he will saddle the public with all sorts of burdens. But is that being fair? This provision is already part of our legislation under the existing regulation. I think nothing of hon. members&#x2019; objections to this clause but I do take great exception to the premises on which they argue. The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) echoed their sentiments and mentioned all kinds of examples.</p>

<p>But what will happen in practice? There may be some dealer or other who is trying to rob the public. This is something that the hon. the Minister cannot permit. It must be stopped immediately. The objection that hon. members have raised in regard to the effect of this provision on certain shops&#x2014;that they have a system that will make it impossible for them to follow the provisions of this Bill&#x2014;is merely a veil behind which they try to hide in order to accuse the Government of doing the wrong thing. There is not the slightest reason for this suspicion. If it were true the price controller, who has always been in existence, would be <span class="col_761-762" refersTo="page_0395"/>guilty of malpractices and this fact would often be raised in this House. But that has not been done because nothing wrong has been done. They are only too anxious to blame the hon. the Minister for anything that goes wrong but they have not yet done so under the present regulations.

The hon. member is again clean off the beam, so much so that he should only let his mind traverse the debate on the previous clause where the amendment suggested by the hon. member for Yeoville was dealt with by the hon. the Minister in the light of the facts as presented by the hon. member and in the light of what is before us at present; and the hon. the Minister said he did not intend using the provisions of this Bill in the manner suggested by the hon. member for Yeoville in which they could be used. The Minister was prepared to give the matter consideration in Another Place, and the hon. member for Standerton must view it from the same angle. It is not a case of whether there have been such cases in the past, or whether members on this side have the idea that these powers would be abused. We are concerned with the written word in what is becoming a permanent part of our legislation, and that is the point.</p>

<p>I want to come back to this clause. When one starts thinking in terms of the practical realities of the situation, I want to put to the Minister the case of so many of our Native trading stores. What is to be their position if they are called upon to implement the instructions which may be given in terms of subsection (c), in regard to these invoices? In a case which came to my personal knowledge, where a sales analysis was carried out, it was shown that in one particular trading store between 800 and 1,600 transactions a day were for less than the value of 5c. Who were the purchasers? Little piccanins who came to buy sweets for 1c or a biscuit. What will the position be if invoices have to be issued for such sales? How can that class of purchaser keep invoices? Cannot you imagine a little piccanin wrapping a sweet up in the very invoice he is supposed to keep? What do they know about this sub-section? I suggest that this is completely impracticable. I know that price controllers in the past in so far as Native trading stores are concerned have felt that that was one aspect of our economic life which had to be watched. I am not saying anything about that. I am not here either to defend the traders or to say anything against them. If I had anything to say, I would defend them because they have difficulties enough as it is. But I do say that this clause will be completely unworkable.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I think hon. members opposite should accept the fact that the application of the provisions of this clause will take place in such a way as to make them workable, and that the price controller will not apply these provisions in such a way as to make them unworkable. In other words, that he will only apply them as has been the case in the past&#x2014;in a workable manner; otherwise he will be frustrating his own aims. But to remove this clause would make his task very difficult. It would nullify certain of the powers that he has to apply price control which can so easily be avoided. The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) has said that price control is applied during times of shortages. But shortages may occur again in respect of certain articles and then we want to have the means of apply price control effectively. Let us imagine that the price controller wants proof that some offence or other is being committed in regard to a certain article. He wants that proof not only from the buyer but also from the seller. This Bill makes provision for the imposition of a ban not only on the sale but also on the purchase of articles at certain prices. Clause 4 (b) provides for &#x201C;fixing a maximum price at which any person may purchase goods from any other person&#x201D;. If we look at the end of Clause 18, which we will come to later, we will find that it states: &#x201C;Any person who purchases or offers to purchase.&#x201D; It is not only the seller but also the buyer who sometimes commits an offence. It may be that an article is in short supply and that the buyer is willing to buy it at a higher price than that laid down.</p>

<p>The other point that was made was in regard to bazaars and self-service stores. It is not of application to them because in the first place the articles in the self-service stores are all marked. The price controller can walk into any of those bazaars or self-service stores and see what the prices are that are being asked for the various goods. In a later clause, in Clause 15, the power is given to the controller &#x201C;to grant an exemption from any of the provisions of the Act&#x201D;. So, as far as these bazaars and self-service stores are concerned, they can always be excluded from any of the provisions of this Bill simply because they are mechanized and because they do not issue invoices in the normal sense of the word. I really think that hon. members are exaggerating this matter and I hope that they will withdraw their objection.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to refer the Minister to Clause 12 (1) (b), where I think the wording can be improved, because I do <span class="col_763-764" refersTo="page_0396"/>not think the intention of the Bill is as set out in the paragraph. It says the controller can demand from a person under certain circumstances any balance sheet or business account in the possession or custody or under the control of that person. Now that is a very wide provision, because although the price controller may require the accounts and balance sheets from a particular person relating to a particular business or transaction, he has the power here to demand every balance sheet or business account in the custody of that person, and that person may have in his possession balance sheets which have no relation at all to the matter which the controller is investigating. Therefore I would like to move, and I hope the Minister will accept this amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>In this case I am also quite prepared to meet the hon. gentleman. But I have certain difficulties in this case. I can see the case which he has made out for the amendment and I am prepared to accept it but my difficulty is this: How is the controller to know which balance sheets are of interest? According to this amendment he has to demand all those balance sheets which relate to the goods and services, but he does not actually know what or where these balance sheets are. However, I am quite prepared to accept this amendment on the same conditions as the first one and to put it to the legal advisers to consider and then to move the necessary amendment in the Other Place.</p>

<p>On Clause 18,</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>A little earlier the hon. the Minister referred to certain penal provisions which applied to a purchaser. Clause 18 (b) provides that if any person purchases or offers to purchase any goods from any other person at a price in excess of the maximum price at which he may under this Act purchase such goods from such other person, he is liable to certain penalties. I Would like to move an amendment here in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 5, after &#x201C;(b)&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;knowingly&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sir, many price awards may be gazetted and published under certain circumstances, but there will be many cases where the buyer will not know of these particular awards, and quite innocently he will go in and either purchase or offer to purchase a commodity at a price in excess of the controlled price. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) dealt a little earlier with the position of the Native traders. There you have a typical example. I do not think it is the intention of the Bill to penalize somebody who has no knowledge of a particular matter. I know that once a certain provision has been published in the <i>Gazette</i> it is supposed to be within your knowledge, but this is so wide and it will apply to so many people that I hope the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to accept that a penalty should only be imposed where somebody knowingly breaks the law.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister whether he will give an assurance that this particular sub-section (b) will not be used by the traps who have been employed in the past by the Price Controller. I want to say that I have had occasion during my legal practice in years gone by to defend very many people who were the innocent victims of traps. In many instances these traps would wait for the principal to leave the premises before they would go in. We have just passed a clause under which the principal will be liable for the acts of his servant in a shop. I want to feel that this Act will not be used in the way in which it was used many years ago, and that is to get convictions under any circumstances by the constant trapping of people.</p>

<p>Sir, we are getting near the end of this Bill, and I do not think anybody can be in any doubt any longer that we are dealing here with a measure which is complicated, which may affect many interests in the country and which can leave an impression abroad that emergency conditions have now become a state of permanency in South Africa. I think it is also common cause that this legislation is based on a war measure which is now more than 20 years old. That war measure, as hon. members will remember, was framed to deal with a situation which arose during a world conflagration, when very many commodities in this country were in short supply and when emergency conditions were changing so rapidly that this <i>ad hoc</i> method was the only method of dealing with the situation. But all that, of course, has changed, and it should be possible to modify and to keep up to date a control measure of this kind so as to suit the conditions as they prevail to-day. The most serious part of the whole matter, it seems to me, is that we leave the impression abroad that emergency conditions have now become a permanency and I think we should make it perfectly clear to ourselves and to everybody else that this type of legislation is looked upon as legislation which will come up for review periodically before Parliament. It was in view of all these conditions that this side of the House wanted this Bill to go to a Select Committee so that this could be thrashed out and dealt with. This is the last chance we have to amend the Bill in such a way that there can be no misunderstanding. This is an attempt therefore to frame this legislation in such a way that weaknesses and vagueness and uncertainties in the legislation can come up for review before Parliament. That is the only appropriate way. If the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment, it will not prevent the Government from implementing the legislation and giving effect to its objects, as they see fit from time to time, but he will ensure that the legislation will come up for review periodically. I think the periods allowed are reasonable, and this amendment follows the pattern which has been adopted in this House on previous occasions where it has been felt that it is necessary to review legislation. I hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment as well.</p>

<p>I think I have been very amenable in this debate. I have already considered and dealt with three of the four amendments in a very sympathetic way. I fear that I shall not be able to accept this last one. I shall not be able to accept it because I really do not see any reason why this legislation should have to be introduced into this House again next year. I see no reason why we should have to have the same debate next year and the year thereafter. I can give hon. members the assurance that they will be able to raise this matter each year under my Vote. They will be able to criticize the administration of this legislation each year if they have grounds for criticism. Just as they had the opportunity in the past to do so, so they will have that opportunity in the future. We are now entering a new era in which we will be able to operate in terms of an Act instead of a regulation. And so let us test this measure. I can give hon. members the assurance that I do not like control. It is not a pleasant thing to have to apply control. I can assure hon. members that I will be one of the first people to come to this House and move amendments if we find that certain clauses are not operating properly. I do not believe that this legislation will ever become redundant in the distant future or in the near future, but I can give hon. members the assurance that if it does appear that this legislation is no longer necessary, I shall not insist that it remain on the Statute Book. If it appears that certain of the clauses are not operating properly I shall be one of the first to bring this fact to the attention of hon. members. I can also give hon. members the assurance that this measure will be applied with the greatest circumspection and I do not believe that hon. members opposite will have any real reason for complaint in regard to its application. I am sorry, but I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I hope that the hon. the Minister will reconsider his attitude. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that in these circumstances this amendment is a very reasonable one, the circumstances being the fact that in introducing this Bill the hon. the Minister said that it had always been and still is the policy of his Government to remove price control and import control measures as soon as possible. That has certainly always been the attitude of this side of the House. Our attitude has been that measures of this kind should be regarded as temporary in our economy. That being the case, I suggest to the hon. the Minister that we are putting a very reasonable request to him in asking that this Bill which is now becoming part of the permanent legislation of the country should be put on the Statute Book in such a way that we on this side of the House will be able to debate the question as to whether or not price control legislation is still necessary. Sir, that opportunity does not exist where the method suggested by the hon. the Minister is followed namely to criticize his administration when his Vote comes up for discussion. In those circumstances we on this side of the House are limited entirely to criticism of his administration. We are not in a position to advance arguments to show that in our view the state of affairs warranting price control legislation no longer exists. Sir, one of the arguments used <span class="col_767-768" refersTo="page_0398"/>by the hon. the Minister for his refusal to accept this amendment was that we would have this same debate over again every few years. I would point out to the hon. the Minister firstly that that is not the position, because as has been pointed out in the second reading debate, we were not dealing with price control on its merits. We did not suggest that the war measures under which price control can be brought into operation should be abolished. In this debate we were not debating whether or not price control was necessary. We accepted the fact that under present circumstances it was necessary, but we suggested that it should remain in terms of a temporary law. What we will be in a position to do if the amendment is accepted, is to advance arguments to show that in our view price control legislation is no longer necessary. The second reason is that circumstances may change between now and that time. It may no longer in fact be necessary to have price control legislation. Sir, the hon. the Minister said that he would be the first to come to this House, if he felt that price control was no longer necessary, with legislation either to abolish it altogether or to amend it. I accept that, but I suggest to the Minister that the Opposition ought also to have the right to advance arguments to this House to show that price control is no longer necessary, and we cannot do that unless &#x2026;</p>

<p>First Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Part Appropriation Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I intend delivering my Budget speech on 16 March.</p>

<p>As hon. members are aware, it is customary to ask the House for an advance to cover the necessary Government expenditure during the first few months of the new financial year whilst awaiting the passing of the usual Appropriation Bill.</p>

<p>I propose to follow the same procedure as last year and to ask for funds to cover a period of approximately three and a half months in order to avoid embarrassment to the Treasury in the event of there being any delay in the promulgation of the Appropriation Act. To endeavour to assess the duration of the Session at this early stage is a somewhat hazardous enterprise.</p>

<p>Bearing these factors in mind, it is estimated that an amount of R263,000,000 will be required for revenue services, R7,000,000 for Bantu education and R55,000,000 for loan services, making a total of R325,000,000. As hon. members will know, these funds can be used to meet only the cost of existing services already approved by Parliament, and any new services contemplated must wait until the Appropriation Bill is passed.</p>

<p>The total amount requested&#x2014;R325,000,000&#x2014;is appreciably higher than last year&#x2019;s Part Appropriation of R281,000,000. Hon. members should not, however, jump to the conclusion that the Main Estimates of Expenditure for 1964-5 will necessarily be correspondingly higher than those for 1963-4. One important factor which I have had to take into account is that much heavier payments for certain services are expected during the early months of the new financial year than was the case during the current year.</p>

<p>While I do not intend to anticipate my Budget speech by giving the House a general review of the financial situation, there are one or two matters of financial interest which I should like to mention now.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that we have for many years had a revolving credit arrangement with a group of American banks. This credit is always arranged for a period of two years, and the most recent period expired on 23 January. The Government has not actually required or made use of the credit for some time, but nevertheless I believe it is important to preserve the continuity of our relationship with the banks and to retain this facility which may one day again be of great value to us. During my visit to the United States of America in September and October last year I accordingly had discussions with the principal banks concerned, as a result of which the credit has been renewed for a further period of two years, and for the same amount&#x2014;&#x0024;40,000,000 or about R29,000,000. The rate of interest remains unchanged at 5 per cent, but I am glad to say that I was able to secure a reduction of the commitment fee&#x2014;which is all that we pay so long as we do not draw upon the credit&#x2014;from &#x215C; per cent to &#x00BC; per cent.</p>

<p>Last December a loan of DM40,000,000&#x2014;approximately R7,000,000&#x2014;which we obtained two years ago from a syndicate of German banks under the leadership of the Deutsche Bank&#x2014;fell due. I took advantage of the visit of Mr. Abs, the President of the Deutsche Bank, to South Africa last year to discuss with him future arrangements with his bank. In view of the present favourable position of the balance of payments and the Exchequer I thought it would be to South Africa&#x2019;s advantage to convert the expiring loan into a revolving credit on the same lines as the American credit. The Deutsche Bank agreed to this and a revolving credit for the same amount&#x2014;DM40,000,000&#x2014;was arranged for a period of two years as from 19 December 1963. Rates of interest in Germany are somewhat higher than those in America and this credit carries an interest rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent and a commitment fee of &#x215C; per cent.</p>

<p>Last year, Mr. Speaker, I explained some of the devices which we had used to mop up excessive liquidity in this country. We have continued these measures, one of which, it will be recalled, was the issue of Treasury bills to a larger total amount than the Treasury actually required to meet its disbursements. The result has been that a substantial balance in the Exchequer account with the Reserve Bank has been built up. In order to reduce this balance to some extent and to earn some interest on these idle funds, I decided to invest a certain amount overseas. About R12,000,000 has so far been invested at short call in London, at rates of interest in the range 3&#x00BC; per cent&#x2014;3 11/16 per cent, and this amount may be further increased. I do not envisage, however, that any very large sums will be so invested. Most of the funds will in any case be required in Britain fairly shortly to meet Government purchases there.</p>

<p>This transaction brought to light an apparent defect in our financial legislation, in that the Government is permitted, under the Exchequer and Audit Act, to invest its funds in only one way, namely, on deposit with any banking institution. I believe it would be desirable to grant the Government a little more latitude in this respect, so as to allow it to invest surplus moneys in, for example, Treasury bills of other countries, where the rate of interest and the security might be superior to that obtainable on bank deposits. I propose to introduce an amendment to this effect in the Finance Bill later this Session.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is always a difficult debate for the hon. the Minister to initiate. He has told us this afternoon that he intends to introduce his Budget on 16 March. Knowing the philanthropic make-up of the hon. the Minister we are quite sure that it was with great restraint on his part that he withheld the good news which he has for the country when he introduces his Budget. I am sure the hon. the Minister, with his natural kindly instincts, would love to tell the country of his overflowing coffers, of his overflowing exchange reserves, of his buoyant revenue and of his ability to give very substantial relief to the unfortunate taxpayers of this country. To that extent, Sir, the Minister has our sympathies. He has so much good news which I am quite sure he will be ready to give us next month that we sympathize with him in not being able to give it to-day.</p>

<p>The two points to which he has referred in regard to overseas revolving credits bear out what I say in referring to the strong financial position of the country at the present time. Again, the hon. the Minister, in telling us that he had renewed the revolving credit facilities in New York, was careful to point out that he had done so because, in spite of the present position, it might be necessary for him to call upon this revolving credit to assist our finances. I do not know what reason he has for saying that.</p>

<p>What about all the capital projects?</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>We do not know about these capital projects. It may be that the hon. the Minister may have, mixed up with the good news he is going to give us next month, equally bad news of the burden which is going to be laid upon the shoulders of the taxpayer. But on the evidence before us at the present time we must suspend judgment until we hear his Budget speech. The attitude of the Government towards the handling of surplus funds is one which, I think, we entirely agree with. If the Government has money lying idle, and if they can assist the over-liquid position by wise investment, I am quite sure we shall be willing to assist the hon. the Minister in any legislation which he may bring forward to enable him to do so.</p>

<p>We are dealing to-day with a request for a very large sum of money. As the hon. the Minister has pointed out it is much larger than last year. He is asking for 3&#x00BD; months&#x2019; supply. If I remember rightly the hon. the Minister last year asked for more than 3&#x00BD; months&#x2019; supply; I think he asked for 4&#x00BD; months&#x2019; supply. I am subject to correction, but I think so. If I am right then, of course, the increased amount he is asking for now for 3&#x00BD; months, in comparison with what he asked for last year for 4&#x00BD; months, is all the greater. The State President in the speech he made on the occasion of the opening of Parliament made reference to the remarkable growth and prosperity of all sections of the Republic&#x2019;s economy.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>One assumes, Sir, that the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has sold his wool at a good price this season. Even allowing for the usual poetic licence to be expected of a Government when it is talking about itself, or of the hon. member for Cradock when he is talking about himself, it is a fact that there has been very substantial progress in almost every sphere of our economic life during the past 12 months, something for which everybody in this House is duly thankful. Some enthusiasts have gone so far as to call it an economic explosion. I hope they are wrong in using that term. I hope they are wrong in their interpretation of what is going on because one of the features of an explosion is that what goes up has to come down, and I do not think it is a very happy phrase to use when you are talking about economic development.</p>

<p>Whilst we all agree that the country&#x2019;s economy is showing every sign of activity and that most predictions from all quarters are to the effect that that activity is likely to continue for, at any rate, the next 12 months, I think responsible people, including the hon. the Minister, are wondering as to what comes next. Is this to be regarded as a normal expansion&#x2014;as a rate of growth which can be maintained&#x2014;or is it a &#x201C;boom&#x201D; which may not last? If so, what is going to happen if it does not last? It is common cause, Sir, I think, that our future well-being as a country and as a people depends largely, if not entirely, on a rapid and a solid economic expansion, an expansion that will provide a substantial improvement in the standard of living of all sections of our people. I think, therefore, it is appropriate, on an occasion like this, for us to consider the main factors governing the present position and to try to assess the implications and the problems which are involved. I think there are three questions which immediately arise, questions which jump to the eye, as our French friends say. The first question is: To what do we owe this sudden upsurge in our economy? The second is: Why has it taken 15 years of Nationalist government to produce a reasonable rate of growth? The third question is: Can the rate of progress be maintained?</p>

<p>As to the first question there are a number of reasons, and the fact that they all happen to have occurred more or less simultaneously has undoubtedly, in the terms of the Holistic theory, shown that the whole is greater than the sums of its parts. In the first place, you have the fact that our gold production is still increasing. We are told that in a year or two it may reach its maximum unless new mines are discovered. But nevertheless last year no less than 27,500,000 ounces of gold were produced, valued at a sum of R684,000,000, which was an increase of nearly 8 per cent on the previous year; a phenomenal <span class="col_773-774" refersTo="page_0401"/>thing, Sir. I want to emphasize once again the extent to which the sheet anchor of our whole economy for the last 50 years has been the gold mining industry.</p>

<p>The next reason, of course, is the lavish spending of the Government. I think the amount the hon. the Minister is asking for today is an indication of that. He is asking today for some R44,000,000 more than he did last year, and he is asking it, I think, for a shorter period than he did last year. Look at the Loan Votes. There is an amount of R22,000,000 for the Commerce and Industries Loan Vote; R150,000,000 for the Defence and so on. What with one thing and another, during the nine months, up to the end of December, the Exchequer disbursed about R812,000,000 which is nearly R80,000,000 more than it did in the previous year. That is quite a considerable sum, Sir, and takes no account of the money spent by the Railways Administration.</p>

<p>The third reason is the fact that we switched over to the P.A.Y.E. system of income tax last year. All the talk of a tax-free holiday gave people, or some of them, money in their pockets and created a general impression among people, I think, that some of them were much richer than they really were. Then you had, of course, as I have mentioned, the very large expenditure on Defence which put money into circulation, although that expenditure is entirely unproductive from the economic point of view. We had the fact that overseas markets were good, particularly in regard to certain articles, like sugar. I do not know whether the sugar industry is planning to put up a statue to Fidel Castro in Natal. I would not be surprised if they were. There has been a boom in the sugar industry of South Africa. The price of wool has improved; the diamond market is booming. Some R332,000,000 worth of diamonds was sold which was an increase of nearly R14,000,000 on the previous year. All these facts have contributed to buoyancy in the consumers&#x2019; market and to the general atmosphere and have put more money into people&#x2019;s pockets much of which has not remained there. I think, however, the decisive factor in the present position was really the apparent decision by the financial, the industrial and commercial world to go ahead. After years of uncertainty and hesitation they apparently made up their minds to take advantage of the climate which had been created by the conditions to which I have referred and that they would not wait any longer, and that as long as the Government maintained law and order &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>You are very often applauded before you have finished your sentence, Sir.

<p>No, they are making hay while the sun shines, and I am not blaming them. The net result of all that, Sir, is that things got moving and they are moving. We all hope that they will continue to move.</p>

<p>The second question is why has it taken so long to experience this increase in economic activity? There is no doubt that the speed, one might almost say the violence, of this economic upsurge is largely due to the pent-up urge of finance, industry, commerce to get ahead with the proper exploitation of the country&#x2019;s natural resources, an urge which has been frustrated for years. If one asks why it has been frustrated the answer is perfectly simple and quite irrefutable. Because the main, if not the only impediment, to steady, progressive, full-scale economic development over the past 15 years has been the policies, or the lack of policy of the Nationalist Government. It all started way back in 1949 when the present Minister of Lands was Minister of Railways and the whole policy of railway and harbour development was held up for some years. He was eventually replaced* by the present Minister who took on the job on the clear understanding that he would be given a free hand and all the money he required to remedy the position. I think everybody in this House will agree that he has done a very remarkable job. So long as the hon. the Minister of Transport sticks to his last we all agree that he has done a good job. But even he, in spite of the work he has done and the money he has had and the ability he has shown in his job, has not succeeded yet in meeting the needs of the country in regard to transport development. Side by side with that, of course, the hon. the Minister who is on the mat this afternoon, in another capacity, in those days, committed possibly the greatest political sin of his political career in killing immigration. That was followed, as we all know, by an unending stream of repressive racial legislation; it was followed by a continuing policy of ignoring world opinion and growing isolation. All that led, as we all know, to a flight of overseas capital and a profound feeling of uncertainty and a lack of confidence both here and abroad. Those, Sir, are facts, facts which nobody in this House can contradict. It is quite clear that the present period of economic well being, so far from being a feather in the cap of the present Government, simply highlights the fact that under a good Government we might have been enjoying the same amount of prosperity at least over the last ten years. It is indeed abundantly clear, it is only too sadly clear, what might have been under a United Party Government.</p>

<p><span class="col_775-776" refersTo="page_0402"/>Perhaps the most important of the three questions is whether the present rate of progress can be maintained. Having regard to its past record is there any reason to suppose that the Government can cope with a new situation and can it maintain conditions which will permit the present rate, the present bright picture, to continue? Can it keep the present rate of economic progress going? One has to bear in mind, in considering this question, that the present upward movement, which everybody is looking at, as far as I can see, in some surprise, should not be regarded as phenomenal. It has been waiting for us; staring us in the face for years. Given favourable circumstances there is no reason at all why the present rate, which is not an excessive rate, should not continue for years to come. We have not had anything from the Government to indicate what they would regard as a proper rate of economic growth to be maintained. As we know our rate of gross national production fell as low as 2 per cent. Over a period of years it was not much more than 2 per cent. We know that other countries have a figure which they regard as the minimum which they should try to maintain. We know the Common Market countries for some years past maintained a rate of about 6 per cent per annum.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about the last five or six years. We know that Great Britain has a rate of about 4 per cent. We know that the United States has a rate of about 4 per cent and they do not regard that as high enough. We also know that in a comparatively undeveloped country like ours that rate should be higher than in the older countries where the population is more or less stable, static, and where there are not the necessary opportunities for expansion that there are in a younger country like ours. I think it is highly desirable that the Government&#x2014;maybe the hon. the Minister could give us some light on this subject&#x2014;should give a clear indication as to what they regard as a sound and necessary rate of progress to be maintained in this country if the present expansion is to continue and if we are going to absorb and give work to all the potential workers who are waiting in this country to be employed if given the opportunity.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, when we consider the question as to whether this rate can be maintained the three main factors on which that depends are capital, labour and confidence in the future, based on peace at home and understanding and support from the civilized countries of the Western world. As far as capital is concerned, I imagine that that for the moment is the least of the worries of the hon. the Minister. His gold and his foreign exchange reserves rose phenomenally during last year by some R84,000,000. I think, until they finally stood at some R509,500,000, to which one can add the money which, with the permission of the Minister, banks hold overseas on short-term investment. So the hon. Minister has at his disposal some R560,000,000 in gold and foreign exchange at the moment. In spite of this, of course, the hon. Minister has not seen fit, has not felt sufficient confidence, to remove his control over the movement of capital&#x2014;that is another subject which we shall have an opportunity to discuss at greater length on another occasion, but I think it is a very important question at the present time, and its ramifications go further than just the movement of capital. Of course there is private capital coming into the country in the form of machinery and plant, etc., which is still essential for the expansion which we wish to maintain. But on the whole I think we can say that as far as capital is concerned, to put it at its lowest, the hon. the Minister has the matter well under control.</p>

<p>The second factor of course is the question of manpower, and this question is the main preoccupation both of the Government and of employers all over the country; industry, mining, the Government, the Railways, employers generally are unanimous in saying that the immediate problem is the question of manpower, all grades of scientific, technical, professional skilled workmen, and even more important in the long run, the question of apprentices. It will be very interesting, Mr. Speaker, when we get the Budget figures to see how much of the Government and the Railway Loan Funds have not been spent during the past year. We voted something like R300,000,000 for capital expenditure in the last Budget, and the amount remaining unspent will be an interesting indication to what extent the Government and the Railways have been impeded in carrying out their development schemes by a shortage of labour. We are told that the building industry at the present moment needs 4,000 trained men, and that there are very few apprentices coming forward at this time of the year when you expect to get them; we are told that the steel and engineering industry requires 3,000 trained men at the present moment and that they want 1,000 apprentices; we are told the motor trade is short of 1,000 trained men and they want 1,000 apprentices. So you can go on. It is quite clear that in all the expanding trades and industries this question of manpower is causing concern amongst all of them.</p>

<p>The Government is trying with its belated immigration policy to do what it can to remedy the position. I understand that we are likely to hear in the course of this Session from the thoughtful-looking Minister of Housing that he has some schemes which may help to meet the problem, which will arise if the immigration policy succeeds, of providing housing for those immigrants. But, Sir, there is one aspect of immigration which I think is a matter for concern and that is the size of the &#x201C;outlander&#x201D; population which we are building up in our country.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I object to it. It was calculated that in 1961 when the new state of affairs arose, there were some 300,000 people living permanently in this country who were not South African citizens and who were showing no inclination to become citizens. Since then, the Government has initiated its immigration scheme which it hopes will develop even further than it has done, and large numbers of foreigners are coming into the country with the idea of making their permanent home here; they are bringing their children, their families, and they are becoming part and parcel of the South African people. It seems to me that it is highly desirable that now that we have accepted the principle of receiving into our country large numbers of new South Africans that we should take steps to make it much easier for them to become South Africans in deed as well as in word, and that we should do all we can to encourage them to play their full part in the life of the country and to regard themselves as part and parcel of the White population of South Africa. I think that the period of five years before a man can become a South African citizen is too long under existing circumstances, and I think it might be reduced to two years.</p>

<p>It might be that if they were permitted to become South African citizens after two years, that a certain number might become naturalized who subsequently prove to be undesirable citizens, but that would not be important; their naturalization can always be revoked, and I think the hon. Minister will agree with me that taking it over a long period of years, the number of people who have come to this country, from various countries, and who have settled in this country and who have turned out to be unsatisfactory citizens of the country, whether they were naturalized or not, has been a minimum. The vast bulk of them and their children have become absorbed in the general community and they have grown up and attached themselves to the country and have played their full part if they were allowed to do so, in the affairs of the country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I think that is unworthy of the hon. member for Kempton Park. I have always regarded him as one of the serious-minded members on the Government benches. In any case, let me tell the hon. member for Kempton Park that the well-known gentleman Sir Oswald Mosley has announced that his party is very much akin to the Nationalist Party in South Africa and that he fully supports the Nationalist Party and that he is advising all immigrants to join the Nationalist Party as soon as they can. The hon. member for Krugersdorp might try to get into touch with Sir Oswald Mosley and ask what he can do to co-operate with him. But quite seriously, Sir, I think that this question of regarding our immigrants as new South Africans, to be dealt with as new South Africans, be accepted as new South Africans, as quickly as we can, is very important indeed and will give a great fillip to the immigration policy of the Government, and I hope the hon. Minister will give serious consideration to that aspect of the matter. Because whilst the Government is carrying out its immigration policy, we think not nearly as fully as they might, at the same time they are increasing the labour shortage all the time with their policy of job reservation. Every gathering of employers throughout the country, without exception, condemns the Government&#x2019;s policy of job reservation. In addition to that, over a period of years the Government has increased the manpower problem by its gross neglect of technical and higher education amongst our younger people who have not been catered for. One quite understands the problem of the Government on the question of job reservation. It boils down to this: If you relax job reservation, the more economic expansion you have, the more economic integration you have, and the more this country expands economically and the more prosperity the whole country enjoys, the more impossible it becomes to carry out the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid, on which the Government side survive at the present time.</p>

<p>But, Sir, signs are not wanting that we are very near the ceiling as far as labour is concerned. There are trades where a black market in labour, so we are told, is developing, where people are competing for labour, paying well above standard wages, and so on. That is not a healthy sign and tends to increase the cost of living and tends to cause inflation if it is carried very far.</p>

<p>Whatever his other views may be, I think the hon. the Minister is bound to agree that in regard to the present economic expansion the manpower question is becoming and is liable to become the bottle-neck which may and will impede the development at a rate at which we would like to see it develop. Mr. Speaker, I repeat, it is this Government that over the last years, ever since it came into power in 1948, by its policies has created this shortage of manpower, and it is now up to the Government to see what can be done to relieve the position. So far we have heard very little. For this reason alone one asks whether the rate of progress can be maintained. It is clear that the <span class="col_779-780" refersTo="page_0404"/>hon. Minister himself has doubts about it. He made a speech towards the end of last year to a professional gathering where he talked about the necessity that might arise to take his foot off the accelerator and applying the brakes gently&#x2014;by which clearly from the context he indicated that the Government might have to consider steps to slow down the rate of progress. Sir, that is a very delicate operation to undertake; it is an operation which may very well have an accumulative effect and snowball into something very different than expanding our economy.</p>

<p>I come to the last factor and that is the question of confidence in the future. Confidence in the economic potential of this country is there&#x2014;here and abroad, everywhere. But the question is can confidence be created and can it be maintained so that the potential can be exploited under peaceful and settled conditions? Events to the north of us, developments in the Transkei, the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s latest attempt to pacify world opinion in regard to South West Africa, all these are matters which may hold threats for us, and there are others too: Our future membership of the United Nations appears to be highly doubtful. The hon. the Prime Minister has told us that the rest of the world is sick and he proposes to isolate himself and us until it recovers, whatever that may mean. I do not know, and I think nobody does. But in regard to this matter of confidence, we have a new Minister of Foreign Affairs, and we wish him well from this side of the House. We look forward to having an opportunity of discussing the affairs of his Department with him in this House as soon as the voters of Beaufort West have been sufficiently brow-beaten to accept him as their new member. But, Sir, if the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, with the knowledge and the experience which he has gained abroad and in his contacts in various parts of the world, can persuade his Cabinet of the minimum requirements of the Western powers to satisfy them that we are moving in the right direction, I think he may do a very great service to the country. But of course if he simply is going to be a chip of the old granite block, I am afraid we shall not be any better off with the new Minister. I cannot help thinking that if the hon. the Prime Minister would only devote himself for the next 12 months entirely to, say, tunny-fishing and would leave his new Minister a free hand to handle his Department, our foreign policy might well receive a new look which would ameliorate, if it did not solve, many of our problems. Because, Mr. Speaker, and one has argued this so often in this House that one does not want to do it again, it is quite undoubtedly that without modification of the Government&#x2019;s race policies, we shall remain in a state of dangerous isolation as far as the rest of the world is concerned, and confidence, both here at home and abroad, will be balanced on a knife-edge.</p>

<p>My conclusion therefore is (1) that the present forward movement is justified and long overdue; (2) that it has been far too long delayed by the actions and the attitudes of the present Government; (3) that there is no indication that those policies will not continue to jeopardize the permanent well-being of our country&#x2019;s economy and to prevent the maintenance of the present rate of progress. I therefore wish to move the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the second reading of the Part Appropriation Bill because the policies of the Government have impeded and will continue to impede the full economic development of the country&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The hon. member found it very difficult to put up a case here and one cannot blame him, because there is very little he can criticize in regard to the economic conditions in the country to-day. But if I briefly have to summarize what he said and what is of any importance, I must say that I had difficulty in making a few notes. Practically the only point of interest he mentioned was that there was a desire on the part of commerce and industry over a period of 15 years to go forward and to develop, but that they were frustrated by the present Government to such an extent that they could not do so, and that now they have decided to break out and take the opportunity to go forward. It surprises me that the hon. member used such an argument. What does it amount to? It amounts to this, that whereas the United Party has not granted us any opportunity ever since 1948, as they already said at that time, and although they told the country that the banks would close and that the country would go bankrupt&#x2014;only two or three years ago they still predicted that we would devaluate and that the price of gold would fall&#x2014;and although they took every opportunity to tell the world how badly things were going for South Africa, as the result of which they chased money out of the country, this phrase used by the hon. member now means that commerce and industry and other economic interests no longer believe the United Party, and now money is being invested, and now they are assisting in the economic development of the country. That is the crux of the hon. member&#x2019;s whole speech, and that is also the reply to his speech.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia referred to immigration. It struck me that during this Session already three of the prominent members of the Opposition have spoken about immigration, first during the motion of no-confidence and now to-day again. The Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), and to-day again the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), sang the same refrain in regard to immigration. For the rest they are completely obsessed with the European Common Market and what has happened in the past 15 years in regard to the E.E.C. It seems to me that somebody works out these matters for them and then they decide just to concentrate on that, whether there are good grounds for saying so or not.</p>

<p><span class="col_781-782" refersTo="page_0405"/>I just want to tell the hon. member something in regard to immigration. If we had continued with the immigration policy we inherited from the United Party, the country would have been filled with unskilled White labour, which would have had to compete with the Bantu. That would have created a very unsound position in South Africa. At that time Europe had no skilled workers whom they could afford to do without. Europe had been razed to the ground and had to be rebuilt. They did not let their skilled workers go. But the United Party wanted us to take everyone who wanted to come, the good and the bad, because at that time their policy was to swamp the Afrikaner vote by means of immigrants. That failed, and thank heaven it did.</p>

<p>We shall see to it that those children develop into intelligent people, and they will not be United Party supporters. They will have enough intelligence not to belong to the United Party.</p>

<p>I want to come to one of the arguments advanced by the hon. member to-day and which was also referred to by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Jeppes in a previous debate, and I want to develop this point in greater detail, because I feel that the Opposition is busy misleading the public by means of their argument. I am thinking now of their reference to the European Common Market, the E.E.C., and what the position is there as compared with South Africa. I will quote what the hon. member for Jeppes said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we have regard to the whole period during which this Government has been in power, as my Leader indicated a few days ago, we find that our tempo of economic growth was only half of that of the countries belonging to the Common Market. Surely that is the test!</block>

<p>By means of that proposition of theirs, those hon. members are trying to compare the incomparable, and they are creating a totally misleading painting of the real position. I just want to say that the United Party has nothing to boast about. They were in power for ten years before we came into power, and what did we inherit from them when we took over in 1948? We got soya bean bread. They could not even give us decent bread. Half the national debt was unproductive debt. Flight capital came to our country. We inherited a community which had lost all sense of thrift, because the United Party deliberately did not encourage the people to save.</p>

<p>Let us now come to the statements of the hon. members in connection with the Common Market. We also had our troubles over the years. The United Party consistently tried to show the world that a bad Government was in power here and that they should not entrust their money and their investments to this Government. All those things necessarily had an effect on the scope of investment in South Africa, and it must have had an effect on the flow of capital to South Africa, as well as from the country. Now the hon. member says that the E.E.C. developed faster than South Africa did over these 15 years. I just want to say that had the E.E.C. not developed faster than South Africa in these 15 years it would have been a catastrophe for the world. The position surely was that Europe had been devastated in 1945 and that industries had been destroyed. They had to start building anew, and building up to a high percentage, starting from nothing, is very much easier than when one starts from something. And that is what happened. We know the hon. member for Jeppes as someone who tries to juggle the figures. Last year he also did so here and then the Minister of Finance pointed out that if he had shifted his years by just one year either way one would have got a completely different picture. One does not expect that sort of thing from an economist, as he professes himself to be. Let us look at the position in Europe, to show how Europe was destroyed. In 1949 Britain and practically the whole of Western Europe devalued. America did not devalue, because she said she still retained all her markets and that nobody else could supply those markets because the other countries did not have the industries to do so. But if it were to happen to-day that Western Europe devalued, America would also have to do so immediately otherwise she would lose all her markets, because Europe has again been built up economically, as the hon. member surely knows. I know how the factories in Western Europe were rebuilt, and particularly in Western Germany, which had suffered most damage. The hon. member tries to compare the incomparable.</p>

<p>I just want to come to the actual position of some of the European countries, the Common Market countries. Take Belgium. In Belgium there was not a great industrial expansion between 1948 and 1960; it was only 40 per cent as compared with South Africa&#x2019;s 150 per cent. In Luxemburg the increase was 50 per cent and in Holland 105 per cent, as against South Africa&#x2019;s 150 per cent. In France, which had also suffered war damage, but not to the same extent as Germany, they started reconstruction immediately after the war, and in 1948 their production was already 5 per cent more than in 1938. Up to 1953 it increased by 30 per cent, or an average of 6 per cent per annum, and in the next seven years until 1960 it increased by 68 per cent, or 9 per cent more than in 1953. The total increase was approximately 110 per cent, which is still less than that of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to the industrial expansion in the various countries. In Italy the increase in 1948 was already 1 per cent more than that in 1938; in other <span class="col_783-784" refersTo="page_0406"/>words, the position was very much the same as before the war, and from then onwards it increased by 200 per cent up to 1960.</p>

<p>But in Germany there was the greatest destruction during the war. There they started recovering immediately after the war, and America assisted all these countries on a large scale through Marshall Aid, etc. Thousands of millions of dollars were given to Europe, and Europe still had the skills they had had before the war. They had the resources which they could immediately utilize to rebuild the country on a large scale and to produce. Three years after the war the production in West Germany in 1948 was 55 per cent of what it was in 1938. In the five years thereafter up to 1953 it increased by 150 per cent, or an average of 30 per cent per annum. That is a colossal rate of growth, but they had started from nothing. For the next two years the increase was 14 per cent per annum over that of 1953, and between 1955 and 1960 the expansion was approximately 8 per cent per annum over the 1955 figure. As a whole, German factory production in Western Germany increased by 350 per cent since 1948, and that is only 200 per cent above their pre-war production in 1938, and that is the important point. But the hon. member has used statistics of the years when there was nothing in order to show us how fast they have expanded.</p>

<p>An important characteristic of all this expansion in the Western countries is this. In the initial years of this 15-year period the growth was much faster than in later years, and the reason for it is obvious. To the extent that they had built up the country and had produced, the tempo of growth had to decrease. In South Africa the position is practically the opposite. At the very least we have consistently maintained the tempo of production, and to-day the rate of growth is faster than in any other country of the world. The hon. member for Jeppes and his Leader, and the hon. member for Constantia have missed the point completely. I want to mention the latest issue of <i>Volkshandel</i> of January 1964. It summarizes the present position very well. They admit that hitherto Japan was the country which has shown the greatest growth in the world, during the last few years, but that is also decreasing every year. In 1962 it was still 10 per cent, and for 1964 it is estimated to be 8 per cent, but as far as the other countries are concerned they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our rate of growth has doubled from 4 per cent in 1962 to an estimated 6.5 per cent last year and 8 per cent in 1964.</block>

<p>Mr. Oppenheimer has already said that the figure for 1963 was not 6&#x00BD; per cent but 7 per cent, and to-day it is generally accepted that the growth was really 7&#x00BD; per cent. It is therefore a very conservative estimate made by <i>Volkshandel</i>. We have already received the figures showing the growth in other countries, and estimates have been made for 1964. Their statistics are much more up to date than ours and they analyse those figures much more quickly. The report continues to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our rate of growth to-day is almost double that of the Western world, where it is on an average of 4 per cent per annum.</block>

<p>The hon. member said a moment ago that in the Common Market countries it is about 6 per cent per annum; that is the norm they give. Here are their own figures of what they expect this year and what it was for the last two years: Italy, in 1962, 6 per cent; in 1963, 5.5 per cent, and in 1964, 4.5 per cent; France, in 1962, 5.8 per cent, and then respectively 4.5 per cent and 4 per cent; Germany, 4.4 per cent, 3.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent; U.S.A., 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 3.5 per cent; Britain, 0.3 per cent, 2.8 per cent and 4 per cent, and South Africa, 4 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 8 per cent, which is more than in all the Western countries, but then these hon. members tell us that our rate of growth is less than theirs. I want to ask the hon. member please to be more careful when making such statements. It is no use trying to compare the incomparable. That is futile. One will just be found out, and one cannot bluff anybody in that way. I say the trouble is that those hon. members make this type of statement without mentioning figures, and then they tell us all kinds of wild stories.</p>

<p>I now want to mention a few figures in connection with South Africa&#x2019;s development over this 15-year period, so that we can see what our own picture is. If we look at it we will see that we have something of which we can be proud and of which the world is envious. Take our national income. The hon. member said the other day that our growth was only an average of 3&#x00BD; per cent per annum over these 15 years. In 1947-8 our national income was R1,686,000,000, but in 1961-2, before this great expansion took place, it was already R5,004,000,000. Where does he get his figure of 3&#x00BD; per cent? It is a growth of approximately 300 per cent over these 15 years from 1948. Our national production showed the same percentage. It was R1,654,000,000 in 1948, as against R5,012,000,000 in 1960. The gross national production taken at market prices shows exactly the same percentage. The national income <i>per capita</i> of the population increased from 1948 to 1962 by over 30 per cent. In other words, the standard of living of the people increased by over 30 per cent, but that includes many millions of people who have practically not yet been linked up in our economy. If one takes only the economically active section of the population, our standard of living has increased by more than 60 per cent over these 15 years.</p>

<p>Let us look at capital formation. In 1948 the total capital formation was only R556,000,000, but of this amount we had to get R352,000,000 from abroad, and South Africa itself could only supply 36 per cent of its capital requirements. Our capital formation for 1962 was R1,145,000,000, more than double the figure <span class="col_785-786" refersTo="page_0407"/>for 1948, and all that money was saved in the country and we still had some over. In addition, an appreciable sum of money was invested abroad. The hon. the Minister himself has told us to-day how he had to try to limit this liquidity somewhat. We know that during the past year, apart from the money which the banks had the right to send abroad, approximately R100,000,000 of South African effects were purchased abroad by our shareholders. All that is surplus money we have, over and above what we normally save and spend locally. Our accounts reflect such a sound position that one can practically say that South Africa has now become a credit country. Mr. Oppenheimer even says that we must now go further and invest South African capital abroad permanently. He would not suggest such a thing unless he felt that this was a permanent thing which had now come about, and that South Africa could in future fully supply its own capital requirements. That is something the United Party could never manage to achieve.</p>

<p>Let us look at our public debt. In 1948 it was R1,618,000,000, but for that we could show assets to the value of R830,000,000 only, and the rest, viz. R788,000,000, was unproductive debt. That is almost 50 per cent. To-day the total public debt is R2,788,000,000, as at 31 March last year. As against that, we have productive assets of R3,483,000,000, a surplus on the right side of R695,000,000, reflecting a complete change and an improvement in the whole position by R1,483,000,000. There one sees progress. I know those hon. members do not like listening to figures, but they cannot contradict them, and that is fatal for them.</p>

<p>Take our factory production. In 1947-8 it was R922,000,000. In 1960-1, before these great increases in recent years, it was R2,751,000,000, an increase of approximately 300 per cent from 1948. Take industrial development. There are a few products which must be regarded as basic in factory production, and one of them is iron ore. We have heard the United Party telling us that during the war they changed South Africa from a primary producing country to a manufacturing country and that they practically made South Africa an arsenal for war production in the Southern Hemisphere. But take pig iron, which is the whole basis of industrial development. In 1938 the monthly production of iron was 27,000 tons. In 1948 it was only 59,815 tons. During the ten years of the United Party r&#x00E9;gime there was an increase of only 32,815 tons, or 121 per cent. From 1948 up to now it has increased to 243,500 tons a month, an increase of 407 per cent, or 183,700 tons in 15 years, as against their increase of 121 per cent in ten years, and then they still boast about their ten years.</p>

<p>With regard to cement, we have the same position. In their ten years, from 1938 to 1948, the increase in production was 48.9 per cent. From 1948 to 1963 the increase was 117 per cent. Take electricity. In their ten years the increase was 60.9 per cent, but in our 15 years it was 213 per cent. Then they are the people who want to tell us how fast the country would have developed if they were in power.</p>

<p>Agricultural production shows the same picture. From 1948 it increased by R376,000,000 to R882,000,000 in 1962, an increase of 135 per cent. The volume of agricultural production increased in these 14 years by 72 per cent. In regard to mineral production we have the same position. Gold increased from 11,585,000,000 fine ounces to 27,600,000,000, an increase of 150 per cent. The production of chrome increased by 105 per cent, asbestos by 500 per cent and manganese ore by 450 per cent. I say that if we have regard to these figures we get a picture of South Africa and also of those other countries which hon. members opposite have held up to us, and the overseas countries compare still more favourably in the ten years of United Party r&#x00E9;gime, because those were the poor years for South Africa.</p>

<p>To sum up, I feel that South Africa has reason to be proud of its economic development. I feel that the whole trend which exists to-day is that the public of South Africa and the financiers and the people who invest their money in business undertakings no longer allow themselves to be led by the nose by the United Party. The country is now progressing fast because the capitalist and the worker no longer believe the United Party, but believe the Nationalist Party. They believe in the future of South Africa, and as time goes on the country will be even more flourishing.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe I am not being unkind to the hon. member who has just sat down if I say that he missed the point of amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and also his argument. Much of his time has been devoted to trying to deal with an argument which was never advanced to-day, but an argument which was advanced last year, and which I will leave to the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) to deal with. I think he will be able to convince the House that the hon. member who has just sat down is as confused about the situation as he was confused about the name of the organization, to which he was referring namely, the E.E.C. There is further confusion on the part of the hon. member who seems to confuse an excess of liquidity with the creation of capital. I will deal with that later, but let me say at the outset that I am glad to see that the legislative formula in the Bill has been changed and that the appropriation is now being made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and no longer from the Exchequer Account. I am well aware that this change was made last year, but the opportunity to comment on the matter never arose. This is more than just a technicality, because the change removes an anomaly which has existed over the years in the appropriation legislation placed before Parliament. This <span class="col_787-788" refersTo="page_0408"/>change now brings Treasury appropriations into line with Railway appropriations, which is always correctly appropriated from the Railways and Harbours Fund and not from the bank account in which the moneys are from time to time accommodated.</p>

<p>One does not expect the Minister to anticipate his Budget speech, but this is of course a suitable opportunity for the Minister to answer questions and to face up to criticism in regard to the acts of commission or omission by the Government over the past year.</p>

<p>One of my first questions relates to what is developing into an unsatisfactory feature of financial administration. Quite clearly a new form of State-initiated industrialism is taking shape in the appropriation of loan funds to the Industrial Development Corporation for establishing the so-called border industries. Now everyone knows that the Government&#x2019;s border development scheme is a political issue and that it is a controversial political experiment. Whether it can or will become economically justifiable is the 64,000-dollar question. Anyway, the I.D.C. is a corporate body with statutory functions and it should be completely divorced from all political controversy. But unfortunately this change now brings it about that the I.D.C. is being dragged into the controversial side of Government activities, because the extraneous responsibilities which have been placed on the I.D.C. make it a part of the machinery of the Government, and as such it becomes responsible for spending public funds and carrying out Government policy, something outside its normal statutory responsibilities. But unlike any other part of the executive machinery which is answerable through a Minister and accountable through the Public Accounts Committee to Parliament, the I.D.C. stands aloof from any parliamentary supervision. How it sets about carrying out Government policy and how it uses funds to implement that policy certainly remain a closed book both to the public and to Parliament. It is true that the I.D.C. provides very neat and tidy accounts at the end of the year, but from the point of view of Parliament they are quite inadequate. Added to this anomaly is the fact that the I.D.C. is now becoming subject to the maximum of ministerial interference, with a minimum of parliamentary accountability. That I feel is an intolerable position and a retrograde step. I accept that whatever the figure is that was appropriated to the I.D.C., it is small in comparison with its approved financial responsibilities. It is not the amount at stake, but the principle which is involved which is important. This possibility of maximum ministerial interference without the safeguard of parliamentary accountability is a danger which I think must be avoided at all costs. This is not simply a debating point I am raising now. In answer to a question put to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs last week, when I asked about the R5,000,000 appropriated in 1963-4 to the I.D.C. for this form of State-initiated enterprise, financed with public money, through the I.D.C. acting not in its statutory capacity but as the agent of the Government, here was this Statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Taking into account the R2,000,000 appropriated in the financial year 1962-3, the amounts paid out were as follows.&#x2026;</block>

<p>And then the details were given by the Minister. But of course where the Minister was entirely wrong was that the R2,000,000 was never appropriated to the I.D.C. for the year 1962-3. Only R1,000,000 was appropriated during that year, and so we are left with the mystery of a R1,000,000, which according to the Minister is accounted for in the books of the I.D.C., but which was not appropriated by Parliament as the Minister has stated. This is an error of quite a substantial order and whatever the explanation may be for it the answer which was given by the Minister to this House on 21 January is incorrect. If ever there was evidence that makes out a case for greater parliamentary supervision&#x2014;I think this does, because it is an indication that by means of question and answer or in this form of inquiry Parliament is not properly equipped or served to deal with a situation such as this. Here we have the mystery of R1,000,000 and there is no satisfactory method of dealing with it at present, except to say that the information the Minister gave to the House is incorrect.</p>

<p>My next question arises from the current South African paradox of having economic buoyancy in an area of political depression. Whilst everyone welcomes the business upsurge which prevails, the tragedy of the situation is that everyone also knows that it is taking place in a context of cold war. Indeed, the hon. the Prime Minister chose to describe the position in these words to the world at large when he spoke at Smithfield in August 1963, six months ago, when he was reported to have said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is in a cold war and should use the time to be prepared for the struggle ahead.</block>

<p><span class="col_789-790" refersTo="page_0409"/>It is in that context that the hon. member for Constantia has raised this question of how to establish confidence in the future when the Prime Minister chooses to indicate that that is the position in which the economic development is taking place. No wonder that the question which is being asked in many quarters throughout the country is: How much longer are the economic forces of S.A. to be hampered and held in restraint by the forces of this Government? Or, to put it another way: How much longer can the inherently strong economy of S.A. continue to put up with the ruinous forces of a r&#x00E9;gime which has brought about extreme racial tensions within our borders and gathering storms of international ill-will beyond those borders?</p>

<p>Unfortunately that is the political state in which the country now finds itself. It is a state of affairs which the <i>Economist</i> recently described rather graphically when it spoke of South Africa&#x2019;s gold-based economy which is now being operated &#x201C;in a dangerous political minefield&#x201D;. Sir, I realize that having put the questions to the hon. the Minister which I have it would be too much to expect a reply, because whilst the hon. the Minister at least should know that prosperity and isolation are contradictory terms when it comes to foreign trade, he himself seems to have become rather politically shackled since he ventured to suggest a 5,000,000 alliance in South Africa instead of the rigid policy of discrimination of his party. But be that as it may, having helped to shackle South Africa&#x2019;s gold-based economy with the tangled network of arbitrary State control, the infra-structure of authoritarian control as I called it two years ago, he himself is now seemingly also tied down, he finds himself too timid apparently to use the present buoyant state of the economy as an opportunity, or as a means, of freeing trade and industry from the arbitrary controls which are helping to hinder the development of free enterprise in South Africa. That is the point that the hon. member for Constantia has made and I need not enlarge upon it. But the warnings from this side of the House, which have been repeatedly made, that this continuous use of exchange control and import control would bring about a constipated money market, have always gone unheeded. But that is precisely what has happened, Sir. There is to-day a constipated money market, and for the past year therefore the Treasury and the Reserve Bank have been trying to devise artificial means to drain off this excess banking liquidity. The hon. the Minister to-day spoke about it as being a mopping-up operation. I would like to give just a few instances of these artificial devices which have been used. The one, of course, is the haphazard allocation of sterling by the Reserve Bank for the purchase of South African shares abroad, particularly in the London market. The hon. the Minister has now virtually admitted that there is a dumping of Treasury bills on the local market and also a casual concession to commercial banks to hold funds abroad on a short-term basis and purely at the whim of the Treasury. Sir, this is all evidence of the financial expediency which is being used, or of the financial juggling which is taking place with other people&#x2019;s money in order to tide the Government over an embarrassing situation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has now indicated that the Government itself has made investments abroad, also for the purpose of draining off liquidity&#x2014;mopping-up, as he calls it. Sir, as the hon. member for Constantia has indicated, to provide additional avenues for investment by the State is perfectly legitimate. My criticism about the matter is the use of this as an artificial means of trying to justify a situation which I think the hon. the Minister should now clearly face and indicate whether it is still tenable. Sir, the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) referred to Mr. Oppenheimer&#x2019;s statement. What Mr. Oppenheimer did recently, of course, was to make a plea to the Treasury and to the Minister for a new approach to the subject of exchange control. He made a plea that the investor should now be allowed a right of investment abroad no longer just as a privilege or as a sort of largesse from the Treasury, but as a right of direct investment of funds outside South Africa. And in making that plea he stressed the fact that this type of investment &#x201C;can often be of immediate benefit to South African trade as well as strengthening ties with other friendly countries&#x201D;. Sir, those are two very important and very pertinent reasons for giving the most careful consideration to the question as to whether the economy should still be restrained by a bureaucratic system of exchange control. In the light of those remarks and in the light of the juggling that has been taking place in the past year,. I think the hon. the Minister should clearly indicate to the House why steps should not now be taken to remove these controls on the ground that they are outmoded are possibly more harmful than helpful to the economy and in any event are a patent form of discouragement to any return of investor confidence in South Africa. Now the hon. the Minister himself has indicated an additional artificial device for avoiding the effect of exchange control and I think this is an occasion when the hon. the Minister should be quite clear on this question of prolonging his control. He is well aware that his predecessor was bold enough in 1958 to quote in this House the strictures of both the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund against any prolonged use of these controls, and we also note that GATT keeps on frowning at the way in which these controls are being applied in South Africa. That is the question which I think deserves consideration and deserves a reply, and if there is justification for the retention of these measures the Minister should be quite specific in explaining the reasons why they should be retained.</p>

After all, the hon. member has had to swallow every prediction that he has made in this very House. He has had to turn a complete somersault in his attitude towards the Government. Sir, we know the hon. member only too well. He became known on this side of the House as the Jeremiah of South Africa. He prophesied doom for South Africa. He predicted that our economy would collapse. He said that South Africa was slowly moving towards bankruptcy. He said that there was a recession facing us immediately.

<p>Never. I remember that on the republican issue he said, &#x201C;Here this Government wants to offend our best customer by declaring a Republic.&#x201D; He went into a state of hysteria when he said, &#x201C;and now we are out of the Commonwealth; what is going to happen to our exports; our fruit is going to rot; we will not be able to find markets.&#x201D; Sir, all these things were said in this House not many years ago. I remember how he went on and talked about the fatal attitude of this Government; about the way in which it had offended South Africa&#x2019;s customers. Hon. members representing Natal will remember what he predicted with regard to the sugar industry. He said, &#x201C;Our sugar industry depends on a Commonwealth agreement; now we are out of the Commonwealth and that agreement is being broken.&#x201D; He prophesied that the sugar industry would go backward and backward. All those predictions were made in this House, and what do we hear today? To-day you hear a different story. To-day they talk about booming conditions. They no longer talk about a recession. They talk about economic conditions in this country and admit a phenomenal growth. Sir, what can we show? We can now show record exports; we can show record gold reserves. And what is the United Party&#x2019;s answer to that? Now they say that there is not sufficient growth in our national income. They used to predict that our national income would drop more and more and that we were heading for a recession. To-day they say that there is not sufficient growth. They go on to ask, &#x201C;How much longer can the development of the economy be held up by this Government?&#x201D; The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) talks that language even to-day. The hon. member said that he was prepared to give credit where credit was due. If you blamed the Government when you thought there was going to be a recession in this country, then if credit is to be given where credit is due, then surely to-day the Opposition must give credit to the Government for the fact that we have booming conditions to-day. They must not talk about the growth not being sufficient. They should face the fact that they, the people who condemned the economy of the country, have been proved to be completely wrong. [Interjections.] Sir, I know it hurts hon. members opposite. After all, nobody likes people to make fools of themselves but that is precisely what has happened to hon. members opposite. [Laughter.] That laughter is not a sign of courage; it is merely hysteria on their part. It is the hysteria of a foolish man.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia used to talk here about unemployment in South Africa. He predicted that South Africa was going to have serious unemployment problems in all sectors of the economy. Artisans would be unemployed and unskilled labourers would be unemployed. They badgered the Minister of Labour. What does the hon. member say to-day? He talks about a manpower shortage in South Africa. Take immigration. I remember the days when this country was losing people; it was becoming depopulated. What is the position to-day? The hon. member for Constantia now talks about too many &#x201C;uitlanders&#x201D; in this country. What sort of attitude is that? Sir, I think the Opposition have a very peculiar approach to South African affairs. They are never prepared to give any credit to South Africa and to the Government of South Africa, even where that credit is due, in spite of the unctuous talk of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). Sir, they have been proved wrong on so many occasions. They have been wrong on the flag issue, they have been wrong on the anthem issue, they have been wrong on the republican issue, they have been wrong on the Commonwealth issue, and they even opposed decimalization.</p>

Every by-election they lose, however, is regarded by them as a moral victory. They are not only losing by-elections, they are losing their own members. Sir, I remember the occasion when the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) in a debate in this House crossed the floor and voted with the Government. What happened? You, Mr. Speaker, had to call an hon. member on that side to order because he shouted &#x201C;rat&#x201D;. When the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell) crossed the floor their attitude was much the <span class="col_793-794" refersTo="page_0411"/>same.

<p>Not in the least. I remember that there was a time when the Conservative members were pushed out of the United Party. The hon. member for Yeoville stood up on that side and said, &#x201C;You could never get a finer team; we are completely united under our great leader, Strauss,&#x201D; and it was not many years later that they got rid of their great leader Strauss and eventually the Progressives left them. Now they lose a man like Mr. Odell and a man like Senator Groenewald. I remember who the people were who used to call upon the Conservative members to resign their seats&#x2014;the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), Mr. Harry Lawrence and Mr. Cope. But as soon as they formed the Progressive Party did they resign their seats? Sir, I would say to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) that he must not resign his seat; he must not embarrass the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), because when the hon. member for Umhlatuzana resigned from the Labour Party and crossed over to the United Party, he was told by them that on no account must he resign his seat. If the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) resigned therefore he would only embarrass the hon. member for Umhlatuzana terribly.

He said that the fact that we ignored world opinion was creating a lack of confidence in South Africa.

<p>&#x2026; or that we should be a multi-racial Parliament and a politically multi-racial State, if the hon. member likes that term better? The hon. member says that it is because of our policy that there is a lack of confidence in South Africa. Sir, I remember how, when the partnership plan was mooted in the Rhodesias it was claimed to be similar to the ideals of the Opposition party in this country. If there is one country which has tried not to ignore world opinion it is Southern Rhodesia which forms part of the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland. And what has happened? Today Southern Rhodesia has 14 Black members of Parliament&#x2014;not eight. Southern Rhodesia went to the United Nations to argue its case. It was represented there not only by Whites but by Blacks as well. And do you know what happened? Sir Edgar Whitehead said that in a matter of ten or 15 years he could say that Southern Rhodesia would be a country that would be governed by the Black men. He made that statement, that promise, at the United Nations. Can anybody go further than that in an effort to satisfy world opinion? And what was the voting at the United Nations? They turned Sir Edgar Whitehead down flat by 81 votes to two. I think Portugal and South Africa were the only two countries which supported Southern Rhodesia. In spite of all this the hon. member comes here and says that we must bow down to world opinion.</p>

My quarrel with hon. members of the Opposition, Sir, is this: If the hon. member for Constantia had said, &#x201C;in the international field South Africa must stick to her guns; the Opposition and the Government must stand together and in that way we can win the confidence of the world in South Africa,&#x201D; then I would have had nothing to say about it.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister of Finance is asking for an appropriation of R325,000,000. The seriousness of the position is epitomized by the speech to which we have had to listen in the last 10 minutes. If in these times when we are concerned with the rising cost structure and when we are concerned with inflation and with a manpower shortage we have to listen to an outburst such as we have had here from the hon. the Minister of Information, then I think the sooner we turn to serious financial subjects the better.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) has indicated in his opening remarks that the financial position of the country is buoyant, but we are entitled when examining the position to look at the realities of the situation. Let us look at it from the point of view of the external position. As far as the external world is concerned we still have restriction on the movement of capital in this country. The Minister, in his opening remarks, gave no indication as to when those capital restrictions are to be lifted. It is perfectly <span class="col_797-798" refersTo="page_0413"/>clear, in spite of what has been said by the hon. the Minister of Information, that there is still an out flow of capital in this country. If the Minister, instead of looking at his Information Department, would look at the Reserve Bank report he will see that they say this in their quarterly bulletin of statistics&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The net private capital outflow from this country was R23,000,000 &#x2026; An analysis of capital movements revealed that there was an inflow of R5,000,000 as a result of the reduction of South African assets abroad, but the foreign capital amounting to R28,000,000 flowed out of the country.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are entitled to examine the so-called boom in the country and the movement of capital. We should like to know from the Minister of Finance&#x2014;although he has a favourable balance of payments position of R509,500,000&#x2014;what he regards as a safe figure? How much longer is he going to continue with exchange control and import control at the present level? We still have a difference between the price of South African shares on the London market and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. There is a margin. That is an indication, in spite of all the assurances from the Minister of Information, that there is still some doubt in the outside world as far as South Africa is concerned because of the Government. The Minister of Information cannot charge us, as he has done, with being un-South African because we criticize this Government: We are quite entitled to criticize this Government and we are not being un-South African when we do so. From the facts of the situation it is quite clear that there is a difference between the prices of the South African shares on the London market and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. That is a measure of the outside world&#x2019;s lack of confidence in investing in South Africa. It is true that there are funds invested in this country; it is true that there are industries coming to South Africa, but I shall deal with that at a later stage.</p>

<p>We talk about this boom but what comfort is the boom to the old-age pensioner, the old-age pensioner who has the additional difficulty of struggling with the authorities to get some reasonable interpretation of the means test? We have a large army of civil servants. That army is growing every year as the Government introduces bureaucratic controls. These civil servants have no share in this boom or is it contemplated that they will have a share in it? We talk about a manpower shortage. The hon. member for Constantia has referred to that. There is a shortage of skilled manpower, but what about the many thousands of unskilled workers surrounding our towns, workers who are unemployed because of the shortage of skilled manpower? Anybody who knows the position in Natal to-day will tell you, Sir, that there are many thousands of Asiatics who are unemployed. I am sorry the Minister of Indian Affairs is not here to-day. While, on the one hand, he had offered them this council, on the other hand, he has offered no solution to the many thousands of unemployed Indians. So long as these people want bread, so long as they want shelter, so long as they cannot find employment, although many of them are educated and qualified, so long can we say that the boom is not as good as it should be.</p>

<p>I should like to know from the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs to what extent he is going to assist with controlling the cost spiral. The Minister of Economic Affairs has to tell the country in the course of this debate what it cost the country to bring the Lord organization here. What did it cost the country to establish that industry apart from the assistance which has been given by the I.D.C.? Here is a border industry established approximately eight miles outside East London. East London is a border town; Durban is not. What did it cost the country? Some say 5s. a shirt; others say 3s. a shirt. What favourable conditions were extended to that factory? What rentals does that factory pay? What financial benefits are given to that organization? What is the South African public paying in increased cost of living in order to establish that industry here? That is masked to-day because we are not given the full information. We are told the I.D.C. is concerned and what assistance it may give to individual firms that come to it is not a matter which concerns this Parliament. Another member on this side has referred to that earlier on in the debate in general terms. We are entitled to ask the Minister of Economic Affairs what responsibility he takes regarding the cost spiral, or how does he expect to contend with it? As long as costs are rising, the period of this boom can be limited, because the principal asset of this country is gold and the price of gold is fixed. The spiral of industrial costs will narrow the margin of profit which the gold-mining industry can expect because the gold mines in South Africa, as the Minister knows, are one of the principal consumers of our industrial products. We find the cost structure rising. The building industry has made it perfectly clear that it is in difficulties; there is competition in that industry for labour. I was in Durban only yesterday where a large chain store had recently obtained a licence to open a shopping centre. It decided to put out the contract to tender. The contract is somewhere in the vicinity of &#x00A3;150,000-&#x00A3;200,000. Shall we say R300,000? When the tenders closed yesterday there was not a single tender; no builder in Durban tendered for the job. When tenders were called for a big housing scheme last week three of the biggest building contractors in the country who regularly tendered for schemes of this kind did not want to have anything to do with it. Builders and quantity surveyors are already adding something like 20 per cent to 25 per cent to their estimates of costs. That means that the cost of housing will be paid for by the ordinary man in the <span class="col_799-800" refersTo="page_0414"/>street, some of whom are not feeling this boom. I should like to know from the Minister of Economic Affairs whether he is allied to this and what remedy he proposes. This is his responsibility. He is in a position to tell us because his Industrial Development Corporation is competing with private enterprise indirectly. When an industry is encouraged to come to this country, because it is essential to this country or because no similar industries operate in the country then the I.D.C. will be fulfilling its function. But when the I.D.C., through encouraging industries to come here in competition with existing ones, it contributes to the inflation of costs of this country. There is another section which is contributing to inflation and that is the Defence Department. The Defence Department is placing contracts for Defence equipment. I should like to know from the Minister of Economic Affairs whether his Department has any say in regard to the costs incurred by the Department of Defence. We know the market is limited and we should like to know whether the Minister envisages any control over prices for contracts for Defence works or does Defence enjoy top priority with no restrictions as long as the items concerned are produced as soon as possible? We know what happened in the last war when attempts were made to try to exercise control of the prices of Defence requirements. To-day there is large-scale spending on the part of some Government Departments as well as large-scale spending by private industry. We have this large-scale spending at a time when there is a shortage of manpower and that has all the ingredients for an inflationary cost spiral. I should like to know from the Minister of Economic Affairs whether he has any solution. It is all very well for the Minister of Information to try to make propaganda for his side. It is as easy to slip out of a boom as it is to try to contain it. It is the job of the Government not to slip out of the boom but to contain it. It is their job to ensure that all the factors, material, labour and capital are there so that the requirements of the country can be met within the capacity of the people to pay. We have already got the signs of inflation and we should like to know from the Minister of Economic Affairs whether he has any remedy, whether he admits that the warnings given by organized commerce, by the Master Builders Association, by commerce and industry, by the various workers&#x2019; organizations have been justified and whether he is paying any attention to them. Can he tell the country how he proposes to remedy the situation? We cannot afford to have increased productivity at a high cost. If we can have increased productivity and maintain the present cost structure we can all share in the benefits of this boom, if, on the other hand, you have increased productivity and increased costs the inflation that will follow will soon wreck this boom and cause those difficulties which we experienced in the years of the depression. The dangers of inflation are there. The Government knows they are there. I hope that a responsible Minister will indicate, during the course of this debate, that the Government appreciates the threat of this inflation and what steps they propose to combat it. We must be told what constructive measures they are prepared to put before the country so that when we deal with Economic Affairs we can deal with it in a responsible way and not in the irresponsible manner in which this question was dealt with by the Minister of Information.</p>

<speech by="#luttig">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LUTTIG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not deal with his speech immediately. I shall do so during the course of my speech. The United Party have to-day come forward with a new plan. In the first place, we had a lengthy speech by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), a speech which was aimed at doing nothing else, Sir, than to throw suspicion on our flourishing economy. I find it remarkable that it should just be at this critical stage where we have to cope with so much hostility on the international political front that the Opposition should avail themselves of this opportunity to represent to the world outside that the period of prosperity we are experiencing at the moment is something which we shall probably not be able to maintain. You cannot help but get the very strong impression, Sir, that they are only trying to make a little political capital out of it. Instead of painting the correct picture to the world as to the scope and the meaning of this economic upsurge the impression is created, as the hon. member for Constantia has done, that it is just by chance that we are experiencing this revival; that it is due to private initiative; that it is not the Government&#x2019;s policy which is responsible for it. The hon. member for Constantia came to the conclusion that it was very doubtful whether we would be able to maintain this prosperity. I say it is a great pity Sir. In the past when the hon. Opposition had an opportunity of criticizing us because the tempo of growth was not fast enough, which was due to many factors which I do not want to go into now, they criticized us very strongly. Now that we have the opportunity of enjoying a period of prosperity they cast doubts on our flourishing economy. I say it is a great pity that, at this stage, a stage when we must show a united front to the world, the Opposition should paint a distorted picture to the world outside.</p>

<p>Their second plan is to ignore the fiscal policy of the Government completely and simply to ascribe this prosperity to chance, to private initiative, private effort, but not to the fiscal policy of the Government. I shall return to this point at a later stage. What fits into this plan admirable is the fact that the United Party first of all announces their campaign in the Press. Last Friday the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) had an article in the <i>Argus</i> in which he already prepared the ground for this plan. The heading of this article is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_801-802" refersTo="page_0415"/>South Africa has reason to be cautious about prosperity.</block>

<p>He concludes with exactly the same idea as that expressed by the hon. member for Constantia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Both these threats to our future have a common origin. They rise from fear about the ultimate political stability of the country.</block>

<p>Do you notice how admirably they fit it in, Sir? Exactly what the hon. member for Yeoville, their main propagandist&#x2014;as a matter of fact also chief financial adviser to the United Party&#x2014;says in the Press in preparing the ground, is followed up in this House by this attack. I say it is a pity that we have to witness this painful spectacle. I do not say that there is no ground for criticism; there is room for justifiable criticism, but not to create the impression that this period of prosperity is only of a temporary nature. On the contrary, as far as economical prosperity is possible the Government will, as in the past, stick to its guns and see to it that the tempo of our growth is sufficient to maintain our standard of living.</p>

<p>I think there are a few important aspects of our economy to-day which should be emphasized. The first aspect is that of rising prices. The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) in particular emphasized that. I do not say that we do not have problems as far as that is concerned. What I find peculiar, however, is that when we try to apply a certain measure of price control, it is the Opposition who objects to it. We had that a few days ago. We now have a great hullabaloo about it in this debate. Here I have a publication by S.A.F.T.O. (South African Foreign Trade Organization) in which there is a very interesting article to prove that South African prices are still the lowest in the world. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to an international cost of living survey completed overseas the prices of essential commodities in South African cities rank amongst the lowest in the world.</block>

<p>They then give a complete table setting out the various comparable prices in the various cities. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, as far as the question of prices is concerned it is naturally a question which gives us cause for concern, but the aspect which I regard as important, an aspect which the Opposition forgets, is that before the present-day price increases came into operation they were proceeded by salary increases. They want to present the position as if we have had those price increases without any salary increases. The attack by the Opposition is characterized by something else. Where we have warned against inflationary tendencies in the past the United Party have always belittled us. In one budget after another it was strongly emphasized that the people should be on their guard against inflation. We also gave the lead in our fiscal policy how to combat inflation. To-day those hon. members are the people who shout the loudest about a possible inflationary tendency. I can assure hon. members that the hon. the Minister of Finance is wide awake to this situation, a situation against which he warned last year. Another characteristic of our economy at this stage is our growing export trade, something which was completely ignored by the Opposition in their attack, except for what the hon. member for Yeoville says in this article of his. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It behoves South Africa to guard against economic isolation a consequence of Government policy.</block>

<p>It is no longer only ordinary political isolation, Sir, it is taken further and we are now heading for economic isolation. Mr. Speaker, I can prove to you how generous this Government is by drawing your attention to a simple pencil. Here I have a pencil in my hand which I think is issued to every member of the House. On the one side is printed &#x201C;R of S.A.&#x201D; and on the other side &#x201C;Czechoslovakia&#x201D;. We are still keeping in touch, even with nations who are on the point of boycotting us, nations who are violently opposed to us, by using pencils from behind the Iron Curtain in the highest Forum in this land.</p>

<p>To be a little more serious, Mr. Speaker. We know it is the privilege of the Opposition to talk nonsense but my problem is how long can the Opposition continue talking nonsense. They are literally accusing us of economic isolation. Let me just for a moment compare our export trade statistics. Let me take the years 1958 and 1962 as example. In 1958 22.6 per cent of our exports went to Africa. In 1962 the figure was 15.3 per cent. It is clear that there was a decline. We know what the reasons were. It is unnecessary for me to give the reasons. The House knows about the various attempts that were made to boycott us. In 1958 59.7 per cent of our exports went to Europe. In 1962 the figure was 58.2 per cent. A small difference; the figure has practically remained the same. In 1958 10.3 per cent of our exports went to America and 11.7 per cent in 1962, which was an increase. But listen to this, Mr. Speaker; whereas our exports to Asia only constituted 5.8 per cent of our export trade in 1958 it had risen to 13.4 per cent in 1962. Therefore, where there has been a decline in our exports to Africa on the one hand, we have effectively made up for that by expanding our export market in Asia. Now the hon. member charges us with economic isolation! This is further proof that it was not by chance that there has been such a change in our exports. That was the result the Government deliberately aimed at under its policy. These missions that were sent and the attempts made by the Government all contributed to compensate us for the decline in our export trade with Africa by expanding our markets in Asia. Really, Mr. Speaker, there is not the slightest sign of economic isolation.</p>

<p><span class="col_803-804" refersTo="page_0416"/>Then I come to a third aspect, a point which was raised by the hon. member for Constantia in particular, when he referred, I can almost say, to the reckless extravagance of the people. He emphasized that repeatedly and the hon. member for Yeoville says the following in the article to which I have referred&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result consumers&#x2019; spending increased by about R400,000,000 in 1963.</block>

<p>The United Party now says it is because the people have no confidence in the Government that they are spending. Literally the hon. member for Yeoville also says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is so much uncertainty about life in South Africa to-day that we should not be blamed if, as a people, we decide to live merrily while we can, enjoy the present wave of prosperity while it lasts and to let the future take care of itself.</block>

<p>That is the picture which is sent overseas, Mr. Speaker. That is why I objected so strenuously at the beginning of my speech to the attitude of the United Party. What is the actual position? Had the hon. member for Yeoville only taken the trouble of once again reading the Budget speech of last year he would have realized that the main object of that Budget was to encourage spending. The concessions made in last year&#x2019;s Budget were aimed at encouraging spending thereby increasing the tempo of development. The year prior to that we were not in the position to do that because that tendency was still absent. The tendency then was to save. That was why the hon. the Minister of Finance made concessions in his Budget last year. The object was to encourage the consumer to spend thereby encouraging the tempo of development. Had that result not been achieved by the attempts made by the Government last year and had there been a tendency to save in spite of those attempts, then it could have been said that the public did not have confidence in the policy of the Government and in the stability of the future. Then it would have been logical to come to that conclusion, but really it is not logical to come to the conclusion, to which the hon. member for Constantia came this afternoon and to which the hon. member for Yeoville comes in that article of his. These things are only happening as a result of Government policy. The fact that hon. members are so quick to criticize once again proves that they do not understand the crux of the whole matter.</p>

<p>As far as the future is concerned, the future which gives the hon. member for Constantia so much cause for concern and in regard to which he drew such Jeremiah-like conclusions, I wish to refer him to the Economic Research Bureau of the University of Stellenbosch which said the following in a recent report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the first time private industry and commerce are in the lead in this revival, because agriculture and mining were previously regarded as the leaders.</block>

<p>As a result of the policy followed by the Government a change has taken place, a change which was envisaged. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this connection the Economic Research Bureau of the University of Stellenbosch estimates that the contribution to the net national income by private manufacturing industries will increase by 8 per cent in 1963-4 whilst the joint contribution of agriculture and mining is only expected to increase by 4 per cent. The bureau moreover expects that whereas this revival in 1963 can in the main be ascribed to increased spending on consumer goods it will be characterized in 1963 by an increased tempo in investment.</block>

<p>The hon. members of the Opposition tell us that the public do not want to invest, that they only want to spend because they have no confidence in the future. Mr. Speaker, there are other aspects I can touch upon in respect of what hon. members have mentioned, but time does not permit me to do so.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to reiterate that the nation can be grateful for the fact that things have worked out the way the Government planned; that just at this stage of our national history we can show to the world not only a dynamic national economy but also a strong and forceful economy which commands the respect of every businessman and overseas investor, an economy which makes it very difficult for our enemies on the political front to carry out their plans. It is the task of the Opposition to criticize where they feel they should but I appeal to them not to interpret the facts surrounding our economic development and our economic stability in such a way that it will create the impression in the world outside that it is something temporary and something inherently weak.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down I am sure will forgive me if I do not follow his train of thought. It will be dealt with by later speakers on this side of the House.</p>

<p>I want to raise certain issues regarding expenditure, affecting the Part Appropriation proposals very much indeed, but which concern another part of the country&#x2019;s activities and economy. I want to deal with certain aspects of expenditure on defence and to try and elicit some information for the House and the country in regard to very important matters in that respect. Defence to-day, Sir, is the biggest single-spending Department of the state; its expenditure of necessity has grown, until to-day we are faced with figures which even ten years ago we would have probably hesitated even to consider. Including the present year&#x2019;s expenditure, and not allowing for the largely increased Budget which the hon. Minister of Finance has told us is coming <span class="col_805-806" refersTo="page_0417"/>in the new Estimates, this Parliament has voted this Government something in the region of R1,500,000,000 for expenditure in order to put the defences of this country into a proper condition. That has been the total amount authorized by Parliament in what I term direct defence expenditure. Added to that, there is the hidden cost incurred by other Departments. And when I refer to &#x201C;hidden&#x201D;, I do not mean it is hidden away purposely, but it is expenditure incurred by other Departments, not debited to Defence, but which has become necessary due to the expansion of Defence and its requirements. I am thinking of the Public Works Department and half a dozen other Departments which are forced into far larger expenditure on account of having to meet defence requirements. When we take all those hidden costs into account, the unknown costs of defence, and add those to the straightforward direct defence requirements, which I have already mentioned, it would be quite a fair proposition to say that during the last 13 years this Parliament has had to authorize the Bill for something like R3,000,000,000 expenditure on Defence requirements.</p>

<p>As the Opposition, one of our responsibilities is to see that the country is indeed getting due value for that expenditure, that the country is gaining in security. It is relatively very large expenditure when one takes into account that by and large it is incurred by the White population of the country only. Added to the direct Defence expenditure there is also the very heavy expenditure increase in connection with our Police, Prisons and other such Votes, all of which have some definite link with the security of the State, particularly when it comes to the internal unrest aspect of defence. These all have to be taken into consideration when we are dealing with defence expenditure. Sir, the only real test of course to find the answer as to whether your defence organization is efficient or not, is the acid test of war itself. That is a test, I am sure, we all hope we will never see applied&#x2014;not for any doubt of its efficiency, but for the inevitable damage which war must bring, no matter who wins or loses. It is a test nobody wants to see applied. But there is an intermediate test that one can apply and that is the check that I am going to ask for. It is a check based on reliable and authoritative statements and progress reports made at the very top level, Cabinet level. You see, Sir, the country has in the last year or so had far too many defence statements and defence reports made by this, that and the other official, or this, that and the other news agency, statements not bearing the imprint of official authority. All able to be denied when some argument developed about them, leaving the country still very much in the dark as to what actually is transpiring. I want to make full allowance for the hon. Minister&#x2019;s difficulties where he is bound in certain respects by matters affecting national security, where he is limited in the amount of information that he can give. One accepts that in the case of defence. You cannot talk about these things quite as openly as you can about ordinary matters. But there are a number of directions in which this Parliament as representatives of the country has a right to expect fuller information than what we get.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Can you give us the aspects in regard to which I can give more information?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I will deal with that as I go on, but the hon. Minister himself should be much better aware than I am as to the amount of official information that he can give without impairing the security of the State. His Department are the only people who have the real information available to give to the country. It is not the Opposition. We are trying to get such information. I gave the hon. Minister, on behalf of this side of the House last year a suggestion that a practical means of transmitting this information could be the formation of a special Defence Select Committee of the House based on the British and American practice, a select committee where defence matters could be more freely discussed, matters which could not be discussed in the open House. Parliament as a whole, through its committee, could get the necessary information, whilst at the same time there would be much closer co-ordination and co-operation in defence matters. After I had made the appeal in the course of debate, the hon. Minister gave us the assurance that this proposal would be looked into and that within certain limitations he would see what could be done, but we have heard nothing further about it. I would like the hon. Minister to tell us what progress, if any, has been made, or what decision the Government has come to in regard to that suggestion, which appears to us to be a perfectly sound and feasible one, based on established practice&#x2014;it has worked well in countries which have a far greater defence liability than ours. It is true that from time to time we are treated to bits and pieces in information reports and newspapers, as for instance that the Government has purchased Canberra bombers or Mirage planes, or various other items of equipment. But they are all in dribs and drabs, with no real authoritative statement as to how far we are making progress in that respect. There is also no real authoritative statement as to what the Government&#x2019;s general strategic policy upon which its defence organization is being built up. Here I am not touching at all on the question of internal disorder, or any internal trouble. I think we accept that the Government has to-day built up its organization to a pitch where the forces responsible&#x2014;the police, with the auxiliary forces attached to the police&#x2014;are sufficiently trained, equipped and sufficiently mobile to deal with practically any type of internal disorder which might occur. I am dealing more particularly with the threat to the country from any form of external aggression. There is no question about it. It is a threat which is steadily increasing <span class="col_807-808" refersTo="page_0418"/>in proportion to the success which the countries which no longer like us are achieving in driving us into a perilous and dangerous isolation.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister has asked me whether I could give him a lead as to certain things that he could safely disclose. I think that this is one case where it is time that the hon. Minister of Defence should take the country more into his confidence. After all it is the life of the country that depends on the success or otherwise of his plans. He should take the country into his confidence in regard to the general form of any practical aggression which the Government feels could develop from an external source or sources. One would assume that the Government&#x2019;s strategic plan is based on dealing with that general form of aggression. It is true that with the rapidity of changes taking place on the Continent of Africa that any possible type of aggression changes almost overnight. But something the country would like to know is: Whom are we arming against, from what direction do we expect aggression might develop, in what direction is it practicable for aggression to develop and what general plan do we propose to deal with it? What is the Government&#x2019;s broad assessment as to the possible nature and direction of such a threat and in the mind of the Government does such a threat really exist? Probably the hon. Minister could also give the country some assurance in regard to whether or not he is able to get the equipment necessary to fit in with the Government&#x2019;s strategic plan. We know the difficulties experienced there. And not only the equipment, but also the replacements which are necessary to keep that equipment in order and operation, repairs beyond the capacity of our own country. These are some points that I think in general could be touched on and a reassuring statement made to the country, maybe, without disclosing the actual source or individual from whom purchases are made. It goes without saying that the hon. Minister would not want to disclose such sources at the moment. Although one can appreciate the hon. Minister&#x2019;s difficulties in this respect, I want to strike a note of warning that over-emphasis of secrecy, particularly in regard to defence matters, the too widespread application of a blanket of silence, can actually react, when it is overdone, to the detriment of defence, to the lowering of the over-all morale of the country itself. The morale of the nation and the people, who due to lack of reliable information, are unable to gauge for themselves just how secure they have a right to assume themselves to be. There is probably no form of State activity of any government which is more subject to or more a target for the activities of the financial tout, the black marketer and that type of person, than the purchasing activities of a defence organization. That is under ordinary conditions. We are not under ordinary conditions. This country to-day is under what I might term extraordinary conditions when it comes to the purchase of defence material. We are in the unfortunate position of being unpopular, isolated, and in many respects the subject of bans and all sorts of restrictions placed on such purchases. Facing the threat of more restrictions which makes the defence job even more difficult. Therefore the Minister and his Department, the people responsible in his Department for dealing with these supply matters are in a much more difficult and vulnerable position than their similar confreres would be in any other state working under normal conditions. Much of the needs of his Department makes it a much more attractive target for these people than usual. The hon. the Minister himself must be well aware that there is a growing volume of unfortunate (I say so advisedly) rumour, surmise and conjecture about alleged malpractices in the procurement of defence equipment. We have had certain of such activities in this country. These will be dealt with by another member in this debate, but I want to refer to certain rumours and statements which have been published, fairly widespread, of the fact that South Africa has been led into buying inferior equipment at excessive prices on the advice of black market touts. In other words that we were forced to obtain certain of our equipment through the black market. It may be exaggerated, as these things usually are, but that does not say that there is not something in it. And the position certainly is not helped by certain news items published in the Government Press, Press controlled by the Cabinet, and in some cases by the Prime Minister. When one sees these statements published in that Press, one accepts that there is some substratum of truth in them, and I think the hon. the Minister would be fully justified in giving much more top-level official information regarding defence matters, particularly these matters I have mentioned and also the assurance, that if such a position unfortunately does exist, there will be no more secrecy in regard to it, that the individuals concerned will be dealt with according to law and punished according to law, irrespective of any other factors. This is a most important matter.</p>

<p>I want to touch on another aspect and that is the complete change which has taken place over the last month or six weeks in the strategic position of our own country <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> Africa as a whole, the events in Zanzibar and up north in Tanganyika, the mutinies in the other African states. Every one of them has a distinct bearing on the future of South Africa. They impose a distinct new responsibility on defence. Here we have the first foothold of Communism in Africa, or in a territory adjacent to Africa. That has brought our own country well within the practical range of guided missiles. I have seen it said that Zanzibar is a second Cuba. That remains to be seen, but it well could be, and it could well be that some new evaluation of defence requirements will have to be taken to meet this new situation. Flowing from it, there is the question of the whole organization of the port system of this country, the sea route <span class="col_809-810" refersTo="page_0419"/>round this country. We have to accept from the lessons of the past that it has to be realized that as far as the Suez Canal is concerned as a sea route, that as far as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea is concerned, they are no longer available in time of emergency. They will be under communistic or united Arabian and North African control. As far as the Western World is concerned, they will no longer exist. Therefore our own coast-line comes right into the forefront. I have heard it mentioned by people as something to be proud of, something that will bring defence aid to South Africa. It may do, but it also brings terrific responsibilities to us, and new dangers to this country if we become the world route to the East. It will throw a huge load on every port in this country. It was something I had to do with during the last world war, and I know what the position was even in those days. To-day our ports are already straining and groaning under the increased load of commercial traffic. What is going to happen when suddenly we are confronted with that other load of strategic sea transport? Is there any provision being made at all to meet it? Is there any investigation, any examination, any attempt being made to begin to equip the ports for this load which we will have to carry? Because our security will depend on its efficiency, just as much as that of any other country. These are vital points to the security of this country.</p>

<p>One last point I want to touch on very briefly is the question of the trainees and the call-ups. We have an increase in the number of lads called up straight from school each year, and there is a growing wave of anxiety amongst parents, amongst educationists, amongst many other authorities of the growing impact being made on the economy of the country by this call-up, as well as the terrific impact which is being made upon the boys themselves. In the limited time at my disposal I am only going to touch on one or two points. There is the question of whether the best use is being made of the boys that are being called up. Military, naval and air services to-day are no longer what they used to be in the days when the bad boy of the family was sent to serve in the Army or Navy. To-day it is a highly developed scientific warfare that we are training for, and you have got to pick the best boys for the job. What the House and the country would like some assurance on is that there is a sufficiently coordinated system at work to sift out the boys after they receive their call-up orders, to sift them according to ability into those units and callings where they can be most useful. In other words, that you will not send the matriculated boy who is waiting to go to the university into a footslogging r&#x00E9;giment to which a much inferior educated boy could go, and that you would not sent the boy with the inferior education to a r&#x00E9;giment where highly scientific attainments are required. You use the best of your human material at your disposal for the best service it is capable of rendering. I would like to know from the hon. Minister whether that is being done. I would like to know also: In the training camps themselves, are there sufficient properly qualified vocational guidance officers with whom these youngsters can consult about their future careers, to give them some guidance? That is one of the most important parts of training. When this side of the House agreed to this call-up system, the hon. Minister might remember I told him at that time that he was putting himself in the position of the foster-father of these thousands of youngsters and that the responsibility for their future, not only their military career, would rest upon his shoulders. I want to ask him to-day whether these matters are being properly looked after? Is there any provision for studying in the camps for those who wish to get away quietly to study, out of the general hurly-burly of a military camp?</p>

<p>One last question: Are there ample facilities for physical recreation? We have been getting reports that there is a substantial lack of these facilities. That can be dangerous. These youngsters are full of spirit. The very military training they are undergoing helps to develop that. They require an outlet and there is nothing better than physical recreation. Yet take a place like Youngsfield here in the Peninsula. Football fields are probably the cheapest form of recreation you can get. But my information is that there is not even a pair of goal posts that they can kick at. They have to do with anything they can scrape together themselves. That does not give much confidence in the overall picture. These are important aspects of those boys&#x2019; future. They have got to come back into civil life, and they should come back with as little unsettling impact as possible, of their military training on the civil side of their life. I would ask the hon. Minister to have the whole of that aspect investigated and see that there is sufficient being done, and being done quickly enough in order to meet the requirements of these thousands of young South Africans that we are calling up.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member said the following in his speech&#x2014;he alleged that during the time the National Party had been in power approximately R3,000,000,000 had been spent on defence. He then asked the Minister whether the latter could name any practical aggressor who could have been the reason for that expenditure. In the third place the hon. member objected to the strict secrecy that was maintained in respect of defence matters. The hon. member then went on and expressed his concern about certain malpractices in the Defence Force or in connection with the Defence Force, Then he referred to the training and the people who were trained, and he concluded by expressing his concern about the physical relaxation facilities, or the lack of them. I cannot reply to all those points but I want to react to two of them. How well we know the Opposition is proved by the fact that I knew yesterday already <span class="col_811-812" refersTo="page_0420"/>what the hon. member was going to say today and that is why I want to reply to two aspects raised by the hon. member in his speech. The first is the expenditure of approximately R3,000,000,000 and I want to bring it into line with something else the hon. gentleman said, namely, our changed position, the change which has taken place recently. I think it is essential for us to view the necessity of increasing our Defence Vote more and more against the background of our changed strategic position as a result of certain happenings during the past years, particularly during the past few months. The necessity to call upon the nation to be willing to spend to the utmost in order to meet that expenditure stems from an appreciation of our position. The military position of the Republic has changed significantly during the past year. I want to mention the following in an appraisal of the position and that is in line with our whole position. The first point I want to mention is the hold Communism has gained in the Atlantic Ocean, in Cuba and on the West Coast of Africa by means of the submarine bases it has built and practically completed there. The second point I want to mention is the hold which Russia and China have obtained on Egypt at the northern gate of Africa. The third is the weakening of the position of the West on the western front of the Mediterranean Sea as a result of the appearance of the unpredictable Ben Bella along the western side of the Mediterranean Sea. The fourth is the large orders placed by China and Russia on the continent of Africa. The fifth is the closer co-operation&#x2014;and this is of great importance as far as the future is concerned&#x2014;between Pan-Africanism and Communism in the struggle against the West and the destructive effect that has on the relationship between the West and Africa and the doors it opens for Chino-Russian infiltration in Africa. The sixth point I want to mention is the hold which Communism has now obtained in the Indian Ocean, within striking distance from our Republic, in Zanzibar. I estimate Zanzibar to be about 1,400 or 1,500 miles from Pretoria. The seventh point I want to mention is the submarine bases which Russia has established along the West Coast of Africa, a fact which must be seen in relation with the severe struggle to gain control over the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The Republic should not regard these occurrences only in the light of a global war, but also in the light of the fact that the front has been moved to a point within striking distance of its own area and that within that distance there are strategically important areas which are under the influence of Communism. Indirectly, the cautiousness or the slackness or unwillingness, under the pressure of other Western nations, to be regarded as an ally or a friend of the Republic, is of no mean significance to us. It must be remembered that the Republic as a stable factor in Africa&#x2014;I maintain that we are the only stable factor in Africa&#x2014;is a thorn in the flesh of those powers who are to-day measuring their strength in Africa, in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Indian Ocean. In view of this changed position and the increased pressure that will be exercised in future, we are compelled to re-appraise our position in respect of our own defence against oppression and in respect of retaliation. When making this re-appraisal and appreciating the fact that we should not do anything that will call upon us to sacrifice our identity and our right of self-determination, we must bear the following in mind: Firstly, that as far as our striking power and our ability to retaliate are concerned we must make ourselves as strong as possible and that the R3,000,000,000 to which hon. members have referred, disappears, like dew in the morning sun, before this necessity which has arisen as a result of this new position. Secondly we must bear in mind that the stronger the Republic is, the more difficult will two other things become. The first is: The stronger the Republic is the more difficult will it be for potential friends or allies to overlook or to underestimate our strategic or military value. Secondly, it will be more difficult for any power or combination of powers to attempt an irresponsible manoeuvre against the Republic. Apart from the indirect military value that may flow from the strengthening of our military forces, such a strengthening of our forces and their ability to defend themselves is of inestimable value to the Republic in the process of making friends or preventing irresponsible combinations of powers which may harbour sinister and aggressive plans against us. We can only benefit by it. In order to be ready for any possible aggression, the Republic should exploit every possible channel to capitalize our strategic position for military purposes without mortgaging a single inch of our soil, and avail itself of the difficult military situation in which other powers find themselves and capitalize its strategic position in the light of their inability; maintain long communication lines in case of difficulty, something which will entail large expenditure, and for the transportation of supplies and military equipment. We must make use of our strategic position and cast that against the background of the lack of any strategic military springboards by other powers that are in trouble. We are very prone to regard ourselves as a small nation and to underestimate ourselves in this connection. In the light of recent events, South Africa has undergone a radical change in respect of her military and strategic position. The struggle in Africa is to get allies that are worth something in the economic and military field. I say we should place our best military product on the market and without sacrificing one iota of our identity we should capitalize everything we have. We should tap all possible capital resources to obtain the best weapons and my reply to the hon. member for Simonstown is this that the money we have spent so far to prepare ourselves and to increase our striking force against the possible potential aggressors he <span class="col_813-814" refersTo="page_0421"/>talked about, is money well spent. I want to add this: Never before in our history has the nation been more prepared to spend money on our defence than to-day. That is my reply to the hon. member. Do not be afraid. Every penny spent on strengthening our defences is in the interests of our fatherland and in the interests of fortifying our position, strategically, in the military and international spheres.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that as far as the purchase of weapons is concerned, experience has shown us that the South African workers and our industries are standing ready. If there are people who are so stupid as to boycott us because of political or international considerations, I think the guarantee of our future war equipment position lies in the readiness and the ability and the willingness to sacrifice on the part of our own country&#x2019;s labour force to provide those supplies. Never before have I faced the future with greater confidence. If we want to capitalize our resources, we have enough resources in the Republic to make ourselves so strong that we shall in future be in a practically unassailable position. My reply to the hon. member in regard to the training and the physical relaxation facilities and in regard to certain alleged malpractices is that those are matters which the hon. member should rather discuss with the Minister personally or with his Department because I do not regard this House as the suitable place to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I trust that the hon. member who has just sat down will not hold it against me if I do not follow him in his poetic appreciation of our strategic difficulties. We have very little time to speak and there are a few other matters which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.</p>

<p>In the first place I very strongly support the plea which has been made by the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) for more information. The Government asks us to vote colossal sums of money for defence, and we have always done so, but we do not have enough information as to how that money is spent and how our Defence Force is trained. That applies to all sides of this House. We want to ask the Minister to devise some method or other by which that information can be given to us.</p>

<p>Another matter that I want to touch upon has also been raised already by the hon. member for Simonstown, namely the irregularities in connection with the purchase of weapons for the Defence Force. Let me say at the outset that there are far too many rumours going around and that far too much suspicion is being cast upon honourable officers and officials in this connection. When matters of this kind are raised it is of no avail to try to hide them behind a veil of secrecy.</p>

<p>I shall come to that later on. Last year we had the case in which the wife of the former Chief of Staff of the army was involved, and immediately thereafter we had the case of Commandant van der Merwe and two others who were accused with him. This case came before the court and the court imposed a comparatively light sentence when one bears in mind the seriousness of the rumours. What I am trying to say is that I think the seriousness of that case was very much exaggerated before it came before the court, otherwise the court would not have imposed such a light sentence. But my point is that the Defence Force as such and the senior officers and public servants were rendered no service by hearing this case in secret or in camera. After the case had been heard the rumours still continued and certain names were still being mentioned. People went so far as to say that this case was heard in camera because there were too many senior people involved and because of the far-reaching nature of these irregularities. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member says that it was nothing but rumour-mongering and I say that that is possible, but the rumours are going around and I am pleading here for the senior officers who are still in the service and whose names have been mentioned and on whom suspicion has been cast. It is not fair towards them. I want to say to the Minister that if such a trial is held in public, then all the dirty linen will be washed in public, and the guilty parties can then be made to pay the penalty for their deeds, that is what we want. As far as the information is concerned which may come out in the course of such a trial, there is nothing which is not already known to the enemies of South Africa. Their Secret Services are such that they know all these things; we would not be divulging any secrets therefore. But I think it is no more than fair towards our Permanent Force officers and senior officials to put an end to this sort of thing.</p>

<p>This secrecy, as the hon. member for Simonstown has already said, recoils on innocent people. I hope that there will be no repetition of this sort of thing, but if it does happen again I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to have these cases heard in public. If that is done we will not have this rumour-mongering. As the hon. member for Simonstown has said, these rumours are still going around. We are <span class="col_815-816" refersTo="page_0422"/>now getting these rumours in the Press which supports the Government. Sir, if you read the <i>Vaderland</i> of 9 January you will see that these rumours are being started afresh. Apparently they are not true, because in reply to a question the Minister told me the other day that he himself did not know of such investigations, but that is what the newspapers say. It is nothing but an attempt to sow distrust, and I think it is very unfair towards the members of the force.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter that I should like to raise, a matter which we must regard as being very serious, and that is the loss of ammunition which took place in the Defence Force last year. I put a question to the Minister the other day and he said in his reply that there had been eight cases involving losses of ammunition and that steps had been taken to ensure that it would not happen again. We accept that statement. But the matter is more serious than that. When we look at the report of the Auditor-General for 1962-3, we find that there was a loss in the Defence Force of 1,200,000 cartridges worth almost R60,000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Was it a loss, or was it a case where no proof could be produced?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>The Auditor-General says that there is no proof, but nevertheless a sum of R59,000 had to be written off. This is an enormous amount of ammunition. It would seem that the ammunition disappeared from the stores and there is no record of it. This is a very serious matter because the first question which one asks oneself is who took this ammunition and what has happened to it. It could very easily fall into the wrong hands. We know from Press reports that certain elements go out of their way to get hold of explosives and ammunition.</p>

<p>Then the next question which occurs to us is this: Can the Minister tell us whether any weapons are missing&#x2014;rifles as well as automatic weapons? No reference is made to it in the report, but one can well imagine that it would not be difficult for an ill-disposed person to lay his hands on weapons and even automatic weapons. Our Citizen Force is armed with automatic weapons and they do not always have the facilities to keep those weapons in safe custody. It may be that some of those weapons have been stolen; we should like to know.</p>

<p>But I come back to this question of ammunition. If it is true that this ammunition is missing, then I think it is necessary that the Minister should not only give us the assurance that steps will definitely be taken to ascertain how it disappeared, but he should find out where it is and if possible it should be recovered. It is an enormous quantity of ammunition. The loss amounted to 1,200,000 cartridges or about 1,000 boxes of ammunition weighing 40 tons. If this ammunition was unlawfully removed from the stores, then it must have been an organized theft, and if that is the case it is of the utmost importance that it should be recovered. We cannot allow this ammunition to be used later on for unlawful purposes.</p>

<p>Then there is another small matter which I should like to touch upon, one to which reference is also made in the report of the Auditor-General, and that is in connection with the Nautical College at Gordons Bay. We notice that in 1962 the number of pupils dropped from 78 to 26 and the cost of training per individual naturally increased from R697 to more than R1,900. I wonder whether the Minister can tell us where the fault lies; whether we cannot get the recruits to take up this course and what attempts are being made to put this very fine institution back onto its feet again.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to support the hon. member for Simonstown when he says that we ought to know more about the training of our Defence Force. We know that when we go to parades on ceremonial occasions we find that these people are excellent; that is all very nice, but we have no proof that these people are being well trained in field work. We do not know whether they are being trained in unitary work or to do manoeuvres in large formations. These are all points on which we should like to have information, for no other purpose than to be reassured that these people are being well trained. The fact that we are spending large sums is no guarantee that we have a strong army to safeguard our position. We want more information and we want to know that that money is being spent in the right way and that the right training is being given.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down was quite right when he made one point after another and said that he just wanted to bring one further small matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The matters that he brought to the attention of the hon. the Minister were really not important. But I do want to reply to a few of the points he raised.</p>

<p>In the first place the hon. member followed the same course as the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) by saying that the Opposition want much more information from the hon. the Minister about defence matters. It was also suggested that a defence committee should be set up. He referred to what the hon. the Minister said last year&#x2014;that he would investigate this matter. There may be a great deal to be said for such a committee. As I understand the Opposition, what they really want is a committee to obtain information on defence matters from the Minister. I want to put this question to the Opposition. Will those members of the committee who are members of the Opposition, and the committee members on the Government side, not be placed in an embarrassing position? They will have information which would otherwise have been supplied to all of us, because I take it that any information that can be released can be released whether through the medium of the <span class="col_817-818" refersTo="page_0423"/>Press or in this House in reply to questions or by way of policy statements by the Minister. It is therefore not this sort of information that the Opposition want; they want more confidential information. In that case I say that I believe that that kind of confidential information ought to remain in the hands of the Minister and the General Staff. But if the hon. the Minister decides otherwise then it is his affair.</p>

<p>I want to discuss another point raised by the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst). He referred to the trial of Commandant van der Merwe in regard to the purchase of weapons. The hon. member said quite correctly that suspicion was cast on people who should never be under suspicion but he himself sowed more suspicion this afternoon than was necessary. He asked why the trial of Commandant van der Merwe was held <i>in camera</i> and he created the impression that it was the wish of the Department of Defence or the Department of Justice or the Minister that this case should be held <i>in camera</i>. The hon. member is aware of the fact the Judge said that he did not think that it was in the public interest that the case should be heard in public.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>The Judge said that he did not think that it was in the public interest to have a public trial. Those hon. members are always talking about the inviolability of the courts, why then do they sow suspicion here by saying that it should have been a public trial when it was the Judge who made that decision? It is not fair on the part of the hon. member. I think he must realize that when a Judge, in consultation with the State Prosecutor, knowing the charge and having certain information before him, decides that a case of this nature should be held <i>in camera</i>, the hon. member must accept that fact in the interests of defence.</p>

<p>Another matter in regard to which the hon. member also sowed suspicion was in connection with the report of the Public Accounts Committee of last year in regard to the large quantities of ammunition which are allegedly missing. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) also had the privilege of serving on that committee and he also asked certain questions. I am referring now to a report that has already been published and that is why it is in order for me to do so. The impression was never given that that ammunition was stolen and the hon. member for Hillbrow knows that. The impression that was given was that no invoices had been signed for that ammunition.</p>

<p>Why was it written off then?</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it had to be written off. That is always the procedure when unauthorized expenditure has been incurred.</p>

<p>But that does not mean that the money was stolen or that it was spent illegally. The impression gained by every member on that Select Committee was that the ammunition had not been stolen but that invoices had not been signed for it. The hon. member for North-East Rand has had experience as a soldier. He has had to deal with Quartermasters who were not Brigadiers but men of quite subordinate rank, who had had no training in bookkeeping. Does he want to tell me that he finds it strange that ammunition should disappear? And remember, this ammunition did not disappear from one store only or from one Command only; it disappeared from stores throughout the whole country.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<p>That is a very poor excuse.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>If it is a poor excuse then it means that poor evidence, wrong evidence, was given before the Select Committee on Public Accounts and that no proper investigation was made. I am speaking here from memory but the hon. member must have the report of the Select Committee on Public Accounts last year before him so he can look it up and tell me whether I am correct or not. There was not the slightest suggestion that theft had been committed. But, Mr. Speaker, I do not say that a single round of ammunition has not been stolen. It may well be that ammunition has been stolen. But in any case, where this sort of thing is brought to the notice of the authorities, when a theft is reported, action is taken just as it has been taken before where other people have committed offences of this nature. They have been charged. That is also the information that the hon. member was given in reply to questions which he placed on the Order Paper a few days ago. One should not in one breath try to suggest that one is the friend of the soldier and that no suspicion should be cast upon him and then in the next breath sow the seeds of suspicion oneself. I know that that is the sort of thing that the hon. member for North-East Rand as a good soldier despised when he was still in the army.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown made a few remarks here about which I would like to say a few words. I have already dealt with the question of the information that he wants on defence matters. I was struck by the following question which the hon. member for Simonstown put to the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Against whom are we arming?&#x201D; He wanted to know against whom we were arming ourselves. I do not want to reply to this question on behalf of the hon. the Minister but I answer it as a South African. My reply is that we are arming ourselves against any enemy who may be stupid enough to want to attack South Africa or who threatens our safety. It makes no difference to us if they are Laplanders. No, I am sorry that I mentioned a name; I should prefer not to mention the name of any particular country in this connection.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the word that I wanted to use; I wanted to say &#x201C;loafers&#x201D;. It makes no difference who it is who tries to threaten South Africa. We are arming ourselves against anyone who threatens South Africa&#x2019;s safety or who is stupid enough to want to attack South Africa. The hon. member asked where the hon. the Minister was obtaining the weapons that we were purchasing. Mr. Speaker, I think that we have daily proof in this regard. The hon. member himself knows what weapons we are purchasing. But there is another statement that we cannot allow to pass unchallenged and that is the hon. member&#x2019;s statement that the secrecy that surrounds our Defence Force may have a detrimental effect upon the people of South Africa; that it may detrimentally effect the morale of the people of South Africa because they do not know how South Africa is placed as far as her defence is concerned. I think that is a completely erroneous statement. Indeed, as I know the public, I believe that their morale is very high to-day. They expect us to be able to challenge the world. I do not think that the hon. member&#x2019;s statement is correct. It is not my intention either to repeat what the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) said. But I want to say this: In my opinion there has never been a time in the history of South Africa when the people have been as determined as they are to-day to defend South Africa against any aggressor with all the power at their command. We find this attitude on the part of all sections of the people and in all parts of the country. [Interjection.] When the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) tells me that I am talking nonsense it means that she is not aware of what is going on in this country. The fact that the hon. the Minister and his General Staff withhold information from the public when they think that it is not in the interests of South Africa to make that information known or when they think that that information can be misused by any possible enemy of South Africa, is something that does not disturb the public of South Africa at all.</p>

<p>Reference has been made repeatedly in previous debates and also in this debate to malpractices that have apparently taken place in our Defence Force. The army, the Permanent Force, is a large undertaking. There are many men in its service; there are many men who are being trained in it. One has to deal with men of many different types in all the branches of the Defence Force. I do not think that they are all little angels because if they were they would probably not be soldiers.</p>

Any member of the Opposition who has any complaints based on information received and who does not go to the Minister or the Department of Justice with that information, is committing an offence. But it is also an offence to start a whispering campaign about members of our Defence Force when they cannot defend themselves here.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Listening to the speeches here this afternoon has given me every opportunity to enter into a first-class argument, but the occasion demands and requires&#x2014;and I appreciate it&#x2014;that a maiden speech should be on a non-controversial subject. May I say that I am glad that on this occasion I do not have to reply to some of the speeches we have heard here. I would, however, say, in dealing with the prosperity of this country that, I have had the opportunity of traversing practically the whole of the Cape Province and I have seen people in all walks of life, particularly the Coloured community and those belonging to the less-privileged classes. I would like to say to the Minister of Finance quite firmly and clearly that the prosperity of which we have heard so much has not filtered down or penetrated to those in the lower income brackets, and I do hope that an effort will be made to ensure that the prosperity which is undoubtedly with us&#x2014;perhaps it could be greater than it is at the moment&#x2014;will be shared by all these people who live within the boundaries of the Republic, who are part and parcel of our Western civilization and who are entitled to a fair share of whatever is produced and whatever is consumed. I must say that in the course of my activities recently I gained first-hand knowledge of the attitude of the Coloured community towards certain policies of the Government. I do not propose to deal with those policies now except to record that separate development, the group areas and job reservation&#x2014;I have thought very hard over the word that I should use because I want to put it in the mildest and nicest way&#x2014;are not favoured by the Coloured community. I hope to have the opportunity on some other occasion of expounding the <span class="col_821-822" refersTo="page_0425"/>views of the Coloured people on these matters which are of such vital importance to them.</p>

<p>Sir, the Republic of South Africa has a Coloured population of 1,500,000. They are part of us, and in this House there are four people charged with the task of looking after their interests and of pleading their case. I hope during my sojourn in this House to be the means of bringing their case fairly and squarely to the attention of the Ministers&#x2019; of the Government in the earnest and firm hope that what I have to say, together with what is said by the other members here who represent the Coloured community, will not fall on deaf ears. A thing which concerned the the Coloured people very seriously in the last few months was the statement by the Prime Minister, a statement to which I merely refer in passing, that there were going to be no concessions and furthermore that they were to have no homeland. It will be my earnest endeavour, tough though the undertaking may be. to persuade the hon. the Prime Minister to make a few concessions because the time has come&#x2014;and I think the Coloured community is in the best position to say what I am now going to say&#x2014;when we should reason together, all of us. We should get to grips with our problems, not on the basis, as they say in Afrikaans, of &#x201C;skelling&#x201D; each other out, because I do not think that helps, but to use a little sweet reasonableness and to realize that concessions must be made because when concessions are not made only demands can be made. Words are the only weapons at our disposal. They are the only weapons we can use or will use. I therefore make this appeal. I say that if we would parley together and discuss our problems in a reasonable way we could live together in peace, harmony and concord but in order to do that, we have to attempt to see the point of view of others who by the grace of God have been thrown amongst us and who live with us and who, for better or for worse, have their future, their welfare and their happiness in our hands.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden), who has just sat down, on his maiden speech. I had the privilege of serving with him in the Cape Provincial Council for several years, and I want to say here that a feature of his whole attitude there was his enthusiasm, whether one agreed with him or not, and since we are at the threshold of a new dispensation in South Africa to-day in respect of our Coloured population, a new dispensation which has been initiated by this Government, I want to express the hope that he will use these fine qualities of his in the right direction for the benefit of the people whom he represents in this House.</p>

<p>I rise really to raise a matter here which is perhaps entirely against the trend of the debate up to the present moment, but it is a matter which in my opinion is appropriate and of real importance. I do not therefore want to react to any of the arguments advanced by the Opposition except to say in passing that although it may sound paradoxical to-day in our present situation, there are two things which are true in respect of the Opposition Party in our present political setup. In the first instance it is true that in our White political set-up the Opposition Party today is nothing but a half-living political anachronism, as it was described on one occasion by the hon. the Minister of Finance. In essence that is what the United Party is to-day in our White political set-up&#x2014;a half-living political anachronism, a powerless party. To use the language of the Bible, we are dealing here really with an Opposition which is like an elk in a trap. But on the other hand it is equally true that never in the history of South African politics has there been a political party whose policy has been so potentially disastrous as that of this Opposition Party. Let me pause for a moment to motivate this statement. We have an Opposition Party here to-day whose policy is to have an undivided State in South Africa. What is the effect of this policy? It is simply this: The United Party with its policy of an undivided State is teaching the large Black Bantu majority in South Africa to aim at Black domination over the whole country. That is the effect of this policy of an undivided State. The United Party is maintaining an image which makes it extremely difficult to canalize Black ambition in this country and to guide it in the direction of separate freedoms.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member can put his question to me outside in the street. Not only is the United Party maintaining this image but it is continually creating a climate which constantly stimulates the expectations and ambitions of the Black majority in the direction of Black domination over the whole country&#x2014;not liberation through division. What the United Party preaches to-day is a one-nation theory, a policy which must result in one thing only and that is eventual Black domination in this country. And what is the effect of the United Party&#x2019;s policy as far as the outside world is concerned? The United Party is prepared to say to the outside world to-day that in South Africa it is prepared to make a start in granting political rights to a Black majority within the same Parliament; in other words, it is creating the impression that the White minority in South Africa is simply another colonial minority which will eventually have to yield to Black ambition. I repeat therefore that what we are dealing with in South Africa to-day on the one hand is a political party, a political anachronism, a party with no influence in South African politics, and on the other hand a party whose policy is potentially more disastrous than that of any party in the history of South African politics.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I leave it at that. The matter which I want to raise here timeously and which I regard as being of very real importance <span class="col_823-824" refersTo="page_0426"/>of the next delimitation of constituencies.</p>

<p>It is true that we recently obtained the figures in respect of the general registration which has just taken place, and I take it that attention will be given towards the end of this year or perhaps early next year to the question of the next delimitation and to the question of the appointment of a Delimitation Commission. The provisional figures which are available at the moment in respect of the recent general registration are disturbing and I ask the Government to give its urgent attention to this matter. Let me deal with the situation as far as the Cape Province is concerned, and let me say here at once that I do not want to approach this matter from a provincial point of view. Let me rather refer therefore to the southern complex of our country. The figures show that if there is to be a delimitation to-morrow on the basis of these provisional figures, the Midlands complex of the Cape will have to forfeit three seats immediately.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to emphasize that these figures are provisional figures, but according to these provisional figures the average quota works out at 11,714, and if one works out the number of voters per province then it comes to 49.25 for the Cape Province. That will mean that at the next delimitation the Cape Province will have three seats fewer which will then bring the number of Cape seats to 49, fewer than ever before in the history of this province. But that is not all. Already there are very strong indications that the Cape may lose a fourth seat. If we take the first interim registration after a general registration and look at the trend revealed there, we find that we run the risk that the Cape Province may very well lose a fourth seat. What is going to happen at a future delimitation once we have forfeited these three seats? We find the following position when we examine the trend followed by previous Delimitation Commissions in the delimitation of constituencies. Take the Prieska constituency, for example. At the last general registration Prieska had 7,877 voters, in other words, 3,896 fewer than the average provincial quota&#x2014;if I may put it that way, although it is not really the correct term. In other words, a constituency such as Prieska has already been unloaded by more than 33 per cent. One finds the same situation in a constituency like Kuruman where there are 8,838 voters&#x2014;3,735 below the average quota. The next one is Cradock with 8,046 voters, that is to say, 3,727 below the average quota. The next one is Graaff-Reinett and then there is also Fort Beaufort, and so I could go on. In other words, it is perfectly clear that these three seats which will have to disappear will have to come from the Midlands complex of the Cape Province. But the story does not end even there. We have this further picture that once the Cape Province has lost these three constituencies&#x2014;and they are constituencies which will probably have to disappear from the Midlands complex of the Cape&#x2014;a further two seats will have to be given up by the Cape Province in the Midlands complex, one to the urban complex of Cape Town and the other to the urban complex of Port Elizabeth. In other words, we are going to find ourselves in this position that at some future delimitation five constituencies will have to disappear from the Cape Midlands complex. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, &#x201C;with tears in my navy-blue eyes&#x201D;, as an old gentleman once said, how are we going to cope with this problem of the depopulation of the platteland?</p>

<p>That will mean that since 1938 we will have lost 11 seats in the platteland complex of the Cape Province; that 11 seats will have disappeared. Section 43 of our Constitution lays down the formula according to which a delimitation must take place. Amongst other things, the following five factors have to be taken into account; a certain amount of weight has to be attached to them. What weight is to be attached to them is left to the discretion of the Delimitation Commission concerned. The one factor is community or diversity of interests, and I maintain that under the present situation we shall not be able to attach any weight to this aspect of the delimitation formula. The next factor is means of communication, which is no longer really a factor in our modern world. The next factor is physical features, a factor which makes the delimitation all the more difficult, as was pointed out by the last Delimitation Commission. The next factor is existing electoral boundaries. What becomes of this factor in the present delimitation formula having regard to the picture which I have outlined here with regard to the southern areas of our country? The fifth factor is sparsity or density of population. In the present situation no effect can be given to this factor either by a delimitation commission. In these circumstances I want to ask whether it has not become urgently necessary for the Government to give its attention to this matter, because the question arises whether our present delimitation formula is not out of date in many respects, and I want to ask whether it is not necessary for us to investigate our present delimitation formula immediately or as soon as possible. I would even go so far as to say that if such a commission of inquiry cannot bring out its report before the next general election we must hold the election in the normal way until such time as such an inquiry can be instituted. I do not want to indicate here what lines should be followed, but there are one or two <span class="col_825-826" refersTo="page_0427"/>aspects which I just want to mention. The first is the question of the size of a constituency. Should this not become a more important determining factor rather than a 15 per cent unloading? Because if it becomes necessary to re-delimit certain constituencies because they are loaded with, say, a few thousand voters and it therefore becomes difficult for members to represent the voters in such constituencies, then the contrary is equally true. May I refer here to the hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. G. de K. Maree). At the moment he represents a constituency the area of which is bigger than that of the whole of the Free State. During the recess he had to go and attend to his work there on behalf of the party which he represents and on behalf of the voters whom he represents. He had to address 92 meetings in this constituency of fantastically long distances. Mr. Speaker, I want to ask whether this matter should not receive our attention. There is the question of maximum loading and unloading. The three previous delimitation commissions tried to preserve a balance between loading and unloading, but they did so on a provincial basis, and although this situation should really benefit the southern part of our country it is very much easier in the particular circumstances to apply that ratio with greater effect in a province like the Transvaal. There may be a third factor, and I mention it here in passing. Is 150 the final number of seats? Since Union the number of seats has been increased by 29 and I do not think anyone of us believes that the present number is the final number. Would we not be able to overcome certain anomalies if we increased this number?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by saying this: In creating a new pattern for the future we in this southern complex of our country form the spearhead. In the eastern parts of this complex we are creating a separate freedom for the Transkeian Bantu. In the Western Cape complex we are engaged in purposeful planning to make the area in which the White man is domiciled more White than it is at present. In this southern complex we also have 95 per cent of our Coloured population in respect of whom the Government is to-day following an entirely new pattern for the future, and I ask whether we in this complex can afford to forfeit more seats in this, our highest legislative assembly.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure that the matter raised here by the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais), who has just resumed his seat, in respect of the future delimitation of constituencies was directed to the Minister of the Interior, and I am sure that the Minister will reply to it. It is a matter which rests with the Government. I know that it is a real problem, and I know that the constituencies in the rural areas in the Cape are becoming increasingly larger. That is a tendency we have noticed increasingly for the past 15 to 20 years already. It has become increasingly clear that those areas in the Cape Province will increasingly become depopulated, with the result that the constituencies will become increasingly larger. But if we as a nation had devoted attention to the rural areas, we would not have landed in this position where the rural constituencies are becoming so large. But I do not want to quarrel with the hon. member in that regard. As I have said, he directed his remarks to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>However, I want to come back to something else which the hon. member said. He said in the beginning of his speech that the policy of the United Party was one of having an undivided state, with the result that in the course of time we would hand over the country to the majority group in terms of the principle of one man, one vote, and that consequently the Black man would eventually govern the country. By implication the hon. member for Moorreesburg of course says that they on that side stand for a divided state; that they want to divide South Africa into compartments&#x2014;compartments for the Black man, for the Coloured and for the White man, and in addition a compartment for the Indians. But what are the facts of the matter? The fact is that the hon. member for Moorreesburg and the Nationalist Party have no reply to the question we have already repeatedly put to them, namely: Where is that state that you want to create for the Coloureds? The hon. the Prime Minister said at Swellendam last year&#x2014;and I quote from the <i>Burger</i> of 21 October 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In so far as the Coloureds are concerned, the problem is quite different. They live together with us in the same area. Therefore separate states is not the solution.</block>

<p>It is therefore admitted that having Coloured separate states is not the solution, but in the meantime, according to Press reports, the Government is creating a super-structure in order to give the Coloureds a separate state. But is that so? Where is it possible to create a separate state for the Coloureds? Where is it possible to create a separate state for the Indians? But the hon. member for Moorreesburg, by implication, intimates that they on that side of the House stand for a divided South Africa. The hon. member says that in essence the United Party itself is responsible for its catastrophes. In other words, this party has never yet done anything good for South Africa. But last year there was an election in which the hon. member for Karoo won, and who was his opponent? His opponent was Mr. Daantjie Scholtz, a former member of this House and the Deputy-Chairman of Committees. And what did he propound? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government accepts the Coloureds as an integral part of the population and tries to do everything possible to uplift them.</block>

<p>He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I stand for election because there is a need for a better understanding. The <span class="col_827-828" refersTo="page_0428"/>Coloureds are an integral part of our population.</block>

<p>What is he objecting to? Mr. Scholtz objects to the implementation of job reservation and the implementation of the Group Areas Act in respect of the Coloureds. But now the hon. member for Moorreesburg says all the evil lies in the United Party. But their own people, the people whom they are prepared to support when they are nominated as candidates for the Coloureds, say precisely what the United Party has been saying for 15 years in this country already. If the United Party is such a failure as an Opposition, if we cannot give guidance to the country, I want to know how it is that a man like Mr. Scholtz can say precisely the same things as the United Party in regard to the Coloureds. The hon. member for Moorreesburg knows very well that there is not a single place in the Karoo constituency where Mr. Scholtz was not assisted by the local Nationalist Party organization. I want to quote further from what he said. I read from the <i>Burger</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Amidst applause the speaker said that he was opposed to job reservation for Coloureds.</block>

<p>That is what the United Party has always said. That is the thing which the United Party has always said is an injustice to the Coloureds. But if all the evil is inherent in the United Party, and the party opposite has so much success with their policy, why is it then necessary for the <i>Burger</i>to predict that in respect of the Bantu homelands it is for the Nationalist Party itself to convince people, and it is not so much the duty of the United Party or others to do so? I want to quote what &#x201C;Dawie&#x201D; wrote on 30 March last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is becoming increasingly clear that the Transkei plan and the policy of Bantu homelands will cost much sweat, sweat not only in regard to these things themselves or the sweat of struggling against political opponents, but the political sweat of convincing and giving guidance to our own people. When I look at the position, this task of persuading our own people appears to me to be one of the most difficult tasks which the National Party has had in many years.</block>

<p>But they tell us that the evil is really inherent in the United Party itself, and that they enjoy the support of the people. Sir, the hon. member for Moorreesburg says that their policy is one of partitioning South Africa. He does not have to try to convince us that that is their policy. We believe that this is the policy of that side of the House, because the hon. the Prime Minister tells us that this is his policy, and we are prepared to accept his word, but the hon. member tried to convince the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;), who said the following on 2 November 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The future of the Coloured cannot be determined.</block>

<p>That was at a meeting addressed by the hon. member for Parow, together with the hon. members for Moorreesburg and Stellenbosch, at Tulbagh. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not possible for the National Party to determine precisely whither its policy will lead the Coloured population in future.</block>

<p>They are the honest people. We are the party without a policy. They are the party in power! The people trust them so much because they are always honest and put their policy to the people! But the hon. member for Parow, at a time when he had his full political wits about him, had to admit that the Nationalist Party did not yet have definite future plans for the Coloureds. That is the tragedy and the irony of South African politics to-day, that on that side of the House one has a Government which has 105 seats here, but outside they do not enjoy the support of 50 per cent of the voters whom they represent. If one talks to people individually, including Nationalists, they tell one that the United Party policy in respect of immigration is correct, that its policy in respect of the Coloureds is correct, and that its policy in respect of not dividing up the country is correct. Why then are hon. members able to form the Government of this country?</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>There are two reasons why hon. members opposite are able to form the Government. They are being kept in power to-day simply because circumstances outside the control of South Africa, circumstances on the Continent of Africa and circumstances in the world keep them there, but not because the people of South Africa support their policy. That is so because one can analyse their policy and come to only one conclusion, viz. that the policy will not be able to preserve White civilization in this country when Bantu states are established and secondly, that they do not have a definite policy in respect of the Coloureds. In respect of the Bantu, their policy will result in the White man not only losing his authority over the smaller South Africa, as they put it, but over South Africa as a whole. And in respect of the Coloureds they have no policy which will really persuade those people to take the side of Western civilization. Those are the facts of South African politics to-day. But we are told that the evil is really inherent in the United Party.</p>

<p>In the last few minutes at my disposal I should like to mention a matter which affects the farmers of South Africa. We have heard from the Ministers of Agriculture that the troubles of the farmers should not be laid at the door of the Government. They are not the scapegoats. No, the trouble is really due to the higher land prices, and the solution will not be to grant the farmers higher prices. The <span class="col_829-830" refersTo="page_0429"/>Minister of Agricultural Economics made the same statement a few days ago, and it is a statement he made also on various occasions last year, firstly when he addressed the National Party Congress, and also the Transvaal Agricultural Union Congress. I have extracts from four different newspapers of the Minister&#x2019;s speeches, and every report agreed with what the hon. the Minister said only a few days ago. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am particularly sympathetic to the farmers&#x2019; cause. I am, however, also aware that further price increases, or even stable prices, for the most important products may have far-reaching effects for farmers who at present have financial problems.</block>

<p>That comes from the <i>Landbou Weekblad</i> of last year. I can also quote from the <i>Burger</i> of 6 September last year, where he said the same thing at the National Party Congress&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Increased prices are always reflected in other spheres, and so, for example, land prices rise. An increase in the price of agricultural products is not always to the benefit of the farmer.</block>

<p>I can quote four different cuttings where the Minister said precisely the same thing, and now I want to put this question to hon. members opposite. If they say that stable prices and increased prices for agricultural products do not benefit the farmer, do they want to intimate that the farmer should be satisfied with low prices? I want to ask the Ministers of Agriculture: If they think that high prices or stable prices are not the solution, then there is only one alternative left, and that is that prices should be low, and is it then the policy of this Government that the farmers should receive low prices? That is the main difficulty of the farmers. It is not that land prices are too high, but because they increasingly have to be satisfied with lower prices for their products, while production costs are increasing. There is no doubt but that the margin of profit of the farmer has become increasingly smaller under this Government over the past 15 years, and that is the reason why increasingly more farmers leave the land. We on this side are entitled to ask the Government: If it is not its policy to guarantee high prices, then what is its policy? Is it its policy that the farmers should be satisfied with less and less for their products? [Interjection.] The hon. member for Cradock says that is nonsense, but is he in favour of higher prices? [Interjection.] The hon. member says he is in favour of stable prices. I am glad to hear that he differs from the Minister, because the Minister has repeatedly stated that he is opposed to increased prices and also to stable prices. [Interjection.] I really would not like hon. members to say that the Minister did not say so, because he said it repeatedly, as I have already shown. It was reported in the <i>Burger</i> and the <i>Oosterlig</i> of 6 September, and also in <i>Merino.</i> We on this side feel that the farmers, in spite of the wonderful prosperity which is supposed to prevail in the country, do not get their legitimate share. We know that agricultural production has increased. Nobody denies that. It increased by R27,000,000 in the past year, but the matter which can not be brought to the notice of the Government strongly enough is that in spite of the increased production, the margin of profit of the farmer is steadily decreasing, and that is the trouble. It is no use saying that production is increasing if increasingly more farmers have to leave the land because they cannot maintain their standard of living as the result of the fact that their prices are too low, and that is the task which the Government should tackle in the year that lies ahead.</p>

<speech by="#heystek">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HEYSTEK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat was concerned particularly with two matters. In the first place he attacked the policy of this side without referring to any policy on that side which could be substituted for it, and secondly his speech dealt with what the hon. the Minister is supposed to have said, that high prices will not benefit the farmer. The hon. the Minister has denied it, and I hope to return to this point after the dinner hour. But allow me to say this in regard to policy. The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) referred to-day to the prosperity in the country, and he heaved a deep sigh and remarked how much better off the country would have been had the United Party been in power. But if things had gone better, it would only have been as the result of some policy of theirs, and now I do not know what policy the United Party has had for the past 15 years which could have made this country more prosperous. Now it is unfortunately true that the <i>Sunday Times</i> recently said that no Nationalist Member of Parliament could really make a speech unless he had read the <i>Sunday Times</i>, and I want to begin by quoting from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 7 April 1963. After the Leader of the Opposition had announced his umpteenth new policy, I read the following in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 7 April 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the first official statement that gives a full and comprehensive picture of the policy the United Party will carry out when it is returned to power.</block>

<p>If the United Party, which has now been sitting in the Opposition benches for almost 15 years, only last year, according to the <i>Sunday Times</i>, for the first time announced a comprehensive policy then one asks oneself with reference to which policy would the United Party have succeeded in achieving greater prosperity in South Africa? With reference to the election in Namaqualand, just allow me to indicate from this pamphlet what the position is in regard to the so-called policy adopted by the United Party. It really amounts to this. A son attended university, and towards the end of his third year he telegraphed <span class="col_831-832" refersTo="page_0430"/>his father: I cannot come home for this vacation; send me some money to spend here. The father telegraphed him: Did you pass or fail? The son telegraphed back: Yes. And the father telegraphed: Yes what? The son telegraphed: Yes, Dad. That is how far we have come after 15 years with the United Party and the Leader of the Opposition in regard to their policy: Yes, Dad. I read here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party leaders have no clarity in regard to their own policy or the consequences of their policy. They can also change their policy so easily. That makes the race federation plan of the United Party so dangerous. In regard to the question of Bantu representation in this Parliament, the United Party during October and November 1963 performed an egg-dance such as has seldom been seen.</block>

<p>Listen to this, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On 14 October Senator Groenewald resigned from the United Party and on 17 October Mr. Odell resigned from the United Party. They resigned because they are opposed to Bantu being represented in this Parliament by Bantu.</block>

<p>And now we get the egg-dance. On 18 October the Free State secretary of the United Party, Mr. Jan Fourie, tells the <i>Friend</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What new policy does the United Party have? The United Party does not want Bantu in Parliament.</block>

<p>In the same paper in which Mr. Fourie&#x2019;s statement appeared, the following was said in a leading article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Odell says that he is now dissatisfied with the policy of the United Party because it accepts Bantu representing Bantu in the Central Parliament. This seems to me a reference to Sir de Villiers Graaff&#x2019;s repeated statements that the right of Africans to represent their own people in Parliament cannot be withheld indefinitely.</block>

<p>On 24 October a letter by Mr. Jan Fourie, the secretary of the United Party in the Free State, appeared in the <i>Volksblad</i>, in which he quotes from a handbook for better race relations issued in August 1963, and which is a statement of United Party policy in regard to race relations. I am just pointing to the egg-dance performed by the United Party in connection with their race policy. Then we continually hear in this House: Where would this country not have been had the United Party been in power with its policy? In this letter he clearly states that the policy of the United Party is that the Bantu will be represented in this Parliament by Whites. On the same day that this letter by Mr. Fourie appeared in the <i>Volksblad</i>, Sir de Villiers Graaff stated at Heilbron that the right to have direct representation in Parliament could not be withheld from the Natives indefinitely. The next day on 25 October Sir de Villiers Graaff stated at Winburg that our children would only have to decide one day whether they would give Natives representation in Parliament or not. But what does Mr. Mitchell of Natal say? On 25 October the United Party leader in Natal stated that the policy of the United Party was that the Natives would be represented in Parliament by Whites. On 26 October again Sir de Villiers Graaff stated, on the farm Merriesfontein in the district of Bloemhof, that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the tremendous right which Dr. Verwoerd now gives the Bantu is the reason why direct representation in Parliament cannot be withheld from them indefinitely.</block>

<p>It is an egg-dance such as has never been seen before, Sir, with regard to something which one cannot call a policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member repeatedly pointed out and emphasized that the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing is supposed to have said that there can be no increase in the price of the farmers&#x2019; products&#x2014;none at all; that it would not benefit the farmer to receive higher prices for his products. Not only here, but also at the Congress, the hon. the Minister very clearly stated his standpoint in this regard. We on this side feel that an uncontrolled increase in production prices will lead to inflation in regard to land prices, and that eventually it will result in a vicious circle from which we will not be able to escape. The denial of the hon. the Minister that he said this is based on the facts. We had the same sort of thing when it was stated that the two Ministers of Agriculture had said that all small farmers would have to leave their farms, and when the Minister spoke about the consolidation of farms in order to give farmers a better chance to make a living.</p>

<p>I shall revert to this denial by the hon. the Minister after dinner. In the meantime, seeing that the debate has now swung over to agriculture, I want to follow a course somewhat unique in the sphere of agriculture, a course which to some extent deviates from the stereotyped speeches we have so often made and listened to here. I should like to refer to agriculture, in relation to the food question.</p>

<p>Business suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 8.5 p.m.</p>

<speech by="#heystek">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HEYSTEK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before business was suspended, I promised to revert to the allegation made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) in regard to what the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing is supposed to have said, viz. that higher prices for farm products will not help the farmers, as if he was thereby intimating that he would not allow it. I looked it <span class="col_833-834" refersTo="page_0431"/>up and found that the Minister had denied that report, and that denial appeared in the Press. Here is the denial of the Minister, namely that it would be ridiculous to say that higher produce prices would not help the farmer, just as ridiculous as it would be to say that higher salaries and wages would not benefit the wage earner. The Minister further says that if in fact he had said anything like that, he could be regarded as a man bereft of his senses. The hon. the Minister was replying to an allegation by the Opposition that the farmers were leaving the land as the result of low produce prices. He said further that even high prices for products in some cases had the effect of farmers leaving the land. That sounds paradoxical, but he immediately gave the explanation that when things were going so well the large-scale farmers bought out the smaller ones. They offer attractive prices and the small farmers sell, because with that capital they are able to make a better living elsewhere. And the farmer who wants to expand and who has the capital is prepared to pay that very attractive price for the land of that small farm. In that way there are also farmers who leave the land as the result of high prices, and not of low prices. That is how the Minister put the matter. The Minister said that high prices alone could not solve this problem. He said that there were also other factors and other measures which should be applied in order to improve the position of the farmer. Surely there are rebates, subsidies, standardization, soil and water conservation, the effective use of labour, selection and land prices. I am not mentioning these things in order to defend the Minister, but we know they exist. If all these things are taken into consideration, the farmers&#x2019; position may be improved. The Minister has said that simply increasing prices will not help in itself. But you know, Sir, one can play with words. I want to give an example. I hope you will allow me to read this little epigram. We all know what an epigram is. I see a thoughtful expression on your face, Mr. Speaker, because you never know what to expect when an hon. member talks in this way and you will not be able to judge before I have read it. If the Minister were to read this epigram he would read it in this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mijn vrouw Griet is in de hemel,</block>

<p>Niet in de hel, dat weet ek wel.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) would read it like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mijn vrouw Griet is in de hemel niet, In de hel, dat weet ek wel.</block>

<p>Now you can see, Sir, how one can be reduced from a state of happiness to one of misery merely by changing a comma in what the hon. the Minister is alleged to have said.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have prepared a speech on the relationship and the indivisibility of agricultural production and the problem of nutrition. But now it is clear to me that I cannot make that speech because my time has elapsed. I just want to make one point before I sit down: This is a particularly good speech, and I am sure I will be able to use it on a later occasion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the last speaker on the latter portion of his speech. It was excellent. Sir, it must be a great satisfaction to the hon. the Minister of Finance to be able to get up in this House and tell us that he has been able to send abroad R12,000,000 of the State&#x2019;s finance for short-term investment in addition to the R51,000,000 that has already been sent abroad by private banks. But this golden statement of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s is somewhat tempered by the fact that he had to tell us in the same speech that he had extended the terms of the revolving credits of the United States and Germany at rates far in excess of the money market rate in this country and that these credits, to quote the Minister, &#x201C;may be required not so very far in the future.&#x201D; I hope, when we come to the Budget speech, that the hon. the Minister will elaborate very considerably on that last statement.</p>

<p>The statement of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s loses its effect still further, Sir, when one realizes that the gold and foreign reserves are maintained by an artificial barrier which has been placed around the export of funds from this country through the medium of exchange control, and that the problem of inflationary pressures is also mainly a problem of too much money. When too much is available it is an indication that much of the tempo of our increased production has resulted from the absorption of surplus capacity and the employment of those people previously unemployed and not from new production. At the same time the hon. the Minister is faced with rises in prices of various commodities.</p>

<p>I want to deal in particular with the question of the rise in the price of petrol. From now on I address my remarks to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. I believe that the hon. the Minister has treated this country with considerable discourtesy in this matter of the rise in the price of petrol. What is the history of it? Some while ago a short notice appeared in the Press saying that the price of petrol was going to be increased and that the increase in price was to be utilized towards the cost of the new pipe-line. This was eventually denied by the Department and it was said that if there were to be an increase it would certainly not be used for the pipe-line. Then a couple of weeks ago, on a Sunday evening, the price controller announced an increase in the price of petrol. According to the <i>Daily Mail</i> of 27 January all that was said was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the official announcement from Cape Town, the price controller, Mr. H. R. P. A. <span class="col_835-836" refersTo="page_0432"/>Kotzenberg, said he had agreed to the 0.6 cent per gallon increase after full investigation and consideration and with the approval of the Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr. Diederichs.</block>

<p>No reason is given in this statement for the increase in the price of petrol. We are not told who is to benefit; is it the State, the supplier, the petrol companies or the garages? All we do know is that the motorist is not to benefit. Then the following appeared in the <i>Star</i> of the same date&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A spokesman of the Department of Commerce said in Cape Town to-day that the Government had taken the decision as a result of representations received from the companies. Asked in what way costs had increased the spokesman said the companies had complained of an accumulation of small increases in f.o.b. price, transport, distribution and several other spheres which could be offset only by raising the price to the motorist. He said the additional revenue from the higher price would not be used to finance any Government project but would be channelled direct to the oil companies to meet their increased expenditure.</block>

<p>Here at last we knew who was going to get the benefit. Then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After all, the increase is so small that motorists should barely feel it. After all, if you buy 10 gallons of petrol it means that you will only be paying 6 cents more.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think that is a correct attitude of the Department of Commerce to take in relation to a product which is so universally used. In 1963 508,000,000 gallons of petrol were sold in this country and this 0.6 cent rise mean a minimum of R3,000,000 into the pockets of the petrol companies. But the Department does not seem to be very concerned about that. Their attitude is merely: &#x201C;After all, if you buy 10 gallons of petrol it means you will only be paying 6 cents more&#x201D;. There seems to be a conspiracy of silence about this increase in the price of petrol. If you talk to anybody you get no information except that certain discussions were held and that everybody seems to have come to a very happy agreement. The R.A.C., for example, Sir, one of the organizations which looks after the motorists, said, according to the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 27 January&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They had obviously gone into the matter carefully and if the price controller is happy about the increase there are certainly no complaints from us.</block>

<p>Nobody, not commerce, not industry, not the automobile associations, seems to come forward with the usual complaints which rightly take place when there is an increase in the price of petrol. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us with whom he made arrangements and with whom he had discussions and who agreed to the increase in the price of petrol? For certainly the public of South Africa was not taken into his confidence and the increased price was certainly just thrown on them.</p>

<p>There are one or two other factors. The price of premium petrol has been increased as well as that of ordinary petrol. In a publication by the Automobile Association in June 1963 they complain that premium petrol was over-priced. But the present increase applies to both premium and ordinary petrol so that to-day ordinary petrol is netting a gross profit of 6.55 cents and premium petrol is netting a gross profit of 8.5 cents; and these have now both gone up by another 0.6 cent. We should like to know from the hon. the Minister why does this increase apply to both classes of petrol. There is something else: Was the increase in the price of petrol really necessary? In the <i>Financial Mail</i> of January 31 they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While the oil companies themselves are as reticent as ever, it is known, of course, that they have been agitating for a higher price of petrol for some time. In 1959 the Shell (S.A.) annual report pointed out that it was getting over 3&#x00BD; per cent return on its capital employed in South Africa. It went to great pains to show that of every rand of revenue, costs (of oil, refining, etc.) absorbed 39 cents taxation, rail and other charges paid to the State took 40 cents, depreciation and marketing ate up 19 cents&#x2014;leaving only 2 cents as surplus.</block>

<p>But here is an interesting factor, Sir, if this report is correct, which I have no doubt it is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since then Shell&#x2019;s position has improved. The return on capital employed rose to 5.2 per cent in 1960; 6.3 per cent in 1961, falling to 5.9 per cent (net after P.A.Y.E. tax saving) in 1962.</block>

<p>So whereas this particular oil company was getting a return of per cent on its capital in 1959 it had achieved 5.2 per cent in 1960, 6.3 per cent in 1961 and 5.9 per cent in 1962. And yet the hon. the Minister, in his wisdom, has deemed it necessary to give an increase which is going to cost this country R3,000,000 to R4,000,000 per annum.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that the public of South Africa is entitled to an explanation of this rise in the price of petrol. Everybody is affected. It is no good being naive and it is no good the Department telling us that it is only going to cost us 6 cents per 10 gallons of petrol. There are users in this country who use tens of thousands of gallons of petrol every month. We have the hon. the Minister of Finance talking about beating inflation with which we are not dealing to-night but this is not beating inflation, Mr. Speaker; it is jumping inflation to the extent of R3,000,000 to R4,000,000 per annum, and I hope we shall have an explanation from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<from><span class="col_837-838" refersTo="page_0433"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>After having listened to the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin), I gained the impression that they are just concerned about the large amount of money which is available in the country. That was really the criticism he tried to express. In regard to the second portion of his speech, which dealt with the increase in the price of petrol, I unfortunately cannot reply to him. I leave that in the efficient hands of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>It is quite clear. All the speeches this afternoon, starting with the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), were to me very splendid testimonies to the success this Government has achieved in bringing about such a tremendous upsurge in the economy of the country. In spite of the doubts he tried to express, his whole speech was larded with acknowledgment that things are going well with our country. The hon. member for Constantia was just concerned as to whether this economic upsurge will be maintained. I immediately want to assure him that this Government, with its well considered policy, is the only one which can maintain, develop and guarantee this economic upsurge. We can also give him the assurance that the greater demands made on our transportation system through the increased production will also be coped with under the efficient guidance of the hon. the Minister of Transport.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the Minister of Transport can feel flattered because the hon. member for Constantia gave him such a good testimonial to-day. I have sympathy with the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) who, it appears, has now become the main critic in regard to transportation. It appears that recently there was a change in the Shadow Cabinet of the Opposition, because the hon. member for Yeoville is now the chief Railways critic. We should like to see how strongly he can criticize the Minister of Transport, seeing that his bench-mate has such a high regard for the Minister. We surely all agree that in order to maintain this economic upsurge it is necessary to have the necessary capital in the country. This cannot be disputed. It is general knowledge that the coffers of the country are running over, so much so that investments abroad have had to be considered and investigated. The Minister said in his speech that he intended investing some of our superfluous capital overseas. A man like Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, <i>inter alia</i>, said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Direct investment of South African money outside South Africa, which can often be of immediate benefit to South African trade, as well as strengthening the ties with other countries, may perhaps be a more advantageous use of a part of our available foreign exchange.</block>

<p>In the first place we must have the necessary manpower in the country. We have all the necessary unskilled workers as the result of the large numbers of non-White workers we have in the country. The potential of these non-White workers will in future be utilized much better as the result of their upliftment, a task which this Government is tackling. In this regard we think of education, housing, etc., which will certainly make them better workers. We also know that in the near future we may perhaps have trouble in regard to skilled workers and technicians, of which there may possibly be a shortage. But thanks to the policy of this Government, their numbers will be complemented judiciously by immigration. As far as the distant future is concerned, the picture is much brighter. It is a matter which enjoys the attention of the Government every day. There is the Scientific Advisory Council which investigates the question of the available manpower so that it may be put to the best use. We have the Education Advisory Council which will give guidance in applying the best possible methods for the training of our manpower potential. If we want to stabilize and maintain this economic growth, it is necessary to have peace and safety in this country. Thanks to the efficient actions of the Minister of Justice, who has ensured the internal security of our country, in spite of the fact that the Opposition so sharply attacks the 90-day detention clause, saboteurs find it very difficult to operate in our country to-day. Our Minister of Defence has built up a military force which is respected by most nations in the world. We need not argue further about that. We accept that the Republic of South Africa is one of the few countries in the world in which there is complete peace and order and where the safety of the individual and of his possessions is ensured. We must admit that under the r&#x00E9;gime of the National Party, our national safety and a stronger economy have been assured.</p>

<p>Now the question arises: To what is this economic growth, this prosperity, peace and safety in our country due? The hon. member for Constantia also put that question. He asked: &#x201C;To what do we owe this prosperity?&#x201D; But to me the reply is quite simple. The country was able to make this rapid progress in the economic and other spheres in recent years because it is being governed by a Government elected by the National Party, a party which is based on principles. The National Party was established under the efficient leadership of General Hertzog. With the slogan, South Africa First, he built and developed this country. The National Party has stood firmly on two legs since its establishment. The one is the ideal of freedom and the other is the ideal of apartheid. To-day, after 50 years, the National Party still stands on the same principles on which it was founded. The policy of the party, ever since it was established, has run like a golden thread throughout its history, i.e. the ideals of freedom and of apartheid. We need not discuss this further; I am merely stressing the fact. I want to point out one further fact to the Opposition, namely that the basis of our economic <span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0434"/>growth and of the industrial development of the Republic was laid down by the first National Party Government in this country. That Government, under the leadership of General Hertzog in the &#x2019;twenties, and under the leadership of Minister Havenga, gave us a policy of protecting our industries. Unless we had that, we would not have had the industrial growth we have in South Africa to-day. I do not want to rub it in, but we know how the then Opposition criticized and opposed Mr. Havenga&#x2019;s policy. To-day it is accepted, and they must concede that if it were not for that policy of protection implemented by the first Nationalist Government, we would never have had this economic growth.</p>

<p>The second foundation laid by the National Party to ensure our recent economic growth was the establishment of ISCOR. Everybody to-day accepts that this is the basis of our economic and industrial development. There were many disputes about it, and I do not want to rub it into the Opposition too hard. The most important point of all is that this economic growth and prosperity under the Nationalist Government is due to the fact that the National Party had great leaders. To-day we can mention the list of National Party leaders with pride. They were men who captured the imagination of the people. Beginning with General Hertzog, there were Dr. Malan, Advocate Strijdom and Dr. Verwoerd, all men who captured the imagination of the people. With such leaders it is obvious that a Government can and must reach the heights. In contrast with that, we have the Opposition to-day&#x2014;we need not emphasize it&#x2014;which lacks leadership. If they do not get rid of their Leader they will be landed with him. In the second place, the United Party lacks a clearly defined programme of principles. In the past we have had so many divergent interpretations and standpoints in regard to their colour policy that we really do not know what to believe. It is no wonder that the people outside are increasingly leaving their ranks. If the Opposition in any way envisages becoming the future alternative Government, they must see to it that they have an efficient leader and a well defined and clear programme of principles.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members opposite have followed the same pattern they have always followed ever since I have been in this House. We have just listened to the hon. member for Welkom (Mr. H. J. van Wyk) who represents a constituency but who never talks about his constituency. According to him everything is rosy in the garden; they can swim on Sunday, or is it never on Sunday? I am not so sure.</p>

<p>Various members, including the hon. member for Welkom, have protected the Ministers. It must give great relief to the Cabinet that every member on the Government side gets up and defends their policy. But never at any time do you hear them talking about their constituencies. One wonders whether they have just been elected here <i>en bloc</i> to speak on behalf of the Nationalist Party. The hon. member for Welkom went to great lengths to praise the Minister of Finance in regard to the investment of free capital overseas. He said that was a wonderful thing and that we had a wonderful Minister. We are told that there is very great prosperity in this country. We have not seen any relaxation of import control to any degree; we have not seen any relaxation as far as any capital flow is concerned. Let us give this prosperity a test. Let us release these various controls and see how good this prosperity is. I think that will be the test. Just the other day the Minister introduced a Bill to control prices. I want to remind the hon. member for Welkom about this country of ours, this country that is enjoying peace, this country of which a part is living under Proclamation 400, this country in which quite a number of people are locked up under the 90-day detention clause; this quiet, peaceful country. Let me tell him that this is a very small country. The hon. the Minister of Defence made a speech last year and he said that his Government should, as one of its major tasks, try to make a break-through to the African States. He realizes that this country is isolated here. The rest of the world is out of step; we are the only country in step. The hon. member for Welkom gave us a long explanation on the history of the Nationalist Party. We know its record. [Interjections.] Do not let us go back to the war because it makes very bad reading and it makes very bad listening to. To tell us that the industrial development in this country is due to the Nationalist Party is just so much nonsense. The Nationalist Party did everything they possibly could during the war to upset the foundation of this great industrial development. Since the war they have done everything possible to upset labour relations in this country on a racialistic basis by killing industrial development. So please do not make those claims; it is just ridiculous to do so &#x2026;</p>

<p>So have you; you are sitting in this House. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member referred to the very great leaders of the Nationalist Party. I admit there were some very great leaders in South Africa&#x2014;General Smuts, General Botha. I want to talk about the very great leader we have with us to-day&#x2014;Sir de Villiers Graaff. [Laughter.] You may laugh, but when you are sitting on this side of the House, and that is not very far away, you will see that our Leader, the Leader of the Opposition, will lead South Africa back on the road of no control and full confidence in this country.</p>

<p>I want to deal with something that affects my constituency. I want to go back to the fishing industry. I am sorry the hon. Prime <span class="col_841-842" refersTo="page_0435"/>Minister is not here because I know he is very interested in fishing. The fishing industry in this country has been described as the stepchild of the South African industries, and it has over the last year or so grown into one of our very wealthy giants. We have become one of the largest exporters of canned pilchards and we are the third largest exporters of canned fish and fish body-oil. I would like to tell my friends from the north who are intent in moving everything from the Western Cape that it even rivals the great steel industry that they are developing up there. The foreign exchange it is earning at the present moment equals that of the wine industry, and as it develops, I hope it will help the Minister of Finance in the respect that he will not have to call on those loans that he has arranged for overseas. He has made arrangements for those loans because I think he is also not too happy about the question how long this prosperity is going to last. I may say that we of the United Party have every confidence in South Africa and that notwithstanding the Government the prospects are good. We know that the voter outside is sensible and when the time comes he will remove the present Government and put in a Government that will take care of things.</p>

<p>That is a border industry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>A border industry on the coast! This fishing industry during the r&#x00E9;gime of the United Party was considered of such importance that the hon. member for Constantia set up the Fishing Development Corporation, one of the most successful development corporations that exist to-day and one of the corporations that is making money. I want to give credit where credit is due. This particular corporation has done an outstanding job in respect of harbours, boats, housing and has assisted wherever possible. But they are mainly concerned with inshore fishing and not deep-sea fishing. There seems to be an amount of misunderstanding when we talk about providing facilities for inshore or for deep-sea fishing. They are two different types of fishing, but we find to-day that deep-sea fishing, where there is a lot of competition, is just as important as inshore fishing. The Food and Agricultural Organization which prepares the world production records has estimated that in 1962, something like 44,720,000 metric tons of fish were caught in this world of ours, and South Africa and South West Africa shared in that to the extent of just over 1,000,000 ton. Our industry is creeping up. Now the Government&#x2019;s approach to this gold mine of ours, on the coast of our country, I would like to say is conservative, is not dynamic&#x2014;I am not going to suggest that the Government should introduce a crash programme, but here in Cape Town, we have been waiting for a number of years for the building of a fishing harbour. The hon. Minister of Railways says that he would like to get rid of the fishing boats out of his harbours, but that it is up to the Minister of Economic Affairs to do something about it. He has to provide the money and has to say where the harbours should be built. The Minister of Railways says that once that has been decided, he will get on with the job. I believe he would do so. A company wanted to put up a refinery in Cape Town, which is now been proceeded with, and they wanted a deep-water berth, and, believe it or not, that is in the course of construction and will be completed in the next couple of years. But as far as the Minister of Economic Affairs is concerned, his Department have been taking samples over a number of years and the latest report we have tells us that the matter is still being examined and that sites are being tested, and it will be some time before we will know where this harbour is going to be built. But, Mr. Speaker, there is some urgency for this particular harbour. Only to-day if you look out into the bay, there were some of the five largest stern trawlers that you have in the world to-day. They come from other countries, and they are fishing off our coast, as far as 200 miles out, not in our territorial waters, but they are bringing fish up and this fish is exported. We, through the lack of facilities in this country, do not offer any encouragement to local industries, to local companies to build these boats because they have nowhere to put them. Furthermore I might say that one of these particular companies is very anxious to share in our prosperity in this country and are prepared to invest money in this country by the formation of a company. I think we all welcome that, but there again their efforts are going to be stymied because we have not got the facilities. What we want in this country of ours is first-class harbours for our fishing industry; we want to see this harbour in Cape Town built. Furthermore, where we build these harbours to help our fishermen on the coast, we want adequate cold-storage facilities. Boycotts do not count here, because people have to live and they have to eat to live and there is a wonderful export market for our fish. We would like to see these cold-storage facilities provided. We have them in Cape Town for our fruit and we would like cold storage provided for the fishing industry as well. We would like to see facilities in Cape Town and places like Kalk Bay and Hout Bay. We know private companies do their best, but we feel that the Government should do something about it on a big scale. It is a case of getting on with the job. We have been dallying far too long with this gold mine right at our door. I feel&#x2014;I do not know whether it is because the <span class="col_843-844" refersTo="page_0436"/>administrative capital of ours is in the Transvaal, where fishing is not so good&#x2014;that we in the Cape are left in the cold. I want the hon. Minister to do something about it and please make a statement in this House as to what is going to happen, especially in regard to the fishing harbour here in the Cape.</p>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) says that we never mention our constituencies. I listened attentively to him but did not hear him mention the name of his constituency of Salt River. Once, on the contrary, I heard him discuss in great detail what is happening at sea. I think that his speech was probably prophetic. I take it that in a few years&#x2019; time that will be the only place in which they will still be able to win seats, but those seats will probably be under water and not on the surface.</p>

<p>I also listened to the speeches that were made during the course of this debate. Some of them were quite humorous but I do not think that this House is always in the right mood to be able to laugh at a good joke. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) told us that the United Party has the majority of voters on its side. I take it that that is the reason why our party is going from strength to strength. This makes me think of the lad who had been fighting and when he arrived home covered with blood his father said: &#x201C;What have you been doing?&#x201D; He said: &#x201C;Father, I have been fighting.&#x201D; His father then asked him: &#x201C;What happened; who won?&#x201D; To which he replied: &#x201C;Father, I won, because while we were fighting, we fell down and I fell underneath, and then we both ran and I was in front.&#x201D; That is precisely how hon. members on that side reason; that is their logic. They say that the wealth of South Africa, our prosperity, is certainly not due to the policy of the National Government. The other day when I was paging through the old Hansard, just for something to do, the Hansard of the days when I was not a member of this House, I was struck by the terrible prophecies that were made by the Opposition in regard to what the position would be immediately after we became a Republic. They said that the misery that would result would be due directly to our policy. Now that we have great prosperity in the country instead of misery, it suddenly has nothing to do with the policy of this Government and with the administration of this Government. It has happened purely by chance! This is really a wonderful way to argue but I must say I find it very strange. Unfortunately I do not have the time to discuss the speeches of hon. members of the Opposition any further because I want to talk about other very important matters.</p>

<p>Some of the hon. members on this side of the House, particularly the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) raised some very important matters to-day. In his speech he referred to the depopulation of the platteland by Whites. He said that our numbers there are becoming fewer and he pointed out how far behind the Cape was in the economic sphere. I personally think that the depopulation of the platteland by Whites is not put in quite the right perspective. I do not think that it is so much a question of depopulation that is taking place as far as the platteland is concerned. If we peruse the voters lists we find that there has been a gradual increase in the number of voters in the rural areas but that increase has been far slower than the growth in the rest of the country and this is due to various factors. It is quite obvious why the growth in the northern parts of our country has been so much faster. In the first place this growth has taken place because of the gold that has been found there. Gold has a tremendous power of attraction and it is the gold that has to a large extent been responsible for the fact that people have invested their money in the northern areas. Another reason is that coal and water has been found there and these have provided the north with cheap power. One can understand that industrialists have been attracted to the north because of these factors. There is water for domestic consumption, for commercial purposes, and I can well understand that these factors have been partly responsible for the swifter growth there. Another factor which has contributed very directly to this position is our traditional railway tariff policy. I know that is now being reviewed and I hope that things will be rectified. The poor transport facilities in our part of the Cape have to a large extent been responsible for the fact that part of our country&#x2014;a very large part of our country&#x2014;is extremely thinly populated and that the whole of our part of the country is gradually being emptied of inhabitants.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, an analysis of the reasons does not get us anywhere. I think that the time has come when something will have to be done to combat this position. What can be done to help and improve this position? I want to say immediately that I believe that the solution to the problems will have to be found in the north-west itself. I do not want to make the same mistake as that made by the hon. member for Salt River and that is not to speak about my constituency. I shall try therefore to come a little closer to my constituency. When mention is made of the north-west, it is often referred to as a country of samples. I am not trying to detract from the Vaal River and to belittle the samples found there. I am referring here to mineral samples. It is generally well-known that there are a large number of mineral deposits in the north-west; that the country is particularly rich in mineral samples but that those samples have never actually been properly tested. Nothing has actually been done to find out what can be produced there. That is why it has simply remained a country of samples. I just want to say that one of the important reasons why the samples have not yet been thoroughly investigated has <span class="col_845-846" refersTo="page_0437"/>been the inaccessibility of that area. Large parts particularly of the mineral-bearing areas, the rich mineral areas, cannot actually be reached unless a helicopter is used or one goes on foot and even then things are still very difficult. I think of that tremendous area, the Richtersveld, which covers hundreds of miles, which has very rich mineral deposits, or let me say, from which we have had many samples of various uncommon minerals that very definitely merit research. I think that the development that has taken place over the past while has now made it possible for us to do something in this connection.</p>

<p>Before I discuss this matter any further I want to express my thanks to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs for having visited my constituency during the last recess and for the very sympathetic way in which he has approached our problems there. I gained the impression that he was really impressed and that what was being done there opened his eyes. I want to thank the hon. the Minister very much indeed. I also want to express my thanks to the Secretary for Mines who has always been sympathetic when we have approached him with our problems. I know that he is very keenly interested in the development of that area and that he has a great deal of confidence in that area. I also want to express my thanks that certain official posts in my constituency have been regarded and that we are now going to have more officials there. I also want to express my thanks to the capable officials whom we have there and who work under difficult conditions. They are doing good work and I am sure that we will get somewhere with people of this calibre. The Director of Metallurgy will also be visiting that area in the near future and I believe that this will lead to even further development. I want to thank the Secretary for Mines for his share in bringing this about.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we all know about the diamonds of Namaqualand and we all know about its copper, but what few people know about is perhaps its sillimanite and corundum that is being mined there to-day with great success by private entrepreneurs. Few people know too that the diamonds in Namaqualand are spread over a surface area of thousands of morgen, that these have now to be localized before they can be developed and that there are still large copper deposits which have as yet not been touched. We simply do not know what those copper deposits can produce if we do not develop them. I am sure that the public of South Africa are quite unaware of the fact that there we have very large deposits of wollastronite, phosphates, barytes, sillimanite and siliconic acid. Until recently it was felt that pegmatite could not be developed there there economically. This idea has now fortunately been proved wrong. A private undertaking started to mine pegmatite a few years ago. They are now on their fifth tunnel and they have achieved a great deal of success. We want to continue to mine pegmatite. I am quite sure that hon. members know that there are other places rich in beryllium wolfram, tantalite, columbite, bismuth, lufidolite, spudomine, mica and so forth. These are all base minerals that are found there.</p>

<p>Our problem has always been transport, water and so forth. We have, however, had a certain amount of development there recently and under the good Government that we have in this country I am convinced of the fact that that area will be given attention. Certain things have been done over the past years that would not have been done under the old United Party Government. We had an interdepartmental commission of inquiry there recently on which were represented the Departments of Coloured Affairs, Water Affairs, Agricultural Technical Services and Mines. That commission found that if the Orange River Scheme was developed to its maximum and if the area that had been reserved for the Coloureds was developed to its full potential, it would become necessary to build a road between Vioolsdrift and Alexander Bay. This would immediately open up an area for us Which up to the present has been completely inaccessible. It has been impossible to enter this area with anything other than a helicopter or, perhaps with a particularly good jeep. It has been impossible to bring a drilling machine into that area. With these developments I believe that tremendous possibilities are being opened up. The Orange River Scheme will give us power, cheap electrical power; it will give us water for domestic and commercial purposes. I believe that if hydroelectric power can be generated in that area it will in the distant future lead to the supplementing of our power by means of a nuclear power station because the minerals that are needed for that purpose are to be found in that area.</p>

<p>We have confidence in that part of the country. Commerce has confidence in that area. Take for example the wonderful ship that arrived in Table Bay harbour to-day, the Swazi Coast, which will be put into service between Cape Town and Port Nolloth. The people in that area have confidence in the development that is taking place there. A large development company has been established there. Everything points to the fact that people have confidence in that area. And now I want to direct an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. I should actually ask for an Odendaal Commission because the area merits it, but that would perhaps be rather ambitious at present. That is why I appeal to the hon. the Minister to ask one of his Departments&#x2014;the Department of Economic Affairs or the Department of Mines&#x2014;to initiate inter-departmental discussions at high level, perhaps at Secretarial level, if possible. Unfortunately, because my time is limited, I cannot motivate my case any further but I ask that the Departments of Mines, of Railways and Harbours and of Defence, the Provincial Administration, the Departments of Agriculture and Water Affairs and the Department <span class="col_847-848" refersTo="page_0438"/>of Coloured Affairs should all participate in the discussions of this departmental committee, see what can be done for the development of this area and determine its potential. I want to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to think in this direction and I want to give him the assurance that I am convinced that the solution to the depopulation problem will to a large extent be found up there in the north-west. The leeway that the Cape has to make up in the economic field today may to a large extent be made up by an investigation of the possibilities I have mentioned.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down opened up on a very sound note. He said that the Opposition had maintained that the prosperity which the country was enjoying was not due to Government policy. He tried in some measure to destroy that argument, but failed lamentably, because he did admit that a great deal of it was due to the fact that a number of new mines had started and obviously had contributed to the economy of the country. Mr. Speaker, this side of the House does maintain that the prosperity of South Africa at the present time is not due to the policy of the Government. It is due, as they well know, themselves, to the remarkable wealth which this country enjoys, a great deal of which this side of the House when it was in government helped to initiate and put onto the road to full development. The development of the mines in the Free State formed the basis of the future prosperity which the country is enjoying to-day and for which the Minister tries to take credit. The hon. Minister of Finance must also admit that in this upsurge of progress it was necessary to have a free flow of labour and a plentiful supply of labour which the country enjoyed over the last ten years in the integration of a further, 1,000,000 unskilled workers into urban and rural life of South Africa. All these factors are important factors in helping the economy of the country.</p>

<p>I want to say further that the hon. the Minister must also answer as to why the prosperity of this country has developed in this remarkable manner when in fact it is due largely to the beleaguered economy Which this Government established some years ago when the reserves of our country began to drain away and when it feared the consequences of the loss of friends that it was beginning to suffer because of its policies. The economy immediately became anchored down and the doors of the country were closed. So we enjoy year by year nearly R400,000,000 to R600,000,000 of money which flows into the coffers of insurance companies and into the coffers of the Treasury from the mines whose production is increasing year by year, and money which also flows into the various savings accounts of building societies, banks and others as a result of the thriftiness of the public as well as the fact that the money cannot be invested as in any other economy namely without any limitations and without being restricted in any way. I do not begrudge my country this prosperity, no South African does, and some of the nonsense we hear on the Government side of the House that we begrudge the wealth we are enjoying must be answered by the fact that every South African not only enjoys the economy and the prosperity, but is working hard to help to build it up. After all private enterprise which must make use of the moneys which have accumulated is doing what we find in many other countries where there is a surplus of money&#x2014;money is being ploughed back into industry and commercial undertakings and the development of land. The money is being made use of, despite the Government, because money cannot lie idle and deteriorate in value. So one has to accept this policy, but nevertheless one must carry on and usefully employ the wealth of the country as it accumulates. It cannot lie idle. That is the common sense economic line which any country follows. But I would like to say further, Mr. Speaker, that the prosperity we are enjoying is not peculiar to South Africa. The prosperity which we are enjoying is a trend which one finds in other countries of the world to-day. Practically all countries are enjoying a trend of prosperity to-day. There are many reasons for it. Even the American economy, which we said was on the downgrade, has also experienced a sudden revival. If one looks at the economy of the Common Market and the economy in Europe in general, one finds the same trend. It is even true of Britain (which at one time was decried by the Government side), the economy of Australia, the economy of some South American countries, that of Canada&#x2014;all these economies are enjoying a buoyancy to-day which is certainly not less than the buoyancy and the rate of progress that we are enjoying in South Africa. So the hon. Minister of Finance cannot take credit to himself that it is as a result of the policies of the Government. The point I want the Minister to answer is this: I would like him to tell us how he is going to accept the advice given by this side of the House to entrench and contain and protect this buoyancy of the economy. There is only one way he can do it. He must bring about a cessation of the fear which this country has and should make its flow of money freer. If the hon. Minister can satisfy us that he need not rely on his control regulations, his foreign exchange regulations, to keep the economy beleaguered in order to maintain it, then we will get to appreciate that he has some appreciation of maintaining and continuing the prosperity and the buoyancy that South Africa is enjoying to-day. All countries have a reasonably free flow of money. In fact, Sir, economists have told him, and he knows it himself, that there is always the fear that unless we can relieve ourselves of the tremendous moneys that are accumulating year by year, by investing abroad, we will certainly go into a period of high inflation. That is one of <span class="col_849-850" refersTo="page_0439"/>the difficulties he has to face and which he has not been able to answer thus far.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member even does not look well. The point I want to make is that a thing may look very healthy and rosy on the outside, but is has to be healthy right through, the cross-section of it has got to be healthy, and that is what the hon. the Minister has got to convince this House and the country of&#x2014;not smugly that he has a prosperous economy, but rather seriously that he has a healthy economy. I want to say that there are certain trends of Government policy which will have a very unhappy effect on the country. We have listened to speakers to-day who spoke of the fact that despite world opinion this is what happens in South Africa, and despite the views of UNO this is what happens in South Africa. The contention all the time is that this side of the House has no right to warn about what world opinion says and what other people outside in the world say. But surely the Government should not adopt a negative policy of that nature. Surely it should be positive and try to make friends, even though they may have a lot of enemies. Surely the attitude of anyone who wants to find a healthy way of life is to make friends and break down the barriers and the prejudices in order to make friends. How does the Government expect this country to believe that they can continue to be impudent about the attitude of other peoples in the world, without making any effort to restore friendship and some links of understanding between ourselves and other nations? I believe it is a trite principle that one must make friends and have friends, and in order to do that we must take positive steps to bring this about, and one of the ways of doing it is to try to improve our image abroad. I want to say categorically that the Information Department is not taking positive steps to improve the South African image. I am sorry the Minister is not here, but unfortunately they rely on some films they have taken. Quite a number of members of this House have had a chance to travel and I have spoken to people in other parts of the world. To my view we, the unofficial ambassadors of South Africa, have helped to improve that image because we have been able to talk to people about our country and its problems. I want to say immediately that I find sympathy on the part of other people in the world when we discuss our problems, which are unique to this country. But when you arrogantly throw across a picture and then criticize people in other parts of the world for not accepting your point of view, how can you expect to have understanding? I would suggest that the Minister of Information must not sell Government policy abroad; he must sell South Africa. I would like my country to be presented properly to the world, and not the Government&#x2019;s policy. After all, why should the world be of the opinion that no opposition exists in this country and that it is only a one-party Government? That is what they would like to see. It is all very well for them to say the Opposition is weak and to deride the Opposition, but in doing that this Government is destroying the image of South Africa. That is what Ghana is doing. Ghana decided to have an election in order to establish a one-party state. Our Government surely, wishing to preserve a democratic institution and to give a correct world image, is surely not prepared to decry the Opposition where world opinion does not even know that an Opposition exits. [Interjections.] We should try to improve the image of our country abroad, not for to-day but for to-morrow and the next day, and if we do that we will make friends. The Minister of Finance knows, and he has been told by other members, of the very unfavourable image we enjoy politically in the very countries from which he gets loans. We know that bankers will give him the money, but bankers have given money to Nigeria and to Ghana and they have even invested money in the Congo. They will invest money anywhere if there is a chance to earn interest. But the Minister should not seek solace in the fact that because they think they are getting a reasonable interest therefore he has overcome the problem of our not having friends abroad. I believe that this country, which has always enjoyed very high standing and friendship in the world, should try to make friends.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the Minister of Economic Affairs something else. I was in a country which is about 2,500 miles long and 2,000 miles broad, Australia, where he has a trade commissioner resident in Canberra, which has a population of about 40,000 people and is 250 miles away from Sydney, which has 2,500,000 people, and 300 miles away from Melbourne, which has 2,000,000 people, but his trade commissioner sits in Canberra. He has no office even in these two big cities, and I think that difficulty prevails also in other parts of the world. I was also in another part of the world, and this I will not disclose simply because I do not want to embarrass anyone. But there the trade commissioner is crying out for proper propaganda from South Africa. He says: I can sell my country with a great image every day if only I have the facilities <span class="col_851-852" refersTo="page_0440"/>and the means. I was led to the very sad conclusion that this Government is quite happy to be in isolation. It is one of these unfortunate psychological complexes where, if they are in isolation, they can appeal to the sympathy of the public and call upon them to stand together because the world is against us. We do not need to have that kind of thing because we are not that type of people. We are people who can move freely in all parts of the world and make a very good impression if only the Government, with its machinery, would help a proper impression being created.</p>

<p>I believe there are two ways in which our country may improve its image. One is by sound and intelligent propaganda, and it should be done through ambassadors, and not artificial ambassadors. The second method is to have sound business links. I want to tell the Minister of Economic Affairs that a few years ago he sent two or three trade commissions to the East, to South America and to Australia. I mention Australia because there has been talk in international circles by people who study these matters of a possibility of a common market between ourselves and what we call our sisters of the South, following a very interesting book written by a South African in regard to the links between ourselves and those countries. These missions that went abroad went to cocktail parties and met important people, but nothing came of it, unless the Minister can tell us how our trade increased. But I find that if the Department would encourage people who are actually engaged in business to go there to investigate matters in certain fields of industrial activity, they would bring back very much better information which would enable us to establish sound and proper trade links between ourselves and those countries. I want to repeat what I said before. We must not content ourselves with the fact that we are enjoying at the moment unprecedented prosperity. That is due to many factors which the Minister of Finance has neither initiated nor controlled. He can only reap the benefit of it. But if we are to maintain a healthy economy, we must improve our image abroad by an amelioration of the policies of this Government and by improving our trade. When I go abroad I want to be faced with a question from an individual as to what my country is like, but not what is my country&#x2019;s policy in regard to the Olympic Games and in regard to job reservation, etc. I say we have failed to be positive in our approach to public relations between South Africa and other countries, and we have even failed to build up new and stronger trade links with other countries. I say we must give it serious attention and not allow ourselves to be deluded by some of the things we have heard here to-day, always decrying what the Opposition says, and stating that we are a prosperous country. We must be a positive country and not a negative one.</p>

<speech by="#niemand">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEMAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to refute the allegation made by the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) that the Government is not responsible for the prosperity prevailing in our country to-day. Business people in this country have confidence in the Government and it is for that reason that they are investing their money in the gold mines and in industry. Another reason is the availability of labour. It has been this Government that has made this possible for them and that is why they have confidence in this country. While the United Party has no good word to say for the efforts of the Government, I shall, later in my speech, tell the House what strangers have to say about our economy and I hope that hon. members opposite will learn a lesson from it.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about isolation. That is all very well. We must try to win friends overseas. We have the Department of Information and the Department of Foreign Affairs for this purpose. We know that these people are doing their best and we are spending large sums of money in this regard. But what is actually the position? It has been stated in this House previously this year that what people want is that we should hand the country over to the Bantu. We cannot satisfy those friends whom the hon. member has mentioned with anything less than a policy of one man, one vote.</p>

<p>Sir Edgar Whitehead offered at UNO to hand over Southern Rhodesia to a black majority within 15 years and they were not satisfied with that offer. And so all that I can imagine is that the hon. member is prepared to bid higher than Sir Edgar White-head did. The United Party do not hold a licence to sow the seeds of dissention in this House but they do have a licence to give credit to the Government where credit is due. It is the practice when money is voted for the country&#x2019;s administration that the Opposition has the opportunity to criticize the Government. We have nothing against this but I am opposed to the fact that they should use this opportunity simply to pass destructive criticism which is not in the interests of South Africa. We know that the Opposition make promises to the voters until they are blue in the face. They make promises that will cost hundreds of millions of rand although they know the funds are not available to make good those promises. They promise numbers of services to people and at the same time they say that the taxpayers should pay less tax. How can they reconcile these two things with each other? But I can understand why they do this sort of thing. They know that they will never come into power and so have to answer to the voters for their irresponsible actions in this House. It is the duty and the task of this Government to give maximum services to the public by means of the imposition of minimum taxes, and that is what we are doing.</p>

<p><span class="col_853-854" refersTo="page_0441"/>I looked up the amendments that the Opposition moved in this debate over the past few years. In 1961 they were worried about the continued out flow of investment capital, the loss of skilled, useful citizens, the general sluggishness of the country&#x2019;s economic development and the resultant slump in our agriculture and in our trade. The Government has gone into all these matters and it is still giving these matters its attention. The matters that they have mentioned in their amendment to-day are also matters to which the Government is giving attention. In 1961 the Opposition spread frightening stories throughout the country. They talked the country into bankruptcy. They painted a black picture of our economy. If they go back over their speeches&#x2014;I am referring amongst others to the hon. members for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman)&#x2014;they will cover their faces with shame. Last year they asked for higher pensions, a matter to which we are all sympathetically disposed, but over the past ten years with the exception of two years, this Government has improved the position of pensioners each year and we still do more for them.</p>

<p>What is the truth about the economy of South Africa? The truth is that notwithstanding all the frightening tales of the Opposition, this Government is becoming stronger and is progressing step by step with the result that the number on that side of the House is becoming smaller and smaller. Things are going well in our country and that is why the Opposition are so concerned. Under this Government South Africa has become one of the most prosperous countries in the world. In saying this, I must say immediately that I sympathize with the people in my constituency and in the northern Transvaal generally who are living in drought-stricken areas and who have not been able to share in this prosperity. Unfortunately the Government has no control over climatic conditions. But here, too, the Government has been of assistance and we are grateful for it. Not only do our Whites enjoy a standard of living that is amongst the highest in the world, but the standard of living of the Bantu is also higher than that of any other nation in Africa. It is admitted that South Africa is one of the countries that offers the best prospects to the investor. We are now producing 70 per cent of the free world&#x2019;s gold. We are producing more gem diamonds, chrome and platinum that any other country in the world. We are second in the world in our production of asbestos and antimony and third as far as manganese and industrial diamonds are concerned. We also produce large quantities of copper, coal, silver and magnetite. The value of our minerals amounts to R900,000,000 annually. Over the past 50 years since 1910 our production has doubled regularly every 10 years. Our coal and iron ore is amongst the cheapest in the world and that is why South Africa is in a position to produce cheap steel and power. But this National Government has harnessed these riches and has made good use of them. It has not been asleep as the United Party was when it was in power. We started Iscor in the 1920&#x2019;s and under the present Government we started Sasol and Foscor, undertakings that the Opposition opposed. What is more, we will find oil some day. What a stimulant these great State undertakings have been for our economy. Our industrial production rose from R992,000,000 in 1947 to R3,175,000,000 in 1961. Our factories are to-day responsible for 25 per cent of our national income. In 1961 our national income was R4,271,000,000, treble the 1947 figure. Our public debt at the moment only amounts to R175 per <i>capita</i> of the population as against an amount of R964 in the United States of America. Under our Government South Africa has progressed to such an extent that she is attracting the attention of the Bantu around us, and now that the Whites are leaving the other Africa States, large numbers of them are coming to South Africa because they think that the policy of this party is the right one and because they know that our economy is flourishing. Our population is increasing by 250,000 each year and this is giving us a greater market for our growing industrial and agricultural production. The numbers of Whites are being supplemented further by the immigration policy of the Government and our sources of skilled labour are being strengthened in this way.</p>

<p>We find that over the past years the United Party have complained about and moved motions in connection with unemployment but to-day they resent the fact that there are not sufficient people to do all the work. But the Government has to bear the responsibility for this. It takes the credit for the prosperity that exists in the country to-day but if things go wrong it must also take that responsibility. The Opposition must realize that when things are going well the Government should also be given the credit. The growth of our country is the direct result of the policy and the programme of action of this Government. I want to refer to what Prof. Horace Gilbert of the U.S.A. had to say. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The performance of the South African economy was one of the miracles of modern times. It is a miracle and it is important that this message be carried back to the U.S.A.</block>

<p>That is what he thinks of our economy, but that side of the House has no good word to say about our economy. Development projects costing R2,000 million have been announced over the past few years for the vast proportion of which this Government has been responsible. Amongst others there is the Orange River Scheme, the Pongola Dam Scheme and our great defence plan and railway construction programme which it is estimated will cost R400 million over the next 10 years. It is estimated that Iscor will spend about R600 million over the next 10 years and Sasol R30 million. South Africa&#x2019;s Balance of payments position showed a deficit of R71,000,000 in 1960-1. It <span class="col_855-856" refersTo="page_0442"/>was in that year that the prophets of doom forecast a dark light for South Africa and gave us no hope for the future. But the year after that, in 1961-2, there was a surplus of R249,000,000. When we take an important industry like the motor-car industry, we find that the Director of Imports and Exports had the following to say as far as spare parts were concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Two of the factors which have helped to stimulate foundry works here are, firstly, the Government&#x2019;s policy of causing as much as possible of industry&#x2019;s requirements of plant and equipment to be made locally, and secondly, the new approach to the motor industry and the encouragement the Government has given to local motor assemblers to obtain components from local resources.</block>

<p>Here we also find an acknowledgment that the motor industry is being stimulated by the Government because people are being encouraged to use more South African spare parts. This has resulted in a boom in this industry. The engineering industry has also been assisted in this way and one finds that a salesman to-day is proud to sell one a motorcar and to say that a certain percentage of South African material has been used in the manufacture of that car.</p>

<p>In regard to South Africa&#x2019;s economic future I should like to read what Mr. Arthur Goldman had to say, according to a report that appeared in the <i>Sunday Express</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Greater prosperity lies ahead for South Africa. This is the confident and dramatic forecast of economists, bankers, industrialists, businessmen and Government officials.</block>

<p>He said this in 1962. Take our fruit exports. In 1960-1 when the referendum on the Republic was held, the United Party asked what our fruit farmers would do with their fruit. In 1961-2, just a year after they had spread their stories about bankruptcy, our fruit exports to Britain increased by 23 per cent over the exports for the previous year. They like our products there. The sound economic position of South Africa is due to the steps that have been taken by this Government. State expenditure in 1947-8, expressed as a percentage of our net national income, was 22.9 per cent. In 1959-60, it was 21.9 per cent, one per cent less. Taxes for 1959-60, also expressed as a percentage of our national income, amounted to 13.6 per cent while in Britain the figure was 29 per cent for 1957-8, more than twice as much. An encouraging factor that we must not lose sight of is that our workers in this country are satisfied. We have labour peace and no strikes. This is the reason for the Opposition&#x2019;s concern and why they do not have one good word to say about our economic growth. Indeed, the National Party has a record of which it can be proud.</p>

<p>No, the hon. member is too long. (Laughter.) Why does the hon. member say these things? He knows better. He spoke about Southern Rhodesia and then he used the cunning argument that Southern Rhodesia had made the offer to the oversea countries that Southern Rhodesia would be black within 15 years and that those countries did not want to accept that offer. What is the conclusion? The hon. member could only conclude that we, the Opposition, would offer a better proposition; in other words, that this side of the House was in favour of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. That is the story that they want to tell the people outside. The Nationalist Party can continue to paint that picture to the people but on each occasion that it is painted in that way on a public platform, the person painting that picture will know that it is untrue. Hon. members opposite will be co-responsible if a picture of that kind is painted. But the hon. member <span class="col_857-858" refersTo="page_0443"/>did not stop there. He said that we were the people who had made so many promises. If it was an hon. member opposite I would remain silent about promises.</p>

<p>I only have 20 minutes and it would take me the full 20 minutes to read out all the promises which they have made and which they have not carried out. Where are the free vacation resorts that they wanted to give to the workers? [Interjection.] Hon. members know who said that but they do not remember their own promises. Where is the national medical scheme and what has happened to the promise that the workers would participate in the profits of companies? The hon. the Minister of Transport made that promise. Hon. members opposite should be rather careful when they talk about promises. People who live in glass houses should not throw stones.</p>

<p>Actually, I want to discuss another matter. It deals with a subject that is very close to the hearts of hon. members opposite and which is a source of worry to me. I refer to the question of job reservation. [Interjections.] Hon. members there have only two things on their minds, the Broderbund and the <i>Sunday Times.</i> I want to say a few words about job reservation. This is a principle that was introduced into South Africa because the Government believed that the White worker would be faced with competition from the Coloured worker and because the Government also believed that it was necessary to protect the White worker. As I see the matter, that is the specific purpose of job reservation. But there is also a general purpose. Broadly speaking, job reservation must be viewed as one of the aspects of the policy of the National Government that is aimed at ensuring the survival of the White man in South Africa. I think that is the background against which we must approach the question of job reservation, approach it, study it and judge it&#x2014;the safeguarding of the White man in South Africa and the retention of his way of life. In considering the question as to how far job reservation serves this purpose, there is one other aspect which the White man in South Africa must never forget.</p>

<p>As I see the matter the White man in South Africa can only survive if he acts in such a way that his best will be good enough to justify his survival. In other words, he must develop to such an extent as far as his character and his mental ability are concerned that his survival will be justified on those grounds. In this connection it can be said that throughout the ages the best in man has only come to the fore as a result of trouble and competition. Competition is the factor which throughout the ages has pushed people to the top. It is competition, struggle and hardship that strengthens and tempers nations. On the other hand, it is the absence of struggle and competition that makes a nation deteriorate into a dull mass, unprepared and unable to fight the battle that has to be fought. It is precisely in this respect that job reservation is a source of worry to me. I am worried because job reservation excludes the element of competition and gives the White man a sham protection and false security. In any case, I fear that the White worker may develop such a frame of mind, a spirit of &#x201C;I need not be afraid; the Government will help me&#x201D; and that he need not therefore fear competition from other races. The State will ensure that he has no competition by reserving his job. If such a frame of mind grips a nation, it will be the easiest thing in the world to lead that nation to its destruction. My plea to-night is that if job reservation makes any contribution at all, no matter how small, to a blunting of the spirit of the worker in South Africa, then it must be abolished. What is the use of job reservation producing material benefits? In the long run all these things will disappear, just as the people themselves will disappear because they will not have the necessary mental ability and character.</p>

<p>Should job reservation also be abolished in the mines?</p>

<p>In any case, I believe that the White nation in South Africa should not be molly-coddled; and in any event it does not want to be molly-coddled. It is rather the task of the Government to present the problems of our time realistically to the people. The challenges that our time presents must not be hidden from the people. They must be told that although the Government is prepared to look after the worker, we must not lose sight of the fact that it can be harmful to do too much for the worker.</p>

<p>Since I am discussing this aspect of the care of our people, I think there are two groups in particular who must be well looked after. There are the aged&#x2014;those who have come to the end of the road and to whom job reservation no longer means anything&#x2014;and then there are the children of our country who are about to face this struggle. The State must look after those two groups. We have heard to-day about all the prosperity that apparently exists in our country. That is true. But what a pity it is large numbers of our people do not as yet share that prosperity. This morning an old lady came to my office. She was in tears. She could not draw her old-age pension because, not knowing what the result would be, she had let a small room in her flat with the idea of supplementing her income. She told me that she could have been dishonest and could have kept quiet about it and then she would still have received her pension. The point that I want to emphasize is that such an old person who has come to the end of her life should not be placed in such an unenviable position. That is the pity of it all. Hon. members talk about the prosperity in our country and then they allow cases of this kind to arise. I may <span class="col_859-860" refersTo="page_0444"/>say that there are hundreds of similar cases in my constituency. A state of affairs of this kind does not redound to the credit of a country like South Africa. We ought to look after our old people better.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are our children. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that a large percentage of people in the lower income group, in spite of the prosperity in our country, are simply not able to give their children any training to prepare them for life? I think the time has come when the Government which is prepared to spend so many thousands of rand so that citizens of other countries can settle here&#x2014;and quite rightly so too&#x2014;should say to itself that no South African girl or boy who has the necessary ability should be permitted to leave school or university simply because he or she does not have the money for further study. The State should ensure that they are given the necessary assistance. We hear it said so often&#x2014;and it is so shocking&#x2014;that it is the poor people who have many children.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that that hon. member is becoming quite excited. I did not say that any hon. member had said it and if the hon. member had been awake he would have appreciated what I was saying. I say that this is a general statement that is made and that it is shocking because if there is one thing for which we must be grateful to the parents of South Africa, rich and poor alike, it is for the sons and daughters that they have given our country. We must ensure that those children are properly looked after if the parents are not able to look after them themselves.</p>

<p>We are on the threshold of the Budget once again and I want to make an urgent plea to the hon. the Minister not only to increase family allowances but also to increase the maximum above which no allowance is paid. The hon. the Minister may ask where he is to find the money. This Government has never been short of a cent to carry out its ideological policies and if the children of South Africa need it, we must also find the money for them. No nation can make a better investment than in the future of its youth.</p>

<p>What we are now witnessing, Mr. Speaker, is evidence of the bankruptcy of this Government when it has to face up to the attacks which we, from this side of the House, have launched. We have charged the Government in respect of various fields of its administration. And yet there is not one single member out of a total of 106 sitting on that side of the House, nor a single Cabinet Minister with the ability or courage to get up and try to defend the shambles which they have made of the administration of the country. Only a few so far were prepared to get up and try to do so but they made a miserable attempt at defending the policies of the Cabinet. If that is the way in which members on the other side approach a debate in which this House is asked to vote millions of rand for spending by this Government, if they are not prepared to argue about the spending of that amount, then we have the right to ask that the debate be adjourned.</p>

<p>Debate adjourned.</p>
