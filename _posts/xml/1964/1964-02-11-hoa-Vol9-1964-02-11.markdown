<question by="#durrant" to="#prime_minister">

<num>*II.</num>

<from>Mr. DURRANT</from>

<p>asked the Prime Minister</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he received any report during 1963 in regard to options taken by a private company on farms in the area of Welwitchia in South West Africa; if so, (a) when and (b) what action did he take; and</li>

<li>(2) whether the Deputy Minister for South West Africa Affairs made any statement in regard to the matter; if so, what were the contents thereof.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#prime_minister" to="#durrant">

<from>The PRIME MINISTER</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes, in July 1963, but the report referred to the whole of South West Africa and not only to the Welwitchia area.</li>

<li>(2) Yes, in consultation with me. The statement read as follows:</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">According to a Press report brought to my attention, options are being taken on a large scale on certain farms in South West Africa, at a price far above the market value. The report claims that it is suspected that these farms will be purchased with a view to re-sale to Kenya farmers migrating to Southern Africa.</block>

<block name="quote">Since settlement is in the first place a matter for the State, I consider it my duty to warn that, if the Government is not consulted when private settlement schemes are started, the Government will not hesitate to take any steps necessary for the protection of interested parties.</block>

<block name="quote">Furthermore, I wish to point out also that, if at any time it should be deemed necessary for the State to utilize land for settlement or any other purposes, the necessary steps are always taken to ensure that on acquisition of land only the actual value thereof is taken into consideration and not any inflated or speculative value, whether options exist or not.</block>

<block name="quote">In conclusion, attention is directed to the fact that laws exist in South West Africa which prohibit settlers from granting options on their land. Options granted contrary to those laws are invalid and settlers will be endangering their property rights by doing so.</block>

</answer>

<question by="#durrant" to="#prime_minister">

<from>Mr. DURRANT:</from>

<p>Arising out of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s reply, is he aware that the area in which certain of these options were taken, Welwitchia, is an area proposed for separate homelands by the Commission of Inquiry?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#prime_minister" to="#durrant">

<from>The PRIME MINISTER:</from>

<p>That may be true, but that is not in conflict with this reply at all.</p>

<p><i>Remark</i></p>

<p>No information is available locally to furnish a reply to, question 2 (a), but can be obtained from the International Wool Secretariat if necessary. It is important to note that the visits to South Africa, especially in the case of directors of the I. W. S., were often included in a circular tour to various wool producing countries and that visits were paid to South Africa on the way to or from those countries. It will therefore be difficult to determine the costs specifically.</p>

<li>(1) Which of the 21 farmers in certain districts of Natal stated by him on 28 January 1964, to have been visited by officials of his Department since 31 July 1963, were approached for permission to enter on to their farms;</li>

<ol>

<li>(1) All farmers whose farms were entered were approached for permission to enter.</li>

<li>(2) Yes.</li>

<li>(3) (a) It is regretted that due to a misunderstanding the reply to question (1) (b) on 28 January 1964 should have omitted the words &#x201C;for the purpose of listing improvements&#x201D;. It has now been determined that only one farm, namely the farm Maqikizana district Umzinto was visited for this purpose. In regard to the other farms the position is that they constitute the group known as the Umtamvuna farms, district of Alfred (Harding) which were offered on the initiative of the Umtamvuna Farmers Association. Officials visited the area during the latter half of 1963 without actually entering any of the farms in order to report on the general situation of the farms in relation to the adjoining Bantu areas.</li>

<li>(b) Mr. H. B. Cole.</li>

<li>(4) In so far as the farm Maqikizana is concerned it was visited on 18 October 1963 in the presence of the owner.</li>

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) and (b) Yes, four research vessels which operate within and beyond the territorial waters of the Republic and South West Africa. These vessels are designed for basic oceanographical research and as a matter of routine collect data concerning commercially important marine animals and the physical and chemical properties of the waters in which these animals are usually found. Routine cruises are made monthly off the Cape coast where commercial fishing is mainly concentrated. Twice a year special cruises are made to Walvis Bay and vicinity in collaboration with the South West Africa Administration. These routine investigations are supplemented by oceanic cruises hitherto mainly in collaboration with the International Indian Ocean Expedition. The latter cruises are now being extended to the South Atlantic Ocean.

<p>The Republic and South West Africa are engaged in a combined research programme and consequently the four vessels owned by the latter Administration are similarly employed.</p>

<p>Apart from the aforementioned duties the four vessels owned by the Department of Commerce and Industries, in an effort to curb contraventions of the sea fisheries regulations, keep a watchful eye on commercial netting operations when they are on routine research work in areas where such netting takes place;</p></li>

<p>In debate after debate in this House we hear a beautiful little fairy story from hon. members opposite; we hear how the beautiful princess, South African Economy, was imprisoned and starved by a heartless stepfather, the United Party Government, until you could not tell her from Olive Oyle, Popeyes&#x2019; girl-friend. From this sorry plight she was rescued in 1948 by the dashing prince, Nationalist Party, who immediately married her and ever since she has never stopped growing until to-day she must look like Twoton Tessie. Sir, what are the facts? Has there been this tremendous acceleration of economic growth throughout all these years since this Government came into office? These are some of the adjectives to which I have listened in this House in the past to describe <span class="col_1131-1132" refersTo="page_0580"/>the growth that is supposed to have taken place&#x2014;&#x201C;remarkable&#x201D;, &#x201C;phenomenal&#x201D;, &#x201C;explosive&#x201D;, &#x201C;exceptional&#x201D;. I think the hon. the Minister of Finance will agree that there is only one simple test as to whether a country is getting richer or not, and that is the national income figures. Let us see what has happened to the national income figures. In the <i>South African Journal of Economics</i> of September 1963, Mr. Stadler of the University of Pretoria has collated all the national income figures over a long period and given the rate of growth of a national income ever since 1911. When we look at these figures, what do we find? We find that in 1938 the national income was R752,100,000. This increased to R1,735,900,000 in 1948, which is an increase of plus-minus 120 per cent over these ten years under the United Party Government. What happened in the next ten years? From 1948 until 1958 the national income increased from R1,735,900,000 to R3,938,300,000, also an increase of plus-minus 120 per cent. In both these periods retail prices increased by about 50 per cent. We thus see that the South African economy grew just as fast between 1938 and 1948 under, according to hon. members opposite, a terribly bad Government, a useless Government, which left South Africa impoverished and its economy in a very poor state, as it did in the subsequent decade of 1948 to 1958 under a wonderful Government of all the talents. There was, of course, this difference, that in the ten-year period from 1938 to 1948 the United Party Government had the little difficulty of a world war on its hands&#x2014;six years of world war when there was of necessity a tremendous divergence of the country&#x2019;s resources and manpower to wasteful wartime production. On top of that we know what problems we had with shipping, with imports and exports, and imports and exports are more important to South Africa than to most countries in the world. As the result of these difficulties gold production actually declined over this period, and on top of all that one had an Opposition which to say the least was not very helpful. I have looked at some of the speeches which were made in that period by hon. members opposite who now occupy very important positions&#x2014;and talk about Jeremiahs! You should read some of those speeches! They seem to resent every development of the economy in South Africa in that period.</p>

<p>In contrast to that period the present Government has governed in ten of the most prosperous years that the world has ever seen as far as economic growth is concerned. Never have the Western countries and countries like Japan grown so rapidly as in this post-war period. The value of gold production, through a whole lot of fortuitous circumstances, has increased over this period from R200,000,000 to R440,000,000, which is more than a doubling in value compared with the almost static conditions under the United Party Government. Despite this good fortune and, if we must believe hon. members opposite, the genius in their ranks, we find that in fact in this post-war period we have had no faster rate of growth than in those difficult war years, surely it is quite clear that we have not had this economic miracle which we are always told about by hon. members opposite. We have had very normal rates of growth in a period during which the rate of growth should have been much faster if one has to judge by other Western countries. I think the Minister of Finance will agree with me that all economic growth depends on investment and that the rate of net fixed investment decides how rapidly your economy will expand. Now, let us see what has happened to this rate of net fixed investment&#x2014;the rate of the investment figure over the national income figure&#x2014;since this Government took over. When this Government took over this figure was in the region of about 20 per cent, and since then, according to the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch, we find that this is what has happened since 1951 onwards: When we look at Table V on page 14 we see that the rate of net fixed capital formation, expressed as a percentage of net national income, showed a strong downward tendency from 1951 onwards. If the Minister of Finance looks at that table he will see that in 1951, 1952 and 1953 it was 18.6, 21.6 and 20.6 per cent, respectively, which was more or less the level which obtained when this Government took over in 1948, but then it showed a downward tendency until in the last three years, in 1960, 1961 and 1962, it dropped to 13.3 per cent, 12.4 per cent and 11.7 per cent respectively. Private capital, the most productive form on which the returns are highest, dropped even more alarmingly from 12.7 per cent, 14.3 per cent and 11. 7 per cent in the first three years to 6.9 per cent, 6.4 per cent and 5.3 per cent, that is to say, less than half of what it was when this Government took over. How can the Minister come and tell us here, when your investment rate drops to such an extent, that this is a wonderful Government and that the country is growing very rapidly? How is it possible, unless they have found some magic whereby we can grow rapidly in spite of the fact that our investment rate drops all the time. No other country has ever solved that problem yet. Sir, it is because of this low rate of investment that the rate of growth that we have witnessed in the last 18 months, which is regarded as normal in the Common Market countries, should so quickly threaten inflation here so that the Minister himself is already feeling for the footbrake of the car and appeals for self-control as far as prices are concerned. Sir, I would like to say to the Minister that the best form of self-control is rapid economic growth and competition. There is nothing that induces an industrialist or a commercial man or for that matter a farmer to exercise self-control as much as competition, and unfortunately, for reasons which have been stated on this side again and again, this <span class="col_1133-1134" refersTo="page_0581"/>Government, in its policies generally, does not allow a free play of competition in our economy because of the artificial restrictions in so many spheres of our economic life. Sir, it would indeed have been remarkable if South Africa had the remarkable growth rate which Government members imagine. South Africa could then have been an object lesson to the whole Western world; hon. members opposite could then have explained to the Common Market countries and Japan, &#x201C;If you want to grow rapidly, what you must do is to restrict your supplies of labour in the big cities by influx control; remove certain types of labour completely from certain areas, as is being done in the Western Province; restrict the acquisition of skills amongst large sections of your workers through job reservation and threaten to carve up your country into a number of new states but do not tell potential investors where the borders will be; keep out skilled immigrants by a restrictive immigration policy, and in this way you will grow rapidly. &#x201D; Sir, what has happened in fact? The Common Market countries, not being as clever as this Cabinet of all the talents, did exactly the opposite and grew twice as fast. Far from South Africa&#x2019;s growth under this Government having been exceptional, it has slowed down tremendously. That is if one looks over the whole term. If the hon. the Minister wants to look just at the recent past he probably will feel very pleased but if he looks at the trend over the whole period and if he looks at his investment rate he will realize that this economy is growing far below its potential rate. Because the economic growth has slowed down so much the improvement in the standard of living of the people has also been very slow, and not very rapid as hon. members opposite claim.</p>

<p>On page 329 of its report, the Odendaal Commission, for instance, gives a table of the compound rate of growth of real <i>per capita</i> income. In other words, the figure that measures how rapidly the standard of living improves in any country. They give the figures for 31 countries over a period of seven years, eight years, 12 years and 13 years. It shows how enormously this figure which measures the improvement in the standard of living in countries has varied. It shows that in countries like the Argentine and Chile there has actually been a decline in the standard of living. South West Africa is one of the countries where there has been a great increase in this figure. Japan shows a rate of 7. 9 per cent per annum; the United Kingdom, which is regarded in the Western world as a country which is growing slowly&#x2014;the Labour Party in the United Kingdom is certainly very worried about the rate of growth&#x2014;has a figure of 2. 3 per cent; the Federation of Rhodesia grew at a rate of 3. 5 per cent; Germany at the rate of 5. 9 per cent, France, 3. 6 per cent, Italy 5. 4 per cent. Those are the figures at which the standard of living was improved, Sir. No South African figures are given because the source on which the commission relied did not give figures for South Africa. But according to the figures given in Table IV of the survey made by the Stellenbosch Bureau I have calculated&#x2014;the Minister can tell me if I am wrong&#x2014;that over a somewhat similar period, say from 1950 to 1962, our compound rate of growth <i>per capita</i> of real income was 1. 6 per cent and for the shorter period from 1955 to 1962 it was 1. 2 per cent. So it is quite clear that as long as the Nationalist Party Government remains in power the slower will our standard of living rise. If you compare these figures of mine, 1. 2 per cent and 1. 6 per cent&#x2014;the Minister can take whichever he wants&#x2014;with the table given here of 31 countries, and I take it that the Odendaal Commission took those 31 countries at random, you will find that far from heading the economic league, as hon. members opposite think, South Africa is near the bottom. We are amongst the last six countries of these 31.</p>

<p>If it is nonsense, then the Odendaal Commission is talking nonsense in their report. As far as more or less Westernized communities are concerned, I am not talking about under-developed countries, I think South Africa&#x2019;s rate of improvement in the standard of living, far from being one of the highest, is one of the lowest. It has probably developed half as fast as it should have. This is the economic sacrifice that we always hear such a lot about from hon. members on the Government benches that South Africa must make for apartheid and which we have in fact made. We have forgone an improvement in the standard of living that would probably have been twice as high as that which we have achieved. Of course, hon. members on the other side are entitled to say that this sacrifice was necessary to maintain White civilization. Whenever things are not going so well we have the slogan: Rather poor and White than rich and Black. It is only when there is a bit of a boom on that they forget that slogan and point out the tremendous development that has taken place. What has happened, Sir? Has the apartheid policy kept us poorer but whiter? If you look at the latest census figures I very much doubt this too. Because according to the latest census figures, over the decade prior to 1960, the Bantu had increased by over 1,000,000 in the cities compared with only 500,000 Whites. In the platteland the Whites had decreased by 46,000 and the Blacks had actually increased by 1,300,000. I think the true slogan should be: Apartheid makes us poorer but not whiter. I think that is a far more true description of apartheid than that it makes us poorer but whiter. How could it be otherwise, Mr. Speaker? Just look at the rate at which our labour force is growing. Professor Sadie recently made a calculation of the rate at which the White male labour force increased every year in South Africa and was likely to increase <span class="col_1135-1136" refersTo="page_0582"/>over the next five years, excluding White females and excluding immigration. He found that our White labour force increased by only 14,000 per annum. Sir, how can you expect a country with an economy of the magnitude of South Africa&#x2019;s, a country with the capital formation which we have, a country with the resources which we have, to grow to its fullest extent with such a slow rate in its labour force? If apartheid is applied 100 per cent it implies that our whole economic development must be based largely on White labour. How can you have economic development if your rate of growth in the labour field is as slow as that? How can you have economic development if you do not have large-scale immigration; if you do not have a scheme of immigration which, until two years ago, the hon. the Minister and hon. members opposite have refused to embark upon?</p>

<p>Hon. members can claim that with more rapid industrialization the White man would have been swamped even to a greater degree but rapid economic growth, with a vigorous immigration policy, would probably have increased the White population by 1,000,000. We would, therefore, not only have been a richer country but Western civilization would have been far more strongly entrenched. The cost of this Government to the country, if you look at it objectively, Sir, has not only been a much slower rate of growth and much slower advancement of standards of living but the cost has probably been a million White people. Can you imagine what the immigration policy of this side of the House, a policy which has at last now been accepted by the Government, a policy which is equivalent to General Smuts&#x2019; policy before 1948, would have meant to South Africa, especially to Cape Town? Do you think the Foreshore development&#x2014;which, incidentally is another monument to the United Party&#x2014;would have been as undeveloped as it is today? That area would have been totally built-up, Sir. Every White person who comes to this country, with his greater technical and administrative skill, increases not only the national income in proportion to his own productive efforts but magnifies it because &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Had I known it would be such a stupid question, Mr. Speaker, I would not have sat down for it. The proof of the pudding is that we had 47,000 immigrants during the last year of the Smuts Government without job reservation. They have only now reached that rate of immigration with job reservation and all. What the hon. member does not seem to realize is that if you do not restrict the development of South Africa, that development would be so rapid that there would be a continuous shortage of the type of skills which the Western immigrant has, skills which the ordinary non-White in this country, for historical and traditional reasons, has not got. The more rapid you grow the greater your shortage of White people, comparatively speaking, will become. That is what the hon. member does not understand. In any event, look at the large-scale immigration we had before this Government took over without job reservation. By restricting the economic development of this country you will in the long run restrict immigration too.</p>

<p>Without apartheid we would not have been so totally isolated from the Western world. South Africa would still have had powerful friends amongst the great Western powers. The Minister knows as well as I do that this isolation is one of the indirect reasons why we are not developing as rapidly as we should. Because we are so isolated and because these threats are constantly made against South Africa the climate for confidence is impaired both locally and overseas amongst industrialists. It is not only the direct results of apartheid that slows down the rate of growth of our economy but also the indirect results. One can only deduce, Sir, that apartheid, far from safeguarding the White man, has only led to a great slowing down of our economic growth and isolated the Western community here politically from the great Western communities overseas.</p>

<p>I realize, of course, that because of what I have said here, because I have pointed out how Government policy has slowed down South Africa&#x2019;s development, I shall get the normal stock answer and be accused of slowing down that development myself. It is the old old argument that when we warn the Government about the consequences of its policy we are told that our warnings and not the Government&#x2019;s policy are responsible for the consequences. It reminds me of the story I heard about President Kruger. He was out hunting and was sitting next to the camp fire one night. He had a tame baboon with him. The story goes that as it got colder and colder the baboon came nearer and nearer to the fire. President Kruger chased the baboon away every time and warned him that he would burn himself. But as it got colder the baboon went nearer and nearer to the fire until he did burn himself in the end. President Kruger then finished the story by saying: &#x201C;Do you know what he did then? He bit my leg because he thought my warnings had burnt him instead of the fire. &#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) has tried hard, by jumping from one point to another, to prove that there is no longer confidence in the economy of South Africa and that things are not going well with us. The best that he could do was to admit that there was &#x201C;a bit of a boom&#x201D;. I can well understand why that is the hon. member&#x2019;s approach. He always finds himself sitting between two stools. As a practical businessman with all his contacts in the business world he knows <span class="col_1137-1138" refersTo="page_0583"/>that things are going well. He knows that from reports. He has his hand on the pulse of this country&#x2019;s economy. He knows how to use that knowledge. He knows how to advise others; he encourages others to come and invest here. That is his role as a businessman. But he also has another role and that is his role as a politician. As a politician his role is that of successor to the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson). At some time or other the mantle of Jeremiah must fall on his shoulders. That is why he has to attack and try, in his role as politician, to paint a sombre picture, a sombre picture which as a businessman he knows is not quite correct. When it comes to this sort of debate therefore he is a Dr. Jykell and Mr. Hyde. Before one can judge him one must always make sure which mask he is wearing. Let us hear, for example, what the hon. member said last year. According to Hansard he said this on 28 March 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We used to have an economy which was very viable, but what have we to-day? We have an economy which is struggling on without a real future.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member said last year. I can understand therefore why he is struggling to-day. Last year he said that we had an economy which was struggling on without a real future and to-day, in 1964, at a time when we are entering a period in which our economy is characterized by full employment, it is his duty, in his role as politician, to say something and to criticize us. Sir, we have an extraordinary degree of prosperity; we have increasing turnovers, we have a rising production, we have a bigger volume of rail transport, we have a bigger volume of exports. The ships which called at our harbours last month broke all records. In spite of what has been said here about our import restrictions, our imports have risen appreciably. Our companies have made bigger profits. There is an infectious optimism amongst all our businessmen, amongst entrepreneurs, amongst investors as well as amongst the general public. And that optimism is shared not only by our own businessmen but also by businessmen from abroad who come to this country.</p>

<p>Against this general background we can understand therefore why the hon. member over there had such difficulty in launching his attack in this debate. But he has to follow in the footsteps of the hon. member for Constantia who said earlier on in this debate that it took us 15 years to bring about a reasonable rate of growth. It is strange that even that hon. member is obliged to make this admission because he is the person who said in 1953 that South Africa used to be a country flowing with milk and honey but that South Africa had now become a land of locusts on a castor oil diet. The economy of South Africa has grown in recent years until to-day we find ourselves in this powerful position. The hon. member for Constantia says that the Government need not worry about capital. That is what he said the other day, but for years he has been telling us that South Africa is losing capital, that capital is being withdrawn from this country. To-day, however, he says that South Africa certainly need not worry about capital. Just think how sound South Africa&#x2019;s position has become since those days. The hon. member for Constantia goes on to say that the decisive factor which has given rise to this development is the fact that industrialists and businessmen, after years of hesitation, have decided no longer to wait but to carry on with their programmes of development. That is correct; private businessmen have played an important role in this development, but the role which the hon. member over there ignores is the extremely important role which this Government has played with its policy in recent years in creating the confidence that there is in this country to-day. But apart from that, just think of the important role which has been played in this development by Government corporations like Iscor, Sasol, Escom and others. Think of the capital which has been ploughed into those corporations, and bear in mind the fact that this wheel which has been set in motion has not come to a halt yet. Private initiative has followed the lead given by the Government but the present upsurge is not attributable only, as suggested by the hon. member for Constantia, to an upsurge in the building industry or to the pay-as-you-earn system. Many other factors have contributed to the development which is taking place at the present time.</p>

<p>But in this matter hon. members on the other side, of course, are only following the lead which was given by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, because he himself visualized a very sombre future for South Africa. I want to remind hon. members that shortly after 1961 he stated that our policy would lead us to poverty; that there was no purchasing power in this country; that people were buying fewer goods than in previous years. This year there has been a rise of 8 per cent, and there was also a rise last year. He saw no future for South Africa. He said, &#x201C;the Government&#x2019;s apartheid obsession hits the living standards of all&#x201D;. He saw no prospects for this country. He even went so far as to say: &#x201C;The policies of this Government have undermined the confidence of the Western world and produced a stagnating economy in which living standards cannot rise. &#x201D; He could visualize no improvement in our standard of living. The hon. member for Jeppes had a good deal to say about this. Mr. Speaker, it is easy sometimes to juggle with figures. The hon. member for Jeppes referred to a 1962 survey of the economic situation in which our <i>per capita</i> growth was indicated. He referred to the period 1952-60. During that period our <i>per capita</i> growth was 1.4 per cent. Compare that with the growth of other countries. Our figure does not compare unfavourably at all with that of the United States or of Australia where there was the same rate of growth. It is even better than that of New Zealand and <span class="col_1139-1140" refersTo="page_0584"/>Canada. But the hon. member for Jeppes chose that period because that period suits him particularly well. Why does the hon. member for Jeppes not refer to the years which preceded 1952? In 1952 the National Party Government had been in power for four years. But the reason is clear. It suits him to refer to this period because the average was 1. 4 per cent. In the four years which he ignores the average was 2. 9 per cent. Their own average for the ten years from 1938 to 1948 was only 2. 6 per cent. That is why the hon. member for Jeppes remains silent about those four years when the figure was higher. The hon. member stops at 1960 because in 1961-2 it was 3. 2 per cent. He also remains silent about last year because in that year the figure was 3. 7 per cent. In dealing with our <i>per capita</i> growth therefore the hon. member takes the period from 1952 to 1960 because it suits him to do so, but he ignores the period from 1948 to 1952 when the figure was higher and he ignores the period after 1961 when the figure improved. After all, Mr. Speaker, we know that no country in the world has a constant rate of economic growth. The <i>per capita</i> increase is not always the same. We know that even in countries like Australia and Canada there has been a net decline in certain years. Our <i>per capita</i> growth is materially influenced by the position in other countries. The price of our raw materials dropped in 1948 and that had an effect on our <i>per capita</i> income. We know that after the war we had a period of full production and this had its effect on prices. But the hon. member does not take that into account: he says that we had a period of stagnation. When one analyses the situation one sees that the picture is not nearly as sombre as it has been painted here, particularly when one bears in mind that not one of the countries which he mentioned as countries with a high rate of growth&#x2014;Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom&#x2014;finds itself in the same position as the Republic. Those are countries where you have a stronger White group and a smaller low-income group. The position of no single country which he mentioned is comparable with ours. When one bears in mind the fact that our population growth averages 2. 3 per cent per annum and that the biggest growth in fact is in the lower-income group, I still say that our growth has been remarkable. I say therefore that there is no single country which is at all comparable with South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, in past years the United Party tried to sow the seeds of distrust. They have tried to break down the confidence of our businessmen; with their predictions about our economic situation they have tried to influence the voters, to frighten away foreign investors and to deter the South African entrepreneur. That is what they have tried to do. They hoped and expected that there would be an economic setback out of which they could make political capital. They tried to do this particularly after Sharpeville; they tried to do so particularly after our withdrawal from the Commonwealth of Nations. Sir, you will recall the stories which they spread at that time.</p>

<p>To-day they come along with a new technique. Now that they realize that things are going well they come along with a new technique. The hon. member for Jeppes referred to a &#x201C;little boom&#x201D;. The hon. member for Constantia wants to know how long this situation is going to last. Once again they are trying to sow the seeds of doubt about our position. There are many factors which may influence our position, but, Mr. Speaker, there is still no material factor, as far as any reasonable thinking person can see, which can influence that development. Hon. members opposite want to know how long this situation is going to last, or they tell us that it will be of short duration. That is the new technique that they are following, and they do this in spite of the confidence which is reflected in all quarters Just think of the statement made by SEIFSA: just think of the report of the Economic Research Bureau of Stellenbosch University from which it appears that 80 per cent of the industrialists who were interrogated were expecting increased turnovers. Just think of the new undertakings which have been announced in just the past month, undertakings ranging from soda ash to the motor industry. There is hardly a sphere which is not covered by this expansion. We find that there is confidence everywhere but the question which is now being asked is how long this will last.</p>

<p>The Opposition has now obtained a new recruit in the shape of the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller). I notice that during the past few weeks he has also started to make contributions on economic issues. Amongst other things, he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has reason to be cautious of prosperity. There is so much uncertainty about life in South Africa to-day that we should not be blamed if as a people we decided to live merrily while we can, to enjoy the present wave of prosperity while it lasts, and to let the future take care of itself.</block>

<p>If that is the hon. member&#x2019;s approach I can only say that that is not the approach of this side. We have greater confidence in the future. In another article he wrote. &#x201C;Our prosperity is not Nat.-dividend&#x201D;. He then tried to show that all this development was attributable to foreign factors. All we can say is this, Mr. Speaker: In all these years this Government has demonstrated its confidence in this country: it has demonstrated it by deeds. It has taken the lead and the initiative. It has taken administrative steps to improve conditions. It has given the right stimuli to that development by means of its economic policy as well as its fiscal policy. But apart from that it has seen to it that the infra-structure is right and that there is sufficient water, sufficient power, sufficient transport facilities, sufficient roads, sufficient schools and hospitals, etc., for that <span class="col_1141-1142" refersTo="page_0585"/>development. The Government has not been idle during this period. It has ensured that we have the necessary infra-structure, which is so essential to the development which we are experiencing at the present time. If the Government had not had that confidence in the future we would not have been in the fortunate position of having been able to cope with this enormous development. Hon. members opposite overlook the fact that the Government acted timeously. Take immigration, for example. The steps which are being taken today were initiated and put into operation a few years ago already, and to-day we are reaping the fruits. As far as our labour is concerned the Government is called upon to meet our labour requirements to a certain extent, but here too the Department of Labour took timeous steps, by way of our industrial legislation, to ensure that we would have sufficient mechanics and other artisans who could make their contribution to this development. Hon. members on the other side of the House often forget the effect which the things that they said had on the minds of private businessmen. They now tell us that those private businessmen have made a great contribution to the development which is taking place at the present time. That is correct, but it was the gloomy prophecies of the Opposition which caused those people to wait so long. If they had not predicted such a sombre future&#x2014;and I suppose most of those people are favourably disposed towards the United Party and in the nature of things they could therefore expect the United Party to give them a lead&#x2014;those people would not have waited so long. This Government can say to-day that this development has taken place in spite of the efforts made by that side to sow the seeds of distrust. We have had this development as a result of the steps taken by the Government and in spite of the actions of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) has referred to a so-called statement by Dr. Viljoen in which he stated that there were numbers of dying mines and that provision must be made for 130,000 people who were formerly employed in the mines. That statement may have appeared in the Press, but the hon. member says that that statement was not subsequently repudiated. We have tried to ascertain what the position is and it seems that a letter was written to the Star on 3 September 1963 in which it was pointed out that that report was incorrect. That correction was never published. Here I have the minutes of, I think, the Chamber of Commerce in which the statement made by Dr. Viljoen is set out. This is what Dr. Viljoen said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of the annual increase in total employment of 162,000, no fewer than 48,000 will have to be absorbed in secondary industries of which 29,000 will be Bantu. Such an increase in employment, however, is dependent upon sufficient skilled employees being available.</block>

<p>He then proceeds to analyse where they should be absorbed. I can only point out that he stated in his speech that 48,000 per annum must be absorbed in our industries. When we analyse our industrial figures, we find that the increase in our industrial section in 11 months, up to the end of November, was not 48,000 but 63,000. It therefore exceeded the normal growth. The hon. member concentrated his attention on the report that these dying mines would increase the number by 132,000 people per annum, and now that he has been corrected he says that the report was not denied. But one expects the hon. member for Springs to know better; one expects him to know how many workers will be affected by the closing of these dying mines. Surely he ought to know that the closing of these mines will not result in 132,000 people per annum being thrown onto the street as unemployeds. When the hon. member for Springs talks about the effect of the closing of the mines he reminds me of the town-crier which one finds in some cities on the Continent of Europe. He is the first man and the last man who always shouts about it, but I think the hon. member cannot mention one sector of the economy of Springs, which he represents, where there has been any retrogression at all. The population of the municipality is increasing, the building activities of the municipality are increasing, as the building plans prove, and there has been industrial expansion. I do not know why the hon. member comes here time and again and raises a hullabaloo, which is quite unjustified, because after all there are many members in this House who know what the position is and the hon. member ought to know it too. Here sits the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg). More mines have closed there than in other parts but I think if I referred to Krugersdorp as a ghost town or a dying town the hon. member would very quickly correct me and say that that is not correct and that there is continued expansion, and the same applies to practically every town on the Rand.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that there are negotiations going on, and those negotiations are going on with the Chamber of Mines. There are certain factors which make it desirable to keep certain mines with large ore reserves on their feet. But every mine, whether it be a gold mine or a copper mine or an asbestos mine, is faced with the inevitable fact that sooner or later it will have to close; there will be no more gold to mine and all the assistance in the world cannot save certain of those mines. Let us be practical with regard to this matter. They cannot be kept going, whatever assistance they may be given. But the assistance which is given must be given judiciously and must be designed to keep the mines going in the expectation <span class="col_1143-1144" refersTo="page_0586"/>of a higher gold price. Negotiations in that regard are constantly taking place. The hon. the Minister of Finance stated last year that the money was available and that a formula must be worked out in this connection. The hon. member need not be perturbed therefore. As a result of that negotiation, certain submissions have been made which still have to be considered and an announcement will probably be made by the Minister of Finance at the appropriate time, but to come along at this stage and to say that there are mines which are closing and that there is a great deal of unemployment as a result of the closing of mines is to paint the wrong picture.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Let me just give the hon. member the figures. He says that the development of border industries is going to harm industrial development on the Witwatersrand. Mr. Speaker, here again the hon. member is trying to raise a false alarm, but he does not know what the facts are. Let me give him the facts. We admit that 1963 was a year of industrial expansion and the hon. member will also admit it, but an analysis has been made of all the industries which required import permits during 1963, and that includes all new industries which are based on imported goods as well as the expansion of existing industries; it therefore includes the majority of our industries, and it appears from an analysis of that industrial expansion that 55 per cent of those applications came from industries established in Southern Transvaal. In other words, more than 50 per cent, i. e. 55 per cent of our industrial expansion, took place in the Southern Transvaal. But when we go on to analyse this 55 per cent we find that 82 per cent of the 55 per cent are situated in the central Rand area. That is the position, that is the concentration which one finds in the central Witwatersrand area. The hon. member need not therefore be so terribly perturbed.</p>

<p>A good deal of reference has been made here to the problem of inflation, and I want to say that in my opinion the Government has shown in past years that it is well aware of the necessity to check inflation, and in that regard our Government, in comparison with the Government of any other comparable country, has had a very great measure of success. It appears from the 1962 returns of the First City National Bank that as far as South Africa is concerned the annual depreciation of our currency was 2. 9 per cent, that of Japan 3 per cent, that of Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom 3. 3 per cent, New Zealand 3. 4 per cent, Australia 4 per cent, France 4. 2 per cent. It is clear from this list that the depreciation of the South African currency was particularly low during that period in comparison with these other countries. But let us see what happened in the preceding year. In the <i>Statist</i> we find a comparison between different countries and it appears from this comparison that as far as South Africa is concerned the depreciation in 1961-2 was only 1 per cent&#x2014;particularly low therefore&#x2014;and that in Austria, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom it was 3. 7 per cent. So we can go on and quote New Zealand, France and Japan. In practically all these countries their currency depreciated to a much greater extent than that of South Africa. I can also refer hon. members to the survey in the <i>Financial Times</i>, in which a comparison was also made with regard to the cost of supper, bed and breakfast, cigarettes, petrol, food, clothing, rental and entertainment, and it appears that in Johannesburg which was compared with 20 other cities, the cost of these items was by far the lowest, except for Zurich, Lisbon and Delhi. It is not correct therefore to say that there has been a great measure of inflation here. But when we look at the latest figures of the Department of Statistics we find the same position. There is no great increase in our cost of living, and that is borne out by the fact that as far as food is concerned, for example, there was a drop in the index from November 1962 to November 1963. As far as our industrial products are concerned there was a very small increase of about 1 per cent. In the case of imported goods there was a bigger increase. This only goes to show that even in the case of our own industrial products the cost index has not risen as much as in the case of imported products. But apart from that we must bear in mind that we have fuller employment and that we have a much bigger production than we had in former years. Our own industries have expanded by 12. 9 per cent! This expansion has not been fortuitous. When we compare our own position with that of other countries, we find that in Italy the industrial expansion was 11 per cent, in France 6 per cent, in Japan 5 per cent, in the United Kingdom 2 per cent, in Germany 5 per cent. Our own industrial achievement in the past year therefore by far exceeds that of these comparable countries. It is interesting to see in which sectors there has been the greatest growth. Take the printing and paper industry. It has been our policy in recent years to encourage our own paper industry and to try to substitute our own product for the imported product. We have succeeded in doing so, hence this increased production. We feel that this is necessary because we have a large forestry production which can now be utilized to the best advantage in our own country. The other big increase took place in basic metal industries, in metal products, where there was an increase of 21 per cent. This increase too has not come about fortuitously; it is the direct result of Government policy, particularly in the case of our motor-car industry, to ensure a bigger South African content, to provide our own machinery, <span class="col_1145-1146" refersTo="page_0587"/>and to push up our steel production. It is not simply fortuitous therefore that this development has taken place in the private sector. The necessary encouragement has been given. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Deputy Minister has dealt briefly with the question of the dying mines. One of my colleagues will follow him on that matter. I want to speak to the House this afternoon on another matter concerning mining activity. In 1962, we passed a Bill in this House dealing with pneumoconiosis, and I can say from the time that this Act came into force there has been much dissatisfaction amongst the mineworkers particularly, and also in the mining industry. I feel, Sir, that something has gone wrong seriously with the working of this Act. I am very perturbed at what the Minister told us here at the time of the introduction of the Bill. He told us that this was an agreed measure, he emphasized again last year that it was an agreed measure, and yet on reading through the address of Mr. P. H. Anderson, who was president of the Transvaal Chamber of Mines, we read with concern what he has said. That was last year, in 1963, and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the concern which the Gold Producers Committee felt at the time of the passing of the new Act, it decided to send a mission overseas with the mandate to ascertain the basis upon which miners who contract pneumoconiosis in the course of their employment are certified in the various European countries in which mining and similar occupations are carried on, and the basis upon which compensation is awarded to such persons.</block>

<p>The hon. Minister at the time told us in no uncertain terms that all the investigations that were necessary had already been done, but when this mission returned, this private mission of the Gold Producers Association, it reported &#x201C;that it was satisfied that the basis of assessment now laid down in our Act was medically unsound&#x201D;. That is even before the Act came into existence. We passed it here and before it was promulgated the Chamber of Mines had already said that this Act cannot be of any use to the mineworkers. Not only that, but the present Act which was shown overseas did not have the support of the leading authorities in Europe. Sir, if that was an agreed measure, why was it necessary for the Chamber of Mines immediately to send a mission overseas?</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The Chamber of Mines did know quite well that this was an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and it makes us suspect even more that there was no concurrence between the Chamber of Mines, the mine-workers and the Government. Sir, the Act came into operation on 1 October 1962, and statistics have emerged from its working which confirm the industry&#x2019;s fears. Not only is the industry perturbed, but the mineworkers are perturbed. A month or so ago, I had a deputation of mineworkers who came to see me. I took their names and particulars. It was a small group and I sent a letter to the Minister of Mines and I asked him to investigate the complaints of these mineworkers. They did not complain about conditions in the mines, they did not complain about their salaries. What they did complain about was the certifications that were altered. I want to make myself clear: The people who came to me had previously been certified in the second stage of pneumoconiosis. With new examinations they were classified as being in the group from 20 to 50 per cent. That put them back in the first stage. These people are thoroughly confused. But there might be some excuse for doing that. However, I cannot excuse the gross mistakes that have been taking place in the bureau. I am not talking without my book. I have the names, the P. F. numbers and details of some of these people here.</p>

<p>If there is one it is enough. I am not concerned about numbers. I am concerned about the efficiency of the system which determines whether or not a man is fit to do his work, and if it is only one it is sufficient. Numbers do not influence my attitude towards the certification that takes place. But we go further and see in this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of the assurance received by the Chamber during the negotiations which took place with the Department of Mines on the drafting of the Bill, directives have been issued regarding the standards to be applied in certifications, the effect of which is to circumscribe the direction of the certifying medical practitioners and to alter radically the principles on which benefits for pneumoconiosis were to be granted.</block>

<p>That is rather disturbing, when we have an Act under which people must work, and then to find that directives have been sent out by the Minister which circumscribe the work of the medical profession who deal with this particular type of examination. And we have also found that since then, there has been a startling increase in the rate of certification. What does that mean? Surely it means that the numbers who have come up for examination have been fairly constant, that the numbers who have now been found to be suffering from these first, second or third stages of pneumoconiosis have gone up. Why have they suddenly gone up? Have the conditions in the mines deteriorated to make more people contract pneumoconiosis, or is the position that previously too many have been passed through who did not receive certification?</p>

<p>This is a very serious state of affairs.

This man was examined in 1957 and warned: First stage. In 1957 he was boarded out and put on the surface. In 1962, he was re-examined and put back in the first stage. A month later he was re-examined again, by request of his panel doctor, and he is now lying in the Sprinkell Sanatorium with tuberculosis. That is the sort of thing we find that has been going on. I have got the details here, but I am not going to bore the House with these details, but I would be pleased if I could meet the hon.

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know, but until we see that amendment I must state my claim here for a revision and I must continue asking for a revision. It is only because of what we have been asking for in the past that there were certain changes made in the Act, but it is not being implemented properly, because directives have been going out from the Minister. The Minister has got no right to tell the doctors how they must examine. The Minister has got a schedule laid down and he must carry out that schedule and not determine who shall be in the first stage, the second stage or the third stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with a group of 40,000 to 50,000 people. I do not say that 40,000 to 50,000 people in this group are all dissatisfied. But let us make these people in this group satisfied that they are going to receive a fair deal when they go up for examination; let them feel that the best is being done for them. That is what they are asking for. They are not asking for anything else. I will be told that these are exceptions and difficulties that have arisen, and that the Examining Board is not infallible, that people can make a mistake in diagnosis. I know that, but I have been saying this here for six years that mistakes are being made, over and over again. This is a very disconcerting feeling for the mineworker when he goes up for examination and he thinks that he is not going to get a fair deal. I have had it said to me over and over again by these people that it is no good going over there: &#x201C;I always get the same reply that nothing is wrong with me. &#x201D; Is it possible that there are people who have been working on the mines for 30 years and who still show no signs of fibrosis of the lungs? Is it possible that they are not yet in the first stage of pneumoconiosis after working underground for 30 years? How can these people have confidence in the Examining Board if year after year they go up and year after year they are rejected? The panel doctors will tell you that these people are suffering from ill health that some of them are almost incapable of going to work regularly, that the absenteeism is increasing among these people. Yet when they go up for examination they are rejected and are being told sometimes that they are good for another 30 years. Some of them do not live another 30 months after that. I cannot let this opportunity go by without expressing my fears that there is something seriously wrong with the whole certification system as it stands now. We cannot possibly allow it to go on as it is now, and I ask the hon. Deputy Minister to investigate this matter forthwith, to see if there are any grounds for these people&#x2019;s fears, to see if there is any fault with either the doctors, or the machinery, or the interpretation of the findings. But please let us find out what the reason is for these mistakes and let us remove the faults. We are dealing with a group of people who are the keystone of our economy. Let us keep them happy. They do not want to be pampered. All they ask for is a fair deal, and we on this side of the House want to help them to get it.</p>

<p>We know that certain irregularities may take place in the application of the Act and that certain defects may manifest themselves, but I now want to know from the hon. member, as I asked him at the beginning of my speech, whether he spoke on behalf of the mineworkers or the mine owners. I want to ask him how many complaints have appeared in the public Press over the past six months in connection with the working of the Act. We who represent mineworkers constituencies live in the closest contact with the organized mineworkers and we know what is happening within their ranks. We know they are negotiating with the Chamber of Mines and various institutions in order to have the Act improved. I recently read the following in the latest issue of the <i>Mynwerker</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have made good progress with a draft amendment which has been drawn up by the workers committee and I can only report that this matter will definitely reach finality during this year. It is a new approach in respect of the pneumoconiosis legislation.</block>

<p>They say that if it does not become law in 1964 it will in 1965. They say the executive council is not prepared to approach the Government with legislation with which they are not satisfied and that because of that it is desirable firstly to come to an agreement with the Chamber of Mines before the Minister is asked to introduce legislation. Briefly it amounts to this that the Mineworkers Union is having a new Act drafted which will in due course be submitted to the Minister. I think it is a pity that the hon. member for Rosettenville should try this afternoon to make political capital from the dissatisfaction that exists in the ranks of the mineworkers and that he does not wait to see what amendments they themselves will suggest. I have the utmost confidence that this Government will, as in the past, look after the interests of the mineworkers and that it will lend a sympathetic ear to the representations of the Mine-workers Union to revise the Act. We just want to tell them that they will gain nothing by trying to make political capital out of this dissatisfaction. Nor is it correct to say that the Chamber of Mines did not agree to the Pneumoconiosis Act of 1962. The hon. member has quoted what Mr. Anderson said, but here I have the speech made by Mr. Koch to the Free State and Transvaal Chambers of Mines, in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The new basis for compensation seems to be inadequate, but as a result of special representations the Minister of Mines has agreed to his Department, in consultation with the Chamber of Mines, investigating the position, should these provisions, after they have been tested out for a reasonable period, prove to work unsatisfactorily.</block>

<p>Surely it is an agreed measure as far as the Chamber of Mines is concerned and we always have the word of the Minister that after the Act has been tested out for a reasonable period, he will effect the necessary amendments. I can give the assurance this afternoon&#x2014;this is how I feel&#x2014;that those amendments will be made as soon as the Mineworkers Union are sure what they want in the Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Welkom (Mr. H. J. van Wyk) does not merit much reply, but I would ask him to consider whether he thinks that we on this side of the House must act and live on the basis of trusting the Minister if we find that people come to us with complaints, and that we must keep quiet about such complaints because if we say something about them we are making political capital. According to him, therefore, we are precluded from bringing to the notice of this House certain things which are not working out as anticipated.</p>

<p>From there I want to come to some of the remarks made by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs. He tore into the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) in regard to his remarks about the marginal mines and replacing them by industry on the Reef, and he said <i>inter alia</i>, that the hon. member for Springs was deliberately giving a wrong impression of the future of Springs and of the Rand. If my colleague is wrong, the Minister himself was wrong because in 1961 <span class="col_1151-1152" refersTo="page_0590"/>this is what he said, in December of that year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The answer to the threatened closing of the gold mines on the East Rand and its effect on the neighbouring towns was for industrialists to establish their industries in the dying areas. He said that the Government&#x2019;s policy on the dying mines would become clearer in the next few months.</block>

<p>This was in December 1961. We had been raising the matter for years before that and it seems that we will have many more years to wait. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the outset it can be said that if industrialists do not voluntarily settle in the stricken areas, the Government may be forced to compel some of them to do so. The urgency of the situation could be seen, for example, in Springs, where 30 per cent of the White population work in industry and 42 per cent on the mines. This meant that if the mines closed, the existing industries would have to double and then still increase further. In Britain industrialists must get permits if they want to establish themselves in certain areas. The South African Government, however, will continue allowing industrialists to establish themselves in areas of their own choice. But if they did not do so in areas where industries were needed most, the time would come when the Government might be forced to compel them to do so. Large-scale industrialization would have to be considered on a regional basis in terms of the whole East Rand rather than of individual towns. The development of the border industries, he believed, could be beneficial to the East Rand rather than harmful, as some people feared. &#x201C;And let me give you the assurance,&#x201D; said Mr. Haak, &#x201C;that I and my Department have the problem of the dying mines very much at heart. With your co-operation, I am sure we can solve it. &#x201D;</block>

<p>So much for his stricture on my hon. colleague, who was not talking about this month or next month, but about the future of Springs and about the Rand.</p>

<p>Equally scathing was the hon. the Minister of Finance when he dealt with the speech of the hon. member for Springs, particularly in regard to his appeal for assistance for the marginal mines. The Minister stated that his Cabinet always had the interest of the Rand in mind and the destiny of the marginal mines. Now, let us see what has really happened over the last few years, and let us remember the constant reminders given to us, when we spoke common sense and economics, that where the life of a people is at stake economic laws must be broken down if necessary. And let us remember the constant reminders to the hon. member for Jeppes that when he is giving sound economic advice he is forgetting the imponderables. So we are always rather at a disadvantage on this side when we talk sense, because some psychic factors are brought up which cannot be explained in words but which really affect the position according to the hon. Ministers.</p>

<p>Let us look at what this Government has done in regard to this problem, which under present conditions more and more hits at the heart of our economy. In 1956 we were told by the then Minister that the question of these marginal mines was under close scrutiny, and that he had arranged a conference to investigate and report. We had been arguing about this for years before 1956. In 1958 the report was published and we were told by a new Minister that he had seen the report and that he intended approaching the Cabinet for support in connection with the proposal that certain railway charges be met out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in order to assist the marginal mines. In 1959 the same Minister under pressure stated that he was still going into it, and that was all we could get out of him. The year 1960 passed, and in 1961 he told us that he could not recommend help through railway rates and from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Believe it or not, he said that a difference in railway rates could not be made to benefit only one section of the community, a very wise statement indeed, in view of the fact that everyone on this side knows what the mining industry means to the country. We have been pressing this matter for years and all we have got out of the Government was the statement in 1958 that the Minister was approaching the Cabinet for assistance to the marginal mines, probably through a reduction in railway rates, and then we were told in 1961 that the Minister of Transport has refused this concession. Now what control the Minister of Transport has over the Consolidated Revenue Fund is something which is probably understood only by the Government and its Cabinet. Then in 1962 we got a new Minister, and at least his verbal approach to the problem gave us a ray of hope. Then in 1963 the Minister of Finance advised us that he had appointed a Cabinet Committee to investigate the matter, and later in the session the Minister of Economic Affairs told us that the Government had decided to give R1,000,000 to meet the cost of pumping out water under certain conditions. We stated at the time that this assistance was not nearly enough, and now I want to tell the House of some things that have happened since.</p>

<p>In Benoni, my own constituency, the New Kleinfontein Gold Mine gave notice of closing, and a deputation from the Benoni Municipality interviewed the Deputy Minister in December and he told them, <i>inter alia</i>, that the International Monetary Fund rules precluded the Government from subsidizing the gold mines. He told them it was not a good proposition to pay &#x00A3;1 2s. 6d. for &#x00A3;1&#x2019;s worth of gold, but that the Government was still investigating and hoping to find ways of helping. In the Press he is reported as saying this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1153-1154" refersTo="page_0591"/>Whilst the Government was sympathetically inclined towards requests for assistance to dying mines, it was a matter of economics. It had to be borne in mind that the Government could not single out a particular mine for special treatment, but had to follow a consistent policy generally. A number of mines were in a similar position, having large reserves of low-grade ore. Other towns could come along with similar requests and they could all use the argument that a subsidy should be provided.</block>

<p>If anyone has heard a more fatuous argument on such an important matter, I should like to know about it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, the Government was concerned with the overall position in as much as the production of gold was for the benefit of the Republic. At the present time the Government was going into the whole question and the council would be kept informed.</block>

<p>Sir, this problem of helping the marginal mines is of paramount importance. On a parliamentary tour of the gold-mining industry towards the end of last year, we were taken to Crown Mines and we were told that with costs as they were then there was gold worth R77,000,000 in the mine which could not and would not be mined. The estimate at New Kleinfontein was R20,000,000. The Minister himself advised us in this House last year that each 25c rise in costs would cost the country, R287,500,000 worth of gold, which could not be economically mined, and yet we can get no further at all with this question of assisting in the production of this gold. The Deputy Minister said that the International Monetary Fund rules precluded a subsidy, but Rhodesia is assisting its marginal mines. I am reading from the Financial Mail of 6 December&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Full details of the scheme have not been released, but its aim is to stimulate interest in new and lapsed gold-mining propositions, as well as to bring existing producers who are making losses, but who can satisfy the Government that they can operate efficiently, up to break-even level. Producers in this category will have to apply for the subsidy to the Government Mining Affairs Board. If they pass the board&#x2019;s efficiency tests, they will qualify for a subsidy to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure, up to a ceiling figure of &#x00A3;3 per fine ounce.</block>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The tax relief measures and the proposed subsidy scheme have the merit both of satisfying the requirements of the International Monetary Fund in these matters. &#x2026;</block>

<p>So much for the fact that assistance cannot be worked out on a basis which will satisfy the I. M. F. I say quite definitely that this problem is being played with, and at the same time the interests of the whole Reef are being played with.</p>

<p>I read just now the speech made by the Deputy Minister at Springs, to the effect that if the mines closed existing industries would have to double and then still increase. Now let me tell you what happened to one particular industry in the Roodepoort area. A big factory there found it difficult to get labour, and it was encouraged to open another factory at Rosslyn, near Pretoria, where they would finish up with five or six Whites and probably 200 or more Bantu, and would receive very great assistance in other ways, such as lower wages, etc. I do not want the Minister to tell me that Rosslyn is a border area. Rosslyn is on the border of Pretoria; it is in the peri-urban area of Pretoria, and within a very few miles of a portion of the country densely populated by Whites. For practical purposes it is no further from Pretoria itself than some of the African towns to the south-west of Johannesburg. This factory was encouraged to open another factory at Rosslyn, where, I repeat, the proportion of Blacks to Whites would be many times greater than was permitted in Roodepoort. The factory in Roodepoort, in terms of influx control regulations, was precluded from getting labour from anywhere outside its own area. Just over the boundary there was plenty of labour available in the south-western Native townships of Johannesburg, but they were not allowed to get labour from there. They were encouraged to go to Rosslyn, where obviously they could produce more cheaply using only African labour, to all intents and purposes. To show the nonsensical attitude in regard to their not being allowed to get labour from other areas adjoining Roodepoort, I asked a question this Session&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What are the boundaries of the area from which industries established or to be established within the Rosslyn border area will be allowed to draw Bantu labourers, and (b) how many Bantu reside in this area?</block>

<p>Please remember, Sir, that on the Reef they are not allowed to draw labour from the adjoining areas, no matter how much labour is available. The reply was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No area has been specifically defined from which industries established or to be established within the Rosslyn border area will be allowed to draw Bantu labourers. The population of the Bantu area immediately adjacent to Rosslyn is at present approximately 21,000, with a vast hinterland where many thousand Bantu reside.</block>

<p>Pretoria can draw from a vast hinterland, but Roodepoort cannot draw the available labour just across the street. I wonder what the hon. member for Roodepoort has to say about this. One Deputy Minister says that on the Reef <span class="col_1155-1156" refersTo="page_0592"/>we will need more than double the industries to replace the marginal mines, but then we get this claptrap from some other Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to show you how far this is going on the Reef and at Roodepoort. The Consolidated Main Reef Mine has given notice of closing. It is within a stone&#x2019;s throw of this industry which is being forced out of Roodepoort, and my information is that the C. M. R. will cease mining operations completely in March. So there we have it. In regard to assistance to the marginal mines, we are fed with words every year, and finally a little drop is given to keep us quiet in regard to this matter which affects our economy so terrifically; we are given R1,000,000 to pump water. We are very grateful for that, but I do not think it amounts to much. As far as Roodepoort and every other Reef constituency is concerned, we find exactly the same position. An industry established there is refused permission to expand and is forced to move to Rosslyn where there is a vast hinterland of labour, whilst in fact in Roodepoort they can get all the labour they want from just across the street. So all that is happening on the Reef is that the Government are killing off the mines and the industries. So much for their words. Let us have actions.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I should like the Minister to consider. It is perhaps not within his power to do anything about it, but he must realize that when he is at the helm of finances he has to consider every factor. Along the Reef every business organization and industry says: Please make the Reef one influx control area, and do not cut us up into little, more or less, municipal areas, where, if we happen to be short of labour and the municipality next door has labour, we cannot use it. This is a very sensible suggestion, but I am sure that just because it is sensible it will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Then the Deputy Minister advised me in reply to a question that the Government this Session was still considering ways of helping the marginal mines. I wonder whether the Minister of Finance can tell me when we can expect that information? I realize that he will not give us his Budget secrets, but cannot he give us some idea? We have been waiting for eight years; can he not tell us whether it will be another eight years, or whether it will be a question of months? I am afraid that every mine will close down before any real assistance is given.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to ask the Deputy Minister whether he still stands by what he said in Springs in 1961, and if so, how does he reconcile this statement with the inducement given to the factory in Roodepoort to move to Rosslyn just at the time when the mine which is the backbone of the economy of Roodepoort is closing down. Perhaps the hon. member for Roodepoort himself might tell us.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) will forgive me if I do not go further into the question of the border mines in his constituency. I admit that that is a national problem, but the hon. member has not convinced me on two points. The first is that the Government is now supposed to be responsible for those declining mines, and the second is that the Government is not doing anything to meet that difficulty. That is why I want to follow another direction. I want to talk about the declining United Party.</p>

<p>Having listened to this debate over the past few days, Sir, and having summarized the achievements of the United Party you realize how true the words are which Professor Edgar Brookes uttered when he referred to the United Party as follows, and he said this as far back as 1958. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) will find this reported in African Affairs, and the hon. member will admit that Professor Brookes is not really a friend of the National Party. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party in its present form has no hope of ever again winning a South African election. No political prophecy can ever be absolute, but it is almost impossible to imagine circumstances in which the United Party could come into power again. &#x2026; Their old gambits cannot win the game. Very courageous leadership might make the United Party a better Opposition, but nothing in the world seems able to make it a Government.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital will agree that Professor Brookes has hit the nail on the head. I do not think it will be long before the final chapter on the party opposite is written. I just want to give you a summary, Sir, of the way hon. members have acted in this debate. Just think how they have hedged away from the cardinal problems of the country and think how they have dwelled on the smaller issues. Take the debate we have had to-day. The hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) advanced his financial arguments. He states that there was a 120 per cent increase in our national income from 1938 to 1948 and then he complains that it was only 120 per cent from 1948 to 1958 as well. He realizes that under our r&#x00E9;gime the growth has indeed been greater because if you compare the total figure of the national income of 1938 with that of 1958 you will find a big difference. But he reduces it to a percentage basis in order to water down the figures somewhat.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite&#x2014;and I want to be quite fair towards them&#x2014;no longer have the bite in them which they used to have; they are only barking to-day. Even the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) no longer has any teeth. They either bark or growl, but they no longer have the political teeth you would have expected them to have. Over the years their teeth have been extracted. I am now referring to the older guard such as the hon. member for Constantia, but when you look at the younger ones you would think they have never had any teeth.</p>

<p><span class="col_1157-1158" refersTo="page_0593"/>I ask myself this question: How is it that during the short period since 1948, the United Party has deteriorated so consistently. I have philosified over the question and come to the conclusion that various factors have encouraged that deterioration. The first, of course, is their policy, but I do not want to go into that at the moment. I refuse, however, to accept that it is only the policy of the United Party that has sent them downhill at such a pace. It is hard to imagine how a party which had a policy and which still had such a large majority in 1943 could have deteriorated to such an extent. Another reason for their rapid deterioration is this: I think the United Party has finished playing its historical role in South African politics. There is no more room for them. They have simply finished their political role; they had to fill the gap between, what I shall call the colonial period in the South African history and the period when we became a Republic, a Republic of which I believe the hon. member for Pinelands is as proud as I am. Now that we have the Republic there is no role left for them to play. That is why I say that if anything has passed judgment on the United Party it is this period and all that remains for us to do is to bury the United Party. I also found another reason why the United Party is going downhill at such a pace and that is because they have lost all confidence in themselves. They do not know where they are in politics. That is why they have developed this disease of always allowing a section of the English-language Press in South Africa to dictate to them. I do not want to treat the entire English-language Press in South Africa on the same basis but certain elements in the English-language Press in South Africa have taken the United Party in tow. It was actually amusing, before we had the no-confidence debate this year, to see how the English Press in South Africa actually first put the United Party through their paces, they made them turn to the right and to the left, made them march, and then fed them on the arguments which they had to advance in this House; they practically took the United Party by the scruff of the neck and shook it so that it would afford us a little opposition. I understand, of course, that the United Party must to a large extent take the English Press in South Africa in consideration. They are no longer concerned whether they comply with the wishes of the voters; they are only concerned about one thing and that is for how long the English Press in South Africa will continue to support them and for that reason, of course, they have to dance to the tune of the English Press in South Africa. What will become of them without the support of that Press? There is not a single newspaper worth mentioning that supports them. If the English Press in South Africa were to lend their support to the Progressives or to the Liberal Party, the United Party would tumble from the top to the bottom like a bag of potatoes.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite suffer from another ailment and that is to oppose everything that comes from this side of the House. They tried to learn their lesson, of course, in the days when the National Party was still in Opposition, but they must not confuse the two parties. When the National Party was in Opposition they had, from the nature of things, to oppose everything suggested by the United Party Government because that side did very little that was right, that was South Africa. To-day they think: Well, the National Party was a good Opposition by opposing everything and we are going to follow their example exactly; if that side of the House introduces legislation, no matter what it is about, we shall simply oppose it. Because they act like that they say &#x201C;no&#x201D; when the Government says &#x201C;yes&#x201D; and when the Government says &#x201C;no&#x201D; they say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. The Opposition do not always know why they are saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; with the result that their sins are beginning to catch up with them as has happened in the case of the General Law Amendment Act which they supported last year. When they get outside, away from the parliamentary atmosphere, they become afraid of the voters and of the English Press and then they start looking for excuses. They then return to this House and say: No, this or that section of the Act is really not good. Hon. members on that side of the House should study their role as Opposition in South Africa better and then we shall have a better atmosphere in this Parliament.</p>

<p>But the United Party suffer from yet another ailment and that is that they are actually harbouring two groups. The one group is the moderate group which consists of members like, let us say, the hon. members for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) and Pinelands (Mr. Thompson), etc., but then they also harbour the liberal group, a liberal group which uses the United Party to get into this House and who then become unmanageable and take advantage of the United Party. They use the United Party as the Trojan Horse just to come into this House and the moment they are here they forget about the principles of the United Party and then they really run amuck &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026;after the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). The hon. member for Houghton sneaked into this House in the Trojan Horse. The former member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) did the same. All those chickens were hatched on the other side of the House. Those liberals are to-day sitting in Parliament. Do not think for a moment, Sir, that they are only making things difficult for the National Party Government; they are also making things even more difficult for hon. members opposite. I think the biggest hiding hon. members opposite have ever had, they have had from members who formerly belonged to the United Party.</p>

<p><span class="col_1159-1160" refersTo="page_0594"/>I briefly want to refer to the Colour policy of the United Party in respect of which there is still a great deal of misunderstanding. You can take 15 hon. members opposite, Sir, and no two of them will tell you the same explanation of the United Party&#x2019;s Colour policy because nobody knows precisely what it is. As somebody once said there was really only one person who knows the United Party&#x2019;s policy and that was the hon. the Prime Minister. There is not a single member opposite who can tell me exactly whether according to United Party policy, non-Whites will come to this Parliament or whether non-Whites will not come to this Parliament, or whether, as the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) has said; even the Prime Minister of South Africa could be a non-White. I had thought that the United Party would avail themselves of this debate, particularly the debate on the motion of no-confidence, to give us a clear exposition of their Colour policy and to say to the voters: &#x201C;Listen, you must not say to us that we proclaim one policy on the platteland and another one in the cities; we have now set out our policy in Parliament; it appears in black and white. That was what I expected, but what did I find? I found that they carefully hid their policy under the bushel. They wrapped their policy in the proverbal head-cloth and buried it deeply.[Interjections.] Does the hon. member for Pinelands who is sitting over there making remarks know what the policy of the United Party is? Of course he does not. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) does not know what the policy of the United Party is. If the hon. member for Hospital knows what the Colour policy of the United Party is let him get up when I sit down and tell us what it is. I shall welcome it. I want to tell you this, Sir: There are always two roads in the policy of the United Party; the one road is their policy as advocated and the other is the implication of that policy and those two roads can never meet as far as hon. members opposite are concerned. When you talk about &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; they deny that that is United Party policy, but every act of theirs, their entire policy, shows that they are veering in the direction of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. They are on that road.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>If it is a sensible question I shall reply to it but that hon. member never asks a sensible question. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said the following in this House in 1959 (col. 6038)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be remembered also that as the standard of civilization of a community is raised, leadership will depend to an increasing degree upon numbers.</block>

<p>He is quite correct. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Restrictive laws alone can never be a final solution.</block>

<p>Does that not also apply to restrictive laws under a race federation policy? If they were to establish a federation in this House, for instance, a federation under which the Whites will have a certain number of representatives and the non-Whites a certain limited number, the non-Whites will simply reject it. That restriction in their Federation legislation will not work; it will not be worth the paper it is written on. Then hon. members opposite are still continually talking about racial friction. They want us to remove everything that can cause racial friction. They however want a Parliament in South Africa in which they will fight till the end of time about one subject only namely the fact that the Whites in this country who are far in the minority have considerable representation in this House. Hon. members of the Opposition ought to know that if we were to have a Black government in this country which was based on this principle and where the same atmosphere prevailed which you find in other African states, there would be no such thing as representation of the minority in this Parliament; it would simply be government by the masses. I want to quote some very striking words uttered by an American Negro who investigated the position in Africa. His name is Louis E. Lomax. He writes as follows in The Reluctant African&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What bothered me most was the fact that Africans are totally unwilling to accept Whites as co-equals and partners in a free government.</block>

<p>Hon. members opposite try to make the voters believe that they are not moving in the direction of a one-man-one-vote government, but all their deeds, their whole attitude and the implication of their policy, show that they are fast heading that way. They are trying to discredit our policy of separate development. Under the National Government we at least <span class="col_1161-1162" refersTo="page_0595"/>have in South Africa a system of separate development with which a large number of Bantu have already expressed their satisfaction and with which the White voters in South Africa have expressed their satisfaction. Now the United Party wants another system, namely, the system of a race federation. I would have given him half a mark if he could have proved that apart from the Whites the Bantu of South Africa would accept that system of his. But he cannot do so. No, not even the Blacks in South Africa accept that federation plan.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks how I know it. I want to quote to him what a prominent non-White has said, a non-White who supports the United Party and who is a moderate person, namely Albert Luthuli. I am not talking about people like Mandela and that group. Let me quote what the so-called moderate Albert Luthuli said. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the face of it there seems little difference between the Nationalist policy and that of the United Party. Racial domination, whether it is called &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; or &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D; is fundamentally unacceptable. It might be said that the Nationalist murder you most ruthlessly while the United Party tries to poison you slowly.</block>

<p>They say that the United Party federation plan simply amounts to this that they will be poisoned slowly and is consequently unacceptable. Not a single Bantu in South Africa accepts the race federation plan as the final solution to the South African problem. That is why I say that I would still have given the United Party half a mark had they been able to prove it to me, but we have the facts of the matter before us, Sir. Neither the Whites nor the Bantu accept those hon. members&#x2019; solution to the racial problem of South Africa. What right has the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to say that his race federation plan will bring about a Utopia in South Africa? Of course the extremist Bantu would rather accept the policy of the United Party than that of the National Party but I say again that they will not only regard it as the Trojan Horse to get into this House but once they are here they will say &#x201C;Away also with the United Party&#x2019;s policy in South Africa&#x201D;. That is why I ask hon. members opposite to start being realistic in South African politics. They should become more serious because we are living in serious times. They should realize that what they say in this House is an indication to the world outside and to the extremist Bantu how we fight in the political field in South Africa. They must be serious and I say the people of South Africa demand it from them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend to reply to the speech made by the hon. member who has just sat down. I would like to say that if I were a reporter reporting the proceedings of this House I would simply say, &#x201C;A certain Mr. van der Merwe also spoke.&#x201D; Sir, I am limited to 10 minutes and I do not wish to deal with any of the details of the harangue of the hon. member who has just sat down save to say that it is a twist in our political set-up that a member who represents South West Africa which does not contribute one single farthing to our finances, should get up in this House and waste our time talking when he is not a bit interested in the Part Appropriation Bill which is before us.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has painted a rather gloomy picture of the future of South Africa. Hon. members opposite themselves are to blame for that gloomy picture because the hon. the Minister through an Act of Parliament has created an economic and financial closed circuit in South Africa. It is a closed circuit which is creating a little whirlwind in South Africa, a whirlwind which is gradually becoming a tornado and which will blow us to pieces. That is why the hon. the Minister is issuing a warning to the people of South Africa to be careful. Sir, that is most unfortunate in regard to at least two aspects. The one is in regard to municipalities because if the hon. the Minister is going to carry out his intentions in regard to capital expenditure by the municipalities, then the first people who are going to suffer will be the Coloured people whom we represent in this House. The hon. the Minister must realize that a municipality like the Cape Town Municipality engages thousands of Coloured people, the vast majority of whom are engaged on capital works, and it is important for their economy that those Coloured people should be constantly in employment. Any interference with the capital expenditure programme of large municipalities in the Cape will affect the Coloured people very materially, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will not revert to what happened some years ago when in fact the Government scrutinized the capital expenditure of all municipalities and erased what they said should not be done; they said, &#x201C;We will agree to this but we will not agree to that. &#x201D; There we have blatant interference with the autonomy of the municipalities, with their freedom to carry out programmes which they felt were urgent. Yesterday we had a warning from the Minister that that situation might again arise. Well, I sincerely hope that the Minister will not do so, because if he does he will create an economic situation amongst the Coloured people here which will be difficult to overcome. It is already difficult for Coloured people to remain in constant employment. We already find that due to the Transkei policy of the Government, where the Coloured people are to be removed that the Government brought in nearly 800 Coloured people from the Transkei to work in the docks in Cape Town, thereby taking away work from <span class="col_1163-1164" refersTo="page_0596"/>our local people. If in addition to this the Minister is now going to apply the brake to municipal expenditure he is going to hit the Coloured people. That applies also, of course, to a great extent to the provincial authorities. I do not know to what extent. I would have had a great deal to say if Coloured education had still fallen under the province.</p>

<p>Sir, that brings me to the other point which I want to raise very shortly. We were told last year that until there are sufficient schools and until there are sufficient teachers, compulsory education cannot be introduced for the Coloured people. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to see to it that there is a large increase in his Budget in the amount allocated to the Minister of Coloured Affairs in respect of Coloured schools. I do not have to go deeply into that question, but I think the hon. the Minister should know and does know that there is a very great derth of schools; there is a demand for more Coloured schools. There are far too many Coloured students in classes, and I do hope that the Minister will realize this and that he will give the Minister of Coloured Affairs not only the amount which was previously given to the province but that he will give him very much more to enable him to accelerate the building of more schools, and to make it possible for compulsory education to be brought into force in respect of the Coloured people much sooner than the hon. the Minister indicated here last time.</p>

<p>Sir, I think I have just about used my 10 minutes. There are very many other aspects of the minor Budget which affect the Coloured people, but I think we will deal with the Minister when he makes his Budget speech and when we come to his vote.</p>

<p>I am evidently one of the last speakers to participate in this debate, and you will forgive me if I do not follow the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I just want to say that personally I very much doubt whether he really sits in this House to represent Coloured interests. I leave it there, but as far as I am concerned I doubt it.</p>

<p>During this debate we have seen how the Opposition has projected its projects on the screen on which it wanted to show certain images. I am not gullible or afraid: I am not referring here to the sort of image of which the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) immediately reminded me. He reminded me of the old song to the effect that the one old ghost was fat and the other old ghost was thin. We have seen quite a number of ghosts and their shadows during this debate.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Towards the end of this debate I should like to refer to the images projected on to that screen by the United Party. In the first place it is quite clear to me that a great attempt was made&#x2014;great according to the magnifying glass of the United Party&#x2019;s speakers, but very small in terms of the facts of the matter&#x2019;by the United Party to belittle our economic growth and the confidence business men in the world have in it, although their shadow Minister of Finance, the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), who will perhaps become Minister of Finance if he lives a few hundred years, said that there was confidence in our economy. The United Party speakers who followed him tried to get away from that attempt he made of at least trying to be honest and to realize the facts of the situation. Sir, all the attempts to try to belittle our economy have failed. The hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) predicted last year that we would be facing a difficult future, but the facts have proved that once again he was wrong. I am not a prophet and fortunately I am not the prophet Jeremiah, but I want to make bold to say to-night that those members of the United Party will again look back on their speeches next year and discover that they have spoken a lot of nonsense, because the Republic and our people are still making progress without in the least being hampered by the attempt of the Opposition to belittle our economic growth. That is the one image we see on the screen, which they try to project. I leave the object of it aside, but I just want to point out that were I to seek a name for that picture, with reference to all the projections we have seen already, I would find it difficult to find any name other than &#x201C;The Sabotage of South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Further hon. members opposite pleaded for &#x201C;a modification of the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x201D;, which amounts to a plea for integration. This integration policy they have propounded here from time to time was not so much intended for this House itself; it was aimed at the non-Whites in the country and also at the liberals outside the country. I feel that the liberal group for which it was intended is really related to the communists. It has clearly emerged in the past that all the subversive elements in this country are linked with the liberal elements in one way or another. To our regret we also have an Opposition in this House in which there is a large element of liberalism, and they advanced the argument that we should ameliorate our policy, that we should move in the direction of integration. Sir, there are people who have studied this matter and who are of the opinion that no one will succeed in combating Communism by making use of one&#x2019;s financial power and one&#x2019;s potentialities. Here I have, inter alia, what Lord Malvern said in connection with this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lord Malvern pinpointed this in 1952 when he said, &#x201C;The real appeal of Communism is not on account of its economic doctrine, not because of its world view, but because of one element in its philosophy&#x2014;abolition of colour prejudice&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I use these words, &#x201C;abolition of colour prejudice&#x201D;, does it not sound <span class="col_1165-1166" refersTo="page_0597"/>to you as if they had come from the mouth of the United Party? It is in line with the refrain we continually hear from that side of the House, that racial prejudice should be eliminated. I do not want to expatiate on this point because it has already been proved clearly that one cannot combat Communism by making use of one&#x2019;s capital and financial strength. This whole attempt of the United Party to persuade us to deviate from our policy is, as they say, intended to influence world opinion in our favour, but there is no proof that if we depart from our policy world opinion will change in our favour so much that we will never again hear in South Africa the policy of one man, one vote, which is continually being propounded here. I fear that we will perhaps hear it and experience it, but then it will only be the Black races who will have one man, one vote. It is peculiar that while we are so concerned about the rights of humanity, nobody is concerned about the rights of the settled White population in this country. When it concerns the rights of the one group who in fact have rights which we recognize, that is all well and good, and then it must be projected. But when it concerns the rights of the other section of the population, then it is no longer a question of valuable human rights which must be preserved or must be granted.</p>

<p>I come to another point, Sir. It has emerged very clearly in this debate that the Opposition is very concerned about the uniting of the two main racial groups, the English and the Afrikaans-speaking groups. One of their chief organs of propaganda, the Sunday Times, started even before this Session with preparatory work in conditioning the electorate for the attack launched here by the Opposition. The main object was to keep the English and Afrikaans-speaking people apart. That was quite clear. That is why the Opposition did not launch a frontal attack on the National Party, because it knew that it would make itself ridiculous, because English-speaking South Africans sit in our ranks and co-operate with us. They launched this attack in a subtle manner by using an Afrikaner organization as the basis of the argument by means of which they hoped to foster racial dissension in South Africa. That is one of the greatest mistakes they have made and for that one can award them 100 per cent. If they had to qualify for something or had to sit for an examination &#x2026;</p>

<p>I say the United Party dare not deny that there was a period of preparation for the launching of the attack against the National Party by making use of an Afrikaner organization. That fear was fomented because increasingly more English-speaking people are entering the fight for the maintenance of the White man as against the Black man in this country. The policy of that party is not only destructive and fatal for the settled White population of the Republic, but just as fatal for the Black people and the Brown people in this country. Is there not sufficient proof yet that wherever the White man was driven out in the north and in Central Africa no racial peace and harmony ensued? Let those hon. members now get up and tell us that as the result of the removal of the Whites, or by placing the Black man in a dominant position, economic growth and racial peace were obtained there.</p>

<p>That hon. member talks about Bantustans, but I want to tell him frankly&#x2014;he will have to admit it later&#x2014;that it is much better to give an ethnic group the opportunities the National Party is now giving them. If you continue with your integration policy, with the abolition of job reservation, etc., you will get what we find in the north, mainly, no co-operation; there will continually be racial friction and conflict. Even if one were to abolish job reservation completely, even if one granted the franchise on certain conditions, one would still have that agitation and friction between the various groups. No, Sir, the arguments they are advancing here now are just intended to distract my thoughts from this crucial matter, namely that the Opposition has made itself guilty of a very strenuous attempt to drive in a wedge between the Afrikaans and the English-speaking people. It began when the hon. the Prime Minister appointed English-speaking people in the Cabinet. The country has reaped nothing but good from that. It was encouraged further by the resignation of two United Party members in Natal, one in the Senate and one in this House, two members who later, for good reasons of their own, joined the National Party, where there is no division between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking people. Our Cabinet and our party and our leader concentrate on eliminating that division because we must stand together as White people in order to ensure a good future for our children and for the Brown people and the Blacks.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>What the hon. Whip says is correct, but they do not want to prevent it because they hope in that way to create a future for the Republic; they do so because they think that by that means, or by means of other manoeuvres, yes, even by means of the Federation Plan, they can gain the necessary votes to overthrow the Government. I am afraid that as the stream runs to-day, the <span class="col_1167-1168" refersTo="page_0598"/>stream of English-speaking people to the National Party, they will not catch those votes. The closer the National Party adheres to its policy, the more hon. members opposite can forget to project those pictures of theirs in the hope of catching votes. They can now despair of harming our economy and our policy overseas with their projections. There are numbers of voices&#x2014;and you are aware of it&#x2014;being raised in favour of our policy. The idea has also gained ground in the minds of our Western friends that this policy of the National Party is not as bad as the Opposition professes it to be. I am very sorry, but we are not prepared to depart from that policy in order to give you votes against the National Party.</p>

<p>The other danger in connection with their policy is that eventually not only would we have Black domination, but we would get communist domination in South Africa, and then we would be incorporated by the enemies of the West. What could be more destructive in all spheres than that? Throughout the years those hon. members have tried to protect the enemies of South Africa, as can be proved from Hansard. They are still doing so to-day. If one looks at the list of questions, one sees how concerned they are about people who are brought before the courts in terms of the General Law Amendment Act. If one compares that concern of theirs with their concern for the prisoners who have been sent to gaol for theft and murder and other crimes, then no right-thinking person can come to any conclusion other than that they are particularly concerned with protecting and in voicing concern for the subversive elements, the communist and the agitator. [Interjections.] What is the motive of those hon. members in adopting that attitude? They can have no other motive. If that is not their motive, I ask what impression they create in the minds of persons who are not in this House? What is the impression they create in the minds of the Black people with whom we have to cooperate?</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I hope that party, will now once and for all project an image on the screen which is in the interest firstly of White unity and secondly in the interest of co-operation between the Whites and the other races in the country, in the interest of a future and a way of life for all of us in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The viewpoint of the hon. member who has just sat down would be the height of impertinence, if it were not so laughable, namely, that this side of the House wishes to divide the Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking peoples of this country. Who are the architects of division in this country, and of separation? Who are the architects of the separation of children in the schools? Who are the architects of building up two ways of life in this country? Who are the architects of the absorption of sections of the community by one dominant group? Were it not laughable to listen to the hon. member in this particular era talking the way he did, we would have regarded his attitude as the height of impertinence to the sanity and the intelligence of this House.</p>

<p>One of the themes of the hon. member has been that this side of the House wishes to deprecate the strength of the economy of our country. I say &#x201C;our country&#x201D; in variance to the viewpoint expressed on the other side that they are the country. It is our country, Sir, not their country. It belongs to all of us. We, as the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) has rightly said, realize&#x2014;and we have played our part&#x2014;that there has been an upsurge in the economy of our country. We have played our part, not only as a party, but we have played our part as South Africans. The upsurge in the economy of South Africa is a credit to the South African people; not to the policies of the Government. We say that the credit the hon. the Minister of Finance wishes to take for Government policy for the upsurge of the economy, is completely fallacious. Because, if anything, the policy of the Government is the thing that is making the economy of the country vulnerable. It is our fear that the economy will eventually suffer as a result of Government policy, unless they change it. We are not alone in this point of view, Sir. This is not the point of view of a political party; this is the point of view of even the very people who invest in this country. It is the point of view of world opinion abroad and the hon. the Minister knows it.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the hon. the Minister this. We have had quotations from the Economist, from the Statist and from the Financial Times. But in order to substantiate some of the points that have been made on this side of the House you have to take into account, firstly, the figures given to us by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) in reply to the figures given to us by the Minister of Finance. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance the following questions: Did he not use gross figures of national growth when giving us the figures about the national growth of the country without allowing for the inflationary tendency and the increase in price levels? Did he not give us figures of other countries which were figures of constant prices allowing for such inflation and price level increases?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>That does not matter because the hon. Minister quoted himself. Where did he quote from? I would like his sources of quotation as well, Sir. The House is entitled to accurate figures if the Minister wishes us to accept as correct what he has said. We are not decrying the national economic growth in the country. What we are saying, Sir, is that the Government is not entitled to claim credit for that as a result of its policies. If they <span class="col_1169-1170" refersTo="page_0599"/>maintain that attitude and encourage their supporters to follow that policy they are creating a potential source of danger to the future of our country and the future of the people of this country.</p>

<p>I also want to quote from an article written by a gentleman who is also an economist. He is the editor of an important weekly publication in this country. I want to quote him in order to substantiate what I have said. He said this talking about the economic expansion of South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was considerable unutilized capacity at the disposal of industrialists; so big increases in production were possible at short notice at the same, or at declining, unit cost.</block>

<block name="quote">The financial institutions, during 1961 and 1962, had accumulated a substantial lending potential which was available to finance a rising tempo of production, and spending power in the hands of the public and private sectors had grown steadily from about R1,750,000,000 in mid-1961 to more than R2,250,000,000 by mid-1963.</block>

<block name="quote">Since the middle of 1963 there have been ample gold and foreign exchange available to finance the bigger import bill associated with a revival of consumer spending, or an upturn in the rate of new investment, or both.</block>

<p>We must remember that gold production still remains the mainstay in the entire economy of South Africa. It does not matter what the production is in this country; you have a constant rise in that export product called gold, something which is not only contributing to the development of our economy but which is putting a great deal of money into the coffers of the country for which the policy of the Government cannot take any credit at all. The dangers we have pointed out and the warnings we have issued to the Government must be taken notice of by the hon. the Minister. He must not pooh-pooh them by means of the political harangue to which we have had to listen and which was not the level which a debate of this nature demanded.</p>

<p>Here is a further quotation from the same economist&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This desirable situation could not continue indefinitely, and during the closing months of 1963 the familiar symptoms of excess demand began to appear in certain sectors of the economy. The general price level began to climb rather faster, production costs began to rise and bottle-necks appeared.</block>

<p>These are analyses made by economists; these are not just political statements made by a party. Then it goes on further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But undoubtedly the most serious shortages that the present boom has disclosed are those of executive talent and managerial ability, and skilled artisans and apprentices.</block>

<p>It is a trite fact that if you want to keep a boom going you have got to keep your production of that boom; you have to make provision for artisans. Why did the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs and other speakers on that side not come to the House frankly and say: We have made a mistake, our policy was wrong; for 13 years we did not allow immigrants into the country to help to build up the country; for 13 years we allowed all the other economies of the world to profit by this tremendous flow of immigrants with all their skills and their capital and their know-how; we have allowed approximately 150,000 persons to emigrate to countries like Australia, right into the Antipodes when we, who were almost in the centre of world affairs, did not get any? No, Sir, the Government had to build up its ideologies: it had to rely on the prophetic pronouncements of men like the Deputy Minister of Labour who made this statement when he talked about a pincer movement to destroy the political foundations of this country; he called it a pincer movement directed to the Afrikaner, the Church and the moral foundation of the Nationalist Party. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Other points of the pincer were directed at flooding the country with capital from overseas investors to develop the country&#x2019;s economy and industries to such an extent that a shortage of labour would be created and the Government would have to flood the labour market with Black labour which would break down job reservation and the colour bar.</block>

<p>But he forgot to add that had he had a sound immigration policy, had they carried on with what previous governments had done, he would not have been afraid of a pincer movement like this. This is the most ridiculous statement any man could possibly have made.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that there is no confidence abroad, not in South Africa, but in the Government. People who have travelled know that people invest in this country because they have faith in South Africa, in the South African people, but they look with a tremendous amount of concern at the policy of this Government. Here is a South African, a member of a firm of top business consultants, who has travelled abroad. He seems to have the same point of view which a number of us have. He says this&#x2014;according to the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of South Africa&#x2019;s top business consultants is concerned about, what he calls, the vicious image of South Africa overseas and believes the time has come for a new constructive big-scale approach to the country&#x2019;s attitude to overseas business.</block>

This gentleman says this and I think anybody who has travelled abroad will agree with him. He says he would raise two other points for inclusion in his new approach&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One is top-level, expert and enthusiastic trade delegations from South Africa to go overseas &#x2026;</block>

<p>He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Half-hearted trade delegations are of no use. He suggested there should be trade officers available overseas who could promote, publicize and organize top level trade delegations featuring people from every cross section of life in South Africa.</block>

<block name="quote">The whole thing has to be treated in a big way, on a big scale. But nobody with authority in South Africa really seems to accept the need to sell South Africa.</block>

<p>It is narrow and parochial for any Government to take to itself the full credit for an economy of the magnitude of that of South Africa&#x2019;s. It does not depend initially on the policy of a government. It is there. Its maintenance and its strength and its future durability and viability depend on the wisdom of the policy of the Government. I say this Government has been far from wise in its doings and in what it has been propagating to the people of the country.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to something. Not being a trained economist, Sir, I am not prepared to underwrite it, but I think it might be interesting to have an answer from the Minister to a letter which appeared in the English morning paper this morning. This letter was written by a man who is a professor of economics at the university&#x2014;Professor Hutt. The hon. the Minister smiles, but I have not stated that I accepted the statement. But I think the Minister could perhaps explain the position to us, because as far as the public is concerned it does seem to indicate certain similarities of trend. We were suddenly startled some months ago when the hon. the Minister attended a dinner given by the South African Institute of Insurance-men and warned the country suddenly of inflation and told the country that he would have to remove his foot from the pedal so that he could hold it back &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I say &#x201C;hold back&#x201D; because prior to that other hon. members of the Minister&#x2019;s party had made statements to the effect that this forward surge of the economy would interfere with certain of the traditional attitudes of this country, more particularly with the policy of the Government. That was what the Deputy Minister of Labour said. In fact, the Prime Minister himself, issued a warning similar to that.</p>

<p>The point on which I want to conclude is this, that when this side of the House seriously criticizes certain important aspects of Government policy, we believe that it is not sufficient for the hon. the Minister merely, blandly and generally and broadly, to take to himself the credit, or take to his party the credit for what is taking place. We believe that these criticisms should be answered. They should be met. If they are groundless the hon. the Minister should prove it.</p>

<p>I just want to give him this further statement so that he will realize that one does not talk with one&#x2019;s tongue in one&#x2019;s cheek. I want to quote from the article by Mr. Palmer in Optima of December 1963. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The gold-mining industry in effect has stepped in where overseas investors fear to tread.</block>

<p>That, Sir, is one of the main pillars of the economy of our country and we are very happy about it as well. For that reason this side of the House is concerned about things like dying mines; for that reason this side of the House is concerned about that particular industry. We are not concerned about the &#x201C;mynbase&#x201D; as my friend over there says, that is the capitalists who control the mines; we are concerned with an industry which is the foundation of our country. I believe that we are entitled to an answer to-day to the criticism that has been levelled by this side of the House and we are entitled to some comment on the figures which the hon. member for Jeppes, in introducing this debate, placed before the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) who has just sat down, has made a great deal of noise here. It seems to me that he is still suffering as a result of the hiding which he got from the hon. the Minister of Finance yesterday. He is still licking his wounds.</p>

<p>I can only say in the case of the hon. member that there are none so blind as those who do not wish to see. The hon. member, like other members of his party, has again referred to the Government&#x2019;s policy and said that it makes our economy vulnerable. Nothing is further from the truth. If the hon. member had listened to what was said on this side he would have heard that it is precisely because of the firm policy of this Government that our economy has made so much headway. He went on to say that the policy of this party amounts to this that we are the architects of division between the two large language groups. Let me tell hon. members opposite who are the real architects of division. We on this side said that an Afrikaner organization had deliberately been dragged in by the Opposition to check the stream of English-speaking people joining the National Party. Let me tell the House what an hon. member on the other side said. I should just mention here that when I raised this matter <span class="col_1173-1174" refersTo="page_0601"/>in the Lobby with one of those hon. members, he repudiated it. I hope the hon. member is here so that he can listen to this. The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) made a speech in the Durban City Hall on a certain occasion last year. I quote his speech as it was reported in the Press, and I do not think there is a single hon. member on the other side who can repudiate this. I challenge them to do so. This is what appeared in the <i>Vaderland</i> of 25 October&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Radford begged the English-speaking community in heavens name to wake up and to join forces to put an end to their oppression by the Afrikaans-speaking people in a province in which the English-speaking person had first claim because he was the first to settle in Natal.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Englishman is sitting back, too busy making money to bother about politics and about the salvation of South Africa. The English-speaking person will find when he wakes up one morning that he is on the same level as the Coloureds, with the Afrikaans-speaking person as the ruler and the oppressor.</block>

<block name="quote">That is the only aim of the Afrikaans-speaking section and the only reason why Dr. Verwoerd is now so piously clamouring for unity.</block>

<p>I apologize, it was the United Party leader in Natal, the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) who said it.</p>

<p>As an educationist I should like to conclude with a few brief words on education and make an appeal to the English-speaking section, since the hon. the Leader of the Opposition refuses to do so and since not a single member of the party over there has done so up to the present moment, to contribute their share to the education of our youth. It is a well-known fact that the Afrikaans-speaking people are also called upon to take upon their shoulders the function of educating the English-speaking children. There are numerous schools in the Transvaal, and probably also in the other provinces, where Afrikaans-speaking persons who are bilingual are the heads of English-language schools and where more than half the staff in certain cases consists of Afrikaans-speaking teachers. The reason for this is that this task is entrusted to the Afrikaans-speaking section, instead of the English-speaking section also making their contribution. Instead of coming along with promises of better salaries which they will pay if the United Party ever comes into power, which they have no hope of doing, they ought to make an appeal to the English-speaking section to enter the teaching profession to join Afrikaans-speaking teachers in carrying out this task of serving our nation. We accept that at this stage most English-speaking persons still belong to the United Party. But look what is happening even in Natal. We believe, on the strength of what is happening there, that more and more English-speaking people will join the National Party and if, in due course, we then make that appeal to the English-speaking section, they will probably pay more attention to it. Sir, we often find that hon. members opposite refer in disparaging terms to the fact that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell) has joined the National Party, but let me give them the assurance that in joining the National Party that hon. member has opened a canal which will flow more and more rapidly in the direction of the National Party and hon. members opposite know that that is so. Mr. Speaker, let me read out this quotation in connection with education&#x2014;</p>

<p>I support this statement which was made by Mr. S. Osier, one of the members of the National Advisory Educational Council. Sir, I do not want to weary you with the statistics which I have before me, because by the time we come to the end of this debate hon. members on the other side will never be able to digest them. I want to mention just a few figures because these statistics <span class="col_1175-1176" refersTo="page_0602"/>are very revealing. At the beginning of 1963 there were only 1,976 English-speaking teachers in the Cape Province as against 6,730 Afrikaans-speaking. In Natal there were 1,923 English-speaking as against 954 Afrikaans-speaking. In the Free State there were only 123 English-speaking as against 3,080 Afrikaans-speaking. In the Transvaal there were 2,243 English-speaking as against 9,456 Afrikaans-speaking. In the Department of Education, Arts and Science there were 259 English-speaking as against 1,299 Afrikaans-speaking. That gives us a total of 6,525 English-speaking as against 21,512 Afrikaans-speaking, a ratio of roughly one to three. And if we take into account the fact that the Afrikaans-speaking population is 1,790,988 we find that 1.2 per cent of the Afrikaans-speaking population is employed in the sphere of education, and if we take the English-speaking population which, according to these statistics, was 1,150,738 at the beginning of 1963, we find that only 0.5 per cent of the English-speaking section is employed in the teaching profession. That is the contribution which is being made by the English-speaking section because they are not being encouraged by, amongst others, the leaders of the party on the other side to enter what they would regard as a less remunerative profession. And this task us undertaken by the Afrikaans-speaking, in spite of the insults which the Afrikaans-speaking section has to endure from time to time. Last year in Bloemfontein at the Congress of the United Party one of the United Party delegates&#x2014;I think it was the Krugersdorp delegate, a former member of the school board&#x2014;addressed the conference, and those who were at the congress will be able to confirm that the language which he used there can hardly be described as nice language. You, Mr. Speaker, would call me to order if I used the language which was used on that occasion. That delegate said that, &#x201C;We must wipe the floor with the heads.&#x201D; And he said that in spite of the fact that this service is being rendered by the Afrikaans-speaking section.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>In spite of the sacrifices which are being made by the Afrikaans-speaking section in this respect we get no expression of appreciation from hon. members opposite. The hon. member over there is one of those people who constantly talk about indoctrination. If the Afrikaans-speaking teacher teaches the youth who has been entrusted to his care to love this country with an undivided love and to owe an undivided loyalty to the Republic of South Africa, then he is accused of indoctrination. If a teacher performs that task in any other country and encourages patriotism he is described as a person who imbues the children with a sense of patriotism. But when the Afrikaans-speaking teacher does it he is accused of indoctrination. We want to make a friendly appeal once again to hon. members on the other side to encourage their people to enter the teaching profession. After all, their own people will then also have an opportunity of indoctrinating the children and I hope that like the Afrikaans-speaking teacher they will imbue them with a love for South Africa, and if they do, then we will definitely make no charges against them.</p>

<p>The question that we have to ask ourselves is whether there has been any improvement in this situation. Unfortunately it has not improved. The position remains unchanged; it is deteriorating rather than improving. I tried to get the statistics in connection with would-be teachers enrolled at the normal colleges in the Transvaal. At the moment there are five normal colleges in the Transvaal which are training teachers, only one of which is an English-medium institution. The position at this moment is as follows: The four Afrikaans-medium colleges in the Transvaal have a total of 5,080 students while the one English-medium college, the Johannesburg College of Education, has 1,600, that is to say, 24 per cent of the total number. As an ex-teacher I once again ask hon. members opposite to give us their support in this matter. Do not let them always criticize the teachers when they do this work which involves a certain amount of sacrifice. Sir, great improvements have been brought about in the teaching profession; there has been an improvement in the salaries and there has been an improvement in the standard of the training of teachers in the Transvaal. The Transvaal Department of Education, for example, has decided no longer to allow the two-year course but to make the minimum a three-year training course, so the argument that we do not have sufficient well-trained teachers to fill the various vacancies is also beginning to fall away. That position is constantly improving. The conditions of service have also improved, and that is why we find to-day that large numbers are being attracted to the teaching profession.</p>

<p>In the six minutes at my disposal I would like to deal with the speech of the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto). He was good enough to bring up a matter which has relevance in this debate, and that is the subject of education unlike the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe), with whose speech I would like to deal a little later.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Pretoria (East) said in effect that the English-speaking people to this day are supporting the United Party&#x2014;as to the majority&#x2014;and he said that the majority of the Afrikaans-speaking people supported the Nationalist Party; and then he went on to point out the dereliction of duty on the part of the English-speaking people in our educational system, and he quoted the percentages of English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking teachers in our educational system. He emphasized, with some truth, that in regard to the teaching of English the responsibility was on the shoulders of the Afrikaans-speaking <span class="col_1177-1178" refersTo="page_0603"/>people who, obviously, were supporters of the National Party. That was the analogy that he tried to draw.</p>

<p>Why &#x201C;obviously&#x201D;?</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>&#x201C;Obviously&#x201D;, because he and the National Party claim the entire credit for this educational system. But I suggest that he should get together with the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts and Science, who is presumed to have some close knowledge of the position in regard to our educational system, and he should ask the hon. Minister this question: What on earth possessed him to say, as he did in October of last year at a certain occasion in Pretoria (which had an educational background) what possessed the hon. gentleman to say &#x201C;the most devastating criticism in regard to the schools of our land, and the whole community as one huge and compound educating force, is the ghastly spiritual and cultural poverty of the majority of the people&#x201D;. That is what he claims to the credit for the National Party for what he calls their indoctrination, their justifiable indoctrination of our children. The hon. member for Pretoria (East) says that the majority of the people&#x2014;and, of course, then he refers only to the White people&#x2014;are Afrikaans-speaking, and that the majority of the Afrikaans-speaking people are supporters of the National Party. So when he talks about the &#x201C;ghastly spiritual and cultural poverty of the majority of the people&#x201D;, he is talking about the majority of the Afrikaans-speaking people, and he is talking about the majority of the supporters of the National Party. Mr. Speaker, whereas I do not claim an apology on behalf of the supporters of the National Party, I think the hon. member owes the majority of the Afrikaans-speaking people in South Africa an apology for this gratuitous insult.</p>

<p>I would like to deal very briefly with the hon. member for Middelland. Mr. Speaker, there you have a perfect example of the poverty that exists, despite their apparent numbers (I say &#x201C;apparent&#x201D; advisedly) that exists on the side of the Government, the poverty they revealed in replying to two speeches we heard this afternoon just before that hon. member rose&#x2014;the one by the hon. member for Benoni, about the dying mines, the moving of industries unnecessarily to the so-called borders of the reserves, the chapter and verse in that speech; and the other speech by the hon. member for Jeppe (Dr. Cronje), studded with facts and figures and statistics. What did we get in reply, against the background of a Part Appropriation debate, from the hon. member for Middelland? What did we get? A tearjerker, as they call it in the film business, about the United Party and its sorry condition. I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, you were not here, because it was an impressive performance. The tears were virtually streaming down the face of the hon. member, as he beheld the sad condition of this honourable Opposition. Now, Sir, is that proof positive that where all argument fails, or where there is no argument at all to oppose the arguments of my colleagues on this side of the House, it is always a good diversion to start bemoaning the fate of this poor Opposition. Now I have got news for the hon. member for Middelland long after he has stopped bemoaning the fate of the Opposition, he and his party will be out of power, and this woeful Opposition will be sitting there! And I will tell him why up to a certain point politics and ideologies are very impressive. (Of course, we live by politics and ideology in this Chamber), but outside as we talk here about the United Party and its difficulties, and as we talk about this, shall I say, insult to the Afrikaans-speaking community and our educational system the majority of the people outside are worrying about how they are going to make ends meet this day, and to-morrow. This is what the Government will find it has to answer for, and I would like to say this to the hon. Minister of Finance last year, I recall that, like his colleague the Minister of Transport, he quoted a certain French essayist by the name of Montaigne. The hon. Minister of Transport is very fond of Montaigne. Somebody writes his speeches and says &#x201C;Now here you must quote Montaigne&#x201D;. So last year, I remember, the hon. Minister of Finance took up this Montaigne creed and he quoted something against me and he then went out of his way to drag in the late William Shakespeare. He said &#x201C;perchance to dream&#x201D;, which was the quotation I had used, and he said that the Opposition was just being given a chance to dream of getting back to power. I want to agree with the hon. Minister that to-day the National Party undoubtedly sits on the throne. There is no question about it they are solidly ensconced on that throne. But the same essayist, Montaigne&#x2014;and I say that as much for the benefit of the hon. Minister of Transport as of his colleague, the Minister of Finance&#x2014;the same Montaigne was heard to say in his day, and it has been preserved for us in the library&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sits he on never so high a throne, a man still sits on his bottom.</block>

<p>I wish I had coined that phrase, Mr. Speaker one day this Government will come right down on its bottom, and with such a jar, that they will not know what has happened to them. They will come down, Mr. Speaker, because of economic facts, nothing else; not ideologies, not through politics.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Jeppes <span class="col_1179-1180" refersTo="page_0604"/>(Dr. Cronje) that this time he was not left at the post! He almost jumped the gun when this third-reading debate started to-day, and I am sure we are all very glad that he was able to make his speech to-day which he really prepared for yesterday. It seemed to me when I listened to him, and remembering what the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) had said, that there was a very distinct contradiction between the two speakers. The main thesis of the hon. member for Constantia was that it had taken 15 years of National Government to produce a reasonable rate of growth. But the main thesis of the hon. member for Jeppes was apparently that our growth is still tremendously slow; these two statements need some reconciliation. But then most of the statements of the hon. member need some reconciliation with realities. I remember the time, not so long ao, when this member too indulged in the expression of some financial foresight, and all I can say is that the whole economy as it is to-day, and as it has been described by the hon. member for Constantia, is an utter condemnation of the financial judgement of the hon. member for Jeppes as expressed in this House. I want to refer you to what the hon. member said in 1961, that is when we had introduced the measures to control the outflow of capital. Then the hon. member indulged in some judgments, what he considered the financial position was going to be. I want to quote just a few, because I have not got much time.</p>

<block name="quote">The serious effects of our leaving the Commonwealth are already felt. Why was the hon. Minister so wrong there?</block>

<p>Was the Minister wrong? Or was the hon. member for Jeppes wrong in his financial judgment? Let me take another statement by the hon. member. In the same speech he said that there was not going to be any confidence in South Africa, that there would be no foreign investments. He said &#x201C;that the Minister had over-estimated the remaining overseas confidence in this Government&#x2019;s policies as far as overseas investors are concerned&#x201D;. In other words, there was no capital coming in to South Africa from overseas anymore, no new factories would arise, we would be stagnant and we would go from bad to worse. But the hon. member went on in that speech and returned to the question of confidence. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This step can only mean that the Minister and the Government have lost all confidence of ever restoring the confidence of the foreign investor in South Africa. It is an act of desperation</block>

<p>That was the financial judgment expressed in 1961 by the hon. member. Well, Mr. Speaker, is it necessary for me to show that only last week the mighty Plessey group started here and this is what was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The city (London) was interested that the mighty Plessey group which is in everything from telephones to time switches and electronic devices, should again have invented heavily in South Africa.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>To-day there is a net-outflow of capital and in the third quarter of last year alone, R23,000,000 of the outflow was caused by the repatriation of South African shares which had been held by overseas owners. R23,000,000 in one-quarter! The hon. member can go and study the <span class="col_1181-1182" refersTo="page_0605"/>most recent Quarterly Bulletin and he will find that in the third quarter of 1963 there was a net-outflow, and then they break it up and they come to the conclusion that R23,000,000 of the outflow was due to the repatriation of foreign-owned South African stocks. We have got those shares now. A lot of the shares that were held overseas a couple of years ago have been repatriated. It is an excellent thing and I wish we could allow a further outflow of capital to repatriate shares, but unfortunately there is a limit to all these things. We are allowing as much as we think is reasonable. But I can tell hon. members that that is not for investment in companies overseas, but for investment in our own shares. These people realize how advantageous it is if they can pick up shares at bargain prices overseas.</p>

<p>They are only too happy to bring them out to South Africa. The price gap, I may say, has also considerably been reduced since two years ago, considerably reduced. I do not know whether I can take the matter much further. The hon. member for Jeppes has quoted a lot of figures. I quoted figures which are not hidden away, but which are in the report&#x2014;they are figures of the gross national produce and I compared it with similar figures of other countries. I did not compare two things that are not comparable: Net figures with gross figures. I gave gross figures. The hon. member has not been able to show that these figures are wrong.</p>

<p>But I come now to the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller). I must commence by saying that I really admire his courage in coming back, a little punch-drunk, perhaps, but still he has come back. Yesterday I accused him, and I quoted two statements of his, that he was trying to belittle South Africa&#x2019;s economy. The first is where he said in effect that our economy is perhaps rosy on the outside, but it is not healthy. He was not referring to the Government, but to our economy. He said our economy was not inherently sound. That is the point he made yesterday. The other point he made yesterday was that our growth was really nothing. He mentioned other countries, including some American states, and said that they were enjoying a buoyancy certainly not less than our buoyancy, and that there was greater progress there than in South Africa. I quoted comparable figures. He was not attacking the Government; he was attacking South Africa&#x2019;s economy, but to-day he says: No, I am not attacking the economy of South Africa; I am attacking the Government. He has not the courage to withdraw the statements to which I took exception yesterday, and to which every decent South African will take exception. (Laughter.) To-day he tries to wriggle out of it and to pretend that it was not really an attack on South Africa&#x2019;s economy, but on the Government. As far as we are concerned, we as a Government can stand these little short-arm jabs of the hon. member. I think that if I must say his words mean anything to-day, compared with what he said yesterday, he is now actually in effect identifying South Africa with its Government. If he tells me that he was attacking, as he was attacking, the Government of South Africa, and I quote what he said about South Africa&#x2019;s economy, I can come to only one conclusion&#x2014;if he does not withdraw the first statement&#x2014;and that is that he is identifying the state with its Government, which is not an unusual thing. If I think of the United States, I do not think in terms of any particular administration which is in power there; I identify that state with the Government it has at the moment, and that is what people overseas are thinking about South Africa. I have a lot to do with people who seriously think about those things, and they do not separate the two. For them the Government of South Africa is South Africa, and South Africa is the Government, and that is what the hon. member has tacitly admitted here.</p>

<p>He quoted the <i>Economist</i> and other papers. I said right from the beginning that the strongest economy in the world can never be equally strong in every part of its structure at the same time. There are always weaknesses and dangers which have to be averted, and that is true of South Africa too. That is shown by our whole past history. It is the achievement of this Government that in spite of these recurrent weaknesses in various sectors of the economy we have been able to overcome them. He mentioned the under-utilization of our factories. Yes, that was our difficulty at one time, but it is not our difficulty to-day. Unemployment was at one time our difficulty, but it is no longer. Those things will recur. At the moment we have other weak points and difficulties, but these new ones will be overcome too.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that if our economy is sound&#x2014;which it is not according to him&#x2014;we have no reason to claim credit for ourselves as a Government. But I wonder, if the economy had deteriorated, would the hon. member have adopted the same attitude? Would he then have said that it was not due to what the Government had done, but due to some <i>force majeure,</i> and the Government is really the innocent victim of what happened? That is a childish argument of the hon. member, and by virtue of the fact that he has come back to the attack to-day I can only say of the hon. member for Florida that failure has gone to his head. I know he was assiduously coached by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), who was at pains to explain something to him just before he spoke. [Interjection.] I can understand what the hon. member said to-day, and if I compare it with what he said yesterday I can only remind him of the word, &#x201C;and the last state of that man is worse than the first&#x201D;&#x2014;the hon. member&#x2019;s second lapse was even worse than his first. <span class="col_1183-1184" refersTo="page_0606"/>But I am quite prepared to accept, as an extenuating circumstance, that he was coached by the hon. member for Jeppes!</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to a statement by Professor Hutt that inflation has been engineered by this Government. Sir, if there is one thing which South Africa cannot afford and which the Government is very well aware that it cannot afford, it is inflation. We are more vulnerable to inflation than many other countries. Our gold mines and our export trade will be hard hit if there is any inflation in this country. To say now that we deliberately engineered it, when we have been warning against it&#x2014;at the same time not falling into the error of many people who try to over-state the dangers&#x2014;is quite wrong. We believe that if timeous steps are taken inflation will never happen, but if there should be inflation we will have to take much more drastic steps. That is the experience to-day of countries of the Common Market. They have had their industrial honeymoon and now we find that the cost of living has gone up there by 7 per cent to 8 per cent, and that is the position we never want to allow here. That is why I made this plea, that we should be realistic about it. There is no inflation and there is no immediate danger of it, but it is always one of the things against which one has to be on one&#x2019;s guard when the economy is prospering. The greater the prosperity, the more one is exposed to this danger. But do not let us have an obsession about it. Do not let us create a kind of inflation psychosis. That is what I warned against. Let us look the facts in the face soberly and see whether we cannot, by taking timeous steps, prevent any such disaster.</p>

<p>If there are sporadic rises in prices of various articles, that is not inflation, and I am quite sure that if we do not talk ourselves into an inflation we will not have it. We have had rising prices all the time. The cost of living has risen, and one of my colleagues has given notice of one of the brakes which could be applied if there is any abuse of our present prosperity. I said yesterday that we have to take a firm hold and see that there are not exorbitant abuses of rising wages and incomes and profits and rents. Those are all things we have to guard against, but there is no inflation yet and I hope there will never be. But there may be inflation if we go and proclaim that there is inflation, as the hon. member is doing here now. Sir, I am beginning to be a little disappointed in the hon. member now. I have praised the hon. member sky-high for his more realistic approach to our economy, and I do not want my dear old friend to disappoint me now by taking up this line.</p>

<p>A few hon. members spoke about the marginal mines. I do not want to go into details. I have already explained that the Government has already given assistance and that it is discussing the matter. We have to have regard to many factors which the hon. member and others are perhaps not aware of. We have to consider the attitude of the International Monetary Fund. They are not against all forms of help to the marginal mines, but there are certain forms which are not acceptable to them, and we have to take that into consideration, and we also have to consider the opinion of the mines themselves.</p>

<p>I want to say in conclusion that it is unnecessary for me, if hon. members want to see how we advanced during the last 15 years, to say much more than to give a few simple figures in regard to our exports, which increased from about R215,000.000 in 1947 to R954,000,000 in 1962, which is not even the latest figure. Our balance of payments on current account was in the red by R392,000,000 in 1947, and it is now plus R307,000,000 for 1962. I already explained why the position of the capital account is as it is, and that it is due to the big amounts that came into the country when we opened up the goldfields. There are no new goldfields that we can open up to that extent again, but that resulted in a large increase of capital flowing into the country. I am not talking about the capital account in 1947. That was a bogus account, because it was due to flight capital which came into the country. In any case, it is very difficult to compare a war-time economy with a peace-time economy, but I think what is remarkable&#x2014;and I want to commend that to the attention of the hon. member for Jeppes&#x2014;is that our economy has shown such a rapid rate of growth while the price of one of our chief products, gold, has remained unchanged since 1949. I wonder how many countries in the world can say that?</p>

<p>I want to conclude by repeating the remark made to me by a very prominent banker when I was in the United States last year, when he said that by and large, relatively, our economy in South Africa to-day is the soundest in the world.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House go into Committee on the Estimates of Additional Expenditure of the South African Railways and Harbours to be defrayed from Revenue Funds during the year ending 31 March 1964, and on the Second Estimates of Additional Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works during the same period.</block>

<p>Hon. members will have noticed from the documents I have already tabled that the expenditure to be defrayed from revenue funds during the present financial year now amount to R523,147,200. For this an additional amount of R18,278,475 has to be voted.</p>

<p>The main reasons for the increased expenditure are the following. In addition to the amount of R36,357 for improved fire-fighting services, the major portion of the amount under Head No. 1&#x2014;General Charges&#x2014;is due to the transfer of staff to departments falling under this head. In order to centralize the accounting work, the staff in the stores department doing such work has been transferred to the control of the accounts department. Similarly the subdivision, motive power, has been transferred from the office of the Chief Engineer (Mechanical) in Johannesburg to the office of the General Manager, with a view to efficiency.</p>

<p>The salaries of the staff concerned have already been provided for under various other heads, but it is necessary to make specific provision for it now under the head Miscellaneous Expenditure.</p>

<p>An additional amount of R767,000 is required under Head No. 2&#x2014;Maintenance of Permanent Way and Works. That was caused, <i>inter alia,</i> by the larger amounts paid in rentals as the result of the greater utilization of mechanized equipment for permanent way maintenance; and also greater expenditure on the maintenance of housing and buildings, which is now done according to a scheme of systematically planned maintenance.</p>

<p>The great increase in rail traffic during the past year is responsible for the major portion of the additional amounts which have to be defrayed under Heads Nos. 3, 4 and 5&#x2014;Maintenance of Rolling Stock, Running Expenses and Traffic Expenses. Operational requirements have resulted in the appointment of additional staff and increased Sunday time and overtime pay, and at the same time the cost of repairing steam locomotives and other rolling stock has also increased.</p>

<p>When the original Estimates were drafted, it was not possible to determine the exact effect of the rationalization of the salary and wage structure on pension contributions, and consequently it was necessary to make an adjustment in this regard. In addition, the number of members of the Superannuation Fund increased to such an extent that the Administration&#x2019;s R for R contributions have to be increased. An additional amount of R277,000 is thus provided under Head No. 6 to cover the increased expenditure.</p>

<p>In regard to subsidiary services, an additional amount of R1,027,300 is asked for under Head No. 12&#x2014;Road Transport Service, which, as in the case of the railways, was mainly caused by an increase in traffic. For the period April to October 1963, as compared with the same period for the previous year, the goods traffic of the road transport service, e.g., increased by 140,000 tons, and vehicle miles for the same period increased by over 750,000.</p>

<p>The increased expenditure under Head No. 13&#x2014;Tourist Services, is due to increased number of passages booked for immigrants and the increase in hotel expenses incurred on behalf of tourists. This additional expenditure is, however, recoverable and the income of the tourist department of the Railways has increased accordingly.</p>

<p>Hon. members will remember that when I announced the increase in the allowances of certain pensioners in my Budget speech last year, I mentioned that the expenditure in connection with that was not included in the printed Estimates. Provision is therefore being made for it now in the Additional Estimates and an amount of R1,442,000 is being provided for under Head No. 17&#x2014;Miscellaneous Expenditure.</p>

<p>The greatest proportion of the amount of R251,000, in respect of assets withdrawn from the service, is designed for the transfer of a non-White residential area at Waterval Boven to the local health committee. In order to clear up a non-White slum on the railway <span class="col_1187-1188" refersTo="page_0608"/>premises, to improve health conditions and housing and to be able to control the further influx of squatters, a location area has been demarcated in consultation with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, in which the aforementioned railway premises is included. It is, however, essential that the ownership rights of a particular area should be vested in the authority controlling it, and therefore it was decided to transfer to the health committee the land concerned together with the assets on it.</p>

<p>Provision is also being made for R352,400 to cover the losses suffered on the realization of investments. In the original Estimates only a nominal provision of R2,000 was made for such losses. As the result, however, of the sale of locally registered low interest-bearing bonds, an additional amount of R352,400 is required to cover the net capital loss sustained in these transactions. The proceeds of such sales are being reinvested in long-term bonds bearing a higher rate of interest, with the result that the loss sustained in this way will be wiped out within an appreciable period by the higher rate of interest received.</p>

<p>In regard to harbour services, an additional amount of R225,315 is required under Head No. 19&#x2014;Operating Expenses, which is mainly due to the higher salaries and wages resulting from the increased activities in the harbours.</p>

<p>The main reasons for the additional provision of R1,673,500 under Head No. 28&#x2014;Airways, is in respect of increased fuel prices as from September 1963; the greater consumption of fuel due to expanded services; switching over to the West Coast route; and the application of a revised depreciation contribution in regard to aircraft. In this connection it was formerly the practice to calculate depreciation on all aircraft and aircraft engines on the basis of a life of eight years with a residual value of 15 per cent of the original value. In view of the latest developments in the sphere of aviation, however, the possibility has arisen that it will not be easy to dispose of used aircraft, with the result that difficulty may be experienced in obtaining compensation to the extent of 15 per cent of the original capital value of aircraft by way of the residual value. It has therefore been decided, except in the case of the Boeing aircraft, to depreciate fully all aircraft of the S.A. Airways as from October 1963 over a period of eight years. In view of the fact that it is expected that the Boeings will still be in service by 1970, their life is estimated to be ten years.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, there have been negotiations with the Mealie Control Board in regard to the taking over of the Department&#x2019;s 34 inland grain elevators, with the exception of the one at Moorreesburg. This transfer took place on 1 May 1963 and it was decided to transfer the credit of R975,000 which became available from this transaction to the Renewals Fund under Head No. 34 to finance the machinery in the new grain elevator at East London.</p>

<debateSection name="#capital_and_betterment_works">

<heading>CAPITAL AND BETTERMENT WORKS</heading>

<p>The additional expenditure to be provided for capital and betterment works amounts to R2,815,200.</p>

<p>Of the amount of R1,122,900 which is required under Head No. 2&#x2014;New Works on Open Lines, R172,500 is intended for the relaying of the line, for a distance of almost six miles, on the section between Frederikstad and Midway. As is generally known, this re-laying is necessitated by subsidences in the vicinity of Carletonville. The new route will, according to all the available data, go over safer terrain. As a precautionary measure at the same time a number of bore-holes along the railway line are being equipped with telescopic instruments in order to watch the position continually.</p>

<p>In regard to the ordinary re-laying and reinforcement works, there are various sums amounting altogether to R320,000 which have to be debited to the Betterment Fund. In this connection I want to explain that railroad material in respect of re-laying and reinforcement works is in the first instance debited to the Renewals Fund. If, however, the new material has a greater capital value than that which was formerly in the railroad, the difference is debited to the Betterment Fund.</p>

<p>As the result of a resolution by the Railways and Harbours Select Committee in 1963, the amount for which approval has to be obtained for delayed debits was increased from R2,000 to R10,000. The amount which must be voted under Head No. 2 for this purpose is approximately R600,000.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 3&#x2014;Rolling Stock&#x2014;R660,000 is required for an order of two turn-table drop-side trucks which are being delivered more speedily than was originally expected.</p>

<p>A start has already been made with the dredging and construction work in the Table Bay Harbour area with reference to the new refinery which is being erected in Cape Town. As the result of the speeding up of the work, the expenditure during the present financial year will be appreciably higher than was originally estimated. An additional cash provision of R600,000 is therefore being asked for for this work.</p>

<p>A further provision of R320,000 under Head No. 5&#x2014;Harbours&#x2014;is in respect of 16 cranes in Durban Harbour; R80,000 is for harbour works at Walvis Bay which is progressing faster than was expected.</p>

<p>In regard to Head No. 8&#x2014;Working Capital, hon. members will notice that portion of the amount originally estimated for the sale of departmental dwelling houses is being transferred to the house ownership schemes; that emanates from a decision provisionally to suspend the sale of departmental houses to members of the personnel. In order to ensure that the personnel is in no worse position in regard to the purchase of properties, the remaining amount from the sale of departmental houses <span class="col_1189-1190" refersTo="page_0609"/>is being made available to the two other schemes.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to obtain additional loan funds from the Treasury for the financing of the various capital works to an amount of R2,815,200, in view of the fact that this can be financed partly from available capital funds and partly from savings on the existing estimates.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to mention that I intend introducing my Budget for the financial year 1964-5 on 4 March, on which occasion I will give a complete review of the operating results for the current financial year.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>May I thank the hon. the Minister for making available to us a copy of the speech which he has just delivered, and at the same time for the somewhat detailed explanations which he has given of certain items. Be that as it may, there are still one or two other aspects of these Additional Estimates which I would like to raise with the hon. the Minister and on which I hope he will be able to give us a reply. May I say in passing&#x2014;I think I am correct in saying this&#x2014;that this is probably the first occasion, in quite a long period, on which the Minister has presented Estimates of Additional Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works in which he has not had to approach the Treasury for further loan funds. But there are still one or two aspects of these Estimates in respect of which the hon. the Minister has not entirely met the requests put forward by this side of the House in the past, because we still find that provision is made here for new items in respect of which the House is merely being asked to vote token amounts to indicate its approval of work eventually to be undertaken by the Administration. I find in studying the Estimates that although in regard to certain of these new works we are being called upon in these Estimates to vote a sum of R351,000 only, there is still something like R803,200 of the total appropriation which the House will eventually still have to vote. Sir, the Minister has criticized us in the past for not coming forward with objective, constructive criticism of his Budget and of his management of the Railway Administration. We have pointed out in the past that unless we have information from the hon. the Minister indicating the necessity for these new capital works, it is very difficult to put forward objective criticism of the proposed new works.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Which items are you referring to?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I refer to Items 5, 6, 7, 10, 32, 39, 40, 44, 45, 51, 53, 54 and 59. These are all new works of a varying nature in respect of which we are now being called upon to vote money for the first time. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that if there was proper and adequate planning by the Minister&#x2019;s Planning Council, there would be no necessity to make provision in these Additional Estimates for these new capital works, because both in the First and Second Additional Estimates we find these new items appearing from time to time in respect of comparatively large works which, if there had been adequate planning, could surely have appeared in the Brown Book when the original Estimates were approved. We are well aware that there are occasions, as in the case of the Midway connection, where there is a danger through subsidence of the soil, where it is necessary to make provision for an item immediately so that the Administration can proceed with the work immediately. That we appreciate; it would be unreasonable to expect the Minister&#x2019;s Planning Council to have foreseen a subsidence of the soil in that area with resultant danger to the traffic and travellers on that particular line. That is appreciated but there are many other items where the Minister, when he presents his Brown Book, can give the House the reasons for having to undertake these capital works, rather than presenting them piecemeal in this fashion and then expect us to confine our questions, in terms of the rules of this House, to the reasons for the inclusion of the amounts in these Additional Estimates. Let me say immediately that in, these Estimates there is a very great improvement over previous years, but I hope that we will reach the stage eventually where only capital works which are urgently necessary will appear in these Estimates.</p>

<p>Then turning to the Revenue Fund, the Minister has pointed out that the bulk of the R18,125,000 that we are being asked to vote here is due to the rationalization of the wage and salary structure, but the bulk of the money&#x2014;R11,000,000 odd&#x2014;is required to cope with increased traffic. We do not quibble about that and we hope that that will be reflected in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget when we will go more fully into that matter. The hon. the Minister dealt in particular with one item and that was Head No. 1. I want to say to the Minister that it seemed to me that he rather glossed over the reasons for the increases there, because I noticed that the Minister makes no reference at all to one of the most important reasons for the increase, and that is the increase in the emoluments of Railway Commissioners with retrospective effect from 1 October 1963. Sir, I realize that I cannot go very fully into that issue here but I would like to ask the Minister what the reasons are for that increase at this stage when we relate it to past increases, because here we find for the first time that a distinction is being made between the three Railway Commissioners. The senior Commissioner is now to be paid a salary of R7,600 which represents a 50 per cent increase in the salary of the senior Railway Commissioner since 1951, a 26 per cent increase since 1955 and a 12 per cent increase since 1963. What do we find when we compare these increases with the increases granted to senior executive officers of the Railway Administration? We find <span class="col_1191-1192" refersTo="page_0610"/>that nothing like it has been granted to senior executive officers in such a short period of time&#x2014;50 per cent in eight years, 26 per cent in four years and 4 per cent in two years! What has necessitated this increase? Surely there is no comparison between these increases and the increases which were given to the railwaymen and the senior officers in 1962.</p>

<p>Sir, I realize that the rules prevent me from going too deeply into this matter. I do not know if the Minister hoped that the Opposition would not notice the footnote relating to Head No. 1, but if he had any such hopes he was mistaken. We hope to take this matter further on another occasion, but I hope that at this stage the Minister will indicate why this very large increase should be given to Railway Commissioners with retrospective effect to 1 October 1963 and how he can justify this increase bearing in mind all the perquisites enjoyed by Railway Commissioners, which are not enjoyed by any other executives in the Railway Administration.</p>

<p>I am really at a loss to understand what the complaint of the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) is in regard to the Additional Estimates on capital works. Surely he must realize that the Railway Administration is a dynamic organization, and you cannot possibly foresee all capital works which may have to be undertaken in the next 12 months. It all depends on traffic conditions whether additional works should be embarked upon or not. Surely the hon. member does not expect urgent work to be held over until the Brown Book has been presented. What difference does it make whether a new item appears in the Additional Estimates or in the Brown Book? Any new item appearing in the Additional Estimates can be fully discussed. There is no limitation on the debate in that regard. There are over 1,000 items in the Brown Book. Has it ever happened that every item has been motivated and the House informed about the reasons for the inclusion of every item? It does not happen. As a matter of fact what does happen is that the House usually spends about one or two hours discussing the items in the Brown Book, and there are about 1,000 items to be discussed within one or two hours. As far as items appearing in the Additional Estimates are concerned, I think hon. members have more opportunity of discussing the individual items in detail because there is more time available. The hon. member is free to discuss each of these items <i>ad infinitum. </i>He can get all the relevant information. I do not give the House all the information in regard to items appearing in the Brown Book. As a matter of fact I give very little information. It is the duty of hon. members, if they want information, to ask for that information. In regard to all these items which appear as new items in the Additional Estimates I am quite prepared in the Committee Stage to give the hon. member all the information he wants. But the trouble is that the hon. member apparently does not know what to talk about and that is why he raises a silly point like this.</p>

<p>In regard to the increase in the salaries of Railway Commissioners, I can accuse the Opposition of many things but I have never accused them of being blind, so quite obviously they must see it when there is a footnote to the Estimates; they must see it, and there is nothing to hide. There are two reasons for increasing the salaries of Railway Commissioners. First of all the increase is fully justified having regard to the amount of work they do and the responsibility that they carry. Secondly, the Government appointed a committee to inquire into the salaries of members of all statutory boards, and the recommendation was that the salaries should be increased. It was only fair therefore to bring the salaries of Railway Commissioners into line with the salaries of the chairmen and members of other boards who received an increase in salary. There were times when the salaries of Railway Commissioners were higher than the salaries of the members of many boards, and to-day there are board members whose salaries are higher than those of Railway Commissioners.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The Government, as I have already said, appointed a committee last year&#x2014;not in 1961&#x2014;and that <span class="col_1193-1194" refersTo="page_0611"/>committee made recommendations in regard to the salaries of board members. Hon. members will see what their salaries are when the Estimates are presented to the House. I felt that it was only fair to bring the salaries of Railway Commissioners into line with the salaries paid to the members of boards. The salaries were always uniform. As a matter of fact they are not quite uniform to-day because there are certain members, such as the chairman of the Board of Trade and Industries, whose salaries are much higher than the salaries of Railway Commissioners. As I have said, there are good reasons for this increase. They deserve this increase bearing in mind the responsibility that they carry and the work that they do. The reason why the salary of the Senior Railway Commissioner is higher is because he carries additional responsibilities. There has always been a Senior Railway Commissioner. That Senior Railway Commissioner acts as chairman in my absence. In regard to the majority of the appeals which are heard by the Railway Board the Senior Railway Commissioner acts as chairman. It is up to him to give the necessary lead to the other Railway Commissioners in regard to their activities. I thought it was only fair that the Senior Railway Commissioner should be given a slightly higher salary because of his additional responsibilities. The increase is fully justified.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has referred to a certain committee which was consulted in connection with this increase in the salaries of Railway Commissioners. I want to ask him whether that committee has approved of this increase. I also want to know from him whether that is the committee which is known as the Coordinating and Advisory Committee on Salaries and Conditions of Employment of Statutory Boards and Other Bodies. It is a committee with a very long name and which, I believe, was appointed by the Government last year to inquire into the salaries and income of members of boards and also the members of the Railway Board. Was that the committee that was consulted? How is this committee constituted? Who are the people who actually advised the hon. the Minister? I think we should have more information about that committee and also about the advice given to the Minister in that connection.</p>

<p>I should also like to associate myself with the remarks made by my colleague who asked why it was necessary to make this increase of retrospective effect from 1 October 1963. Has the volume of work increased so fantastically over the past few months that it has become urgently necessary to grant the increase from 1 October 1963? Why could it not have waited until the new Budget was introduced this year? The hon. the Minister has said that he made a comparison between the salaries paid to members of the Railway Board and to members of other boards. When granting this increase did he consider the fact that members of the Railway Board had their own passenger coaches and that they enjoyed many privileges which members of other boards did not enjoy? When those things are taken into consideration it is clear that members of the Railway Board are indeed well remunerated. I think the hon. the Minister owes the Committee a further explanation in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>I have explained why the salaries have been increased. I shall repeat what I said. The Government appointed a committee to inquire into the salaries of members of other statutory boards. If the hon. member wants to have details about that committee he must ask my colleague because that committee did not inquire into the salaries of Railway Commissioners. They inquired into the salaries of members of other boards. As the Minister concerned and knowing the work the Railway Commissioners do and what responsibilities they carry I decided that it would only be reasonable to bring their salaries into line with those of members of other boards.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>No, they did not inquire into that; that is my responsibility. I know what responsibilities they carry because they work in very close association with me. I knew what work they <span class="col_1195-1196" refersTo="page_0612"/>did and I decided, firstly, that it would only be fair to bring their salaries into line with the salaries of members of other boards. Secondly I also decided to differentiate between the salary of the Senior Commissioner and the salaries of the others, because of the additional responsibilities he carried. The reasons are the same as those that applied when the hon. member&#x2019;s salary was increased a few years ago. At that time this House felt that because Members of Parliament carried greater responsibilities they deserved higher salaries. It was for the same reason that I increased these salaries. I took into account the facilities they enjoyed before I came to the decision. I decided that it should be effective from that date, but that is even a later date than the date from which members of other boards received increases. I did not want to go as far back as that. Those are the reasons for these increases in detail, Sir.</p>

<p>May I explain to the hon. member, Sir? I said in Afrikaans that the Cabinet decided to appoint a committee to inquire into the salaries of members of boards, not the salaries of the Railway Commissioners. That committee made recommendations in regard to the salaries of those members. That committee did not inquire into the salaries of the Railway Commissioners. The reason is quite simple. I am my own Minister of Finance; whereas the Minister of Finance is responsible for the salaries of the members of all the other boards I am responsible for the salaries of the Railway Commissioners. That is why the Government committee could not inquire into the salaries of the Railway Commissioners.</p>

<p>The Minister says he appreciated the increased responsibility of and work done by the Railway Commissioners. We get a report from the Railway Board annually and from that we are able to gauge, in part, what they are doing. I am not quibbling about the fact that additional responsibility has been placed upon the Railway Commissioners. All I wanted to establish was that the Minister must have failed in the first place not to have <span class="col_1197-1198" refersTo="page_0613"/>the salaries of the Railway Commissioners considered by the special Cabinet committee. That being the position the Minister has taken this decision on his own shoulders.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree with my hon. colleague. The impression I got &#x2026; [Laughter.] That laughter that you hear, Sir, is guilty laughter. There is the question of collective Cabinet responsibility, Sir. No wonder the hon. Deputy Minister over there laughs. The Minister has given us two reasons for this increase. First of all, the Government appointed a committee to go into the whole question of the salary structure of the chairmen and members of other boards. Having done that they reported to the Cabinet and the Minister saw that report. He then came to the conclusion, because of that report, that the Railway Commissioners were underpaid. He came to that conclusion as a result of the report, not because of the work done or the non-executive responsibility carried by those Commissioners. The Minister had a doubt in his own mind, that is obvious. He could not take the courage in his own hands and announce in this House last year, when the general increase was granted to Railway servants, that he would at the same time give the same percentage increase to the Railway Commissioners. He lacked the courage. The Minister has to get some confirming authority. It cannot be escaped that there is a 50 per cent increase. I challenge the Minister this afternoon to show us one single other example of a member of any other board that exists by Statute in South Africa where there has been a comparable increase in remuneration as it is now proposed to give to the Railway Commissioners. I challenge the Minister to give us one example. Because in 1962, in Col. 2547, when we debated the increase which the Minister then gave to the Railway Commissioners, an increase which represented a 26 per cent increase on the 1955 salary basis, the Minister said that for years the Railway Commissioners were ahead of other board members. We now suddenly find that because of a committee appointed by the Cabinet&#x2014;I have not seen their report; I do not know whether any other member has seen it&#x2014;all members of boards are getting an increase and that fact has justified an increase in the salaries of the Railway Commissioners. But the other executive members of the Railway Administration, those members who carry the burden of the Railways on their shoulders, have not had a 50 per cent increase since 1951; they have not had a 26 per cent increase in their salaries since 1955. They do not enjoy free motor transportation; they do not enjoy free passes; they do not get all the other perks that go with an increase. We must not overlook those privileges. May I ask the hon. the Minister whether any reference is made in this report, the report that convinced him that his Railway Commissioners were underpaid, to the privileges which other board members enjoy; privileges which naturally have to be taken into consideration&#x2014;such privileges as subsistence, travelling allowances, etc.? I do not know of any board member who enjoys the same privileges as the Railway Commissioners. Think of the extra allowance that a Railway Commissioner gets; think of the R200 which is now to be paid to the Senior Commissioner as an entertainment allowance. Think of the Gold Pass and the free transportation.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Minister has convinced this House that the increase is justified, neither will he convince the railwaymen of South Africa that it is justified, neither will he convince the public of South Africa that it is justified. The one fundamental fact remains that the Railway Commissioners carry no executive responsibility whatsoever. There are other board members who do carry an executive responsibility but Railway Commissioners carry none whatsoever. The arguments advanced by the hon. the Minister this afternoon carry no weight with me whatsoever.</p>

<p>I want to turn to another item under this Head No. 1. There is a footnote at the bottom which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The additional amount is necessary as a result of the transfer of certain staff to the General Manager&#x2019;s and Accounting offices, and also improved fire protection services.</block>

<p>Could the Minister tell us whether that means a new reorganization of the General Manager&#x2019;s office? There was a general reorganization two or three years ago. It says &#x201C;transfer of certain staff&#x201D;. May I ask the Minister what classes of staff are involved and whether this transfer means an extension of services or a reorganization; are specialists being transferred to assist in the General Manager&#x2019;s office? I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister will give us the details.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I have tried plain English and I have tried plain Afrikaans but still they cannot understand.</p>

<p>Sir, I have explained to hon. members that the Central Government appointed a committee to inquire into the salaries of members of statutory boards. That committee made certain recommendations. I decided to bring the salaries of the Railway Commissioners into line with the salaries of the members of those boards. Apart from that the Railway Commissioners, as a result of increased responsibility and the additional work they have to do, deserved an increase. I held that increase back at the beginning of the year because I <span class="col_1199-1200" refersTo="page_0614"/>knew directly the Railway Commissioners got an increase we would probably have a chain reaction and the members of all the other boards would ask for an increase.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question? Why should there have been a chain reaction? What about a chain reaction in the case of the railwaymen who did not get the same percentage increase as other railwaymen?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member need not worry about the railwaymen. They are on the whole satisfied with what has been done for them. Even in regard to the railway workers&#x2019; wage increases there have been no uniform increases. There has not been a flat percentage increase in the wages and salaries of railwaymen. As a matter of fact, there has been no uniformity. It was based on job evaluation in consultation with the staff themselves. As I have said the increases in the salaries of the Railway Commissioners were justified in view of the increased responsibility that they carry and the additional work they have to do. As I have said, I held that increase back until the Government decided to increase the salaries of other board members. I then thought I would bring them into line. I am solely responsible for that decision. I took that decision with, of course, the concurrence of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>The hon. member challenged me to give one example where a member of a board had received a higher percentage increase over the years than the Railway Commissioners. I accept his challenge. I can quote him a number of cases. In 1910 the Railway Commissioners were among the highest paid members of boards. At that time a railway commissioner received more than heads of departments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They had entirely different functions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Only up to 1912, but they still received the same salary after 1912 when their functions were limited to what they are to-day. They received R4,000 then and heads of departments only received R3,000 in those days. When the Public Service Commission was appointed in 1912 the chairman was awarded a salary of R3,000, that was increased to R3,600 in 1922. The chairman of that commission to-day receives more than the senior Railway Commissioner gets. When the Board of Trade and Industry was appointed in 1924 the chairman of the board was awarded a salary of R3,200 and the Railway Commissioners received R4,000. To-day the chairman of the Board of Trade and Industry receives a higher salary than a Railway Commissioner. The hon. member should not issue challenges when he cannot substantiate his facts.</p>

<p>Is the hon. member still interested in my reply to his other question? Then he had better listen. He wanted to know what the transfer of staff entailed. The staff engaged on Stores Account are being transferred to the Accounting Department. The object is to centralize the accounting work as recommended by the 1938 overseas mission which investigated financial procedures and the Hugo committee on more effective financial control. The purpose is to centralize accounting.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has a very short memory. He spoke for hours telling us about the complete changes he would bring about; how he would do away with Sunday time and overtime. He <span class="col_1201-1202" refersTo="page_0615"/>was going to make the Railways more efficient; he was only going to transport on weekdays, etc. We have had that for hours and hours over the last few years and now the Minister asks &#x201C;What past?&#x201D; The hon. the Minister is like a locomotive which has reached a stage where it needs an overhaul; it has to go to the workshops; it gets choked up. I suggest to the Minister that he prepares his brief before he comes to this House with his Estimates. He should look up what he said in the past.</p>

<p>This amount is made up of such items as &#x201C;maintenance&#x201D;, &#x201C;running expenses&#x201D; and &#x201C;travelling expenses&#x201D;. We are dealing with &#x201C;Running Staff&#x201D; so this money must be paid entirely in the way of wages to those men who are operating the railway system. Then we have an estimate by the Minister of what he will have to pay those men over the 12 months. Now he says he wants nearly R2,000,000 more. And he gives the justification for that as overtime and Sunday time. I want to ask the Minister whether that means that he is going to allow full Sunday time and as much overtime as possible, as long as the railways can carry all the goods that are offering?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) talks about locomotives that must be overhauled, but he is completely off the rails. I have never announced it as a policy that no Sunday time and overtime should be worked. The working of Sunday time and overtime is inevitable. The Railways cannot stop all the trains on a Sunday; the trains must run on Sundays although we are trying to cut overtime to the minimum. That is the policy. We are trying to avoid unnecessary overtime. In 1958-9 when we closed the year with a deficit we eliminated a lot of unnecessary overtime and Sunday time. That is still the policy; there has been no change in policy. Obviously when there is increased traffic to be conveyed more trains must run, more overtime must be worked and more Sunday time must be worked. There has been a considerable increase in traffic during the last 12 months. As a matter of fact, I think the increase in tonnage transported is over 6 per cent for the year.</p>

<p>Of course the estimates are out Can the hon. member predict what is going to happen to our economy 12 months ahead? It has never happened in the past under that Government. I have also quoted the estimates of my United Party predecessors and they were much more out than we have ever been. Hon. members must remember that the Railways are dependent on the state of the economy of the country as a whole and on the amount of traffic that will be offered for conveyance. It is impossible even for a small business to predict precisely to the nearest penny what its financial returns will be 12 months ahead. It never happens in the case of the Railways and it never happens in the case of the Central Government. This additional amount is required for additional appointments; more vacancies had to be filled than we anticipated and more Sunday-time and overtime was worked to cope with the traffic that was offered.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) wanted information on Item 305/1. Mechanically refrigerated trucks are, of course, fitted with refrigerator units when they are purchased. Obviously you will not buy a truck without the unit. This amount is actually required to cover the expenditure incurred in the starting, the running and the general checking of refrigerator units, including the cost of all consumable stores that are debited to this account, but not the cost of the unit itself.</p>

<p>There is one point in respect of which I should like to get some clarity. The Minister has told us that one of the main reasons for this increased expenditure is the fact that he has had to take on new staff, new appointments, and fill vacancies. But as I see the position all the posts covered by heads 277 to 283 are qualified posts. You do not appoint a new driver just out of the blue; he has to have training. You do not appoint a new driver of an electric locomotive out of the blue; he has to go through his training. You do not even appoint new guards out of the blue.</p>

And in regard to the time factor again, because there are only about six weeks left in which to spend the added amounts, whereas the smaller amounts have had to cover a longer period of something like 10 months.

There is for instance an amount of R35,000 in connection with the collision between a passenger train and a Combi van on 31 May 1962 at Koelenhof Station, and R20,000 in connection with the collision of a goods train and a motor-car near Beaufort West Station, on 22 April 1961. Item 336, &#x201C;Damage to Property&#x201D;: This is accounted for as a result mainly of the settlement of a claim by a firm in Dal Josafat; a building was damaged by fire caused by an engine on 26 January 1963. The amount paid was R35,000. It also includes provision for additional amounts to various smaller claimants.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) I may say that an additional amount is required for the hire of cartage vehicles due to increased traffic and more staff on military leave than expected.</p>

<p>Would the hon.

Minister in his opening remarks dealt briefly with this, but the point I want to get clarity on is the question of the proportion falling to &#x201C;immigrants&#x201D;. Do I understand from this that the Railways themselves, through the Tourist Department, had to assume responsibility for certain hotel accommodation provided for immigrants? I can understand the tourist side of it, but where do the immigrants come into Railway Expenditure?</p>

<p>The Tourist Service is in the nature of a travel agency. The Tourist Service makes reservations in hotels, on planes and on ships. Of course the service is reimbursed by those individuals for whom they make the reservations and they get a commission on reservations. They are merely acting as an agency, and whether they are tourists or immigrants, they make the necessary reservations and they get their commission on those reservations and they are reimbursed in respect of the amount of their outlay. But they carry no responsibility for any subsidy to tourists.</p>

<p>It is entirely due to the additional amount required for pensions.

<p>I also want to refer to an item under Account No. 534: &#x201C;(d) Loss on the realization of investments.&#x201D; I know the hon. Minister dealt briefly with that item also in his opening remarks, and as far as I was able to judge from what he said, the loss on realization was due to some extent to a reduction in the rate of interest earned by these investments. But this item clearly reads &#x201C;loss on the realization of investments&#x201D;. That must of course mean that stock invested has been disposed of or sold. I would like to ask the hon. Minister if he can give us some further information as to how that loss is made up, an amount of R352,000. Did it in fact come from the realization of stock, or was it due to a reduction in the rates of interest? I would like to have a little clarity on that. The hon. Minister stated that a portion of it at any rate was due to a reduction in the rates of interest. Could the hon. Minister tell us in his reply what rate of interest the original calculation was based on and what is the rate of interest, the reduced rate of interest, which increased the loss from the original R2,000 to R352,400?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>It has been the policy for some time to sell low interest-bearing stock before maturity and to reinvest in higher interest-bearing stock, and the loss on realization is compensated in a very short time by the higher interest on the higher interest-bearing stock. I can give the hon. member one or two examples. For instance the 3 per cent 1957-66 stock was sold and reinvested in 4&#x00BE; per cent stock; 3 per cent 1957-66 stock, of a nominal value of R1,000,000&#x2014;the cost price was R994,450.47; the date it was realized was 10 January of this year for an amount of R998,155.85. On this particular stock there was a profit of R3,705. It was reinvested in 4&#x00BE; per cent stock. But in the majority of cases there has been a loss, but those losses are compensated in a very short time by the higher interest-bearing stock.</p>

<p>The hon. member is not correct. It used to be a fixed percentage, but a year or two ago I amended the Tourist Corporation Act, and it was decided then that the contribution of the Railways would be decided upon in consultation with the Minister of Finance. Now I have persuaded the Cabinet to accept a fixed contribution of I think R200,000 a year from the Railways. Obviously, the Tourist Corporation&#x2019;s activities continue to expand and more funds are required if they want to do a good job of work. But I felt that the Railways did not get so much benefit from tourists coming to South Africa that it justified a higher contribution than the amount that has now been decided upon. This amount provides for the sum to bring it up to that amount that will be the fixed amount in future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to deal again with certain of the new items. I raised the issue in the debate on the motion to go into Committee. The Minister&#x2019;s reply was to the effect that I must not go off on the wrong track when I discuss these matters. I now hope to put the matter clearly, giving specific examples of items clearly before us here. Let us take Item 6. That is a new item, namely the re-modelling of a yard at Cyfergat, and Item No. 5: Kraankuil&#x2014;Additions and Improvements to Station Yard; or we can take the Eastern Transvaal System, Item 10: Permanent Way Improvements, that is the relocation of an existing loop, shelters, etc. I can mention various other new items under this head. Now surely the inclusion of these new items under this head cannot suddenly have come to the fore during the last two or three months, because some of the new items or new works proposed here are of a permanent nature, resulting obviously from some inquiries or some planning by the Administration. My point is this: If we are expected to objectively discuss these matters, and the amount of money that is placed before us either in the Additional Estimates or in the Brown Book, then whatever capital expenditure is involved, it surely must have a purpose behind it, it must be based on some plans. Now in the past time and time again, we have said to the hon. Minister: You ask us to discuss these matters objectively, but all we really can do is to stand up and put questions in regard to these issues and then to learn what is proposed, with no indication of the planning and the visions that may be held in regard to future railway transportation and the capital requirements therefor. I repeat again that I think it is a bad practice, as we have said repeatedly in the past (and let me admit that there is an improvement in these estimates) to come along in Additional Estimates and include new items of capital expenditure which obviously are not of an immediate or urgent nature and which should for a proper discussion be placed in the Brown Book so that one has the whole picture. Now the hon. Minister asks why we are crying about it now, because we never raised these things although we have an hour or an hour and a half to discuss the Brown Book. But the hon. Minister is to blame for it, not members on this side of the House. The Minister is to blame because if we had here before us the ideas and the thinking and the scheming of the Minister&#x2019;s Planning Council, we would be in a position objectively to discuss these matters. I take it for granted that the Planning Council has had a lot to do with these new improvements, and that this is not a sudden idea, but if the hon. Minister wants to have an objective discussion on the Brown Book, then let the Minister come with the plans and the thinking of his Planning Council and place it before members here so that they can weigh the plans up in terms of the proposed capital expenditure. Then and then only will it be possible to have a constructive and objective debate on the capital works programme of the Railway Administration. But to-day we are again placed in the position of having to stand up parrot-wise on these benches and say to the Minister: &#x201C;What is the reason for the expenditure of this money?&#x201D; Then the Minister says that there was a delay in traffic and an additional yard has to be put in. But when did this delay occur? Did it occur 18 months ago, two years ago, or did it occur in the last three months? When did it become necessary to have additional yards at Kraankuil? Surely consideration has been given to the traffic needs of the past and the requirements of the future, and that must have motivated additional expenditure? That is what we want. We want to be able to assess, and we are incapable of assessing reasonably these new proposed capital expenditures because we just do not know the reasons behind them. I plead again with the hon. Minister. I know he is sympathetic to my viewpoint.</p>

The Minister sees the light inevitably eventually, as we know from past experience. I really believe that it is in the interests of the Railway Administration that this should be done. The vision set by the Railway system for the transportation needs of our country, gives an indication to the railway users, the manufacturers, etc. Once the Minister sees that, he will find that there will be much more constructive criticism offered from these benches, and perhaps even from hon. members on the Government benches. So I plead again that the hon. Minister should give us the basic plan where major expenditure in involved, so that we can objectively assess the capital works programme of the Railway Administration.</p>

<p>I think I am correct in saying that item 25 deals with the deviation of the railway line which was necessitated by the subsidence near Carletonville, something which made the railway line very dangerous. I think that is an expenditure to which no one will object because it is an unforeseen expenditure. As you will also see, Mr. Chairman, it is a new expenditure. I notice that the estimated total cost is R470,900 and that we are only asked to vote R172,500. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether that is <span class="col_1209-1210" refersTo="page_0619"/>the most important part of that total expenditure, whether he regards that as sufficient to make that railway line safe, particularly for passengers in the immediate future and whether the entire scheme, as planned, will be adequate to remedy that very dangerous situation.</p>

<p>I notice that it says that telescopic bench marks will be installed in boreholes. I realize that boreholes must be drilled, although it is not very assuring to know in the first instance not only that there will be boreholes; but that telescopic instruments will also be installed. Could the hon. the Minister perhaps tell us how those telescopic instruments work, whether they locate large holes under the ground, and what is really happening underneath that important railway line.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to be perfectly reasonable to the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant), and I think it is quite clear that he is sincere when he asks that the plans of the Planning Council should be presented to Parliament. I am afraid that even if that is done, Parliament will not be able to discuss these matters objectively or to offer any constructive criticism. Unless you have to do with the running of the Railways from day to day, you cannot even judge whether those plans are justified or not, and the House will not be able to do that. Take for instance the building of a new yard. The Planning Council can say: We find it necessary because there is congestion and it is necessary to expand the yard by building additional lines; it is urgent, there has been congestion and there will be more congestion in future. Now Parliament will not be able to say whether that is justified or not. They will have to accept the position, and Parliament will be unable to offer any constructive criticism. Not that Parliament does not wish to do so, or that hon. members do not have the ability to do it, but merely for the fact that unless you have to do with the day-to-day running of the Railways, you cannot form an objective opinion as to whether a new work is necessary or not. So it will be useless laying those plans before the House. The hon. member knows of course that a certain amount is appropriated every year for &#x201C;unforeseen works&#x201D;, because Parliament realizes that matters arise suddenly that have to be dealt with immediately. For that reason that provision is made so that urgent works can be started and that there is no delay. Most of these new items have already been started and financed under the &#x201C;Unforeseen Works&#x201D; Vote. More than that cannot be done. You cannot wait for 12 months when something has to be done urgently. You cannot wait until Parliament meets, then put it in the Brown Book and ask Parliament to agree to it. In regard to bigger works the Planning Council inquires into the matter and submits recommendations. Those recommendations are submitted to the management and to me for approval. Estimates must be drawn up. That might only be finalized say in April, that is a month after the financial year has stared. You cannot place the items in the Brown Book before you have all the information, before the Estimates have been drawn up and before the Minister has agreed to the new works and before the Planning Council has reported and the management has agreed. That might happen only in November, or it might happen in June for that matter. You cannot wait until the Brown Book is placed before Parliament. Perhaps the work must be started immediately as an urgent work and financed from the &#x201C;Unforeseen Works&#x201D; Vote. Then Parliament is asked to approve of the item in the Additional Estimates, or when the main Estimates come before Parliament. Those are the practical objections to the request made by the hon. member.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) I may tell him that that whole area is of dolomite formation and as a result of that the position will probably never be stable; there will always be a danger of subsidence. That was why it was decided to deviate the railway line from Fochville to Houtkop as an alternative route. As soon as that line has been completed most of the heavy traffic will be conveyed along that line.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Does that also run across a dolomite area?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is why the line runs from Fochville, behind the hill, to Houtkop. I may say that the existing line is safe to a certain extent. The boreholes are sunk and the telescopic instruments lowered and we are immediately warned if any change has taken place in the underground structure. There are big hollows, grottos, under that entire area and it is this erosion that causes the subsidence. The boreholes are sunk at different places along the line with these telescopic instruments inside them so that we are immediately warned of any change in the underground structure so that the necessary steps can be taken. We have already deviated the line and to-day it runs over a fairly safe area where the grottos are far below the surface and where there will possibly not be a subsidence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the right opportunity to debate with the hon. Minister the point that he has just made in reply to the standpoint that I took in regard to these new items, is now. I agree with the hon. Minister that it would be quite ridiculous to think that you should table in this House the plans of the Planning Committee dealing with the odd thousand items in the Brown Book or the particular items of new capital expenditure in detail, unless one knows the running of the Railways. But I am not asking for that. You see, Sir, if you follow the Minister&#x2019;s argument to its logical conclusion, there surely is no point in our even standing up here to ask the reasons for this expenditure.</p>

<p>Yes, but think what would happen to the Railway system under the hon. Minister if there was not the watchful eye of the Opposition at least. But to me there is no logic in the hon. Minister&#x2019;s argument. He says: Unless you know the running of the Railways, the plans of the Planning Committee are quite useless here if I were to put them on the Table of the House. But I remember very clearly the hon. Minister telling us on one occasion that when his Planning Council gets to work they also often consult not only their specialists in the Railway Administration, the technicians and engineers, but they also consult outside sources in regard to future expansion and development, because obviously any major expenditure must be based on the future economic expansion of the country. I fully realize that an item such as Item 25, the construction of the new Frede-rickstad-Midway link, is not an item which can be foreseen so that it can appear in the report of the Planning Council, because certain circumstances arose which necessitated immediate work of this nature. Any reasonable member of this House appreciates that. But would the Minister say to me that if he decided on the doubling of the line between Johannesburg and Durban, for instance, we on these benches could not appreciate it if the report of the Planning Council was tabled envisaging such a development in, say, four years&#x2019; time. I submit, with respect to the Minister, that the argument he presented in reply to me is not logical or reasonable. I still maintain, according to what the Minister himself has said, that much of the debate in this House on Railway matters in past years had no objectivity whatever. I agree with the Minister to a certain extent there, because hon. members can only stand up in parrot fashion and plead to know what the reason is for a particular item, and the Minister reads from a briefing he has got from the General Manager as regards the reasons for the expenditure. But no one in the world will convince me that a lot of these new items in the Additional Estimates have suddenly in the last few weeks become urgent works and therefore they had to be inserted here. If the Minister uses that argument, it must prove to some extent that there is inefficiency in the operation of the Railways and insufficient foresight in respect of future developments on the Railways to meet the economic needs of the country, and we have sufficient proof of that already in the form of the other additional sums we have had to vote for the Railway operations during the last 12 months. I plead again with the Minister not to think that hon. members of this House who tried to take an intelligent interest in the transportation problems of the country, are a lot of parrots who know nothing about these matters whatever, and are incapable of making a reasonable assessment of the capital expenditure the Railway Administration envisages. In fact, I would go further and say this. We know of the ever-increasing interest burden in regard to a great number of these items which are included here. It is my opinion that one of the main reasons for that ever-increasing interest burden is because capital developments on the Railways have come along in this haphazard way without adequate thinking and planning behind it. I suggest to the Minister that even if he thinks hon. members are ignorant, he should at least credit them with the motive of wishing to take an intelligent interest. Having seen the Planning Council&#x2019;s report, hon. members could try to make inquiries in order to appreciate the necessity for these things. I would say to the Minister that if he thinks that hon. members of this House have no knowledge or interest, and are in fact fools when it comes to discussing Railway matters, possibly if he tables the reports of the Planning Council in regard to these new items, there may be people outside in commerce and industry who would like to know what the Railways consider necessary for the future transportation needs of the country to meet the ever-increasing economic expansion. We do not know in this House, and no commercial man or industrialist knows what the Administration has in mind in regard to meeting the future economic needs of South Africa by expanding the Railway system. I would say to the Minister that if he adopts the policy of giving us a Brown Book, with these items adequately planned and the background knowledge of the Planning Council, he will find that we have a far more intelligent and appreciative approach to the problems he has to face as Minister of Transport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Could the Minister just amplify a little the explanation he gave in connection with these figures? I want to deal particularly with Item 61, the Table Bay Docks tanker berth. The footnote says the increased amounts are required to cover expenditure due to progress of work having been greater than anticipated. The additional amount asked for is R600,000. If one reads that in conjunction with the note, it virtually means that the progress on the tanker berth has actually been doubled. The amount originally asked for, for this year was R648,000, and that has been spent, and now another R600,000 is asked for. Can one accept that that is the case? If it is, it is very good news. It would appear that assuming nothing else happens to disturb the estimates, the job will eventually be completed <span class="col_1213-1214" refersTo="page_0621"/>somewhere within the range of the original Estimates, but somewhat earlier.</p>

<p>The other item I wanted to deal with is Item 63, dealing with a number of cranes, etc. provided at Durban Harbour. There also the same footnote applies, that progress on the work has been greater than anticipated. I hope the Minister will clarify that a little more and give us the reasons for it. Is it due to the fact that the work at Durban Harbour has got so far ahead of the programme that this additional sum is required?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to the last item, that money is required for the payment of cranes which have been ordered and which will be delivered this year. We expected delivery next year, but there is to be earlier delivery, and consequently they have to be paid for. With regard to the tanker harbour, as I explained in my opening remarks, the work has been speeded up and more progress has been made than was originally anticipated. We are of course endeavouring to complete the tanker dock to coincide with the completion of the refinery. That is more or less the undertaking that was given, and consequently the work is being speeded up as much as possible. We hope that the tanker dock will be completed at the same time as the refinery.</p>

<p>Are you not moving the first part of your amendment?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to move that separately, because it seems to me that at this stage the Minister may accept the one without the other being attached to it. I have a different attitude in respect to each of the amendments, and therefore I should like to move them separately. If the Minister is disposed to accept them both, then of course I will move them both immediately and together, but I should like to move them separately because they are already two distinct amendments.</p>

<p>The amendment which I now move is to provide that the conditions which are laid down in sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Act should apply in respect of this new ground for taking away a licence. As the Minister is aware, Section 17 provides that the National Transport Commission can cancel licences if certain conditions of the licence have not been complied with or have been contravened. It is now proposed to give an additional ground to the provision for cancelling these licences, and that ground is that a carrier licensee has, in the opinion of the National Transport Commission, committed an act prejudicial to the national security of the Republic. When the Minister spoke on the matter in the Other Place, he made the point that the Commission was concerned with matters of aviation and therefore it ought to be the body which determined whether or not matters relating to aviation have or have not been carried out, and <span class="col_1215-1216" refersTo="page_0622"/>he expressed the opinion that it was not necessary or desirable for a Court to substitute its opinion for that of the Commission. That may be so in the case of the existing powers the Commission has for the cancellation of licences, but here the Minister wishes to provide that anyone who does anything prejudicial to the interests of the Republic should also lose his licence. We quite agree that anyone who does in fact do something like that ought to lose his licence, but we join issue with the Minister&#x2014;or perhaps we do not; I hope we do not&#x2014;on the wording of this clause, in that as it stands at the moment it is not necessary for the Commission to have regard to certain other factors which it has to have regard to when it cancels other licences, and especially that a licence should not be suspended unless it appears to the Commission that the failure has been repeated or has been persisted in or has been deliberate. As things stand at the moment, &#x201C;in the opinion of the Board&#x201D; means just what it says. The Board may form an opinion and there is nothing at all that any licensee can do if the Commission has formed a wrong opinion. The only remedy available to the licensee, as the Bill stands at the moment, is that he is given notice and he may make representations to them. But if it forms an opinion that it is wrong, there is nothing that can be done about it. If this amendment were accepted it would have the effect of bringing the other provisos of sub-section (2) within the purview of any consideration under this new ground. The Minister, when he spoke in the Other Place, indicated that there were certain safeguards, in that <i>mala fides</i> was a ground upon which one could take this decision on review. I think we can take it as read that the Commission is not going to act <i>mala fide.</i> But as the clause stands now, there is nothing that anyone can do about it. When I later move the amendment in relation to the deletion of the words &#x201C;in the opinion of&#x201D;, I think we will further remove the curtain that is drawn by this clause between the licensee who is aggrieved and some sort of review. The Minister, in speaking in the Other Place, seemed to be under the impression that this sub-section applies also in respect of a suspension of a licence in relation to having committed an act prejudicial to the interests of the Republic. I may have misread the Minister, but that is the impression it created. [Interjection.] Well, then I have not misread it, and then I move this amendment with even more confidence. It does no more than to place the additional ground for the removal of the licence on exactly the same premises as where a contravention of a condition of the licence has taken place, and I hope the Minister will accept it.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). Other hon. members will probably do so. I do think, however, that we owe it to the House to say what is happening here. This clause deals with the safety of the State and with aircraft that come over the borders of South Africa. Certain measures to put a stop to that are laid down in this clause. It provides further that a licensee can lose his licence if he does anything that endangers the safety of the State. The hon. member for Durban (North) has moved an amendment which will make this clause incapable of application. I just want to indicate, Sir, what the consequences will be should this amendment be accepted. It will mean that if a person should make himself guilty of an act which endangers the safety of the Republic, action can only be taken against him if he does it repeatedly, if he persists in it, if he commits it deliberately and if it is a serious offence. Now I ask you, Sir, if an act is committed which endangers the safety of the Republic, and the Bill is changed as the hon. member wants to change it, that act which endangers the safety of the State must have been committed repeatedly, it must have been committed deliberately, it must have been committed repeatedly, he must have persisted in it and it must be shown that it was a serious act. In essence it means, therefore, that this entire clause will be absolutely useless and of no value at all. It is more serious than would appear on the face of it. We are dealing with something of which we have experience, we have experience of people who have flown across the Republic from one protectorate to another; people who from time to time have done that, and it is necessary that the law be applied in such a way that the Commission can take action immediately, in the first place&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;that the act is not committed repeatedly. It is necessary for the Commission to have the right to clamp down on that licensee, and it is also important that they should have the power to clamp down on him immediately. That is why the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is totally unacceptable&#x2014;it will take all the bite out of this clause. I wonder what motive is behind the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment? Does he want to make it possible for the sort of abuses which we want to stop to continue and to be committed repeatedly before action can be taken? Does he want the Commission to be rendered useless so that it cannot take action against such a person unless he commits the act repeatedly? Does he want us to have repeated incidents before any steps can be taken? No, it is quite impossible to subscribe to that attitude and to render this clause useless by means of an apparently innocent amendment. It makes the entire clause useless and it opens the door to the very people who must be prevented from doing repeatedly the very thing this clause seeks to stop.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal-Middelburg (Mr. J. W. Rail) is quite correct when he indicates what effect this amendment will have, but the Minister, in the Other Place, indicated that there were already safeguards and that the Opposition there was wrong in assuming that there were no safeguards at all. In the course of explaining what the safeguards were, the Minister read from sub-section (2), including these words which are now to be applied by this amendment. It was because of that speech and that attitude that this amendment was drafted. The Minister refused an amendment to take out the words &#x201C;in the opinion of&#x201D; and put in the word &#x201C;deliberately&#x201D;, which is what the intention of this amendment is, so that before the commission takes action it should be a deliberate act; there should be an element of <i>mens rea.</i> If I have misunderstood the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I have it before me, but perhaps the Minister did not intend this. That is why this amendment appears in this form, and not in the form in which it originally appeared and was rejected by the Minister.</p>

<p>But I would like to move the first amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 36 and in lines 50 and 51, respectively, to omit &#x201C;in the opinion of the Commission&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In moving the amendment to delete the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Commission&#x201D;, we are faced with the position that in respect of any other licence, the Commission must find as a fact, and not as a matter of opinion either that the conditions of the licence have been contravened or have not been complied with. It does not say that the licence can be cancelled if the board is of the opinion that the conditions have not been complied with or have been contravened. If those words are taken out then the test becomes a test of fact, not a test of fancy. The test then is whether or not in fact, as before, as in relation to all the other cancellations under this section, a licensee has done something prejudicial to the interests of the Republic, and if as a matter of fact he has done something then we are quite agreeable that his licence should be suspended. But the test must be what it was before. I am sure the hon. the Minister does not intend that the board should have fancy opinions. Surely it is the Minister&#x2019;s intention that the board should only cancel a licence if in fact some carrier has done an act prejudicial to the safety of the Republic. You see, Sir, it is no good the hon. the Minister saying that they can take it on appeal on the ground of <i>mala fides.</i> We must assume, as I said just now, that the board is not going to act in a <i>mala fide</i> way, but then the hon. the Minister must also appreciate that the board is now dealing with a matter not related to aviation in the sense that it is something falling within the special knowledge of that board, which is the normal reason that one would give for excluding the courts from deciding upon the facts which a specialist body like this is asked to decide upon. In this case it is asked to decide whether something is in fact an act which is prejudicial to the safety of the State. Sir, courts, as you know, comprised of people trained in the law and trained to assess facts and trained to apply the law to it and trained to interpret the Statute and to apply it to the facts, but there is always a right of appeal against the decisions of the courts because courts, although comprised of trained people who are also human can make mistakes, and very serious consequences may ensue as a result of this board exercising its opinion, and if its opinion is wrong, if its opinion is not based upon the facts, then surely the hon. the Minister will have no objection if the board&#x2019;s decision is taken on review to a court, because then it is a matter not as to whether or not they hold an opinion but whether in fact the licensee has done something prejudicial to the State. That is the difference. The hon. the Minister wants to catch those people who have done an act prejudicial to the safety of the State, and there we are a hundred per cent with him. Those who have done such an act must be dealt with, but as this clause reads at the moment it is not whether the person concerned has done such an act but whether a group of people forming the National Transportation Commission are of the opinion that he has done such an act, whether in fact he has or not. I hope the hon. the Minister will indicate to us at this stage whether we should go on arguing our case or whether he is prepared to accept the amendment&#x2014;either the first part or the second part or both.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid I am not prepared to accept the amendment. I agree with my hon. friend the member for Bethal-Middelburg that if I did, it would make this provision completely worthless. What the hon. member apparently does not realize is that the other matters dealt with in Section 17 are matters which are clearly defined. Section 17 provides that the commission may cancel a licence, etc., if the holder has contravened or failed to comply with any provisions of this Act or of any law prescribing measures of safety in connection with the use of aircraft. Those laws are definitely laid down. Then the section goes on to refer to &#x201C;any lawful order or requirement of the Commission under this Act or any condition of his licence&#x201D;. Those conditions are stipulated in the licence and there is no doubt as to what those conditions are. Then, lastly, the section refers to a contravention of the terms of any exemption granted to a holder under the Act. Those are all matters which are clearly defined. If there is a contravention of those <span class="col_1219-1220" refersTo="page_0624"/>regulations or rules the Commission can act in a certain way. But national security cannot be defined. &#x201C;National security&#x201D; is an exceedingly wide term. If &#x201C;national security&#x201D; could be defined within strict limits then there might be some substance in the hon. member&#x2019;s argument.</p>

<p>Is that not all the more reason for accepting the amendment?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>No. &#x201C;National security&#x201D; is a very wide term which cannot be defined. The commission does not form an opinion until it has heard the licensee, but the crux of the matter is that the onus under my amendment is on the licensee to prove that he has not committed an act prejudicial to national security. If I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment the onus will be on the Commission to prove it, and it would be quite impossible for the commission to prove. Let me give the hon. member one illustration: If the pilot of a company flies over a strategic or prohibited area and the licensee appears before the Commission then if I had to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, all the licensee would have to do would be to say, &#x201C;I know nothing about that; my pilot did it on his own&#x201D;, and if the pilot is a licensee he may come before the Commission and say, &#x201C;I was blown off my route&#x201D;. He might have had an ulterior motive in flying over a strategic area and the Commission would not be able to act. That is why it is so essential that the onus should be placed on the licensee, and that the licensee should be held responsible for the actions of all his employees. But let me say this: I know that in theory, especially if you are a clever lawyer, you can always predict anything that may happen under any provision of any Act, but I am a practical man and I am concerned with what happens in practice. The hon. member should know that the Commission acts neither capriciously nor frivolously nor irresponsibly &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and what will happen in practice is this: If any licensee is suspected of having committed an act prejudicial to national security he will have to appear before the Commission; he will be given a full opportunity in terms of Section 17 (2) to state his case, and only after hearing the licensee the Commission will form an opinion and act on that opinion, and the Commission may then decide to cancel his licence. The Commission is comprised of a responsible body of men, and I do not for a moment believe that they would act irresponsibly. I do not think that they are vindictive. I do not think that they have any desire to act unjustly towards any licensee, just as I have no desire to act unjustly towards anybody.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is possible that they may make a mistake; anybody can make a mistake but I do not think they will make a mistake. I do not think they will act frivolously or irresponsibly and, after all, if a licensee has a reasonably explanation and if apart from the explanation he can prove that he is completely innocent of the act of which he is accused, surely the Commission will not act so unreasonably as to cancel his licence. I am concerned with the practical application of this provision. Anything can happen in theory. As a matter of fact I know that you do not have to study constitutional law to know that Parliament can pass a law which provides that the firstborn in every family must be killed. In theory Parliament can do so but in practice things of that kind never happen. As I have said, if I accepted the hon. members amendment the whole provision would be completely worthless.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I also wish to approach this subject from the same point of view as the hon. the Minister and that is from the practical point of view and not from any theoretical point of view. The practical point of view&#x2014;and I am surprised that the hon. member for Bethal-Middelburg did not support this point of view&#x2014;is the point of view of those who are actively and actually concerned with the problems of flying. The hon. the Minister of Transport has put to the House the case of a person who acts in a way which is prejudicial to the safety of South Africa, and because that is a nice emotional issue which he can use to get people worked up, he is taking a hatchet and cutting through the whole fabric of the entrenched rights of licensees in terms of the existing legislation. He is not only dealing in this Bill with the question of danger to South Africa, and that is the point that I want to put from the practical point of view. The hon. the Minister is aware that there are four bodies in South Africa which are concerned with civil aviation. One is the Civil Aviation Association, one is the Owners&#x2019; and Pilots&#x2019; Association: then there is the Federated Chamber of Industries and the Associated Chambers of Commerce. These are the four bodies which are concerned in practice, not in legal theory, not in National Transport Commission theory, not in ministerial theory, with the day-to-day practice of flying aeroplanes, and all four have unanimously and very strongly objected to this one clause in this Bill. Equally all four of those bodies have given unanimous support to the Minister in his desire to prevent any act which may endanger the safety of South Africa. They are prepared to accept the most drastic provision against a person who endangers the safety of South Africa. All they ask is that it shall be an act which can be proven or disproved by the accused. Under <span class="col_1221-1222" refersTo="page_0625"/>the present proposed amendment, however, that person has no defence in practice. If he is charged with having endangered the safety of South Africa, which is an emotional issue, he has no recourse to law to prove on the basis of fact that he has not committed an offence. In seeking to close one loophole the Minister has in fact gone far beyond that. Even if he is not prepared to remove the words &#x201C;in the opinion of&#x201D; which are the crucial words, I want to ask him whether he will not at least remove the provision in the proposed amendment which makes an offence against any law relating to aviation, the cause for the loss of one&#x2019;s licence. The proposal in Clause 5 (b) is to substitute in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) for the words following the word &#x201C;law&#x201D; the words &#x201C;relating to aviation; or&#x201D;. That proposal changes the whole sense of the section which it is proposed to amend, and which at the moment refers only to offences relating to safety. If this proposal is passed as it stands it means that the licensee may lose his licence for every single offence under the Customs Act, for example. A pilot or any member of an aircraft crew committing a minor offence against the Customs Act or a minor offence against any Act relating to aviation&#x2014;and the Customs Act relates to aviation&#x2014;can endanger the licence of the licensee. The same applies to the Immigration Act. The offence in question may be completely innocent. The pilot may be bringing in a book which has been banned but he offends against an Act which relates to aviation in that it controls the entry of goods by air. A person bringing in a banned book which may be a classic and which he did not know had been banned, may cause the licence of a whole company to be cancelled.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am not. As it is proposed to be amended Section 17 (1) (a) will now read: &#x201C;Any provision of this Act or of any law relating to aviation.&#x201D; That law which I have mentioned, dealing with importation of goods or of people, relates to aviation in so far as aviators are the carriers. That is the opinion of all these bodies who have gone into the matter. If I am wrong I hope the hon. the Minister will tell me so. But even if I am wrong in regard to the Customs Act, I am correct in regard to all the actual laws relating to flying, and any technical contravention of any law relating to flying itself, may mean the loss of a licence to the whole company. How on earth can the owner of a company be held responsible for every minor infringement by every member of his staff? The law as it stands has been tested, and if the Minister wants to change it I ask him to give us his reasons. He has given us no reason whatsoever why he wants to change that provision relating to safety laws and turn them into &#x201C;any law relating to aviation&#x201D;. If the Minister wants to change that, then surely there must be a reason, and that reason cannot be related to the question of endangering the safety of the State.</p>

<p>I put that one aspect to the hon. the Minister, and finally I want to add my support to the plea of the hon. member for Durban (North) to protect the rights of persons who through no fault of their own have their livelihood endangered and placed in jeopardy by the exercise of &#x201C;the opinion&#x201D; of a commission which might very well make a mistake&#x2014;a mere opinion which can be influenced by emotion rather than fact. When you are dealing with an emotional issue it is quite easy for a person to come to a decision&#x2014;quite unconsciously; I do not say <i>mala fide</i>&#x2014;which could be patently unfair, and I plead with the hon. the Minister to accept the deletion at least of the words &#x201C;in the opinion of&#x201D;. If he is not prepared to accept the second part of the amendment, even that is not so serious, but the words &#x201C;in the opinion of&#x201D; relate not only, as the Minister said, to the question of endangering the safety of the Republic but to every one of these offences. The Minister himself said five minutes ago that all the other offences were matters of fact but that the question of safety of the Republic was a matter of opinion. This Bill does not say that. This Bill says that from now on it will be a matter of opinion whether a person commits any of the other offences provided for here because the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the commission&#x201D; apply to every single one of the four sub-sections of this section of the Act. &#x201C;In the opinion of the Commission&#x201D; now applies to all four paragraphs of sub-section (1) of Section 17, that is to say &#x201C;any provision of this Act&#x201D;, &#x201C;any lawful order or requirement of the commission&#x201D;, &#x201C;any condition of his licence&#x201D; and &#x201C;the terms of any exemption&#x201D;. The Minister a moment ago tried to create the impression that those were matters of fact and that it was only the question of the safety of the Republic which was a matter of opinion. Sir, I challenge that. &#x201C;In the opinion of the Commission,&#x201D; as it stands here, relates to all these offences. Therefore I support the plea of the hon. member for Durban (North) and I also add my plea in regard to the question of safety instead of &#x201C;all other laws relating to aviation&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In regard to the last point made by the hon. member who has just sat down, if he refers it to his colleague behind him he will be able to correct him. &#x201C;The opinion of the Commission&#x201D; relates to one particular matter only and that is the safety of the State. In regard to sub-paragraph (b), the hon. member objects to the insertion of the words &#x201C;relating to aviation&#x201D;, and he wanted to know the reason for the insertion of those words. I want to set his mind at rest immediately. There is only one other law relating to aviation that we are concerned with here, and that is Act 74 of 1962, the Aviation Act. In connection with the discussions of the Civil Aviation Advisory Committee, there was only one member who <span class="col_1223-1224" refersTo="page_0626"/>raised an objection to this particular provision and he did not even get a seconder.</p>

<p>There was no division. As I have said, there was one member who objected to this particular amendment and who did not even get a seconder. That is what happened; so apparently the hon. member has received wrong information. There was a division of opinion in regard to the other matter raised by his colleague, the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell), but in regard to this particular amendment only one member raised the matter. He objected and he did not even get a seconder. The reason for this amendment is the following: As a matter of fact I gave the reasons by way of interjection while the hon. member was speaking yesterday afternoon. The reason is that certain regulations were promulgated last year in regard to the over-flying of South African territory&#x2014;over-flying from one Protectorate to the other&#x2014;and those regulations provided that any plane flying from a Protectorate is compelled to land at a designated aerodrome in South Africa before he can continue his flight to the other Protectorate. Those regulations were promulgated under Act 74 of 1962, not under this Act, and that is why it is necessary to amend this Act in order to give the necessary authority to the commission to act if there is a contravention of those regulations. That is the reason for this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister, as he correctly states, made that interjection yesterday. But if he inserts into the law as it now stands an amendment that any person who endangers the safety of the State, who acts in a way which is prejudicial to the safety of the State, shall lose his licence, that will be the law anyway; why then repeat it? In other words, it is not only the act which is prejudicial to South Africa which he is worrying about but the offence of not carrying out the regulations. He says that he requires this amendment to deal with the person who does not carry out the regulations which provides that he must land at a particular airfield. That is his reason. But if that should happen in all innocence, is the firm still to lose its licence, if the safety of the Republic is not endangered?</p>

<p>Yes, they are two separate matters and the Minister is trying to link the two together. One is the safety of South Africa, and that is covered by the amendment with which nobody has quarrelled. But in order to enable the Minister to protect South Africa he now wants blanket powers to cover every single act of commission or omission under any law. The Minister went on to refer me to my colleague in regard to the question as to whether everyone of these aspects became a matter of opinion. The words &#x201C;in the opinion of the Commission committed any act prejudicial to the national security of the Republic or has&#x201D; are proposed to be inserted in sub-section (1) after the word &#x201C;has&#x201D;. There is no comma after the word &#x201C;Republic&#x201D;; there is no punctuation. The section, as amended, will then read: &#x201C;The commission may &#x2026; if the holder has in the opinion of the Commission committed any act prejudicial to the national security of the Republic or has failed to comply with &#x2026;&#x201D; Sir, has the Minister had legal advice on this or is he merely telling the House that from a practical point of view this does not apply, because as I read it, and in the opinion of the people concerned with flying, the &#x201C;opinion of the Commission&#x201D; will apply to all aspects of all offences. It is linked completely to the opinion of the Commission. It now says that any person who in the opinion of the Commission has committed an act or has contravened or failed to comply with any provision of this Act, etc. I ask the hon. the Minister to look again at the object of that provision in the proposed amendment. I am certain that the hon. the Minister will find that it is not as clear as he may wish. Now, in regard to the Minister&#x2019;s claim with regard to the point which I made that there is only one person who raised an objection to the proposed amendment, he will not deny that there was an even division of opinion on an overriding clause protecting persons against all the effects of all these issues. There was a request for a right of appeal to the courts.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know if the minutes of this body are confidential; I know that the view of the bodies represented have been put to me, and what I have put to the Minister is that four of the bodies represented have pressed for this, and if four of the bodies have unanimously pressed for this, then that must constitute half the Commission. I have no knowledge as to what happened on the Commission but I do know that four of the bodies represented were opposed to these provisions of Clause 5, and those bodies have indicated their opposition. There is division therefore. <span class="col_1225-1226" refersTo="page_0627"/>because they are the bodies represented. The hon. member is trying to play a game to divert attention from the real issue to a question of breach of privilege. There is no law or no rule or no convention which says that a body, because it has a representative on another body, cannot express its opinion directly as an organization. That is what they have done; they have represented their views as an organization. But, Sir, to come back to this point, the hon. the Minister is aware that this is creating concern; that every single organization representing private flying is concerned with this matter. Why does he not take some notice of this view to give them at least some sort of security? There is no attempt whatsoever to prevent action being taken against saboteurs, against traitors, against fifth columnists or against persons acting against the interests of the State. There is no attempt to protect them. The attempt which is being made is to protect the innocent person who through no fault of his own, without any knowledge of the provision, may lose his licence. May I then put this point to the Minister: Would he consider making the commission of an offence a cause for the loss of the licence only if it is shown that the owner, or licensee, had knowledge of the offence? Is the Minister not even prepared to go so far?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister picks out one of the only two laws, as far as I am aware, where that provision is incorporated in the law, but the Minister knows that the Liquor Act was a special case. At the time the Liquor Act was passed, liquor was a restricted, confined commodity which was kept away from seven-eights of the population. That provision was brought in unhappily as a special and emergency measure, and the Minister quotes that Act now as giving him the right to apply that principle in every aspect of life. Are we then going to have that principle applying to every offence which can, be committed? Are you going to say that any person who is an employee who commits an offence in any field against any law, is going to make the owner or proprietor of the company liable for punishment? If a taxi driver has an accident, is the whole taxi company going to lose its licence to operate taxi&#x2019;s? If you have one engine driver on the S.A. Railways getting drunk and committing an offence, is the Railway Administration going to be stopped from running trains? Here we have the principle that the head of a body or organization can be made liable for an offence of any sort committed by its employees. Where that relates to the safety of aircraft or of the State, it is a different matter because there lives are at stake, but where the offence may have been innocently committed I believe that the Minister is following a course which is completely against the traditions of all Governments in this country.</p>

<p>It appears to me, firstly, that this is a fight between legal theory and practice. The hon. the Minister has fold us that he was a practical person and the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has also stated that he approached the matter from a practical angle. But I think the Minister is less inclined to agree with him than with the hon. member who has moved the amendment. In the first instance I should like to point out that the body which issues the licence is the Commission. I think it will be a sound principle if the body which issued the licence also had the unrestricted right to cancel that licence.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, no. The hon. member must not look for trouble. If the hon. member wishes to draw the conclusion that this commission, a responsible commission such as this, will withdraw a licence without any reason whatsoever, he is talking nonsense. I said it must have the right but most certainly not without reason. Had the hon. member ever been present at a sitting of the National Transport Commission he would have known that every party is given the fullest opportunity, not only of stating his case, but he is also given the opportunity of submitting factual evidence; he is also given the opportunity of getting an attorney or an advocate to represent him. After all the evidence has been heard the Commission decides, just as in the case of any other body, on the facts.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) spoke as though the Commission was of necessity obliged to cancel a licence or to suspend it when an offence of any nature had been committed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they have the power. But the way you put it it looks as if, when the most insignificant little crime has been committed, it would be found to have been prejudicial to the safety of the State and that he must of necessity lose his licence. That is not so. Surely we must accept, and hon. members opposite must accept with us, that this is a responsible body. Clause 17 does not say it &#x201C;must&#x201D;; it says it &#x201C;may&#x201D;. In other words, that body has discretionary powers. If for instance, a minor offence has been committed, an offence of which the person actually knew, but it was not of a serious nature, it does not mean that the Commission must of necessity cancel or suspend that licence. It is not part of the amendment that has been moved, Sir, but the hon. member for Durban (Point) also said that it should be provided in this clause that the licensee should know about the contravention. Why does the hon. member ask that? Then he complains when the hon. the Minister refers to the Liquor Act. Why does he ask that? It is in line with our legal principles for the licensee, in such a case, to be <span class="col_1227-1228" refersTo="page_0628"/>responsible for the acts of his employee when the latter is in the employ of the licensee. That is the reason why he asks that.</p>

<p>Let me just refer to the principles governing agencies, Mr. Chairman. I read from &#x201C;The Law of Agency in South Africa&#x201D;. They say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every act of the agent done professedly on the principal&#x2019;s behalf and falling in the scope of the agent&#x2019;s actual authority, expressed or implied, is binding on the principal in respect of third parties dealing with the agent in good faith, even though the agent was acting not on the principal&#x2019;s but fraudently on his own behalf.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. L. MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the &#x201C;actual authority&#x201D; is not what the man is doing, but the work in connection with which he commits the act. Sir, surely these are accepted legal principles. And it is because this is the position that that hon. member asks that it should be changed. Had it not been so, surely he would not have asked for it to be changed. He asks for the change because he wants to open the door for a licensee to have a ready excuse when the person who expressly, on his instruction, committed an offence, an offence which entitles the Commission to cancel or to suspend the licence.</p>

<p>If we were to deprive the Commission of the right to express an opinion I think we would be placing the responsibility of proving that such an act had actually been committed on the shoulders of the Commission. I want to emphasize that the hon. member was wrong when he said it could find a man guilty simply in theory. That is not what happens, Mr. Chairman. Why do we have sub-section (2) then? Sub-section (2) expressly makes it obligatory for the Commission to notify such a person, so that he can appear before the Commission, either in person or through his attorney or his advocate, to state his case. In other words, the Commission is under an obligation to give that person an opportunity of stating his case, not only to argue his case, but to submit factual evidence. Only when the factual evidence has been submitted to the Commission will the Commission, the same body that issued the licence, after consideration of the factual evidence, decide whether in its opinion there has been a contravention.</p>

<p>I do not even wish to talk about the second part, the inclusion of that additional paragraph. I think it is completely wrong to expect that such an act prejudicial to the safety of the State must have been committed repeatedly, deliberately and persistently before a licence can be cancelled. I do not think the hon. member is serious when he asks for that.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) is obviously a lawyer. You cannot dismiss this question of agency as he has done. He quoted from Scoble on &#x201C;Evidence&#x201D;. I do not think that was a very lofty start, but be that as it may. The hon. member talks about the responsibility of the principal for his agents and his servants. But surely the hon. member knows that one of the great questions on which opinion is always so divided is the question of whether or not your agent is doing something that he was instructed to do or whether the agent or the servant is out on a frolic of his own. That was precisely what the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) was referring to, not the agent or the servant in the scope of his normal employment, but the agent or the servant who goes out on a frolic of his own. He goes out and he does something quite unknown to the principal for which the principal can in no way be held responsible. But now he is to be responsible; more than responsible, Sir, now he is to lose his licence, his livelihood, if something like that were to happen. What remedy has he got? The hon. member for Ceres says he has the opportunity to appear before the board. Yes, he has. The hon. member also pointed out that he has the chance of taking his attorney with him. Yes, he has. And what is his attorney going to do? He is going to lead evidence. What evidence? The evidence of facts. The attorney is probably also brought in because some law may be involved; there may be certain phrases in the Act that have to be interpreted. Of what use is this going to be, Mr. Chairman, for him to bring his attorney when, in the end, the decision is not going to be based on fact. It is not going to be related to the evidence; it is not going to be related to the law or to the submissions that are made; it is going to be based on an opinion held by the Transport Commission. I want the hon. member for Ceres to answer this; he is quite capable of answering this: Why are the words &#x201C;in the opinion of&#x201D; put in? Why is it not left &#x201C;that if the commission finds &#x2026;&#x201D;? Why are those words put in? The hon. the Minister has not answered that. All the hon. the Minister said was that as the Act stood at the moment it was not necessary to have &#x201C;in the opinion of&#x201D; in because they were dealing with a contravention of a licence which was a matter, I think he said, which was clearly defined, therefore it was easy to determine whether, as a matter of fact, the licence had been contravened or not. Surely, if the hon. the Minister is right, if &#x201C;national security&#x201D; is a term which is difficult to define, and I must agree with him on that, then there are circumstances under which it is very hard to determine whether an act is prejudicial to the national security. But if that is so, then surely that is even more reason why this should be tied down a bit. Surely this gives rise to all sorts of capricious thoughts in the minds of people who are not bound to decide the case according to the facts. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reasons for <span class="col_1229-1230" refersTo="page_0629"/>rejecting the first part of the amendment are in themselves the reasons why this amendment should be accepted.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that the onus was on these people. This confirms my worst thoughts about it, Sir. I do not see any provisions relating to the onus in this case. The National Transport Commission may suspend a licence if, in its opinion, an act prejudicial to the security of the State has been committed. It now has purely an opinion. It does not throw the onus on the licensee in the ordinary sense of the word. Even in the worse sense of the word it does not throw the onus on the licensee. Here he is quite incapable of proving as a fact that he did not commit an act prejudicial to the safety of the State. What can he do about it, Sir? He can prove that he did not do it and where does that get him? Nowhere at all. Surely, Sir, the Minister does not believe that we suggested from this side of the House that the National Transport Commission was going to be capricious or frivolous. I believe they are not going to be and I do not think anybody has suggested that they were going to be. And I do not believe that, in 1949 when the principal Act was passed, anyone suggested that they would act capriciously or frivolously. But nevertheless they provided in Section 17 (2) that no licence should be revoked unless the act complained of was deliberate and serious.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is right; that is what I am referring to. Otherwise why was it put in? This is a protection against such capricious act on the part of the National Transport Commission. In other words, Sir, the legislature in 1949 stated that although you have these powers you may not exercise your discretion unless you are satisfied that, as a fact, it was repeated and persistent or deliberate and serious. Now, Sir, this is not a case of being capricious or of being frivolous, this is a case of making a genuine mistake of fact. Let me say to the hon. the Minister that you can get a judgment from the Supreme Court, from a judge, you can take it on appeal and get the judgment reversed; you can take it on appeal and get a different decision by two to one; you can take it further on appeal and get the first judgment upheld by two to three. This has often happened, Sir. In other words, even in such high echelons of reason of thought, of impartial weighing of facts, you get mistakes. You get mistakes with one big difference: Here the mistake, once made, deprives the man forever of his livelihood. He can never come back again and do anything about it. All he can do is go to the court and say: &#x201C;This board acted capriciously or acted frivolously or acted <i>mala fides.</i> If they had acted capriciously or frivolously he could in any event take them on review as the Bill stands. I ask the Minister to give this matter some more consideration, if only in respect of the first part of the amendment. If only the Minister can explain to us why it is that he must now have the words &#x201C;in the opinion of&#x201D;. Why must this now become a matter of caprice? Why must this become a matter of fancy? Why cannot the hon. the Minister accept that first part of the amendment?</p>

I find, in regard to these matters, that this is the only effective way of doing it. The National Transport Commission is the licensing authority. It should also have the right to cancel a licence. If the man has committed any other offence the courts of law are there to deal with him; this deals only with his licence.

<p>But he is not the innocent owner. It is not only that these provisions should be introduced to punish guilty persons but they should also act as a deterrent. When the owners of licensed aircraft know that there is such a provision on the Statute Book and that their licences can be cancelled in this way they will be doubly careful to see that their employees do not do anything to prejudice the national security. This is a deterrent as well as a provision that can be acted upon. That is why it is essential to retain it in its present form. It is the only possible way of dealing with these culprits.

<p>There is one point on which I agree with the hon. the Minister; and that is that we should have no sympathy with people who endanger the safety of the State. The purpose of our amendment is not to protect the person who endangers the safety of the State. It is to protect the people who are innocent, those people who may be the subject of a miscarriage of justice. I really rose, Sir, to protest, mildly but emphatically, against the suggestion that comes again and again from the Minister in his argument that, because we want an amendment that will make an appeal from the decision of the National Transport Commission possible, we are suggesting that the Commission consists of irresponsible men and of men with less character. That is not the sort of argument we expect from the hon. the Minister, Sir.

There can only be an appeal if the Commission had acted <i>mala fides</i> or neglected its duty or if it had been capricious, etc. The purpose of our amendment is clearly to bring this new provision of the law in line with the existing provisions, so that there will be an appeal based on the facts.

<p>I hope I shall be able to disabuse the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind on that. If that statement is correct then our magistrates and Judges are useless, because there is an appeal from lower courts to higher courts, but that is not a reflection on the ability or the efficiency of those bodies. We are dealing with human institutions, Sir, and mistakes happen. The Minister of our Republican State must know it is important for all of us to prevent miscarriages of justice; we are jealous of the administration of justice in this country. That is the object of our amendment. It is our desire to improve the clause. It may be a long chance; it may not happen. But if a mistake is made in one case there will be a serious miscarriage of justice of which neither the Minister nor us would like to be guilty. We want to give him an opportunity of making that impossible. I am particularly enamoured of the second half of this amendment which will make offences committed to the prejudice of the State also subject to the existing safeguards in Section 17 (2). One of my hon. friends over there seemed to indicate that we wanted the act to be both repeated and deliberate or serious. That is not so. The safeguard merely says that it must appear to the Commission that the offence must be either repeated or serious and deliberate. Surely, Sir, that is a safeguard which the Minister can give to these people; surely he can agree that in regard to acts affecting the safety of the State they should be serious. In most instances they will be serious from their definition. Why deny those people safeguards which his predecessors saw fit to put into the law? We are trying to help the Minister to prevent miscarriages of justice. I plead with the hon. the Minister to consider this matter.

<p>The main point made seems to be that there is no recourse to the courts of law. If the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the <span class="col_1233-1234" refersTo="page_0631"/>Commission&#x201D; are left out it merely means that this hearing by the Commission is changed into a full trial. As the Opposition knows in a trial of this nature, where the safety of the State is in issue, it very often takes months, even years, before a decision is arrived at. What is to happen in the meantime? That is the main point. I think that is the difficulty which faces the hon. the Minister. You cannot wait until the trial is over and judgment given in a matter of this nature. Therefore there must be a body to act in the meantime. This commission must be there to decide in the meantime, and in certain circumstances, only to suspend the licence. You need a certain body to act. You either approach the Commission which issued the licence or you must create a body or person which can act in the meantime in a case of emergency. So you must either give the Minister of Justice the power in a special Act, or give the Minister of Transport the power in a certain Act in order to enable him to suspend a licence, in the case of emergency, where the safety of the State is being endangered. We now introduce a Bill which proposes that a commission, consisting of, I think, seven people, of whom some are jurists, to decide whether, in their opinion, it is necessary to suspend or otherwise deal with a licence. The Opposition has failed to take notice, as the hon. the Minister has said, of the critical times in which we are living. Mr. Chairman, it must be admitted that in certain exceptional cases such steps are necessary, and here we have an excellent proposal that the commission which deals with the licences, should be the body to act.

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to make a final plea to the hon. the Minister, and I wish in particular to refer to two matters and wish to express the hope that the hon. Minister will be prepared to consider amendments in the Other Place in respect of these two matters. The first provision to which I refer is the form of appeal provided in this Bill. There is an appeal to a board which consists of a judicial officer and two persons sitting with him who would not necessarily have legal qualifications. Sir, I can give the hon. Minister an example to show that a board of this sort can make mistakes, and it is because of that that this request is being made. The case I refer to is a case that came before the Transvaal Water Court. Under the Transvaal law, as it stood at that time, there was an appeal to a board consisting of a Judge plus an engineer assessor and a lay assessor. In the particular case the engineer assessor and the lay assessor held one view of the law and the Judge held another view of the law. The Judge had to dissent from the views expressed by his two colleagues on a point of law. The matter was taken on appeal, and on appeal it was held that the two laymen were correct, and that the Judge was wrong, but because there was an appeal allowed to a higher court it was possible to test the matter. It was considered a matter of course that the Judge&#x2019;s views on the law would be upheld, but he was held to be wrong. It is for that reason that I do most sincerely hope that the hon. Minister will reconsider this question. He can very easily put it right in the Other Place.</p>

<p>But the principal point which I wish to raise is the fact that the Minister has removed by a clause in this Bill the position which applies at the present time in regard to the patenting of plants. They are now plant breeders&#x2019; rights, but those plant breeders&#x2019; rights are confined to breeding within the country, and for my part I am convinced that the legislation to be sound should include provision for registration elsewhere. It is true that one day there may be an international convention. It is also true that the world is moving in the direction of plant breeders&#x2019; rights and not patent rights as at the present time exist in this country. I want in this regard to express my complete disagreement with the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan), the statement which he made at an earlier stage, in which he said that it is said that we will not be able to get these plants from overseas because of the position, but one can always get hold of them. I hope that we in this country are not prepared to sink so low as to get hold of plants because they are not patented in this country because of the state of our law, and to ignore rights which have been granted in other countries as patent rights. I can only interpret the hon. member&#x2019;s <span class="col_1237-1238" refersTo="page_0633"/>speech in that way that he is prepared to see that our country ignores the rights of persons. Very large sums of money may be at stake. I have in my hand a catalogue of a great American firm which has played a tremendously important part in the breeding of plants, and they of course also buy rights in respect of plants, and the hon. Minister perhaps knows that two of the varieties of apples for which the patent rights are held by this firm are at present in this country in quarantine, as it is quite proper that they should be.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl also raised the question that the importation of plants can result in diseases being imported into our soil. I have great confidence in our Agricultural Department, and I am convinced that the steps that they take in respect of plants which they quarantine when they come into this country are such that there is no possibility of an infection of our soil with some of the very dangerous diseases from other countries, In this particular case the firm which is concerned state in their catalogue, so it is public knowledge, that they actually bought the original plants which appeared in America in the one case for the sum of &#x0024;51,000 and in the other case for the sum of &#x0024;25,000. It is very obvious that the development of a new plant, especially one that is used in the commercial field, for which there is no provision here, can be something of immense financial value because of its great value to mankind.</p>

<p>This Bill although unquestionably it has some good provisions, is definitely defective in these respects, and I do hope that the hon. Minister on further reflection will at a very early date take steps to ensure that these rights which I have referred to are protected, as I for one believe they should be.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to object strongly to the insinuation made by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). He said that he hoped that we would not sink so low as to try to get plant material from abroad in the way I suggested. Far be it from me to try to suggest that we should attempt to get plant material in the low manner indicated by the hon. member. I stated clearly that our Department of Agriculture, through the agreements it has with the Departments of Agriculture of overseas countries, could obtain that material quite legally and on a completely honourable basis. It certainly does not behave the hon. member to imply that we want to obtain that material in a low manner. No, we can in fact obtain that plant material through the agency of our Department of Agriculture from another Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>In regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s allegation that he evidently has much more confidence in our Division of Plant Control and the quarantine applied by them than I have, and that they will in fact be able to keep out plant diseases, I just once again want to refer the hon. member to the example I mentioned in my second-reading speech of two varieties of grapes which we imported in 1952 and which for two years were not only kept in the quarantine station, but inside the hothouses of that experimental farm. Only after they had been planted out in another district did there appear to be a latent virus disease in those grapes, a disease which never showed itself during those two years of quarantine. It is not so impossible for a disease to reveal itself later. But I do not blame the hon. member there. I take it that this is a case of ignorance rather than of obstinacy.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>At the end of this third-reading debate I want to take the opportunity also to thank hon. members of the Opposition for the general support this Bill has enjoyed in principle, although we differed mainly on two points.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) has now quoted an example to show that the provision made here amounts to this, that not all the people serving on the board of appeal will be lawyers, but that there will be a lawyer assisted by an official of the Department and someone else who has special knowledge in connection with this matter or of a certain type of plant. Then the hon. member said that the Water Court was also constituted in that way, but that a case could go to appeal from that court. Now peculiarly enough, the people who were not lawyers were correct, and their standpoint was upheld by the Supreme Court. I think that the hon. member is thereby supporting the standpoint of the Department, and that we may perhaps make even more use of the common sense and the decision of people who are experts in a particular sphere, although they need not necessarily be lawyers.</p>

<p>I think this matter has been so thoroughly discussed on both sides of the House that it is not necessary for me to say much more. I did not see my way clear to amend the Bill quite in the way hon. member of the Opposition wanted, but I am glad that in general they agree with the Bill.</p>

<p>I may just say that the aspect of disease played a very small role in the consideration as to whether we should or should not grant plant breeders&#x2019; rights in the Republic in respect of plants coming from outside the Republic. Because as the hon. member for Paarl correctly said, it is not improbable that a trace of disease in a plant, particularly one developed abroad, which may have been latent and which was not evident before or while it was in quarantine, may later reveal itself to such an extent, as has already happened, that not only had we to prohibit its propagation, but, as in the case of the grapes to which the hon. member referred, we simply, in co-operation with the farmers, had to have those vines destroyed due to the great danger of the spread of an infectious disease which could have infected our vineyards generally. <span class="col_1239-1240" refersTo="page_0634"/>Therefore the aspect of disease is reasonably controlled by the quarantine service of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. The question was whether it was so essential and whether we were going to lose anything by excluding plants from abroad. Will we perhaps not gain more, and will we perhaps not encourage our own breeders more, by granting rights and privileges here, whereas they would perhaps otherwise be put in a less competitive position as against imported plants which will immediately be granted breeders&#x2019; rights here? I am convinced that the Bill will have the desired effect and that it will not be necessary to amend it on account of our not being able to get plants from abroad, but if it is found that we cannot import plants in the proper legal manner, I shall be the first to come to this House to amend it.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we opposed the second reading of this Bill and advanced our arguments for doing so. We opposed it in the first place because whilst we were quite ready to continue to extend the powers the Government now has for controlling prices for so long as it seems to be necessary, we were not prepared to subscribe to a policy which places price control on the Statute Book as a permanent measure. We opposed it because, even assuming that the Government was justified in proceeding with this Bill, it was not justified in doing so without giving deeply interested parties an opportunity to consider the Bill and to make their representations and express their views. We know that the views of organized commerce and industry were only actually published after the second reading had been completed, simply because they had not had time to express their views before. That seems to us a most unsatisfactory state of affairs and one for which there is really no explanation. Our third reason for objecting to the Bill was that even if it was necessary to place such a Bill on the Statute Book, the measure from which it stemmed almost word for word was drawn up almost 20 years ago, and conditions then and now are different in many respects. For that reason, again assuming that it was justifiable to legislate, the war measure upon which the Bill is based should have been carefully scrutinized and examined by all concerned before legislation was introduced. Well, none of those arguments had any effect on the Government. In the Committee Stage we pointed out one or two anomalies, as we thought they were, anomalies to the extent that in legislation to-day they should not be included in the Bill, and the Minister said that he was impressed by at least two of our objections and that he would endeavour to have those amendments redrafted and accepted in the Other Place, but whether that will be done or not we do not know. Then we also logically endeavoured to get the Minister to agree, seeing that he was determined to place the Bill on the Statute Book, to limit its functioning to two years and to provide that he would have to come back to this House if he wished to have it for a further period, but of course that did not suit the Minister at all. He claimed that this was just an enabling measure and that we need not worry about it; it would be handled very carefully, with kid gloves, and nobody need be alarmed. He tried to soothe us with gentle words, which cut no ice with me. I know the Minister and his views as to how a country should be run only too well. To me it is quite clear that the Minister is simply taking this opportunity to place the whole country in yet another respect at the mercy of a Government Department and its officials. We believe that this is not good government and that it is a step in the wrong direction, and we shall therefore vote against the third reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>This is just another occasion which has proved, as we have contended so often, that this Government is continually saying one thing and doing another. It so often talks about private enterprise and free competition and the capitalist system, but that is obviously just an act, as this Bill proves. We are now taking permanent statutory powers to control prices, which shows me and everybody else that they really have no faith in private enterprise and free competition, the methods which we have always regarded as the correct ones to keep prices down, and that their speeches supporting private enterprise and free competition are merely lip service. If one could keep prices down simply by price control regulations and at the same time not affect the production of goods which might fall into short supply, running a country would be extremely easy and we would certainly not have the inflationary tendencies we have at the moment. The Minister knows that price control tackles the symptoms only; it certainly does not cure the disease. It is simply like a patent medicine which is advertised to deal with symptoms, but seldom cures the disease. In fact, the Minister also knows that in many instances price control increases the price. We have had many instances of minimum prices becoming maximum prices, particularly when there are shortages. Every thinking person concedes that in time of crisis and shortage price control should be applied, but every effort should be devoted to its elimination, and not to its perpetuation. In war-time it is essential, when shortages occur, and the total energies of the country are directed <span class="col_1241-1242" refersTo="page_0635"/>towards one object only. Surely after eighteen years of peace, such control should come to an end, unless of course this Government is prepared to acknowledge that we are really in a permanent state of war or emergency. The Minister already has powers to deal with monopolies, powers which are essential because if producers combine to eliminate competition they are certainly not entitled to any protection from the Government, and everybody knows that monopolies can be dealt with. But surely those powers are sufficient.</p>

<p>Another point I asked the Minister to remember is that price control measures such as these certainly do not help to build up confidence overseas, particularly in the minds of those people who may be considering extending their businesses and investments in this country. It is measures such as these that definitely do so much damage to our image and reputation as a free enterprise country overseas, and not our criticism of the measure. That at least shows that there are still some intelligent people in the country.</p>

<p>These measures, as was said by the hon. member for Constantia, were not submitted to anyone. They were not submitted to commerce and industry, and certainly not to the Housewives&#x2019; League or to any consumers. They were simply slapped before us and when we asked for a Select Committee that was not accepted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I must ask whether the Government would introduce any measures such as this affecting the agricultural industry without any consultation. I have my doubts about that. If the Government wants to tackle inflation, it can use the normal fiscal and monetary measures, as other Western countries do, but of course, most of all, it should remove the restrictions imposed by it on our economy, and so increase production and competition. It is common cause that the chief inflationary factor in this country is the shortage of skilled labour, yet we have job reservation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I suggest that the Government should accept the suggestion made by my Leader earlier in the Session, that there should be a crash programme to produce more skilled labour instead of applying price control. After all, for 18 years the Government has promised us that these measures were temporary. We agree that these measures should be retained, but on a temporary basis. We say it is the policies of the Government that have prevented us from getting back to normal, and unfortunately notwithstanding our wonderful natural resources we must still have certain control powers, but to make them permanent is such an act of fear that we cannot support it. We will support temporary powers, but not permanent ones.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, practically all the arguments advanced during the second reading have been repeated here. It has particularly been said that there was no consultation. The fact is that last year the export and import control regulations were embodied in legislation, and then already it was said that this one was still outstanding and that this year it would be embodied in legislation. It therefore came as no surprise. It was known that we would do so, and it is not true, as the hon. member for Benoni has said, that we have always accepted it as being a temporary measure. Our standpoint throughout was that these regulations should be embodied in legislation if it is considered necessary that they should continue to exist, because legislation is preferable to regulations.</p>

<p>Now it is said that the Bill should apply for two years only. The fact remains that this legislation is necessary. It may be necessary now and not in the future, but the time may arrive when it will again become necessary. This legislation is merely permissive. It gives the Government certain powers which it need not necessarily apply, but it empowers the Government to do so. In recent times it has been the policy to lift price control as far possible, as was done in the case of fresh milk. But it may be necessary to apply it, and therefore this legislation must be there. If an Act is to operate for two years only, Parliament may be in recess at a time when it becomes necessary to apply price control, and then we would have to wait for the next Session. We cannot allow such a gap. The hon. member says that conditions now differ from what they were in 1939 when the regulations were framed. That is correct, but these regulations have been applied from that time until now, and what is contained in this Bill are those portions of the regulations which are considered essential, and experience has shown us what is necessary and what is not. But the Minister said in the second reading that he was prepared to consider certain amendments. The matter was referred to the law advisers and the Minister intends moving certain amendments in the Other Place, so that hon. members need not be afraid that this will not be done.</p>

<p>It is said that this is a matter which is left to the officials. That is correct, but the responsibility has to rest somewhere. But it has been applied in the same way during recent years, and we have not received many complaints. There are still 18 commodities to which price control is applied, e.g. the Population Registration photos, leather supplied by tanneries, porcelain insulators, coal, sugar, coke, firearms, galvanized iron sheets, steel products, flat sheets for fencing, fertilizer, agricultural implements, lucerne and lucerne meal, oil cake, salt, agricultural tractors, fish meal and Langfos rock phosphate. There are certain other items in regard to which, in consultation with the department, an agreement has <span class="col_1243-1244" refersTo="page_0636"/>been arrived at that prices will not be increased without the consent of the department. That is therefore done outside the regulations. I refer here to cement, petrol, power paraffin, diesel oil, tyres and tubes, wattle and wattle extract, steel tubes, etc. The prices of those commodities are controlled by agreement and will not be increased without the consent of the department.</p>

<p>It is not true to allege that production is limited as the result of price control. I cannot believe that for a moment. On the contrary, the production of many of those articles has increased. The fact remains that it is necessary. It is not the only way of combating inflation, and it is not being used as such, but it may in fact be used if the public is being exploited in times of scarcities. We have had reference to the Monopolies Act, but that is not the only solution here. That Act is applied only when a monopoly is formed, but there can be price increases without there being monopolies. Therefore the problem cannot be solved in terms of the Monopolies Act. The hon. member for Benoni said we should leave it all to be settled by production factors, but hitherto it has appeared that we cannot leave it to those factors only. If it is left to that only, high prices may arise, which will have a chain effect on production costs, and we should not like to see that. Therefore it is essential to put this legislation on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>In this Bill the amendment of five separate Acts affecting provisions dealing with the same basic matter, viz. the right of residence in the Republic, is being proposed. It is a matter which is of real interest to every individual, because on it depends his right to enter the Republic, his right to leave the Republic and again to return to it, and also the rights he enjoys in this country, whether they be the rights of a full citizen or merely those of a visitor. These five Acts firstly grant the right of entry to any person provided he complies with certain requirements. He is granted the right of residence, whether for temporary or permanent purposes; secondly, it is provided <span class="col_1245-1246" refersTo="page_0637"/>how and under what circumstances he loses that right of residence and what the consequences of that loss will be to him, and thirdly, these Acts provide when a person is a citizen of the Republic or how he can become one, and when he loses that citizenship.</p>

<p>Because this right of residence, which is the basic idea underlying all five of these Acts, is contained in five separate Acts, a state of confusion has arisen in the minds of some people, and the object of this Bill is mainly to give greater clarity to certain provisions, particularly with a view to the possible consolidation at a later stage of these five Acts in one comprehensive Act.</p>

<p>In Clause 1 it is provided that the persons mentioned in Section 5 of the Regulation of Admission of Persons to the Union Act, 1913, will not, for the purposes only of Section 4, and not for purposes of the whole Act, be prohibited persons in the Republic. This amendment appears in the part of sub-section (1) which precedes paragraph (a). All the other amendments in this clause are consequential amendments or merely improve the language.</p>

<p>This Bill is in essence only a clarification of the existing position because so many people, including even lawyers, now want to argue that these persons are also exempted from the provisions of Section 24 of the same Act, which in essence declares any person except South African citizens by birth or descent (and of course children under 16 years) who enter the Republic without travel documents to be prohibited persons.</p>

<p>What the protagonists of this standpoint evidently lose sight of is that the main provisions of Section 24 were originally for the first time only inserted in the Act in 1937, whereas Section 5 has been embodied in the Act since 1913, and that a later provision <i>ipso facto</i> negatives a former provision if the two cannot be reconciled with each other, as is the case here.</p>

<p>Whatever the legal arguments might be, it is in any case inconceivable that a person may enter the Republic without a travel document or a visa unless he is exempted from the requirement of possessing it, and that will be the case if the persons referred to in Section 5 are exempted from the provisions of Section 24.</p>

<p>Provision for exemption is made in Section 24, and the Republic&#x2019;s visa agreements or arrangements with or in respect of other countries like the Commonwealth countries are based on the provisions of this section. In addition, Section 24 also contains the express exemptions mentioned before, viz. in respect of South African citizens by birth and descent and children under the age of 16 years.</p>

<p>In Clause 2 an amendment is being proposed in terms of which foreigners who enter the Republic by air will receive the same treatment as those who arrive in the territorial waters of the Republic by sea.</p>

<p>In terms of the present provisions, any foreigner who arrives within the territorial waters of the Republic by ship without a permit for permanent residence or a permit to enter the Republic for temporary purposes, issued in terms of the provisions of the Aliens Act, 1937, may be treated as a prohibited person in the Republic in terms of the Regulation of Admission of Persons to the Union Act, 1913, in terms of which the obligation then rests on the captain of the ship in which that prohibited person was transported to the Republic to remove that person from the Republic if permission to enter the Republic is denied him.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Regulation of Admission of Persons to the Union, 1913, have been applicable since 1923 also to aircraft, but although the provisions of the Aliens Act, 1937, were applied as if they also applied to aircraft, it is clear from Section 6 (2) of this Act that there is possibly room for doubt, and it is to remove all doubt that it is now being proposed to make these provisions applicable also expressly to aircraft.</p>

<p>If this doubt is not removed, it is conceivable that such persons may find themselves stranded at the airports of the Republic, without being able to appeal to the airline which transported them there.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 4. The present provisions of Section 17 of the South African Citizenship Act, 1949, provide that certain South African citizens through registration or naturalization will lose their South African citizenship if they are absent from the Republic for a continuous period of at least seven years.</p>

<p>Certain persons are exempted from the operation of these provisions, but while the South African Citizenship Amendment Act was being piloted through in 1961, the Minister&#x2019;s attention was directed in the Other Place to the fact that other persons, such as, e.g. students, may through circumstances beyond their control be adversely affected by the present provisions. The Minister at the time undertook to devote attention to the matter, and it is with the object of meeting such persons that it is now being proposed that paragraph (e) should be added to sub-section (1) and sub-section (5).</p>

<p>As the result of this proposal, any person or class of persons may be exempted from the provisions of this section for a definite or an indefinite period, either conditionally or subject to such conditions as the Minister may deem fit to impose. In addition, all such persons who have already been adversely affected can be met. All these cases will have to be dealt with on their own merits, seeing that it is impossible to specify every deserving case. Every case will be considered on its own merits. Even though an attempt is made to do that, there will always be cases which are not covered, and that will result in some deserving cases having to suffer unnecessary hardships <span class="col_1247-1248" refersTo="page_0638"/>until such time as the Act can again be amended.</p>

<p>In Clause 5 it is proposed that a certificate for the resumption of South African citizenship in terms of Section 25<i>bis</i> of the Act will be subject to certain conditions which also apply in respect of certificates of naturalization.</p>

<p>In terms of Section 25<i>bis,</i> a person who has automatically ceased to be a South African citizen because through some voluntary and formal action he has acquired citizenship or nationality in any other country or territory in Africa, or of any other country, by virtue of his residence in any country or territory in Africa, may, as soon as he returns to the Republic to settle permanently, if he is not a prohibited person in the Republic, apply to resume his former South African citizenship, and the Minister may then issue a certificate to that effect to that person.</p>

<p>In other words, if a South African citizen has acquired citizenship of the United Kingdom either by birth or descent or registration or naturalization in, for example, either Kenya or Tanganyika or the erstwhile Federation, because he voluntarily and formally applied for it, and as the result lost his South African citizenship, he can, on application, immediately get back his former South African citizenship when he returns to the Republic with the object of settling here again.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that these people were the bearers of Western civilization to those countries where they acquitted themselves excellently of their difficult but laudable task. It is therefore also quite ethical and just for us to receive these people back with open arms, but for the sake of maintaining good order&#x2014;and they know only too well what the consequences are if there is no orderliness in the government of a country&#x2014;it appears to be necessary to set certain further conditions which must be complied with when renewing South African citizenship.</p>

<p>It has now been found that there are some of these people who refuse to take the oath of allegiance to the Republic voluntarily or fail to take possession of their certificates of reassumption of South African citizenship within a reasonable period. They apply and forget about the matter, and they simply ignore requests directed to them to take possession of these certificates.</p>

<p>In order to combat this state of affairs, it is now proposed that these persons, just like persons who have applied for certificates of naturalization, should take up their certificates within six months after having been notified of the granting thereof, or else they will not be issued to them. Then they will have to apply anew.</p>

<p>It is also provided further, just as in the case of naturalization, that such persons, if they are over the age of 14 years, must take the oath of allegiance to the Republic as prescribed in the Act within the same period of six months, otherwise that certificate will not be issued to them.</p>

<p>This requirement, just like the previous one and the one I will deal with next, has been incorporated in the South African Citizenship Act ever since 1949 in respect of naturalization. It is therefore no new provision and I think everybody will agree with me that every citizen of this country should owe allegiance to the Republic when he settles here and enjoys what the country offers him. The acceptance of citizenship of another country implies allegiance to that country, and in view of the fact that we demand undivided allegiance from our citizens, it is no more than right that they should take an oath of undivided allegiance to South Africa.</p>

<p>Apart from these proposals, it is further proposed in this connection that the issue of these certificates, just as in the case of naturalization certificates, will be completely in the discretion of the Minister, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 6. Sec. 29 of the South African Citizenship Act, 1949, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that an applicant for a certificate of naturalization should, at least one month and at the utmost six months before applying to the Minister for naturalization, publish in both languages in the <i>Government Gazette </i>a notice in the prescribed form as to his intention of applying for a certificate of naturalization in terms of this Act. The Minister is, however, empowered to exempt from this obligation anyone belonging to certain categories of persons. When the Republic left the Commonwealth the certificate of registration as a South African citizen lapsed, and all persons who could formerly apply for this certificate must now apply for a certificate of naturalization. They are consequently now also, other than was the position before, subject to the provisions of Section 29.</p>

<p>Among the persons who could apply for a certificate of registration were also included the descendants of a male citizen of the two former Republics or of a male person who was born before 1 September 1900 in an area which was incorporated into the Union and who was legally allowed to enter the Republic for the purposes of permanent residence therein. This provision applies to the farmers from Angola and the Argentine. It is now proposed that the Minister should also be clothed with the power to exempt from the obligation of publishing the required notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> anybody belonging to this group of Angolan or Argentinian farmers. These persons were allowed to apply for certificates of registration because the requirements for these certificates were not as strict as those for certificates of naturalization. There is no reason why these persons should now all be compelled to publish the relevant notice just because we have left the Commonwealth, because they are not citizens of Commonwealth countries. It may, however, become desirable under certain circumstances to compel some of these persons to publish <span class="col_1249-1250" refersTo="page_0639"/>the relevant notice and therefore it is considered advisable to provide in Clause 6 that the Minister should be clothed with the power to exempt the person concerned from this requirement in respect of an application by or on behalf of such a person. Each case can then be considered on its merits.</p>

<p>Section 6 of the Regulation of Departure from the Union Act, 1955, provides that if a person, to whom a permit has been issued to leave the Republic permanently, leaves the Republic with the object of going to a place outside the Republic and thereafter returns to the Republic, he will be considered to have left the Republic without a permit. The Secretary for the Interior is compelled in terms of the present provisions to issue a permit to leave the Republic permanently to any applicant who convinces him that he wants to leave the Republic permanently. It is further provided in the same section at present that if such a person is convicted of a criminal offence, the Minister can have him removed from the Republic as a prohibited person if he was not born in an area incorporated into the Union.</p>

<p>In Clause 8 it is proposed that the powers of removal of the Minister be replaced by the provisions contained in sub-section (b) of the new section, namely that any person, irrespective of where he was born, becomes a prohibited person from the time he leaves the Republic with a permit to leave it permanently. Such a person then automatically loses his South African citizenship. It should be remembered that the relevant permit can be issued only to a person who has convinced the Secretary for the Interior that he wishes to leave the Republic permanently. If he in fact leaves, it is further proof that he wants to shake the dust of the Republic from his feet and wants to have nothing more to do with us. Therefore it is only logical that he should lose his South African citizenship&#x2014;in fact, he really surrenders it voluntarily.</p>

<p>If, however, such a person wishes to return to our country again, his return and residence here as a prohibited person in the Republic can be arranged as a matter falling under the provisions of Section 25 (1) of the Regulation of Admission of Persons to the Union Act, 1913, after which he can then again become a South African citizen along the ordinary channels, after his residence in the Republic has been arranged, by applying for naturalization as a South African citizen. Citizenship is not something which one can throw away to-day and pick up again at will to-morrow. Any nation which is worth its salt is proud of its citizenship, and therefore it also behaves us, as a nation with self-respect and pride, to honour our citizenship. Consequently, if a South African citizen proves to us that he has broken his links with the Republic, it will not be fitting to allow him to retain the main link, viz. South African citizenship. Nevertheless, as behaves a worthy and mature nation, we make provision again to accept as a worthy citizen such a person who later regrets his actions.</p>

<p>Section 13 of the Commonwealth Relations Act, 1962, provides that any person who, while he is in the Republic, becomes an alien, i.e., someone who is not a South African citizen, and who does not make a written statement before a prescribed official before 1 January 1963 in which he declares that he is in the Republic with the object of settling here permanently, will be considered as from 1 January 1963 to be in the Republic temporarily. This provision is particularly aimed at born British subjects and their residence in the Republic after we left the Commonwealth. After 31 December 1962 it appeared that approximately 2,000 of these persons who wanted to make this declaration did not do so timeously, but did in fact do so before 1 April 1963.</p>

<p>As the result of representations made particularly by the hon. members for Durban (North) and Durban (Umlazi), I undertook in this House to investigate the case of these persons and to meet them as far as possible, even though it requires legislation. Therefore I now propose that the section be amended to prolong the date 1 January 1963 to 1 April 1963. In this way these 2,000 dilatory people will be fully taken care of. In addition, it is proposed further that a notice of the intention to apply for naturalization which is published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> before 1 April 1963 will be accepted as sufficient proof of the intention of the person concerned to settle in the Republic permanently.</p>

<p>It is further proposed that every person who on 1 April 1963 was an alien who was admitted to the Republic since 1913 and who has not made the necessary declaration or has not published the relevant notice of his intention to apply for South African citizenship by way of naturalization, will for all purposes be considered to have remained in the Republic for temporary purposes at all times before 1 April 1963.</p>

<p>Section 10 (3) of the South African Citizenship Act, 1949, is amended by Clause 3 in order, together with the proposed amendments to the aforementioned Section 13, to put the position beyond all doubt and once and for all to make it clear which persons have permanent residence and which have temporary residence in the Republic.</p>

<p>Linking up with the proposed provisions of Clause 5 which amend Section <i>25bis</i> of the South African Citizenship Act, 1949, I should like to draw attention to the fact that both this section and Section 15 of that same Act refer to a voluntary and formal action as a result of which a person will lose his South African citizenship because he has thereby obtained the nationality or citizenship of another country. The question has arisen as to whether South African citizens who applied in territories or countries in Africa for citizenship of that territory or country, or of another <span class="col_1251-1252" refersTo="page_0640"/>country outside Africa, by virtue of their residence in that territory or country in Africa, and who obtain that nationality of citizenship in an attempt to maintain law and order or good Government in that territory or country in Africa so as to safeguard their own lives, bodies, property or honour, have committed a voluntary action.</p>

<p>The Government has come to the conclusion that under such circumstances there can be no question of its being a voluntary action, because those people were forced to commit an act which they otherwise would not have committed, as will appear from the fact that they already lived there for an appreciable time without committing such an act. Therefore I declare on behalf of the Government that any person who has committed such an act will not be regarded as a person who has lost his South African citizenship through a voluntary and formal action if, at any time after 31 May 1962 he committed an act with the aforementioned intention. That intention will always become clear if the internal conditions in the territories or countries concerned are analysed and, for example, it appears that that person accepted that citizenship in order to get on to the Voters&#x2019; Roll of that country. Where the intention is not clear, or where the act with that intention was committed before 31 May 1962, the provisions of Section 25<i>bis</i> will always be applicable.</p>

<p>As I said in the beginning of my speech, this Bill is chiefly aimed at affording clarity in regard to certain aspects of residence in the Republic. It is absolutely essential that particularly immigrants to the Republic and other inhabitants who are not yet South African citizens should know precisely where they stand with us.</p>

<p>It would of course be an ideal state of affairs if every person within our borders could be a citizen, but we realize that this is impossible, and in addition we cannot cheapen our citizenship by urging it on people as if it is a commodity which is sold from house to house. In this Republic of ours we need people to-day, and for the future, who are prepared to defend the Western way of life to the utmost and to maintain it. The world daily offers us further proof that the Western way of life is the only guarantee for peace and good order. Without good order there can be no peace, and the right of residence in the Republic must therefore, from the very nature of the matter, also be obtained and retained in an orderly manner. A community cannot be orderly if one of its corner-stones, namely the right to call oneself a member of that community, is not determined unequivocally and in an orderly way.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>There is nothing contained in this Bill to which we are opposed in principle, but there are various aspects of it which will merit some attention on the part of the Minister. There are many aspects which, if the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech is to be taken as the yardstick, he does not appear to have paid any regard to, or to have appreciated.</p>

<p>This Bill contains much that is desirable. It contains many concessions in relation to citizenship, and in the discretion of the Minister much can be done. It once again deals with the question of Commonwealth citizenship, which the Minister has dealt with, but in that regard again we will have more to say in relation to aspects which I believe the Minister has not appreciated. It provides also for a most unusual position concerning prohibited immigrants, those people to whom the Minister referred as having thrown away their citizenship, and having thrown away their citizenship they could not just pick it up again. I want to tell the Minister that as far as that clause is concerned, I do not think it is as easy as he says. There are certain aspects of it which we would probe at this stage and ask the Minister to give some indication as to how he will deal with some of the problems which will arise under this clause.</p>

<p>The most important provision in the Bill is contained in Clause 9, which deals with Commonwealth citizens. You will recall, Sir, that in 1962, when the provision which is here being amended came before this House, it was provided that all those Commonwealth citizens who had not registered before the end of December&#x2014;later extended to 1 April&#x2014;for permanent residence would become aliens. Our attitude at that stage was that these people had had adequate warning, and if they wanted to be South African citizens they had had adequate time in which to make up their minds. We were quite agreeable that such persons should then become aliens, and I think we indicated quite clearly that we were not in favour of dual nationality, and that if people wanted to be citizens of South Africa they should make up their minds. I mention this at the present stage because I hope that we will not have that thrown at us in relation to our attitude to this Bill. But after this Act was passed and those persons became aliens, the date was extended, and as the Minister said when he introduced the Bill, certain members on this side went to see the Department in relation to a circular they had sent round to various people in regard to citizenship.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned for supper, I was saying that the most important provision of this Bill was, without doubt, Clause 9. It relates to former Commonwealth citizens who fall to be affected by this Bill. When this matter came before the House in 1962, our attitude from this side of the House was that these people had had adequate warning to the effect that should they not register for permanent residence <span class="col_1253-1254" refersTo="page_0641"/>before the end of the period stipulated, i.e. six months which was later extended by three months, they should then face the consequences and become aliens. This is still the attitude we on this side of the House hold.</p>

<p>But something happened in between. At that stage it was thought that these persons would just become aliens. However, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, subsequently certain protests were made. Certain things were pointed out and the matter was raised again when the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote came up last year. The hon. the Minister then said that he had had these observations in which it was pointed out that these persons were not in fact aliens for all purposes as Clause 9 now provides. Clause 9 now provides that for all purposes, all these persons who did not register by 1 April, are to be regarded as being aliens and as having sojourned temporarily in the Republic for all purposes and for all times before that date.</p>

<p>Now, at that stage it became clear that the law did not say that. The hon. the Minister then said that he would investigate the matter and I think it is fair to say that the presence of Clause 9 in this Bill indicates that our view of the law at that stage was correct, i.e. that Commonwealth citizens who did not register for permanent residence, could become citizens if they waited for one year. In other words, if they registered for a permanent residence and resided here for a year thereafter, they could, at the end of that year, apply for citizenship and get credit for all the years during which they resided within the Republic while Commonwealth citizens.</p>

<p>The effect of Clause 9 is to remove this completely. Its effect is to say to these people that they lose all the credit they have before 1 April 1963. When the matter was again raised in this House, the hon. the Minister accepted that there was some doubt about the matter. According to col. 6068 of Hansard, Vol. 7, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We should like to have their opinion as to what the actual position is &#x2026;</block>

<p>He is referring here to the law advisers and continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and as soon as we ascertain their views the matter will receive further attention. We will even, perhaps, have to consider introducing amending legislation to meet <i>bona fide</i> cases where people find themselves in trouble. The point is that there was never any intention on the part of the Government to put people in a difficult position at short notice&#x2026;.</block>

<p>I want specially to emphasize the last sentence, namely that there was never any intention on the part of the Government to put people in a difficult position at short notice and to exclude those who settled here permanently but who have neglected to take these steps. Clearly, Sir, at that time, i.e. 1962, when these people became aliens, it was not a case of their being put into a difficult position at short notice. They were allowed six months and this was later extended by a further three months. The Minister in the debate from which I quoted also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Even the letter referred to by the hon. member for Durban (North) was submitted to the law advisers so that we could get a complete picture and be able to make as many concessions as possible to these people.</block>

<p>This is perhaps the essence of what I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider, i.e. that these people at that stage were in a position where they did not have to start all over again, to start <i>de novo</i> and stay here for another five years before qualifying as citizens. All that was needed in terms of the law then was residence for a further period of one year after registration. All the years they lived here before that would count&#x2014;at least four out of the previous eight would count towards qualifying for citizenship. This was publicized in the Press and became a matter of public knowledge. This is important because I believe there are a number of people&#x2014;I cannot say how many&#x2014;who appreciated what the position then was. They appreciated that there was some doubt and that they could become citizens after having resided here for one year after registration. That is important, I think. It is important because the hon. the Minister said that it was not the intention when introducing legislation, or with the already existing legislation, to put people in a difficult position, as he put it, at short notice.</p>

<p>The position in which these people now find themselves is this. They have now, if I may use the phrase, a vested right. They resided lawfully within the Republic, perhaps for many years, in circumstances which normally would qualify them for citizenship. Suddenly their position was changed so that they now find themselves in a position where, without any notice at all, they may lose those vested rights and the credit they have.</p>

<p>Does not this Bill meet them now?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>No. It is just what it does not do. This Bill now says to them that if they did not register by 1 April they lose all their residence in the Republic. This is not the intention of the Minister. I quoted what he said. The position they were in before was that they could count to their credit that period of residence before 1 April 1963 because at that stage they were not temporary sojourners; they were lawfully here and their residence here would have qualified them but for our becoming a Republic. I hope the hon. member for Heilbron now appreciates the distinction. Instead of having to wait one year before obtaining their citizenship they now have to wait five years for it.</p>

<p><span class="col_1255-1256" refersTo="page_0642"/>Now, Sir, I have indicated that we, on this side of the House, do not object to the principle of this Bill. We do not object to the stipulation that these people must make up their minds whether they are, or are not going to be, South African citizens. I think every one in this House will agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister that we do not want to place anyone in a difficult position at short notice. I want to inform the hon. the Minister at this stage that we intend moving as an amendment in the Committee Stage that the date mentioned in Clause 9 should be changed to 1 July 1964 from what it is now, i.e. 1 April 1963.</p>

<p>In the normal course this Bill will be passed within two weeks or so and it will then give to the people concerned the chance to make up their minds having regard to the new position they find themselves in. In other words, they will get adequate warning&#x2014;just as the Minister gave them adequate warning before&#x2014;that if they do not by a certain date decide what they want to be, i.e. whether they want or do not want to be South African citizens, they will have to face the consequences.</p>

<p>They had this chance last year but, as I said, since that time a new situation has been discovered, i.e. that these persons can become citizens after residence of one year.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging should not joke about this. The hon. the Minister himself is very keen to extend all possible benefits and concessions to people who are, or should qualify to become, citizens. This very Bill contains provisions entitling the hon. the Minister to grant citizenship to people who have been out of the Republic for more than seven years. I should like to ask the hon. member for Vereeniging: Who is more qualified to become a citizen, who is more desirable as a citizen&#x2014;someone who has lived here for ten years and is aware of what is happening, of his rights and of his duties as a citizen, or someone who has been out of the country for ten years? Because it is also provided in this Bill that the Minister can concede to people who have been away from the Republic that they do not lose their citizenship after having been away for seven years.</p>

<p>It seems to me that these people who have been here but who have not registered for permanent residence although they have nevertheless lived here for a number of years, are far more qualified to become citizens, and are far more desirable to have as citizens, being aware, as they are, of what is happening, than those who have been away from the country for ten years.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that I realize. But the position is that South Africans who have renounced their citizenship can come back to South Africa and the Minister is quite prepared to extend concessions to them too. He has indicated that he wants to help them as well. They must, of course, take the oath, etc. But these are people who have renounced their South African citizenship which, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said in connection with Clause 8 and to which I am coming in a moment, you cannot just do. The hon. the Minister is prepared to make concessions to these people, and we agree with him on that, but let us be prepared to make concessions also to people in the category I am talking of. I hope the hon. the Minister will find a way to do that. Consequently, I hope he will be able to give our proposed amendment his consideration.</p>

<p>There are other aspects of this Bill upon which we should like to dwell. Speaking of concessions, I should like to say at this stage that we welcome the attitude of the hon. the Minister towards those people who by mischance or misfortune lost their citizenship. We welcome his attitude to extend citizenship to them. I hope this benevolent attitude will also be shown to others.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister dismissed Clause 8 rather lightly. He spoke of this clause as if it was a case of someone losing his citizenship because he has renounced his intention of remaining in South Africa. But Clause 8 goes much further than that. In 1955 the departure from the Union Regulation Act was passed. It was therein provided that one could not leave the Union unless one has either a passport, an exit permit, or an exit permit endorsed to the effect that one was departing permanently. Up to that stage it was in the discretion of the Government whether or not to grant anyone a passport or exit permit. <span class="col_1257-1258" refersTo="page_0643"/>In this Act, however, it was provided that if someone applied for an exit permit and he stated that he intended leaving permanently, it was obligatory to issue him that exit permit. It was not just a question of losing one&#x2019;s citizenship either. It was also provided in the Act of 1955 that if one left South Africa with an exit permit endorsed to the effect that one was leaving permanently, one could be charged upon your return with having left the country without a valid travel document. A term of imprisonment of up to two years could be imposed if I remember correctly. That Act also excludes from the operation of certain of its provisions persons who were born in the country. That was done for very good reasons. It was provided in that Act that persons who were South African citizens and left the country with an exit permit, could, on their return, not only be charged, but could also be deported as prohibited immigrants. Excluded from this provision, however, were persons who were born in the country. This was done for extraordinary good reasons, namely that they obeyed public international law. As far as I am aware, public international law has not changed since 1955. Public international law provides that everyone has a country of origin and that everyone has a nationality. Everyone, therefore, belongs to some country. I need not remind the hon. the Deputy Minister that public international law is based on consent.</p>

It provides that a South African-born citizen who leaves the country cannot ever return. He then becomes a stateless person. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister why he has not consulted the other nations of the Western world who will be effected by this. Where do these people go to? Where do they go to when they leave South Africa on an exit permit?</p>

<p>All right. I do not mind whether it is Dar-es-Salaam or whether it is Great Britain. I specially mentioned England because the people the hon. the Minister has in mind under this clause are more likely to be turned out of England than out of Dar-es-Salaam. Let us, therefore, say that they go to Great Britain. Let us suppose that while there they engage in the same activities they engaged in while in the Republic and that this is frowned upon by the Government of Great Britain. You will understand now why I did not choose Zanzibar! Let us suppose that the Government of Great Britain declares such persons to be undesirable and decides that they must be deported. Now, if such a person has to be deported, Great Britain will only have one choice. There is only one place to which you can deport a man and that is to his country of origin, in this case South Africa Now, can the hon. the Deputy Minister tell us what will happen to such a person when he arrives here? It is no use saying that the shipping companies will not take him. In Great Britain the court will issue an order according to the dictates of their laws and in accordance with the dictates of public international law which they accept. So this man is going to be sent back to South Africa. I am asking these questions because I should like to know what <span class="col_1259-1260" refersTo="page_0644"/>the hon. the Deputy Minister has in mind in regard to such persons. [Interjections.] Just one moment please! Let us suppose that such a person arrives in Cape Town. He can be charged with having left the Republic without a proper document. He will be a prohibited immigrant in terms of this clause. So what is going to happen to him? For how long does he remain in the detention barracks in Cape Town? As far as I am aware, Sir, persons remain in the immigration detention barracks in Cape Town pending their deportation. But where is this fellow going to be deported to? What is intended to do with him? How is he to be provided for? These are the questions I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister. Does he know what the position will be of such a person?</p>

When the hon. the Deputy Minister says that such a person has thrown away his citizenship and cannot regain it, he contradicts himself because in some circumstances a person can throw away his citizenship while in other circumstances he can pick it up again.</p>

<p>My plea is this. This Bill, as I have already said, contains much that is good and desirable.

<p>Sir, it is realized that there is still a large number of British subjects in South Africa who, for reasons of their own, or who were misled by sensational Press reports regarding the future of the White man in this country, are now thinking afresh and taking a fresh look at the Republic. No doubt they are comparing events which not only have taken place in Africa to the North but in many other parts of the world. These people must realize and must now be convinced that this country not only offers security, but a wonderful living for themselves and a future for their children. No other country offers so much as South Africa. To those British subjects in our midst who stand at the threshold I want to make a special appeal to make up their minds about permanent residence and eventual citizenship. They can at any time apply to the Department of Immigration for permanent residence and by obtaining permanent residence they will be able to become citizens after a period of five years from the date they obtained permanent residence.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Sir, and I apologize. No reflection was intended. Before delivering speeches such as the hon. member has to-night I think he might give them a little more attention and thought. For example, he makes a special appeal to those persons who are standing on the threshold of taking on South African citizenship. I think an appeal from that hon. member is enough to put anybody off. In regard to this statement about people having been misled by certain politicians, may I remind him of his own constituents who voted him to this House. Were they not misled by a certain politician? And then this hon. member has the temerity to stand up in this House and say that people who ought to be citizens of this country, useful citizens, have been misled by certain politicians. [Interjections.] He is the last member in this House to get up and make a statement like that. Absolutely the last.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I proceed to deal with one or two aspects, which I think the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has not had time to deal with, I do want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister. My appeal is this: The legislation with which we are dealing to-night covers the cases of individuals, people who themselves, as ordinary persons, are considering the question of their citizenship and the whole future of their lives. To unravel that position and to decide what to do, they have to unravel a mass of legislation to try to determine what exactly their position is. The hon. Minister knows that legislation such as we are considering to-night is covered by some five different Acts, each one of which is amended from time to time. It is becoming so complicated for the ordinary person to deal with legislation which covers his life and his future, he has the greatest difficulty to sort the position out. I think, for example, of the Group Areas Amendment Act where the legislation has become so complicated by amendments that the Department, without bringing a consolidating Bill to this House, has consolidated it departmentally. <span class="col_1263-1264" refersTo="page_0646"/>I can assure the hon. the Minister that if his Department, which I know intend to do something of this nature, could do a departmental consolidation, it would help not only members of this House but it would help those people who from time to time come in contact with this law or have it applied to them. I am sure it would be much easier for them to understand their position and what they have to do in the matter. My colleague from Durban (North) has also appealed to the Minister to accept or to consider accepting our amendment. I think the legislation surrounding this particular type of person is complicated and in giving thought to the amendment which we shall move in the Committee stage the hon. Minister might also take into consideration the complicated effect of this legislation.</p>

<p>The other point I want to deal with is this: As the hon. member for Durban (North) has already stated the main portion of this Bill is contained in Clause 9. It deals with those people who are already in our country, people, in many cases, who have lived here for many years; people whom the Minister of the Interior has indicated he wants to assist to become South African citizens. I too think that this Clause is the main Clause of this Bill, and that is why I want to deal with it. This Clause has been introduced particularly to clarify the position of these people and to put it beyond doubt. It most certainly has done that. It has left no doubt that those people who are resident here now and who became aliens under the Commonwealth Relations Act of 1962 are going to lose the qualifying rights that they had. That is already well known. Whilst the hon. the Minister was introducing this piece of legislation he made the point quite strongly that he was not going to see our South African citizenship cheapened. We on this side of the House quite agree with that. But I think there is another angle from which he can approach this matter&#x2014;and I think it is a far more intelligent one. I do not think anybody wants to cheapen their nationality, May I remind the hon. the Minister that the British Parliament is at the moment considering, or has already considered, legislation to try to restore citizenship to those people who have forfeited or given up their citizenship to assume the citizenship of other countries. That is a country from which we are drawing immigrants, yet they obviously want their people back and are prepared to take steps to encourage them to come back and, when they come back, to make it easy for them to resume the citizenship of their birth. I think that is a very good principle. I think it is a very good way of approaching people of your own country. But whilst the hon. the Minister is introducing legislation of this type, legislation which makes it more difficult for people to become South African citizens, and actually puts bars in their way, the hon. the Minister of Immigration is trying to bring people to this country. It seems so foolish to me that the efforts of the hon. the Minister of Immigration should be frustrated by the hon. the Minister of the Interior who is trying to make it more and more difficult for people, exactly the same type of person who the Minister of Immigration is bringing out here, to become South African citizens. It seems an awful waste to me, Sir. Because, whilst on the one hand we are trying to stop people from becoming South African citizens, the Minister of Immigration is paying R155 per head to bring these very same people to South Africa. To me it seems that the two Departments are working at cross-purposes. Having discussed with the Minister of the Interior the very situation which is dealt with in Clause 9 of this Bill last year, we then went on to the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Immigration. We repeated to him that we did not know how many of these people were affected in the Republic. The hon. Minister cannot tell us. We have had reports varying in number up to 300,000. I think, like the hon. the Minister of the Interior, that that figure is a great exaggeration. But if anybody were to tell me that that figure was somewhere in the region 65,000 to 100,000 I would be prepared to accept it. I believe that 65,000 to 100,000 immigrants in this country at this moment, especially people who have become accustomed to our way of life and in many cases have a stake in the country, are the most valuable immigrants that you can possibly get. I do not think that you can improve on that by going to other countries and bringing people here who are strange to our ways. I believe that this situation is one which the Minister must very seriously consider. I think he has flown in the face of these facts. When a flaw was found in the legislation which was introduced last year this Minister set about closing that gap instead of opening it up. I believe he is moving in exactly the opposite direction from that in which he should be moving in relation to those people who are already living in our country. I believe there is not a country in the world which wanted immigrants, that would not take the utmost steps to persuade those people, not to make their citizenship cheap, but to persuade those people to assume citizenship. The effect of Clause 9 of this Bill is going to be exactly the opposite, because where these people qualify under the Act as it exists to-day to become citizens of this country in one year, in most cases, from the date of notification of their intention to reside here permanently, the Minister intends, by this law, to extend that period to a minimum of five years. I do not think that is good business. I think it is very foolish. The hon. the Minister of Immigration has accepted the fact that we are looking for immigrants. I want to quote him. In col. 7240 of Hansard last year he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have no target. I am prepared to accept immigrants into South Africa provided I can find employment for them in South Africa.</block>

<p><span class="col_1265-1266" refersTo="page_0647"/>These people already have employment, Sir. He does not have to find employment for them; they are employed. Those people all earn a living and are contributing to the national welfare of our country. Yet here we are tonight considering a law to make it more difficult for those people to join us and to help us with our other problems&#x2014;and South Africa has many problems.</p>

<p>I want to make another point. The hon. the Minister is also tightening up very considerably the position of those people who, for some reason or other, emigrated from South Africa on what, one might call, a one-way ticket, people who notified the authorities that they were emigrating for good, perhaps because of financial regulations. There were quite a number of those people. This Bill puts the position so that those people really have not got the right to come back; they will be considered prohibited persons if they did come back, unless they have an exemption from the Minister. And as the hon. the Deputy Minister indicated in his speech each case would be treated on its merits. I would like to ask him in passing whether that means that they would have to apply for that consideration whilst they are still in the country where they are residing at the moment, because if they come here, I take it &#x2026;</p>

<p>Let me make the position quite clear to the hon. the Deputy Minister. There are three ways in which you can leave this country. There are only three ways that I know of. One, you can leave on a passport; two, you can leave on a permit and the third one is that you can leave on a permit endorsed to the effect that you do not intend to return. To the best of my knowledge and belief the only way in which you can get finances to finance you in your new home overseas, is by leaving on a permit endorsed to the effect that you do not intend to return, that you intend to remain permanently outside the Republic. The hon. the Deputy Minister said in his introductory speech that those people who left the Republic with the intention not to return, left on the same permit, endorsed in the same way, as the person who emigrated permanently from South Africa. That is the position; it is quite clear. I am not trying to catch the Deputy Minister out; I am just trying to get the position clarified. There is no catch to this; we just want him to understand what we are doing.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that the hon. the Minister of Immigration is prepared to give to those persons, in respect of whom the hon. the Minister intends to make it more difficult to return under this Bill, assistance to return.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Just let me finish my argument. The point I want to make is that we are tonight legislating in the face of statements made by the hon. the Minister of the Interior last year in which he indicated that he was going <span class="col_1267-1268" refersTo="page_0648"/>to give every assistance, not only to those people resident in this country, but the hon. Minister of Immigration said he was going to help those people who had left here and said they were never coming back but who now wanted to come back. Yet here this legislation does exactly the opposite. I believe we are doing a very foolish thing. On the facts that are before us, the facts that are recorded here in Hansard, the facts of the statement by the two Ministers are directly in conflict with one another. I believe that this is something the Minister should have sorted out before he brought a Bill of this nature to the House. He has been very forcible in protecting South African citizenship. Of course, as I said before, we all want to protect South African citizenship, but we don&#x2019;t want to be so foolish that we block the flow of immigrants who are the life-blood of our country to-day. We cannot do without them. Even this Government has had to acknowledge it, in spite of the fact that for 14 years it turned its face against them. It has had to accept the fact that we needed immigrants. Now that they have accepted that fact, I appeal to the hon. the Minister not to go and impede the flow of immigrants to this country, not to put foolish legislation of this nature on the Statute Book without reconsidering it.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<p>As I have explained already there are three ways in which you can leave this country. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I don&#x2019;t go round asking people how they left the Republic. I can only tell the hon. member what the law is. If he wants to know the law he can look it up himself. I shall tell him what it is if he is too tired to look it up. I have already told him. But he asked me a question and that was my answer. I have not quoted any individual cases; I was talking about general policy and the advisability of this Act. I am sure the Deputy Minister can give him the names of people who have applied to come back to this country and who left on a permanent exit permit. I don&#x2019;t know.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to repeat to the hon. the Deputy Minister that we do intend moving an amendment in the Committee Stage of this Bill. We are trying to treat this intelligently because we think it is a matter of vital importance to our country. To judge from the noise behind me, Sir, I am sure there are many members on the Government benches who treat this as a joke. Why do they treat it as a joke? Because I don&#x2019;t believe they want immigrants in our country. They put up a member like the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) to put up a show, but they immediately wipe out the whole effect by their attitude when we discuss this matter. I must repeat my plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister please to reconsider this matter and to consider our amendment which is available through the Secretary.</p>

<p>I listened attentively to what the previous hon. member said and also to what the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) said. I listened to the arguments they advanced against this Bill. As I understood them they said that they did not really have any basic objection to the Bill but that they had certain doubts and that they would submit those doubts to the House and that if those doubts of theirs could be dispelled they would not have any objection to the Bill. I think that was more or less what they said. I suppose therefore that it is probably our duty on this side of the House to try to reply to the points raised by them and to give them more or less a satisfactory explanation. I intend to try to do so. I say &#x201C;try&#x201D; because I do not know whether I shall succeed, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>Before doing so, however, hon. members will forgive me for saying I find it very remarkable that they are so extremely irritated when the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell) speaks.

I can tell the Opposition that they give me the impression that it is an extreme case of sour grapes.

<p>I now want to deal with the Bill, Sir. If the hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) will forgive me I want to start with the points raised by the hon. member for Durban (North). The hon. member said that Clause 9 was really the most important clause of this Bill and he gave the reason, namely, that in view of the fact that British subjects, in terms of the 1962 Commonwealth Relations Act, became aliens in this country since 31 May 1962 they had acquired a status different from that they had before. It is true that they were not South African citizens prior to that but they were at least not aliens.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>And we agreed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite true. That group of people had seven months&#x2019; time, up to the end of 1962, to indicate that they wanted to remain permanently in South Africa. As the hon. member said some of them did not do so during those seven months. They are now <span class="col_1269-1270" refersTo="page_0649"/>given a further chance in this Bill, another three months, which is a great concession. They have therefore had ten months&#x2019; concession. But the hon. member says even that is not enough. The crux of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument was that the Minister should meet them further. Well, I do not think it is for me to reply to that. I take it the hon. the Deputy Minister will give him a reply. As I have said I want to try to convince him by giving him the facts. I do not say I shall be successful because the matter is fairly complicated in the long run. I wonder, however, whether the point I am about to make is not a point which the hon. member ought to consider. That is that in terms of Section 8 of the 1949 Act the position of British subjects who wanted to acquire South African citizenship had already changed. The residential qualification was then increased to five years in all. Section 8 of the 1949 Act reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may upon application in the prescribed form grant a certificate of registration as a South African citizen to any person who is a citizen of any Commonwealth country or of the Republic of Ireland, provided that that person satisfies the Minister &#x2026; (b) that he has been lawfully admitted to the Union for permanent residence therein.</block>

<p>An Act was therefore passed in this House in 1949 in terms whereof British subjects could only become South African citizens if they had been lawfully admitted to the Union (later the Republic) for permanent residence. Such a person has to convince the Minister of this fact. This group of people have known all this time what to do if they wanted to become South African citizens. When we became a Republic in 1962 and with the passage of the Commonwealth Relations Act in 1962 many warnings were issued to them by the Hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and by the Minister of the Interior that they should take the step. There is not one such person in South Africa who did not know what he had to do. He had seven months to think about it and this Bill now extends grace to the late-comers. My submission to the hon. member for Durban (North) is this, however, that those people did not only know in 1962 that they had to indicate that they wanted to remain here permanently. The person who entered this country in 1949 as a British subject has had the opportunity since then, not only from the 31st of May, 1962, to convince the Minister that he wanted to remain here permanently. He was warned and I maintain that he was already warned in 1949 and not only from the 31st of May, 1962. That is why I regard this as a very reasonable Bill, because is gives those people who, for all these years, from their arrival in South Africa up to to-day, have not heeded that warning to indicate their intention of remaining here permanently, further time up to the 1st of April and I think it is reasonable that they should be regarded as aliens in this country from the 1st of April if they do not indicate their intention of remaining here permanently. That is my reply to the hon. member on that particular point raised by him.</p>

<p>The hon. member made a very strong point of the fact that under Clause 8 those people who obtained a permit to leave South Africa permanently would be in a difficult position. He wants to know what is to become of them. I just want to point out that at no stage in his speech did the hon. member say that the United Party was opposed to such a measure and that they as a party were opposed to the introduction of permanent exit permits or temporary exit permits in terms of the 1955 Act. Neither that hon. member nor the hon. member for Umlazi said that they were opposed to such a measure being on our Statute Book. All they said was that the people were not sent away and they asked what were to become of them if they returned one day.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>We must be practical and ask ourselves who these people are who leave the country under permanent exit permits. That also brings me to the hon. member for Umlazi who committed the colossal blunder of comparing those people with those who had left our country as emigrants and who had gone to Australia, for example. Surely the hon. member cannot argue like that. Any person who wishes to leave South Africa applies for a passport to leave the country, and when you have received your passport, you leave the country and you travel around, or you settle in another country and when you arrive there you enter the country on your passport. Your passport tells the authorities there: &#x201C;This is a decent chap, we have nothing against him; he has our blessing to travel around&#x201D;. Our Citizenship Act says that if a man settles permanently in Australia and he applies for citizenship there by naturalization, his name is deleted from the Minister&#x2019;s list and he forfeits his South African citizenship. That is what happens and it fully covers those people to whom the hon. member of Umlazi has referred. That is why I want to tell the hon. member for Umlazi that he is totally and utterly wrong, as wrong as he possibly can be, when he compares people who leave our country to settle elsewhere with people who leave on permanent exit permits.</p>

<p>Why has the system of permanent exit permits been introduced? It was introduced in 1955. The Government found that people went overseas on a passport, and in many cases they went overseas on a British passport; they then go behind the Iron Curtain and elsewhere where they indulge in subversive activities and receive training in sabotage work. They then return along the same channels whereby they had left. We then passed the 1955 Act which provided that nobody could leave the country without a legal passport or without an exit permit. I might add that 98 per cent or 99 per <span class="col_1271-1272" refersTo="page_0650"/>cent of the people who apply and who are respectable people get their passports. But there is a certain number, those who constitute the subversive element, who do not get issued with passports. Hon members opposite ask questions in that connection and they would probably know how many passports have been refused. The person who has been refused a passport cannot leave the country. The provision was accepted at that time that if such a person wanted to leave the country permanently (the person who cannot get a passport and who is an undesirable person to whom we do not want to extend our blessings to travel abroad on a South African passport), he could do so if he indicated to the authorities that he wanted to start a new or another life in another country. He must have some document, a travel document or a departure document, in order to get away. If he wishes to leave our country permanently the Minister must issue him with a permanent exit permit. The law states clearly that the Minister may refuse to issue him with a temporary exit permit but if he applies for a permanent exit permit the Minister has no choice; he must grant it. He then leaves. But, Mr. Speaker, people do not just go blindly on a ship to travel about. The hon. member for Durban (North) will not do so. You make arrangements. You want to go to a country; there is a country that must receive you; you have arranged everything beforehand. Such people may want to go to Tanganyika or Algeria or perhaps to Czechoslovakia or Ghana. They have made their arrangements. There are people who have gone there. But the hon. member for Durban (North) now says&#x2014;I am not talking about the hon. member for Umlazi who said that people who had gone to Australia and regretted it could not return; they have come back in their thousands; there is provision in our legislation for them to come back&#x2014;that you also have the subversive element that want to return. The Bill which we are passing here&#x2014;the old Act also laid it down but it provided that he could return but then he had to appear before court and if found guilty the Minister could deal with him as if he were a prohibited immigrant, and as the hon. member rightly said the old act related to people who became South African citizens either by naturalization, registration or by descent&#x2014;makes that applicable to born South African citizens as well. The Minister does not take action against them for having left without legal documents only after they had returned and if they had been prosecuted, but the Bill says that from the moment they leave and get beyond our territorial waters, they are prohibited immigrants. It makes no difference whether the person is a born or naturalized South African citizen, he is a prohibited immigrant. I notice that the eyes of the hon. member for Durban (North) are beginning to shine because I am now coming to the difficult point he has raised. The person has left, he regrets it and wishes to return, or perhaps he had done something over there and that country no longer wants him either and they deport him to South Africa because this is his country of birth. The hon. member wants to know how we get away from the international law.</p>

<p>The hon. member has no objection to the Bill; he does not object to anything. He only wants to know. I shall try to give the hon. member the information. Firstly, in terms of Section 15 of the Citizenship Act, as amended, the Minister has in any case the right to deprive a South African citizen of his citizenship. The Minister has had that right since 1949. The whole issue to-day centres round the person who is a born South African citizen. The other people cannot become stateless because they can be deported to their country of birth. But the born South African citizen could, in terms of Section 15 of the 1949 Act, lose his citizenship from that date already. The Minister could deprive him of his citizenship from that date already. The point raised by the hon. member this evening, therefore, is something which is not even relevant under this Bill. It is something which has existed since 1949. In this respect I want to tell the hon. member&#x2014;I am not quite sure, but I think so&#x2014;that we are obliged under the Hague Convention &#x2026;</p>

<p>We are compelled to accept such people back. Such a person need not even be brought before the court, because in terms of this Bill he immediately becomes a prohibited person, in terms of the 1913 Act, and we can then deal with him in the way we deal with a prohibited immigrant. We can detain him, we can deprive him of his right, he is prohibited from going into business, and he will be prosecuted if he goes anywhere where he should not go. We shall apply the whole Act of 1913 to him because he will be a prohibited immigrant in South Africa and he will remain it. I think that is more or less the only reply one can give the hon. member.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to the debate by associating myself with what the former speaker, the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) has said. I want to thank him for the very clear exposition he gave and also for the reply he gave to the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). It is correct that if such persons who have been deprived of their citizenship here land in trouble abroad and that foreign power decides <span class="col_1273-1274" refersTo="page_0651"/>to send them back, South Africa is then obliged in terms of the Hague Convention of 1930 to accept them back.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The Hague Convention applies to all countries and it is not necessary to mention it in every Act. We are then in the position that in terms of Section 25 of the Regulation of Admission of Persons to the Union Act of 1913 we have to treat any person who comes back in this way, and who therefore is a prohibited person here, as a prohibited person. He will have to make arrangements anew for his temporary residence, and thereafter he will have to make arrangements to obtain permanent residence; he will have to follow the ordinary process of naturalization again. I think that is the reply to the problem raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) <i>inter alia</i> raised the case of people who depart permanently. That has also been replied to by the hon. member for Queenstown, but for the sake of clarity I want to state it again. The case was mentioned here and the question was asked: What about the South Africans who have now emigrated to Australia or New Zealand: if they want to return, are they also subject to this automatic termination of their citizenship? No, that is not the case. The persons who emigrated and went as immigrants did so with a passport, as the hon. member for Queenstown correctly said. It is necessary for me to emphasize that those persons to whom permanent permits for departure have been issued are persons who applied for an ordinary passport; the ordinary passport was refused for good reasons. Thereafter they said that they wanted a permanent permit of departure. But that will not apply to those South Africans who emigrated to Australia and elsewhere. In other words, those people can come back without this restriction. I hope this is clear now.</p>

<p>I must say that I was very upset about the bitterness revealed by the hon. member for Umlazi towards the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) (Mr. Odell). In season and out of it, one always hears from hon. members opposite the words &#x201C;racial harmony&#x201D;. It is always the United Party which wants to teach South Africa the lesson of racial harmony. They are the people who continually tell us how necessary it is to live together in peace and harmony and that there should be racial harmony between English and Afrikaans-speaking people. But the bitterness which emanated from the words of the hon. member for Umlazi against the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) is certainly no evidence of racial harmony: it is evidence of a deplorable bitterness. And it is not only that hon. member who revealed that bitterness here; it is the members on that side who treat any action, any statement or any plea made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) in that deplorable way. His great sin of course is that he is an English-speaking person who joined the National Party.</p>

<p>In regard to the hon. member for Pieter-martizburg (City), I want to say that he raised an important matter here. He made a plea and appealed to the British subjects who have not yet been naturalized and have not yet obtained citizenship to register now for permanent residence in this country. I want to support that plea very strongly, because in terms of the legislation now before us, we are now again in reply to the pleas made by hon. members opposite, making the greatest concession to these 2,000 slowcoaches by extending the date for making application to 1 April. Now hon. members opposite say the date should be extended still further. But where is it to end? Is that now how a country regulates the orderliness of its citizenship? Has one no self-respect and pride in one&#x2019;s own citizenship? Must one make unlimited concessions to such persons?</p>

<p>In this Bill we are going very far in order to show a spirit of goodwill and sympathy towards the British subjects who are in our country and want to acquire citizenship. By extending this period we are making a great concession to them. Many warnings were given over the radio and in the Press and in other ways that they should before 31st December state their intention as to whether they wanted to become citizens of our country. This was known to one and all of them. Now we are extending it to 1st April 1964, which I think is a great concession. The legal position now is&#x2014;and I think this should now be clearly realized&#x2014;that however desirous we are to have the British subjects in South Africa as citizens, and however much value we attach to them, after this Bill becomes law any of them who by 1st April 1964 have not yet submitted that declaration and been accepted as South African citizens will then be in this country as temporary sojourners. Every country must regulate its citizenship properly. In order to acquire citizenship it will be necessary for them to realize that they must now register <span class="col_1275-1276" refersTo="page_0652"/>for permanent residence. Because as the law stands now they can only become citizens five years after having acquired permanent residence in our country. Therefore the first step which those British subjects should now take is to register for permanent residence. That is why I am so grateful for the plea made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) to those British subjects now to comply with this first requirement of the Citizenship Act. For those British subjects who are accustomed to an orderly and regulated government, this should be a very understandable arrangement.</p>

<p>In fact it is five years, but a prospective citizen is allowed to apply for naturalization after 4&#x00BD; years. He must apply six months before the expiry of the period. That explains the 4&#x00BD; years.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) mentioned another point in regard to which I want to support him. In the first place he appealed to British subjects here to register for permanent residence in South Africa, because that is the first requirement for naturalization in our country, and I am very glad that the hon. member made that appeal.</p>

<p>The hon. member further made an appeal to the Government to consider sympathetically the cases of people who now apply for permanent residence, and asked that we should consider speeding up their naturalization so that they can be naturalized before the expiry of five years. In terms of our law, the Citizenship Act, we can grant consideration to such cases in terms of Section 10 (8). I can only tell the hon. member that if we are convinced that British subjects are really serious in desiring to become South African citizens and they make use of this opportunity to apply for permanent residence in South Africa, and after a year they apply for naturalization, we will grant favourable consideration to such cases.</p>

<p>For the rest, there was not much objection to this measure. I am particularly gratified that it was accepted with a great measure of goodwill, and I do not think it is necessary to say any more.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>After the disappearance of the last constituent university colleges, which all became independent universities, the University of South Africa was placed on a different basis in 1951. At that time the question of donations was not a question which had received serious attention. The question of donations to the University of South Africa to strengthen its funds for its development has only recently become a real one. For example, the City Council of Pretoria donated a large piece of ground to the University of South Africa. But apart from that donation the City Council of Pretoria also decided to make a grant-in-aid of R4,000 per annum to the University of South Africa. The position is, however, that the City Council of Pretoria decided in the past that if the City Council of Pretoria made a grant to any institution of R100 or less, the City Council could demand to have one representative on the board of such a body, and that if the City Council made a grant of over R100 per annum, it could demand the right to have two representatives on the board of that body. Subsequent to that and after this donation the City Council approached the University of South Africa and drew their attention to the fact that they wanted representation on the council of that university. The University of South Africa considered their request and decided that, apart from the two representatives the City Council desired, they also had to consider the position of other donors, because, as I said at the beginning, it is only recently that the University of South Africa has been receiving donations. The Council of the University then recommended that the City Council of Pretoria should be allowed to have the necessary two representatives and that the other donors in the country should also be allowed to have two representatives. As a matter of fact, if this measure does not go through, thereby giving the City Council two representatives on the Council of the University, the University is in danger of losing that grant-in-aid and I do not think anybody wishes that.</p>

<p>Apart from this question of principle, the other provisions only provide for changes in the wording.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Naturally, Mr. Speaker, there can be no serious objection to this amending Bill in the changed circumstances of the University of South Africa. The hon. Deputy Minister has spoken of the old University of South Africa coming under a new organization, but it should not be confused with this University of South Africa. When the original Bill was introduced into the House, we suggested that this new university should be called the University of External Studies, to avoid the confusion which apparently still exists.</p>

<p><span class="col_1277-1278" refersTo="page_0653"/>Mr. Speaker. I don&#x2019;t see why the Bill should have been drafted in this way. We have clauses 1, 3, 4, 5 and sub-sections (a), (b) and (c) of clause 2 to say only one thing, which, I think, we could have stated in one clause in this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The University of South Africa Act, 1959, hereinafter referred to as the principal Act, is hereby amended by the substitution for the words &#x201C;Governor-General&#x201D; wherever it occurs of the words &#x201C;State President&#x201D; and for the word &#x201C;Union&#x201D; of the word &#x201C;Republic&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Then we would not have required the other four clauses.</p>

<p>I come to a point particularly mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to donations from the City Council of Pretoria. Can one take it now that the University of South Africa has become a Pretoria University and not a university to serve the whole country, as we understood it would be? Is it to be permanently situated in Pretoria? I presume that must be the reason. If that is the reason, we shall have two universities in Pretoria, and I presume the City Council subscribes to both.</p>

<p>The most important point that I wish to raise in connection with this Bill is: Why should it have been sponsored by the Government? The original University of South Africa Bill was sponsored by the Government, but I think there was a good reason for that. Your predecessor, Mr. Speaker, ruled, when we had the Separate Universities Bill before the House, that the University of South Africa was <i>sui generis</i> and did not fall into the same category as the other universities. Can we now take it for granted that the Government will sponsor any amendment to a university bill? Up to the present we have regarded it as essential that a university bill or an amending bill should be introduced as a private bill. Can we take it now that the Government has adopted a new system of sponsoring every university bill? I think it would be a very good thing and I should like the Deputy Minister to tell us whether this indicates a change in the Government&#x2019;s policy in introducing these bills.</p>

<p>In reply to the question whether the University of South Africa is going to remain in Pretoria I can only say that no decision has been taken to move it anywhere else. All the indications are that this university will remain there for many years when you consider the fact that the City Council had given them some land on which they can erect those buildings. The latter question, which the Speaker ruled out of order, I am not allowed to reply to.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since the coming into operation of the Archives Act, 1962, (Act No. 6 of 1962) it has become apparent that it is essential to effect certain amendments of an administrative nature to that Act. The object of the Archives Act is, <i>inter alia,</i> to place the archives of local authorities under the control of the Director of Archives and this was welcomed by the four Provincial Administrations and by the Administration of South West Africa. It now appears, however, that because of the definition of the word &#x201C;archives&#x201D; in the Archives Act, the transfer of archives of local authorities does not fall under the Archives Act of 1962. In terms of Section 1 (iii) of the Archives Act documents or papers which are controlled by another Act, do not fall under the Archives Act. The result is that the archives of local authorities in the Cape Province cannot be transferred to the Archive depots because ordinances apply in respect of the archives of divisional councils, municipalities, town councils, etc., namely, Ordinance No. 15 of 1952 and Ordinance No. 19 of 1951.</p>

<p>The words &#x201C;other Acts&#x201D; in the Archives Act are now replaced by &#x201C;Act of Parliament&#x201D; in order to include the transfer of archives of local authorities in the Cape Province in the Archives Act of 1962. The transfer of the archives of local authorities in the other provinces and in South West Africa is already fully covered by the Archives Act.</p>

<p>The object of the Archives Act is moreover that only the archives officials can make the archives available to the public for research purposes. They can offer the necessary facilities and exercise the necessary control. It has, however, come to light that Section 9 (6) of the Archives Act can be interpreted to mean that &#x201C;archives&#x201D; in possession of State Departments can be made available by somebody in control of such archives. In order to put it beyond any doubt that it is only the officials of the archives who can make the archives available to the public for research purposes, some amendments are being made but I want to point out that it is being done in such a way that heads of State departments will not be hampered in the execution of their duties nor that their own officials will be prohibited from doing research work in their own archives. It is essential for sound administration that their own officials do that research work. Provision is made for that in Clause 5.</p>

<p>A new provision, namely, Clause 4, is being inserted in order to give the Director of Archives the right to request those research workers who use the archives to give one copy of a published work to the Director. In the <span class="col_1279-1280" refersTo="page_0654"/>past it was the custom for people who had used the archives for research purposes voluntarily to give one copy of their work to the archives as a gift, which was of course of great value, but everybody did not do so. Some were asked to do so but did not. We are now making it easy for them; they need not think about it; they are compelled to give it. This amendment is made because we think it is necessary for the archives to be placed in possession of the ultimate result of their research work.</p>

<p>Clause 2 deals with the chairman of the Archives Commission. I might just remind you, Sir, that the chairman of the National Film Board and the National Education Board are appointed by the Minister and that system operates very satisfactorily. That system is now introduced here. In future the Minister will have the right to appoint one of the members of the Archives Commission as chairman of the Archives Commission. The reason why this has become necessary is because of the increasing responsibility of the archives for State departments. The archive officials have now been given the power to go through the documents of State departments and to sort them out. The problem has become a big one because of the documents that have accumulated. Eventually there was no more space to accommodate all the documents. A great many of those documents had actually become of no value. It is a very responsible task to sort out these documents and it is now done by the officials of the archives. You can understand, Sir, that to sort out the documents of State departments is a very responsible task. If a mistake is made it can have repercussions in this House and the Minister concerned can be held responsible for any documents that have been injudiciously discarded. Because the sorting of these documents has to be done under the supervision of the Archives Commission, the Government feels that it is only right that in this case too it should have the right to appoint the chairman of that commission, in view of the fact that the Archives Commission will in future carry a greater responsibility.</p>

<p>Those are the main provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a second time.</p>

<block name="quote">The Marriage Act of 1961 has now been in operation for two years already and we have therefore had the opportunity of seeing how it works in practice. So far the Act has operated very well indeed, but, as always happens, some people do not always attach the same meaning to words as others. This Bill provides <i>inter alia</i> that no marriage officer shall solemnize a marriage unless both parties to the marriage have had their banns called in the church to which he or she belongs. As we all know, the object of having banns called is to make it known to all interested parties that the parties concerned intend to get married, so that if anybody wants to object to the marriage he has an opportunity of doing so. The parties are usually best known in the congregations to which they belong and consequently the notification of the intended marriage will naturally serve its best purpose if given in such a congregation. But it has happened, however&#x2014;as a matter of fact it happens daily&#x2014;that a person is a member of a certain congregation or church society but that he practises his religion in a church in another congregation, or that he attends another church society and in this way his banns are called in a church to which he does not belong. It is felt that this may give rise to legal difficulties and this measure is introduced in order to eliminate any possibility of any illegal marriage. That is why provision is made in Clause 1 for a party to an intended marriage also to have his banns called in the congregation where, in the opinion of the minister of the congregation concerned, he usually practises his religion. I think this provision is much more in line with reality and it leaves every person free to practise his religion according to his own conviction.</block>

<p>The measure furthermore places the validity of all such marriages that may possibly have been solemnized illegally beyond any doubt except in those cases where a competent court has already declared such a marriage invalid. I may just say that neither I nor my Department know of any marriage that has been declared illegal, and this step is only taken to prevent such a possibility.</p>

<p>A second practical problem is also being met in this Bill. That is in connection with the person who sometimes undertakes the service in a congregation. In terms of the existing provision in the Act a substitute who leads the service may call the marriage banns but he can apparently not issue a certificate that he did so. To put this beyond any doubt as well, it is provided that such a substitute be specifically empowered to issue such a certificate and to decide, for the purpose of calling the banns, whether or not the parties usually practise their religion in that congregation. These amendments can only have the effect of preventing any possible embarrassment to married couples. That is the object of this Bill.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Sir it gives me great pleasure to introduce this Bill. Hon. members who have read this Bill, particularly hon. members who are connected with the Bar or the Side-Bar, no matter on which side of the House they sit, will, I believe, heartily welcome the provisions of this Bill. We who belong or who have belonged to the legal profession know, of course, what problems confront the advocate who has a flourishing practice and who is called to the Bench, in many cases at a salary&#x2014;I admit there are exceptions&#x2014;less than he earned at the Bar. This Bill now tries to amend the 1959 Act which governs these cases. Hon. members who know the 1959 Act will know that it deals in the main with three aspects, firstly, with the salaries of judges, secondly, with the pensions of judges and, thirdly, with the pensions of the widows of judges. Hon. members will notice that this Bill only deals with the first two, the salaries and pensions of judges, and that it does not deal with the pensions of widows. I immediately want to anticipate the question why it does not.</p>

<p>The reply to that is that in terms of the 1959 Act where it is a question of the pensions of judges&#x2019; widows it is a contributory scheme. Judges, just like members of Parliament and Senators, contribute to the pensions that will ultimately be paid to their widows. At the moment that amount is laid down at R8 in the 1959 Act. I have informed judges that if they wish to make an increased contribution in terms of the provisions of Section 59, I shall be prepared, without committing myself in any way at this stage because I first want to go into the whole aspect after I have received their replies, to investigate the matter, if they indicate that they want to make increased contributions, or to amend the Act so as to make such increased contributions possible and to revise the widows pensions along those lines and bring them in relation to the increased contributions. That is my reply should hon. members ask me why steps are only taken in respect of the first two and not in respect of the third aspect.</p>

<p>Because this Bill deals with the Bench, with Judges and with the Supreme Court of South Africa, I hope, Sir, that in spite of the fact that it has nothing to do directly with this Bill, you will allow me to make a few observations about the Bench in South Africa, observations which I believe are fitting to make at this stage and which I believe should be made in this House. It is namely this that we in this country, no matter which party has been in power, have every reason to be proud of the way in which the Supreme Court has always in the past and still to-day, performed its duties. I think we all rejoice not only in that knowledge but in the fact that we can say to the world that here in South Africa, even perhaps under the most difficult circumstances, we have a Bench which is completely independent and that judges realize that and that in no circumstances will they hesitate to mete out justice according to their convictions, whether it pleases man or not; that we have always had judges who interpret the law as they see it in the light that is given them, whether it pleases the Government or not. As long as you have such a Bench, Sir, you have every reason to be thankful and you must at all times very jealously guard the interests of such a Bench. Because I as Minister have the highest esteem and respect for the Bench, not only as an institution, but for the judges as individuals, I have on various occasions, and again only recently, expressed myself very strongly against the organization known as the International Society of Jurists which has had the temerity to send people to South Africa to come and see, it was alleged, how justice was administered in practice here in South Africa.</p>

<p>No, we have nothing to hide, but what sticks in my throat&#x2014;and I was very grateful that those newspapers which otherwise do not support the Government, adopted the same attitude&#x2014;is the way they acted. We have nothing to hide and our courts are always open for anybody to enter to see how justice is administered. But what I take strong exception to is the fact that those people asked for a special permit to come and see what was happening in the courts of South Africa, and the implication of that, of course, is very clear. You only ask for such a special permit if you wish to insinuate thereby that everything is not above board. Otherwise there was no reason for them whatsoever to have asked for such a permit. Funnily enough those same <span class="col_1283-1284" refersTo="page_0656"/>people had come here in the past without asking for a permit. They came of their own free will and attended the courts and nobody objected. The only thing that I resented, and I resented it on behalf of the General Bar Council and the various Bar Councils of South Africa, was the fact that in the past so-called &#x201C;observers&#x201D; had come to South Africa and they did not even have the elementary courtesy&#x2014;I asked the Bar Councils and that is why I can speak with authority&#x2014;of even introducing themselves to the senior members of either the Johannesburg or the Pretoria Bar. That is not the way to act. Because I felt that courtesy called for it I expressed myself very strongly on that and I again wish to express myself strongly on it. I must say that when the latest &#x201C;observer&#x201D; came to South Africa he, I believe, after I had taken very strong exception to it, introduced himself to the Bar Council and he also asked for an interview with me. I granted him the interview and I told him exactly what I have told hon. members to-night in this House, namely, that I took the strongest exception to the fact that people wanted to drag in our judicature and place it under suspicion and to interfere in our judicature in that way. I did not mince words. I told their representative, a certain Mr. Arnholdt, that in my office at Pretoria in very strong language. As far as I am concerned I shall at all times resist it when our courts of law are interfered with and made suspect.</p>

<p>To return to the Bill, hon. members will know that in the 1959 Act, in the First Schedule of it, both the salaries and pensions of judges are laid down. Hon. members will notice that according to the Schedule the pensions were a fixed amount in the past. In the case of the Chief Justice it was a fixed amount of &#x00A3;1,800 per annum, and in the case of an Appeal judge &#x00A3;1,700 and in the case of the Judge President it was &#x00A3;1,600 and in the case of an ordinary judge &#x00A3;1,500. It made no difference how long he had served the amount was fixed. [Interjections.] I think hon. members have developed a complex to go home early but I do not want them to get used to that. According to the new Bill the position will be that the salaries will still be determined in terms of the existing Act, provided that where a Chief Justice received &#x00A3;5,500 or R11,000 he will now receive R12,500, an Appeal judge R11,500, the Judge President R10,500 and an ordinary judge R10,000. In other words, there is a salary increase of R1,500 in each case. I do not think hon. members will fight with me because we are now increasing the salaries after they were considered in 1959. I think where we are now dealing with the pensions, hon. members will admit that the first attempt is now made in this Bill to place the pensions of judges on a sound basis inasmuch as we are now dealing here with a fixed amount, but that the pensions of judges will be determined according to a scale which hon. members will find in the Bill. That is also why it is being taken out of the Schedule where it has appeared in the past and incorporated in this Bill.</p>

<p>Hon. members will find the provision governing those pensions in sub-section (2) of Clause 1 of the Bill, the clause which amends Section 3 of the 1959 Act. I shall read the clause because it states it very clearly. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Yeoville asks why I want to read it. I am doing so because I know my colleagues in this House very well. Hon. members do not read their Bills. (Laughter.) Furthermore I want to save hon. members the trouble of reading the Bill. One good deed from the one side invites a similar deed from the other side. The hon. member wanted to save me something, and now I am saving him something. I read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Such pension shall be paid monthly at the rate of twenty per cent per annum of the annual salary&#x2026;.</block>

<p>I shall not read the whole clause because time does not permit my doing so nor is it necessary for hon. members to know what it says.</p>
