Similarly a warning radio talk by the Deputy-Secretary for Coloured Affairs was broadcast on the 21st February, 1969 followed by a press release on the 22nd and a rebroadcast on the Protea programme on the 23rd February, 1969.

<heading>EXPROPRIATION OF MINERAL RIGHTS (TOWNSHIPS) BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 2 deals with the circumstances under which mineral rights may be expropriated and certain consequential procedures. Although the hon. the Minister yesterday was frank enough to say that I should talk to the hon. member for Wonderboom and not to him, I will address myself to the hon. the Minister. The position in terms of clause 2 is that the first offer to the owner of mineral rights is an offer which is made by the Administrator of the province with the concurrence of the hon. the Minister of Community Development, but the basis of the offer is the value fixed by the Minister of Mines. There is no discretion vested in the hon. the <span class="col_6225-6226" refersTo="page_0260"/>Minister or in the Administrator. As the Minister will see from clause 2 (1) (a), the value is determined by the Minister of Mines. If the owner or owners cannot be located or cannot be dealt with by direct contact or direct negotiation, the Bill provides that the Administrator may cause a notice to be published in the <i>Gazette</i> indicating what he assesses to be the value of the mineral rights.</p>

<p>Then the clause goes on to say that if there is no acceptance of the offer, the Administrator may expropriate. Sir, I find a difficulty arising in sub-section (4) where it is provided that the provisions of certain sections of the Expropriation Act shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply. The hon. the Minister, in this Bill, has inserted certain sections of the Expropriation Act which deal solely with the method of giving notice and the effect of the notice and matters of that sort. It will be seen that the hon. the Minister in his Bill makes provision that section 7 (2) shall apply only as far as the Expropriation Act is concerned. It seems to me that is a wrong procedure, and I would like to draw the hon. the Minister’s attention to what he is doing in fact. The Expropriation Act provides in section 7 (1), as amended in 1968, for what should be done in the absence of compensation being agreed upon, and section 7 (2) which the Minister now wishes to apply, and not 7 (1), provides for what should happen if no application is made to court for a determination of the compensation. Sir, you cannot have 7 (2) applying without 7 (1). They would be contradictory in terms if section 7 (1) which provides for the right to go to court to determine the compensation is eliminated from this Bill. There is a problem of procedure because of the fact that the Bill before us is intended to deprive the owner of mineral rights of the normal procedure of having his compensation determined either by arbitration or by the courts. I believe that the Minister would be well advised to allow section 7 and section 8 of the Expropriation Act to apply to expropriations under these circumstances. I know that the hon. the Minister may have some difficulty at this stage in giving me an answer on this matter, but I propose to move an amendment: To substitute in line 33 the figures 7 and 8 for 7 (2): in other words, that the procedure is that if there is no agreement on compensation, then under the Expropriation Act which applies in other circumstances where the State expropriates for public purposes, there is a right to go to court and, with section 8 being applicable, there is a basis upon which the valuation or the compensation should be determined. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 33, page 4, to omit &#x201C;7 (2)&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;7, 8&#x201D;.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>What the hon. member is proposing in that amendment, basically amounts to whether we should permit these people to go to court if they are not satisfied. I just want to point out that the object of this legislation as a whole is to prevent the owners of mineral rights from taking such steps as may either hamper township development or make it too expensive. These are the two major considerations. If we could expropriate and if it were merely a question of our wanting to prevent them from hampering township development, I should have had no objection to the hon. member’s amendment, but the other important question, which is really the important question, is to prevent the owners of mineral rights from taking such steps as may cause the price of plots in a new township to become too expensive. What is the hon. member asking for? He is asking that they should have the right to go to court, and he is asking for ordinary arbitration. Sir, the arbitration process is an expensive one, and if one allows him to go to court, it is an even more expensive process. It may be found later on that the court costs and the arbitration costs come to more than the cost of the land. That is why we decided not to permit that form of arbitration and not to permit these people to go to court. After all, what is involved in this Bill? In practice it is to develop areas in respect of which geologists and everybody are satisfied that township development is more important than mineral development. In other words, when they decide that township development is more important, it goes without saying that there is very little hope of there being any economically exploitable mineral deposits in the soil. If the geologists and the experts of the Department of Mines were to ascertain that there are minerals which can be exploited economically, then it stands to reason, surely, that the exploitation of such minerals would be more important than the development of townships. In such a case the Administrator will not intervene, but if they decide that those minerals cannot be exploited economically, it stands to reason that the establishment of townships is more important. Who is in a better position to ascertain this than are the experts of the Department of Mines? If it were any other form of expropriation, I would be in complete agreement with the hon. member for Green Point, but I have a responsibility and my problem is to try to make plots available as cheaply as possible. In my mind I am completely convinced that we cannot under any circumstances do an injustice to the owners of mineral rights. We cannot do so for the simple reason that, if the Department of Mines&#x2014;the people who are most anxious to exploit and develop minerals&#x2014;were to see that there was the slightest possibility of developing those minerals, they would be the last department to advocate the development of townships. That is why, if the interests of the owners of mineral rights are looked after, there can be no better arbitrator than the Department of Mines. Therefore, if we were to accent the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point, we would from a practical point of view be putting into operation machinery which could hardly serve to protect the owners of mineral rights. The only purpose this could <span class="col_6227-6228" refersTo="page_0261"/>serve, would be to push the price of that land, together with the attendant additional costs, higher and higher. Under those circumstances I am not prepared to accept that amendment.</p>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is a problem in connection with the assessment of value in terms of clause 2, where the Minister may decide on the possible potential value of land. Hon. members are aware that the position in regard to minerals varies from time to time. The hon. the Minister referred to the geologists of the Department of Mines who would assess the value of such an area. However, I must say that, if we were to think back on the history of the Witwatersrand, we would see that in 1890 the ore formations of the Witwatersrand did not really have any value, on account of the fact that there were certain metallurgical problems. At that time people adopted a quite pessimistic attitude to the gold reefs of the Witwatersrand, as it was thought that the ore could not be extracted from the soil. The development and the exploitation of those minerals were only rendered possible through technological development. No mining engineer and no geologist can say to-day what the value of some mining product or other which is nil at present, would be in the future, for the simple reason that the geologist or mining engineer in question is not in a position to assess the future economic development of such a mineral deposit or the demand for such a mineral. I should like to substantiate this with particulars. I am thinking of uranium, for instance. When uranium was discovered in our gold reefs in 1924, people said that this mineral was only of academic value and that it had no economic value. Hon. members are aware of the role which uranium plays in our national economy to-day. I could mention many other cases. For instance, I am thinking of the Murchison Range in the Northern Transvaal. In the time of Oom Paul Kruger and the Transvaal Republic gold was mined there, whereas very little or no gold is being mined there at present. However, at present antimony as a primary product is being mined at the same spot. The same applies to the Witwatersrand, for instance, and I assume that that is the real problem as regards the establishment of townships in that area. To-day, in this atomic age in which we are living, we do not know what the demand or need for osmiridium, one of the by-products of the Witwatersrand ores, will be in the future. For that reason I think that it will sometimes be very difficult for the people of to-day to determine what the value of such a mineralized zone is. That is why it is a fact in the history of the mining industry that any mining company will, for instance, freeze its mineral proposition for a period, until such time as there is a sufficient demand for that particular product which can be mined in that mine. It appears to me as though we are dealing here with an unfair measure as regards those people who hold that mining proposition, in spite of the fact that it is temporarily nonproductive. However, owing to economic conditions it may become productive later on. Here I am thinking, for instance, of many gold mines on the Witwatersrand which are not productive to-day on account of the fact that the gold price is too low and that the gold can therefore not be mined economically. If the gold price is increased one day so that it may be worth-while to process, say, 1.5 or 2.5 dwt., that mine could resume production. I want to conclude by saying that as far as the mineral industry is concerned, we are to a certain extent labouring under a misconception in the sense that it is not possible for one to say at a given juncture that a mine has been worked out or is defunct. One simply cannot think of a mine being exhausted completely. It is economic and political conditions which cause mining activities to be discontinued.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I disagree completely with the hon. member for Etosha. As regards the socio-economic aspects for which provision is being made in this legislation, i.e. to facilitate housing for the community, it would be short-sighted to say that in years to come there might be a possibility of these minerals being exploited profitably. This clause was inserted with a view to those areas where there are, so to speak, no minerals. In most cases we will find that there are no minerals. It deals with the right to the mineral rights of persons who possess mineral rights and have the opportunity of pushing up the price of land to such an extent that it bears no relation to the real value of such land. This is basically the reason for this legislation. This clause makes it very clear that the Departments of Mines and Community Development will act in conjunction with each other. Surely, if the mineral wealth does exist, the Department of Mines will never permit that area to be declared suitable for the establishment of a township. This clause is in the interests of the development we are experiencing in South Africa now. We are experiencing to-day an era of new points of growth all over the Republic. The shortage of residential sites is not a result of the action taken by the local authorities of smaller towns. The potential was provided overnight. I am thinking, for instance, of Newcastle and many other places in South Africa where a need for sites has virtually arisen overnight. That is why it is so essential that the machinery be made available for investigating all manner of possibilities in order that the establishment of townships may be expedited. I find it a pity, though, that provision has not been made for this legislation to be applied in respect of the establishment of industrial areas, particularly as far as our border industry development is concerned.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am indebted to this hon. member for Etosha for his contribution. He has had a wide experience in dealing with this question of mineral rights and with the unpredictable. But the Minister himself has made some rather startling statements this afternoon. First of all he said that he was going to expropriate in such a manner as would not increase the price of land. But, surely, what he ought to be concerned with here is to pay the owner of mineral rights a fair and reasonable price for those rights. That ought to be his primary consideration. For him the conflict lies in the fact that the surface rights and the mineral rights are owned by two different people. So, when one of these has to surrender his rights he has, surely, to be paid a fair and equitable amount for that. Another astounding statement statement made by the hon. the Minister is that the geologist of the Department of Mines would indicate whether a particular mineral right has any value. Well, Sir, I am afraid he is claiming for the geologist more than he would claim for himself. After all, why have we invested so much money in Soekor if the geologist can tell us where oil is? I say the hon. the Minister is on two very weak premises if he argues against me on those lines.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the expropriation of mineral rights and the expropriation of a piece of ground required for public purposes? I should Like the hon. the Minister to accept that the procedure should be the same for both. Let me elaborate on this procedure. First of all, an offer will be made equal to a figure determined by the Department of Mines. If that is not acceptable there will be a second figure determined by the Administrator in conjunction with the hon. the Minister and with the hon. Minister of Mines. After that the Administrator can make the final decision. This procedure is not applied to any other expropriations in terms of our law. Of course, there are difficulties which I can appreciate. But the Expropriation Act took cognizance of that. Hence the provision that if agreement cannot be reached the amount shall be determined in terms of section 7 (3) of that Act, i.e. by a magistrate below a certain figure, otherwise by a judge. The Act furthermore provides that the magistrate or judge, as the case may be, may invoke the assistance of not more than two persons who are skilled and experienced in the matter to sit with them as assessors in an advisory capacity. This is not, I submit, an expensive procedure. After all, a man stands to be deprived of his rights, his rights of ownership and, surely, the least he can claim is the adjudication of an independent body. According to what the Minister has said this afternoon, what is his advise to the Administrator to be? His advice will be, &#x201C;Get these rights as goedkoop’ as you can because I do not want to push up the price of the land&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But you said that expropriation in terms of this legislation will take place in such a way as not to push up the price of land. That is what you said. What, then, is his advice to be to the Administrator? His advice will be, &#x201C;Get it as cheaply as you can. Pay as little as you can because I do not want the land to be too highly priced in the proposed township&#x201D;. Therefore, I think the hon. Minister should give serious consideration to this. He is already applying the Expropriation Act in a number of clauses of this Bill and I see no reason why the whole of section 7 and 8 of that Act cannot also be applied. We know that the hon. member for Etosha has had a vast experience with minerals in South-West Africa and with the difficulty in determining mineral rights. In the circumstances, the Minister will be well advised to accept this amendment and allow the normal procedure to run its course.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>First of all I want to deal with the argument advanced by the hon. member for Etosha. I am in complete agreement with him that it is impossible to say where we are going to find minerals in the future and where we are not going to do so. It is absolutely impossible to say. But the practical implication of this is that in that case we should not establish townships anywhere, that we should not proceed with the establishment of townships at all, because, if we were to establish a township here in the Cape Flats, I do not know whether oil, gold, uranium or a mineral which is yet to be discovered may still be found there. Therefore I say that one cannot argue on those lines. The fact of the matter is that the establishment of townships must proceed and that we must make do with the knowledge we have to-day. After all, we must house people and that is why we must, in the light of the knowledge we have, do what is best. Therefore, while theoretically speaking I agree with the hon. member for Etosha, I want to know, when we come to <span class="col_6231-6232" refersTo="page_0263"/>the practical question of the value of mineral rights, who else I can consult if not the Department of Mines?</p>

<p>Why did the hon. member for Green Point not vote against the Second Reading of this Bill?</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I asked for arbitration.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is now arguing that we are spending millions through Soekor in our search for oil, and that it is not possible for us to know where oil may be found. But where am I to establish townships? Therefore this is an absurd argument, surely. The thing I should like the hon. member for Green Point to grasp, is that the Administrator has to determine what is more important: mineral development or the establishment of townships on a given piece of land? How does the Administrator arrive at such a conclusion? In the first place, he consults with the Department of Mines. Then that Department investigates the position thoroughly. When can the development of minerals be the more important factor? When minerals can be exploited there on an economic basis. Under those circumstances the exploitation of minerals is more important and a township will not be established. On the other hand, however, the Department of Mines may tell the Administrator that the development of minerals on a specific piece of land is not an economic proposition. And they can only arrive at that conclusion on the strength of the knowledge they have at present and not with the knowledge they might have in ten, twenty, forty, fifty, or even a hundred years’ time. It is, of course, possible that calculations may be changed as a result of knowledge we may still gain. For instance, there is the case of Oklahoma which the hon. member mentioned yesterday. In that city it was only after the city itself had been developed and skyscrapers had already been erected that they discovered that oil could be extracted there. But these are problems which have to be met as and when they arise.</p>

<p>What the hon. member for Green Point wants is that provision should be made here for arbitration, that it should be possible to take the matter to court. But can he imagine the drawn-out process in which this may result? Surely, the courts have already decided on this matter by saying that they are not in a position to determine what the mineral rights on a given piece of land are. That was before this legislation. Now the hon. member wants the courts to decide on the price. But how will the courts do this? They will do so by calling as witnesses all the geologists of the Department of Mines. Similarly, the owner will obtain the services of geologists, perhaps from abroad, to strengthen his case. And yet the hon. member for Etosha, who is a well-known geologist, admits that one cannot determine these things with any degree of certainty. But the hon. member for Green Point wants a drawn-out court case, which is completely impracticable and will push up the price of the land tremendously. I am not at all impressed by the accusation levelled by the hon. member for Green Point who said that I would instruct the Administrator to try to obtain the land as cheaply as possible. As far as I am concerned, I hope he obtains it as cheaply as possible. However, that is no concern of mine. They are advised by the Department of Mines. After all, if mineral rights cannot be exploited economically, I cannot see that such great value can be attached to them. Theoretically the hon. member is right, but in practice his argument does not hold water. Therefore I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to point out that the hon. member for Green Point is basing his argument on a totally wrong premise. His argument is based on the premise that it will be the Administrator’s sole aim to alienate mineral rights. However, if he were to read clause 2 (1) (a) properly, he would see that there are three ways in which the final stage can be reached. The first is for the owner of the mineral rights and the surface owner to agree that the owner of the mineral rights consents to the development of the surface area, and for the owner of the mineral rights to grant that consent without any disposal of or change in rights and without any payment of compensation. What does that mean? It means that the owner of mineral rights remains in full possession and control of his rights. He receives no compensation and his rights are not alienated. That is his first alternative. His second alternative, as determined in the Bill, is that he may, by way of negotiation with the surface owner, come to an agreement and agree on a price, in which process money will change hands and rights will be disposed of as well. Thirdly, if no agreement can be reached, all that remains is the question of alienation. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister that the procedure proposed by the hon. member for Green Point is a drawn-out and an expensive process. This is a delaying process which, in terms of the establishment of townships, may sometimes cost hundreds of thousands of rands. This will eventually have to be recovered from the person who will buy that site. For that reason the procedure proposed in the Bill is, to my way of thinking, a shortcut for coming to an equitable agreement. The hon. member for Green Point may not know this, but in the Transvaal it is already a requirement that the plans in respect of every new township which is submitted for establishment purposes, must be accompanied by a geological survey report. In some cases it is required that a programme of drillings be launched in order to determine the subterranean structure of the piece of land in question, should there be any dispute in regard to the matter.</p>

<p><span class="col_6233-6234" refersTo="page_0264"/>Only when it appears that that right is not one which can be developed in the public interest, do these powers of the Administrator come into play. The hon. member for Green Point made a contemptible remark in saying that the hon. the Minister would now offer the lowest compensation possible. In clause 2 (1) (a) it is clearly provided that the Minister of Mines will determine that compensation. He is the person who, in the first place, is best qualified to determine the value of those mineral rights.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that if we were to look at this matter in terms of time and the future, it will be impossible for us to lay out any townships in the Transvaal. It is my considered opinion that subterranean gold is to be found all over the Transvaal, but it is situated at very great depths. Ten or twenty years ago we would never have been able to think that we would have a Western Deep Level at 12,000 feet, but techniques are improving all the time. This means that in another ten years’ time it will perhaps be possible for us to do development work at depths of 25,000 or 30,000 feet. It is my considered opinion that subterranean gold and coal deposits are to be found practically all over the Transvaal. If that is the case, it will be impossible for us to establish any townships anywhere in the Transvaal. Consequently we cannot tie ourselves down to the needs of the owner of mineral rights in the year 2,000 or 3,000. Where does the hon. member suggest we should live in the meantime? Therefore I shall also reject that amendment, because it is based on a false premise.</p>

<p>Amendment put and negatived.</p>

<p>Clause, as printed, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Wonderboom correctly set out the stages to be followed up to an attempt to arrive at an agreement as to compensation. Where that compensation has not been agreed upon this clause 3 becomes operative. This is the clause which says that the compensation for mineral rights expropriated under the last-mentioned section shall on the application of the owner of those rights be determined by the Administrator in consultation with the Minister of Community Development and the Minister of Mines after the consideration of written representations. Now, I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Community Development to consider what is done in his own Department where it is necessary to buy in a property which has changed hands because of the proclamation of a group area. The Minister knows what happens in his own Department. His departmental officials do not fix the value. Valuers are appointed by his Department to inspect the property and to make a price, and if that price is not acceptable as the basic value, then his own Department allows a right of appeal to an independent revision court to revise the value for expropriation or for taking over under the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p>The reason for that is quite obvious. The Minister knows what happened in his own Department where these values are fixed on ministerial consultation with the Administrator. I need only mention one instance to show what injustices can result. When property in the Strand was acquired by his Department from disqualified Coloured persons for something like R10,000, which was the value fixed by his Department as a fair value, it was sold by his Department for R100,000. He knows that happens, and it happens because the valuations are fixed department ally. I believe here we will have the same problem if the value is fixed by the Administrator in consultation with the Minister of Community Development and the Minister of Mines, and under subsection (2) the determination is then final. There can be no review or appeal. I believe it will lead to a great deal of dissatisfaction and there will be great justification for complaint.</p>

<p>I am going to suggest to the hon. the Minister that this is the clause where at least he can accept an amendment of the nature of the one I moved to the previous clause and which he was not prepared to accept then, namely that where we have gone through these procedures and we have got to the stage of making an offer of compensation as determined by the Administrator in consultation with the two Ministers, this subsection (2) should be deleted and that there should be substituted a provision that if the owner or owners of the mineral rights do not accept the compensation determined in terms of subsection (1), then the provisions of sections 7 and 8 of the Expropriation Act of 1965 shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply. I want to move that as an amendment so that the determination shall not be final, but that there should be this right of appeal to a body outside of those directly concerned. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit subsection (2) and to substitute the following subsection:</block>

<block name="quote">(2) If the owner or owners of the mineral rights do not accept the compensation determined in terms of subsection (1), the provisions of sections 7 and 8 of the Expropriation Act, 1965 (Act No. 55 of 1965), shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you may think that I am deviating from the principle, but what I am saying is that the principle of this clause should remain, that is to say, the compensation shall be determined by the Administrator, but what I say is that the decision should not be final; that there should be this right under sections 7 and 8. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I believe this is a matter that needs serious consideration. I must apologize that these amendments do not appear on <span class="col_6235-6236" refersTo="page_0265"/>the Order Paper, they were given to the Minister just before lunch. If the hon. the Minister will tell me that he accepts that this is a matter that requires thought and consideration and that he will give it thought and consideration as to whether this should not follow the pattern of the Expropriation Act, then I am not going to press the hon. the Minister for a reply at this stage. If he tells me that this is a matter which needs to be considered and that it is a matter which can be dealt with in the Other Place, I should be grateful to him, because I believe it is something that warrants further consideration by the hon. the Minister and his Department.</p>

<p>Sir, I think we argued this point completely and fully on the previous clause. There I explained why I thought it would be unsound to allow the parties either to go to court or to go to arbitration. I told the hon. member the other day that I would seriously consider this. I have considered it very seriously. I had discussions this morning with the Chamber of Mines, who also brought up this point, and after a very full discussion it was clearly my impression that they agreed that it was most difficult in these circumstances to go to court. You cannot compare these mineral rights with surface rights. In the case of surface rights it is fairly easy to arrive at a valuation. You have your valuators and if they differ then it is easy to go to arbitration. But here you have something completely different. You have to call in geologists and I do not know who else to give evidence. But I give the hon. member the assurance that I will go into the matter again, and if there is the slightest possibility that I can meet him, I will do so in the Other Place.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to raise one or two matters with the hon. the Deputy Minister for clarification. As the law is at the present moment, a proclamation must apply to specific and separately identified buildings, land or premises. The powers are now changed in regard to the specifications of such buildings, land or premises to what one might term a blanket directive, namely to include all buildings, land and premises in a demarcated area in a proclamation. The right then to occupy in that whole area and not in respect of the individual buildings, becomes restricted in so far as disqualified persons are concerned only to the exemptions under section 26 of the principal Act. Two problems arise, and I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us more information in this regard.</p>

<p>Firstly, does this blanket proclamation now prevent the Minister from giving rights of access to or excluding specific buildings such as a church, a communal centre, etc., which may be used by various racial groups and which may be in a proclaimed area? Will this lead to any difficulties? Let us assume that there is a city hall which is situated in a white group area, but which has been used and is permitted to be used for various purposes by members of other race groups. Does this blanket provision prevent that use continuing as it has been in the past? I believe the hon. the Deputy Minister has considered the matter and that he will be able to give us a reply.</p>

<p>The other problem which arises is whether clause 3 (1) does not conflict with section 26 (3) (a) of the Group Areas Act. Section 26 (3) (a) of the Group Areas Act states the following:</p>

<block name="quote">The State President may by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> exempt from the operation of subsection (1) disqualified persons of any class or group, either generally or in relation to land or premises situated in any particular area or lawfully occupied by persons of any other class or group &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, section 26 (3) (a) of the principal Act seems to envisage that there would be a separate proclamation affecting separate buildings or separate pieces of land. This clause, as it now is, appears to conflict with that provision in that that exclusion will not arise. If the hon. the Deputy Minister can satisfy us that that difficulty will not arise, then of course there is no objection to this clause as it stands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as regards the first question, the position is very clear. A proclamation is issued proclaiming an area a designated area under section 19 of the principal Act. Subsequent to that proclamation notice has to be given to the individual owners of the different premises that those premises are going to be used for a particular purpose. Therefore the date of the proclamation is not the date on which it is said that the premises should be used only for one purpose or the other. It is only proclaimed a designated area, and subsequent to that the occupier must again be given three months’ notice that those premises should only be used <span class="col_6237-6238" refersTo="page_0266"/>for a particular purpose. The examples of a mosque or a synagogue were mentioned. If a mosque is situated in a certain area and a notice is not served on the society, the people may still have the use of that mosque. Therefore there is no difficulty as far as that is concerned. The problem which the hon. member mentioned in connection with section 26 (3) (a) concerns another kind of area. This section only deals with the particular area mentioned in section 19 of the principal Act, that is a designated area, and it has no bearing whatsoever on section 26 of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 35, after &#x201C;servant&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;(other than a domestic servant employed in respect of a detached single dwelling and occupying part of the premises or outbuildings comprising such dwelling)&#x201D;</block>

<p>This clause is designed to give to the Minister powers to impose conditions regarding visitors to domestic servants and also conditions regarding the visitors of an employee. Both of these classes, namely the domestic servant and the employee, have the legal status to occupy premises in a white group area by virtue of the conditions of section 26 of the principal Act. During the Second Reading debate I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he would indicate what type of regulations he envisaged he would like to apply to domestic servants. I must say that the answer he gave was quite surprising. Let us look at what the hon. the Deputy Minister is seeking to do. Firstly he said that a visitor should not visit a domestic servant while that domestic servant is working.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_planning">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>I mentioned it as a possibility.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as a possibility. It shows how the hon. the Deputy Minister’s mind is working. My domestic servant is in my service continuously and I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister realized what he was suggesting, namely that he wanted regulations to control servants to that extent. The hon. the Deputy Minister also suggested that visitors should not be allowed to stay overnight. What earthly harm is there if the husband of my non-white employee comes from up-country and spends the night with his wife in my servant’s quarters? Is that such a terrible crime? Is that a matter that should be prohibited? I want the hon. the Deputy Minister to realize that most of the domestic servants who live in, and I now refer particularly to private dwellings, reside permanently at their owners’ residences. Is the hon. the Deputy Minister really serious when he considers bringing in regulations of that kind? Thirdly the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned the question of the duration of these visits. He knows the periods that are permitted. There is a period of 90 days for a <i>bona fide</i> visitor under section 26 of the principal Act. A visitor can come into these areas for 90 days, although he is a disqualified person and stay in these areas. I am puzzled over the attitude of the hon. the Deputy Minister as to what is contemplated by way of these regulations. I think he rather revealed himself when he suggested that a servant should have half a day per week off for recreation. Surely the hon. the Deputy Minister knows that nowadays domestic servants are not kept in the kitchen for 12 hours a day or alternating between the kitchen and their quarters. Servants are given time off during the day and they are not either in the kitchen or the servant’s room. That is the problem that the hon. the Deputy Minister does not see. He does not realize that that is the problem. I mention these matters because of the great difficulties with which the hon. the Deputy Minister is faced in formulating regulations. I believe that if the hon. the Deputy Minister had said to us yesterday that there would be regulations to see that there is no overcrowding in these communal residential areas attached to flats, he would have had almost complete support for regulations of that type. That is the cause of the evil. It is the overcrowding and not when they visit or whom they visit. As I indicated yesterday to the hon. the Deputy Minister, although what he is asking for is a permissive authority, namely the right to make regulations and that it may apply to single dwellings or complexes, I believe that this is so serious a matter that we must specifically and definitely exclude private dwellings, namely single dwellings, from the context of this regulation. Now, why do I say that? I can understand that in a block of flats where there is a communal residential area for servants. there is a necessity for some control by regulation, because there is no single employer who controls those quarters. One finds that one’s servant complains about the conduct of other servants, who may not be as well-behaved as she is. One can realize that where there is communal housing there may be the necessity for regulations. I can see that. I can also understand that you cannot exclude cases where the servants rooms are adjacent to the flats, because the domestic servant of one tenant might commit actions which affects the tenant next door. But I cannot see any reason why there should be any need for regulations which control the domestic servants who are employed in single dwellings. In single dwellings the servants’ quarters form part of the unit or the outbuildings of the dwelling unit. For that reason I move the amendment as it appears on the Order Paper. That servant is <span class="col_6239-6240" refersTo="page_0267"/>under the perpetual and direct control of the employer. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to look at this matter in the way we asked him to. This is an infringement of the exemption provisions of section 26. It is a lessening of the exemption provisions which are contained in the principal Act. I hope the hon. the Minister will see that this is not an unreasonable request. What is more, I hope that the hon. the Minister will see it as a request which should be granted by the Government, so that domestic servants who are employed in single dwellings should be excluded from any of the provisions of this particular clause. I want to ask the hon. members opposite what their feeling would be if, like we all have, they have had faithful servants who have been with them for years and years, and they suddenly find that by Government regulation they are told how they should treat the servants on their farm, their home or in their private dwelling. I am sure that it is unnecessary. It is unnecessary for the vast majority of the employers of domestic servants, because the control is there, they are part of the families and they work as such.</p>

<block name="quote">In line 44, after &#x201C;regarding&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;undesirable or illegal practices by&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The amendment which I have moved is largely consequential on the Minister’s accepting the amendment of the hon. member for Green Point. I agree with all that he has said. As regards the abuse of the domestic servants in rooms. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister has put it very well; it is probably a case of one in 1,000. We are now going to legislate for that one. While we are going to make use of domestic servants of different colours, we naturally must treat them with respect. We must not abuse the trust they have in us. The amendment that I am moving I think puts the amendment made by the Deputy Minister in its true perspective. What we are really against, is the undesirable practices of those visitors that make use of the various rooms of our domestics. Unfortunately there are the shebeens and other practices. But it does not only occur among the Coloureds or the Bantu; it also occurs among the Whites. In large hotels, where Whites are employed as servants, there is a certain amount of abuse. But here we are legislating against Coloureds. In order to test the sincerity of the amendment by the Minister, I should like to move the amendment standing in my name.</p>

<p>And visitors, but these are not in legal employment, obviously, if they are visitors. So he has these powers already. Believe me, they are more than adequately used. It never ceases to amaze me how Ministers and Deputy Ministers can make amendments to existing legislation and pass regulations, all of which involve the use of vast Police powers, without giving the matter a second thought, without considering the enormous amount of manpower tied up in the implementation of these regulations, not to mention the increase in the number of people hauled off in the police vans to be charged with these minor offences of trespassing. Here we have an extension of existing powers. The Deputy Minister has, to my knowledge anyway, not yet given any explanation as to why he requires these additional powers. Is he dissatisfied with the 1,600 arrests a day for pass and documentary offences in South Africa? Does he think he needs more powers for the Police, more utilization of their valuable time, which should, in fact, be employed in tracking down the real criminals, rather than people who are simply visiting their friends on domestic premises.</p>

<p>Apart from my not understanding the need for this measure, I want to say that I think this is a mean little clause.

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, but I must ask you to allow me to explain my objection to clause 6. This is what we are now discussing. The hon. the Deputy Minister is now including conditions regarding the visitors of a domestic servant. If I cannot discuss that, I cannot discuss the clause at all; because that is all the clause does. It extends, in terms of the proclamation of the State President, section 226 of the principal Act to include the visitors of domestic servants. This is what this clause is all about. What is the effect of this extension? All it does, is to remove any semblance of any right to normal married life of domestic servants to have their husbands, for instance, visit and stay with them.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I know the hon. the Deputy Minister considers that these are not, as a matter of fact, the superfluous appendages. These are people in employment. They are not unproductively employed, as the hon. the Deputy Minister does seem to think. These people release white women with skills and enable them to go out and contribute to the productive capacity of South Africa. The very fact that there are domestic servants doing these chores, enables white women to go out and do work. Therefore these are not unproductive people themselves and they are not superfluous appendages. Now they are to be forbidden by regulation, as the hon. member for Green Point pointed out, from having their own husbands come and visit them. What is the harm in this? Why does the Government have to regulate every facet of private life in South Africa? Why can they not leave well alone? That is what I want to know.</p>

But let us leave that to one side. It is just possible that it is the existence of the hon. the Deputy Minister that might be doing South Africa a lot of harm. He is certainly doing a great deal of harm to the average householder in South Africa by suggesting now that they must make conditions even more difficult for their domestic employees.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister may not approve of this, but he may find, as his colleague, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, found when he tried to deprive the electorate of Randburg of their domestic servants, that the people of South Africa&#x2014;not just liberals like me&#x2014;but the ordinary South African voter, does not approve of being legislated out of his domestic servants. He does not want it. Even the supporters of this Government in Randburg do not like it.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am back to the Bill, Sir. The hon. the Minister is making it more difficult for people to employ domestic servants in terms of this clause. He said himself that because the employer was not able to cope with the demands of domestic servants&#x2014; they have their friends and husbands visit them and stay overnight&#x2014;he was taking super powers to stop this from above. As I say, I think this is unnecessary in law. There is more than enough power already given to the Police to arrest trespassers. I think it is a mean little clause that the hon. the Minister is introducing.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, he talked glibly about the half day off per week&#x2014;&#x201C;minstens&#x201D; he said&#x2014;that employers ought to give their employees. Therefore he said, they can have all their recreation with their friends in their own areas. I wonder if he knows what this half day off per week means. Has he any idea of the time it takes for the average domestic servant to get back to his own area, to catch a bus into town, to take a train out to the township, either to walk a long way or take another bus before he even gets home? In the end, this half day per week boils down to a miserable hour or two spent at home, part of which is devoted, I can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister, to their own domestic chores, to doing shopping for the household and ever having a little bit of normal family life with their husband and children. Now where are these opportunities for ordinary social intercourse on this half day off per week? Does the hon. the Minister not have any idea of the reality of the situation? I would like him to spend one day in the shoes of an ordinary domestic servant in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not think he was one of the gentlemen who took a pride in doing his own washing up, as the Minister of Bantu Administration and the Minister of Health did at one stage. They may know what their capabilities extend to, but as far as I am concerned the hon. the Deputy Minister does not begin to appreciate just what it means to a servant to have to travel back home before she can enjoy any of the ordinary amenities of social life. As I said before, legally the Minister does not need this clause and he does not need it from any other point of view either. I do not believe the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point goes far enough. I think this should apply equally to domestic servants, whether they be in flats or in houses. Most blocks of flats have superintendents who are supposed to keep an eye on the domestic servants in the block, and as far as I am concerned I am going to vote against this clause <i>in toto.</i></p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>I want to start with what the hon. member for Salt River said. What his amendment amounts to is that the proclamation has to lay down the conditions regarding undesirable or illegal visitors. Now, in the first place, who are illegal visitors? Surely there has to be a definition in the Act for laying down who illegal visitors are. We all know that illegal visitors are people who offend against the Act, but in terms of the Act as it stands such a visitor may remain there for 90 days. One cannot determine the commencement of that period of 90 days, which makes this period virtually unlimited and which makes it impossible to prove that he is there illegally or that he has been there for longer than 90 days. Therefore it will not nay to use the word &#x201C;illegal&#x201D; here. &#x201C;Onwenslik&#x201D; is a word we do not know: it simply means &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D;. Who is &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D;? This is a very loose term and a definition will have to be included in the Act to define an undesirable person. Consequently we cannot write it into this legislation and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Salt River.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Green Point. I may say that he was so sweet-spoken and waxed so sentimental that one was practically moved to tears, but I do not know why he became so sentimental and sad. He asked me, in the first place, what kind of regulations I envisaged. Of course, I may say to him that at the moment I do not envisage any regulations, because the Minister of Community Development will be the person who will issue the regulations; that will be in his hands, and not in my hands. What kind of regulations he will issue will be in his hands, but the hon. member asked me what I envisaged. I told him the time might have arrived, for example, when visitors should not stay overnight; it might be unnecessary for them to stay overnight if they lived near by. We may say that they may not come to stay there without a permit. These are the kind of things which may be contained in the regulations, but I am not saying they will. Therefore I do not know why the hon. member elaborated on this matter.</p>

<p>I now come to his amendment. He now wants to restrict this only to servants in flats who receive visitors, but he does not want to extend it to visitors of servants in private dwellings. Let me take as an example the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town. As the hon. member knows, there are very few complexes of flats in the Northern Suburbs but we know that the police have already issued the very warning that conditions in private backyards in those residential areas in particular are such that there is a flocking together of visitors, or so-called visitors, of servants. Yesterday I mentioned an example why we could not accept this amendment either as private dwellings were the very places at which these difficulties arose. Perhaps one private owner does not care how many visitors his servant receives on the premises and there may be a whole congregation of visitors. We even know of cases where a shebeen was kept in the backyard and the owner simply did not care; he put up with it, but it offends the neighbours and it is not a good thing that this should happen. Yesterday I also mentioned to him the example of a domestic servant who said, &#x201C;I shall be your domestic servant, but if you are unable to accommodate my husband and children here as well, I cannot come to work for you.&#x201D; And that entire family lived there for more than a year. It is an impossible task to pinpoint the beginning and end of this period of 90 days, and these are the matters about which the police are concerned. That is why they are asking for more effective control. I think I have now elaborated sufficiently on this matter.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member for Houghton that I am of the opinion that this House no longer pays much attention to her stories. We have become tired of these, I may almost call them, nonsensical stories of our cruelty and cold-heartedness which we get from the Progressive Party time after time. She may go on talking; she is like a cicada round our ears and nobody pays any attention any longer to those stale stories of the Progressive Party. We know we have to implement the Act, and to tell us that we are cruel and intolerant achieves nothing. I want to make her understand this very clearly and very well, and I am not going to pay much attention to the unkind remarks she made here this afternoon either. There is no need for me to dwell any longer on what was said by the hon. member for Houghton. I may just say that the police once executed a raid in her own backyard and as from that time she has always been resentful of the police. [Interjections.] At the moment the position is that some domestic servants do not live in separate quarters; they live in rooms in certain houses. <span class="col_6243-6244" refersTo="page_0269"/>The visitors of the servants also come into those houses and there is a mixing of the races. We are very well aware that the hon. member for Houghton wants a mixing of the races in South Africa, but we do not want that. However, I am not going to pay any more attention to her and therefore I am not going to give her a further reply.</p>

<p>I may just say that we do not envisage restricting <i>bona fide</i> visitors. We only want to be in the position to round up <i>non-bona fide</i> visitors, the people who come there to live and not the people who come there to pay a visit, but those who abuse this section as it stands. I should like to make the position very clear to hon. members so that they may understand what it is about. Subsection (1) of section 26 provides that a disqualified person, one who is not allowed in that group area, may not live or occupy any premises in that group area. Subsection (2) makes provision for certain exceptions and grants certain exemptions; it grants four exemptions. Paragraph (a) mentions a <i>bona fide</i> employee of the State or of a staturory body. They are exempted. Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) refers to <i>bona fide</i> visitors. What they are granted is blank exemption. They may come to that area as <i>bona fide</i> visitors. Paragraph (c) refers to domestic servants; they are exempted and paragraph (d) refers to <i>bona fide</i> patients in hospitals and similar institutions. The domestic servants, however, are only exempted after a proclamation has been issued in respect of them by which they are exempted, and that proclamation states the conditions on which they are exempted. But such exemptions do not affect the visitors as the visitors are exempted by law. In the proclamation we cannot grant the visitors similar exemption as that granted to domestic servants. In their case we have the right in subsection (3) to impose conditions by proclamation, but not in respect of the visitors. Consequently it is now necessary for us to amend this Act in such a way that we may also impose the necessary conditions by proclamation as far as the visitors of domestic servants are concerned. In other words, in future we shall be able to treat domestic servants and visitors alike. This is the only thing we are envisaging. Visitors will still be allowed, but in terms of the regulations the visitor will probably have to have a permit to pay a visit in any group area in which he is a disqualified person.</p>

<p>I just want to react to one or two aspects of the reply of the hon. the Deputy Minister. His reasoning for the non-exclusion of private dwellings is certainly a most extraordinary one. Apparently now regulations are necessary so as to protect a private individual who wishes to employ a servant who may say, &#x201C;I will only come and work for you if my husband can stay with me&#x201D;. The Minister says that these regulations can now be used to ensure that the employer can then say, &#x201C;I am sorry, your husband cannot stay with you and you must come and work without your husband&#x201D;. Surely that is extraordinary reasoning. Sir, that is not controlling visitors. We on this side of the House are not prepared to accept the reasoning of the hon. the Deputy Minister that this regulation which is represented to us as being necessary to deal with the problem of locations in the sky and that sort of problem, is now apparently to be utilized to deal with vast areas of single residential dwellings, as in the northern areas of Cape Town, for example. That was not the purpose for which the Minister introduced the Bill at the Second Reading. He has not given us any reason why the amendment I have moved should not be accepted. As I indicated during the Second Reading, this amendment is a fundamental one so far as we on this side of the House are concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to focus attention on a very important aspect in the Fishcor annual report. Let me, incidentally, focus hon. members’ attention on the neat presentation of this annual report, with a photo on its cover of the project which was completed by Fishcor at the Berg River mouth last year. In content this annual report is perhaps the most rewarding of all the annual reports already published by Fishcor. The section of this report to which I specifically want to refer is that dealing with research. According to this an amount of about R444,000 was spent on a few facets of marine research. Firstly, there is maarsbanker/pilchard research; then experimental <span class="col_6249-6250" refersTo="page_0272"/>tuna fishing; then research in connection with shrimp and prawn fisheries; and, fourthly, the cultivation of oysters. In passing I just want to ask the Minister what the difference is between the research which Fishcor is doing here and ordinary marine research. I am not clear about what the difference is. As far as I know Fishcor is not usually concerned with research. Therefore I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could tell me what the difference is.</p>

<p>However, I want to restrict myself to the cultivation of oysters. In this annual report it was announced that the first consignment of oysters from the oyster breeding farms in the Knysna lagoon would be made available this season to lovers of this seafood. This is a very great achievement. Here we have the first results of calculated marine farming in South Africa, if I may use this term. Therefore I do not want to let this opportunity pass without referring to this achievement of Fishcor. It is not clear to me whether we should speak here of an oyster &#x201C;breeding farm&#x201D; or an oyster &#x201C;nursery&#x201D;. It is a scientific fact that the oyster can change its sex at will. If this could happen in this House the hon. members for Houghton and Wynberg would perhaps, on many days, unexpectedly find themselves in the majority in their battle for the emancipation of women. I have no certainty in this connection. This is a new science which is in the process of developing and time will tell whether one should speak of an oyster &#x201C;breeding farm&#x201D; or an oyster &#x201C;nursery&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In any case, the breeding of oysters is actually a very old culture. The Romans already knew about the breeding or cultivation of oysters in their day. In Holland this culture dates back to the year 1850. It is also a well-known fact that during the past few years, particularly in America and Japan, good results have been furnished by this facet of marine farming. I think that in America last year the artificial breeding of oysters was already yielding more than 15 million dollars. In South Africa this is not an industry which is only now yielding its first results either; repeated efforts were made in the past to furnish the necessary momentum to this industry. It is a scientific fact or, if I may use the term an historic fact, that on two occasions, i.e. in the year 1673 and subsequently in the year 1676 oysters were brought to Table Bay from our country’s south coast to see whether an oyster breeding farm or nursery could not be started. The first efforts in this connection were not very rewarding. In the year 1894 a second effort was made to import oysters by air to South Africa from abroad. This consignment was planted at the mouth of the Berg River where this beautiful project, which is pictured here on the front page of the Fishcor annual report, was completed. A portion of the consignment, which was brought from abroad, was planted at the Langebaan lagoon. But there no results were forthcoming either. In the year 1913, again, 4,000 indigenous oysters which were collected along our country’s south coast were also brought to this area to be bred artificially. This attempt also evidenced only initial success and subsequently it once more petered out. A long time elapsed after that before another attempt was made. In 1946 the late Mr. H. G. Bright went to Holland to survey the position there, where they were engaged in this artificial cultivation. A little later, in 1948, research was done to determine how suitable the Knysna vicinity would be for such an undertaking. Mr. Willem Dort, a very well-known Hollander, who kept an oyster breeding farm which contained these oysters, was brought to Knysna. He actually began the breeding farm in that vicinity. In 1949 a second attempt was made to import oysters by air and to take them to Knysna. On that occasion about 10,000 oysters were brought from France after the well-known Dr. Koringa had been to select and to collect the oysters for this consignment. They were subsequently brought to an area in the vicinity of Knysna. About 10 per cent of this consignment of oysters died. Since we have such a great variety of oysters in South Africa, one may ask: why endeavour to bring consignments of oysters for cultivation to South Africa from abroad? It is a wellknown fact that the European oyster actually has a much lovelier shape than the South African oyster. It has a soft shell and actually contains more meat than the South African oyster. The European oyster is also more suitable for breeding or cultivation, because it is available for the market within a period of three years after it is planted. On the other hand the South African oyster is only available for the market after the passage of five or six years. That is the reason why repeated endeavours have been made to bring oysters for cultivation to South Africa from abroad.</p>

<p>The next important step in the development pattern of oyster breeding in South Africa took place in 1953. After Fishcor had gained a 50 per cent interest in the Knysna undertaking, a breeding farm or nursery was started in that vicinity. Dr. Koringa, the world-famous expert in this field, then came from Holland to survey the conditions here and to give advice. He spent about six weeks here and his report about what could be done in the Knysna vicinity was an excellent one.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, I think that with This announcement, which is made in this Fishcor annual report, South Africa has come to the threshold of a situation where new momentum must be given in the future, through the medium of Fishcor, to this particular industry which has now proved that we in South Africa can continue successfully with this oyster cultivation. I now want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister that we should begin immediately with another and similar attempt, i.e. an oyster breeding farm or nursery in the Langebaan Lagoon. Recently a report appeared, under the aegis of the Department of Planning, which investigated all possible facets of future dispensations in respect of this <span class="col_6251-6252" refersTo="page_0273"/>beautiful long lagoon. In the report it was recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that efforts should be made to begin a fish hatchery in this long lagoon. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, last night I referred to the fact that in 1902 a Select Committee had been appointed by the old Cape Parliament to consider a report and a plan submitted by an engineer, Mr. C. W. Methven. His report was considered in considerable detail by the Select Committee. One of the witnesses called by that Select Committee was another engineer who was chief of the then Public Works Department of the Cape Colony and his name was Mr. W. Westhofen. He made certain criticisms of the plans put forward by Mr. Methven. He said that the Methven plan provided for 5½ acres of water at Kalk Bay at high tide and 4 acres of water at low tide. He maintained that those figures were inaccurate and according to certain depths he had had taken in the harbour area two and an eighth acre would be of one fathom depth, one and three-quarter acres of 1½ fathoms, 1¼ acres of two fathoms, only three-quarters of an acre of 2½ fathoms, which is a reasonable depth, and only a quarter acre of water at the depth of three fathoms. He even maintained that under Mr. Methven’s plan, accommodation would only be provided in the harbour for some 30 boats and he did not believe that that was sufficient for the requirements of the expanding industry. He maintained that unless a harbour was built big enough to accommodate at least 200 boats, no scheme should be proceeded with. He came forward with a plan of his own to the Select Committee. This is the plan I should like to recommend to the Minister and his department for their consideration. It appears in the Select Committee report, volume 2 of 1902. I shall only be too happy to discuss it with the hon. the Minister and his department at an appropriate time. Now, Mr. Westhofen’s plan provided for 8½ acres of water at high tide and 3½ acres of water at low tide. The 3½ acres of water at low tide would provide sufficient berthing accommodation for no fewer than a hundred boats. The gross cost of Mr. Westhofen’s scheme was to be £76,000 whereas the cost of Mr. Methven’s scheme was to be £45,000 at that time. If we exclude however from Westhofen’s scheme the area he proposed should be reclaimed from the seashore, and valuing it as he did, at £2,000 per acre, the toal scheme would have cost £65,000 in those days. Accommodation would have been provided for 220 boats.</p>

<p>Now, to cut a long story short, owing to the financial stringency at the time of the First World War, the smaller harbour proposed by Mr. Methven was built at Kalk Bay and not the one proposed by Mr. Westhofen. This was done in spite of the fact that the Select Committee of 1902 had chosen Mr. Westhofen’s plan in preference to that of Mr. Methven. The foundation stone of the harbour was laid in 1919 by the then Minister of Railways, Mr. Hull. The harbour has not been a success, because there was never enough berthing space, and there is not even now enough deep water to accommodate sufficient small boats at low tide. The first allegation is proved by the fact that in the middle 1930’s, an additional wooden quay in the middle of the harbour had to be provided for additional berthing space.</p>

<p>The question arises whether there are any other sites in False Bay which are more suitable for a harbour for small boats than Kalk Bay. Mr. Methven and Mr. Westhofen, at the turn of the century, were of the opinion that Kalk Bay, although small, was the only suitable site between Simonstown and Muizen-berg for a harbour. In more recent years there have been suggestions, some emanating from the Divisional Council, a local authority with an interest in this area, that Miller’s Point should be converted into a small boat harbour. I want to submit to the hon. the Minister that that area is not at all suitable for the reasons given by Mr. Methven in his criteria for choosing Kalk Bay as the most suitable site. There are, for example, no suitable facilities at Miller’s Point at the moment. There are no slipways, there is no direct Railway communication and even the road communication is very distant from the rest of the Peninsula. Furthermore, there is no quarry stone readily available at Miller’s Point for the building of a harbour. Many engineers with knowledge of the sea and the building of harbours, are of the opinion that it would be completely unsuitable to build a small boat harbour at Miller’s Point. That brings me back to the position at Kalk Bay. Again using Mr. Methven’s criteria for what is the most suitable site for a harbour. I find that Mr. Westhofen’s scheme provided sufficient space for 200 boats. That, I should like to submit, is enough for our requirements in the Peninsula. Secondly, his scheme provided sufficient depth of 3½ acres of water to accommodate at least 100 of those boats at low tide. Thirdly, there are already slipways at Kalk Bay and there are also facilities for nets and gear as well as for the landing of fish. Fourthly, there is an adequate and a direct Railway link to Kalk Bay. Lastly, the existing entrance has proved to be a safe entrance to the harbour and the entrance proposed by Mr. Westhofen is an entrance of a similar type. There is no reason to suppose that it would not be just as safe at all times and at all tides.</p>

<p>The Question is whether the present time is appropriate. I submit the time is appropriate for the building of extensions to Kalk Bay Harbour. First of all, there is a public demand for facilities. Secondly, there is at the moment, ample parking space available within the harbour area. Thirdly, a tunnel is to be built next year through the mountains above Kalk Bay Harbour, which should not only provide the filling for a harbour, but also all the rocks which might be required for a breakwater. <span class="col_6253-6254" refersTo="page_0274"/>A new access to the harbour is being investigated by the City Council at the moment. For all these reasons, I submit that the time has never been more ripe for the Minister and his department to give urgent consideration to this suggestion that the Kalk Bay harbour facilities should be extended and that the plan and the report of Mr. Westhofen of 1902 should be given every consideration. People who have local knowledge, believe that the scheme can be put into effect and will be the most successful one of all of those considered so far.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to give it his personal attention and to ask his department to consider the matter. I hope he will thereafter come to Parliament next year with the first amount placed on the Estimates for the building of a greater Kalk Bay Harbour.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday evening, through the mouth of the hon. the Minister, we gratefully took cognizance of the progress which is being made in respect of the establishment of industries in the border areas at our Bantu homelands. This is basically essential to the implementation of the policy of separate development of this side of the House. We also gratefully took cognizance of the economic boom in South Africa to-day. Figuratively speaking it can be said that, in the economic sphere, and with the establishment of industries in South Africa, we are bursting at the seams. On this occasion I actually want to say, with a tinge of regret, and I do so without any recriminations, that as far as the industrial development in South Africa to-day is concerned, it is a recognized fact that the Orange Free State is actually the Cinderella province in South Africa. Even the fantastic development in respect of gold which took place in the Free State, and which, for almost a decade and a half, made such a gigantic contribution to South Africa’s foreign exchange earnings, could do nothing to bring about greater industrial development in the Free State, and particularly in the Free State gold fields. It is tragically ironic that the gold coffers of South Africa are filled from the Free State soil on a scale unprecedented in the history of South Africa. And yet the Free State is, as of old, the province which has to struggle to make ends meet in almost every sphere. What I have said in respect of the Orange Free State as a whole is amply true in respect of the Free State gold fields, particularly of its key town, Welkom. Hon. members know that Welkom is 21 years old to-day, and yet if the mining industry were to come to a halt, with no more gold to be mined, those approximately 100,000 white inhabitants, who are settled there today, would witness a tragic day. With the technological development in mining to-day, that evil day is perhaps not nearly as far from the door as we may think at this stage. If, when that day dawns, Welkom and its neighbouring towns have no economic leg to stand on other than gold mining alone, you may safely believe that it will be nothing but a disastrous day, not only for that part of the Orange Free State, but also for South Africa as a whole. At present, with a few exceptions, commerce and industry are actually satellites to the gold-centred economy. They are few in number and let me say very honestly and sincerely here this afternoon that when gold breathes its last, the industries which are established there to-day, will also vanish like mist before the morning sun. It can never be said that the town councils of that area, the chambers of commerce and other bodies do not realize the importance of the fact that that area cannot only be established on the gold mining industry, but should also be established on secondary industries. The town councils of that area and the responsible bodies are busy from day to day in order to find incentives for the establishment of industries in that part of the Free State. Here I want to say to the Government’s credit that we cannot do otherwise on this occasion than to express our sincere gratitude as well, especially to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs who took the trouble a few years ago to meet the respective bodies in that area and to discuss their problems with them. In particular I should also like to thank the hon. the Minister of Planning very sincerely for taking the time last year to meet the different bodies there. The fact remains that since physical planning and decentralization of industries have for such a long time been magic words in South Africa, I am compelled to ask when something is going to be done in this connection for the Free State and its gold fields, which need it so bitterly. Since I am touching upon this matter with so much seriousness, it would be clearer to the hon. the Minister and other hon. members of the House if I quoted a few figures about what the position in Welkom is, and about what is at stake for Welkom alone in connection with this important matter. An amount of R600 million, if not more, was invested and spent on mining development in Welkom. On all facets of services such as access roads, rail, air and road transport, buildings, etc., the State has already spent an approximately equal amount. The total valuation of taxable and non-taxable buildings in the town is calculated at more than R100 million. The ratio of taxable to non-taxable assets is R99 million to R24 million, which indicates that the State and private interests have both taken large slices of Welkom. The investments of Welkom’s town council itself amount to about R27 million. With this picture of a town which, in truth, has no other refuge but the fact-declining asset of gold, industrial development is therefore of the greatest importance. I venture to say that industrial development for this area is priority number one. Since we are concerned about this whole set-up, it has become important for me to ask what tangible steps the Government can take to ensure the future position of that area. It is all very well <span class="col_6255-6256" refersTo="page_0275"/>to speak of the physical planning of the country and the decentralization of industries, but how does the gold field region fit into those plans? It is fine that Welkom supplies about 16 per cent of the free world’s gold, but when our labours can no longer sweat the gold out, must that region then be thrown to the wolves in its entirety? The fact that our secondary industries must be enticed to the Free State, and especially to that province’s gold fields, makes a policy of State-supported and State-guided decentralization absolutely essential. I want to state very clearly that it must be done within the framework of the National Party’s policy. That goes without saying.</p>

<p>When we speak of a gold mine it is very difficult to determine and to make an accurate calculation of what the lifespan of such a mine is. However, I may point out to you that a gold mine is a hazardous undertaking. The expectations which are sometimes cherished for such a gold mine are not always realized. In this connection I should like to quote what Mr. Harry Oppenheimer said on occasion in Welkom in 1964:</p>

<block name="quote">In the current year of 1964 it looks as though the six mines in the Welkom area are going to produce 50 per cent of the profits of this industry, and out of the six mines in the Welkom area, four alone are going to pay nearly 50 per cent of the total tax to be paid to the Government by the gold mining industry &#x2026; It is interesting to note that here, in this district of Welkom, out of six mines in Welkom itself they are producing more gold, more foreign exchange for South Africa in this one town than the total exports of the independent states of Kenya and Tanganyika put together.</block>

<p>Since the gold fields have meant so much to the State coffers over the years, and are still going to mean so much in the years ahead, and since the gold fields have meant so much, and are still going to mean so much, to the country in foreign earnings, it would be unfair to that area and its people, when the goose stops laying its golden eggs, to adopt the attitude of &#x201C;When things were going well, you did a great deal for the country, and now that you can no longer do so, it is all over and done with; go and fight your own battle&#x201D;. On the same occasion Mr. Oppenheimer said:</p>

<block name="quote">It has not been a bed of roses. It is true that certain mines have done remarkably well but it is something to bear in mind that there are in the Free State five mines in which no less than R187 million has been invested, which last year showed profits not much in excess of R5 million put together. These are the mines from which you see the reverse story &#x2026; If you have to start a mine and it does not come up to expectations &#x2026; there are grave social risks to the community depending on these mines.</block>

<p>I do not want to bore you with the benefits which the town councils of Welkom and the surrounding parts have offered in their efforts to have industries established there. Suffice to say that everything humanly possible is being done to have industries established in that area. The most important question that I want to ask the hon. the Minister this afternoon is what the Government intends to do, especially since it is taking the idea of decentralization even further. For border industries, which are absolutely essential to the implementation of the policy of separate development, certain incentive measures have been established. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#erasmus">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sure that the hon. member for Welkom will excuse me if I do not follow him up in what he has just said. However, I want to follow up on what certain hon. members opposite have said. By way of criticism some of them tried to ridicule and to discredit the policy of the establishment of industries and border industries. In general the criticism was very superficial and very contradictory. The hon. member for Pinetown expressed his concern at what the cost per worker would be. However, he was also concerned about the fact that the tempo of development had decreased over the past year. The hon. member calculated that, to date, it has cost R5,815 per employee in the border industries. He then calculated what it would cost in the future and used precisely the same figures. The hon. member took no cognizance of the diversity of future construction costs. For many different reasons, which I do not want to go into now, I believe this to be a completely wrong estimate. If the hon. member were to have calculated further he would have seen, had he taken the cost for 1968, that the costs had already decreased. The costs are now R5,470 per employee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>What figures are those?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#erasmus">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>The same figures that the hon. member used. These figures are also in the report. I now pertinently want to ask the hon. member for Pinetown whether he can tell me what it costs per employee in the existing industrial areas within the white heartland. What does it cost to employ a worker there? I challenge him to prove that it costs more in the border areas than in the established industrial areas. I am not saying that it does cost more, but I am saying that even if it did cost more this Government would be prepared to accept this, because for us it means the salvation of white civilization, being a positive step towards the establishment of further separate development and social separation. It also affords the Bantu the opportunity to live within his own homeland, to create growth points there out of his own economic earnings and also to create his own middle <span class="col_6257-6258" refersTo="page_0276"/>class for the absorption of the increase in the Bantu population.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Point once more came along here with his wild accusations. He said that the Government was applying State socialism and that our whole policy was just one big bluff. In the first place I want to tell him that, if he uses the term &#x201C;State socialism&#x201D; in that sense, he is bluffing himself that he knows what it means. I want to ask him to read more about State socialism so that he can use the term correctly. But if it is a fact that during that period, from 1960 to 1968, 54,000 Bantu workers were employed in those areas, and that in recent years the tempo was maintained at 5,000 per year, and if one considers this in terms of five persons per family, then 270,000 Bantu have been kept within their homelands; and if that is bluffing I want to tell him that we can safely go on bluffing like this. This is a brilliant way of bluffing the public. I want to tell him that he need not concern himself about his white identity or his survival. He must merely trust the National Party; We shall save him. It will perhaps not take place as quickly as he thinks it should, but what has already taken place is nevertheless an exceptional achievement.</p>

<p>I now also want to refer to the hon. member for Parktown. He said this policy of ours was an ideological policy without any economic foundation. I agree that the policy was inspired by the ideology of separate development, but I say that it actually has an economic basis. The selection of each border industry was made with thorough cognizance of all the economic factors. The establishment of an infrastructure was calculated with thoroughness. [Interjections.] This policy is applicable to industries which are transferable and not location-orientated, and the financial assistance given to those industries is given on a very sound economic basis. I do not think that this policy results in any higher production costs. There may, it is true, be a shift in the emphasis of production costs, but the total costs will finally not be much greater.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for King William’s Town came along and made a very strange statement. He said that the main reason why the United Party was against border industries was that they were being established alongside an area which would soon become an independent state. Well, if that is his reason then he should have a complaint against the establishment of the Republic of South Africa, against the fact that Pietersburg is situated where it is. Then he must shift the country’s borders, but I do not know what he wants to put in the intervening space. But in the same breath in which he was complaining about industries being established along another country’s borders, he pleaded that the new Iscor be established in the Berlin area. Surely this is altogether contradictory. These are the clumsiest arguments I have ever heard.</p>

<p>While we are speaking about Iscor, I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister and the Government on the choice of the site for the establishment of the third Iscor, and I just want to refer to the ridiculous statement which was made here by the hon. member for South Coast about an alleged leakage of information. Again, this was merely done in order to look for trouble and to sow suspicion, because to my knowledge there was no leakage. I do not think that the public of South Africa and the business people are that stupid. They could determine where the possible places would be and they possibly went along and speculated at various places, but I do not believe that there was any leakage. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Listening to the hon. member for Pietersburg trying to justify border industries on economic grounds, makes me think that in view of his background and training he must have been talking with his tongue in his cheek, because if he reads the report on the decentralization of industries and the granting of relief to these industries, it shows up the fallacy of his argument. We also listened to the hon. member for Welkom. We on this side of course have a considerable amount of sympathy with his problem of the dying mines, and if the hon. member had been in the House some years ago he would have known of the pleas made by the former member for Benoni for some form of relief as regards the dying mines. But we now have the Minister of Planning taking a hand in that, he is restricting industry as far as the areas in which the dying mines are located, and industry can only be built up in those areas subject to restrictions in regard to Bantu labour. But he and his party have been hoisted by their own petard, because when you come to Welkom with its possible dying mines and one looks at the map of the Free State, where are you going to create a border industry to assist Welkom? Are you going to bring a large Bantu population nearby, or are you going to group them together? As far as decentralization is concerned, you would have to bring a very large Bantu population within the vicinity of Welkom in order to make it work. I would love to hear from the hon. member for Welkom how he hopes to make this work.</p>

<p>Now I should like to deal with the Western Cape. We are slightly different from the other areas. We have this peculiarity here where we are losing our labour. The hon. member for King William’s Town was complaining about the labour being removed to his area from other areas like the Western Cape and the difficulties they are having there. He asked for something to be done to employ the Bantu there, but we are in the opposite position. The Bantu are being moved out of this area, and what is more, we have the added disadvantage that the Government in its enthusiasm for border industry is encouraging industry to move away from here as well. So we have the two evils. We have the removal of Bantu labour and we have the removal of <span class="col_6259-6260" refersTo="page_0277"/>industries from the Western Cape. It is interesting to read the report of the permanent committee on the location of industry and decentralization. You find that 99 per cent of the report refers to border industries and there is very little mention of the Coloureds. They do mention the subject; I will give them their due, but their Border industrial development points are the East London, King William’s Town, Queenstown, Ladysmith, Colenso, Empangeni, Richard’s Bay, Pietersburg, Tzaneen, Phalaborwa, Brits, Rustenburg, Zeerust and Mafeking. I do not see Welkom mentioned there, but there is nothing at all about the Western Cape. We are of course pleased to hear that the Minister has at last made up his mind on the siting of the third Iscor, at Newcastle. It is probably the best site in the circumstances for internal consumption of steel, but certainly not for export. The position all over the world is that these large steel manufacturing units are now being located at the coast. The Minister comes from the Western Cape and I am surprised that he did not think of the Western Cape or the North-Western Cape as the sites for this industry. It might be argued that there are difficulties in regard to transporting the ore and probably labour, but that could be overcome. If the Japanese can transport ore for thousands of miles and still sell steel at world competitive prices, we in this country could do the same. It would have been a great fillip to the Western Cape or the North-West Cape if we could have some such industry located here. We probably have the largest natural harbour in South Africa at Saldanha Bay. It is waiting for development at a fraction of the cost of Richard’s Bay. They say it lacks fresh water, but the Minister of Water Affairs could overcome that situation. It probably has the most favourable shipbuilding site in the country, but all attempts to establish a first-class shipbuilding industry at Saldanha have been killed at birth.</p>

<p>As I said, in the report of the committee on the decentralization of industry, I was pleased to see that they were assisting those factories which were employing Coloured labour. We in the Western Cape have seen some of our biggest factories moved and shortly we will see one of the largest motor units moving to the north, probably to a border industry. Up to now the Government has done very little to assist the retention of this large industry, which employs some 2,000 Coloureds. We should have some of the assistance referred to in this report, which says that since the Government decided in March, 1965, to extend border industry advantages to other decentralized areas with substantial labour surpluses of racial groups other than Bantu, assistance has been given to two new white undertakings, three new Indian undertakings and one new white undertaking based on Coloured labour. Sir, they are looking at it and I want to make a request to the Minister to go into the question as far as decentralized industry is concerned and to offer to the Western Cape the same facilities that he is offering to the border industries. If the Government is sincere in its policy of moving the Bantu from the Western Cape and moving the Coloureds into the Western Cape, then they must offer us the same facilities that they are offering to border industries.</p>

<p>You will never attract industry for the utilization of Coloured labour unless the Government gives some measure of assistance or encouragement. When you find enormous sums of money some R52 million spent by the I.D.C., on the development of border industries, and you see the pittance spent on the development of industry in the Western Cape, then one gets rather a shock. Added to that are the facilities and the relief handed out to factories that go to the border areas. I think any manufacturer would be foolish to refuse the opportunities afforded by the I.D.C. and the Government; they would be foolish if they did not accept the offers made by the Government. But it not only affects the area concerned; it affects the workers. Workers are displaced. I know of one factory where, if it is moved, something like 100 white families will have to be moved to another area. If one sees the big motor factories being put up outride Pretoria, not in a border area but close to a big Bantu township, and one sees adjacent to the township the houses that are put up for white workers, apparently with Government assistance, one realizes how the Government has lent backwards to assist in moving these industries near to the border areas. Think of the ridiculous situation of declaring Rosslyn a border area. I believe the location is something like 28 miles from the centre of Pretoria. Here an area, which is adjacent to Pretoria, has been created a border industrial area and all sorts of facilities and rebates have been offered to industries established there. This seems to be a shocking state of affairs.</p>

<p>Well, we would like this shocking state of affairs here too. We would like the same facilities to be offered to industries in Cape Town. We would like to see the same facilities offered to industries within 12 miles of Cape Town or a bit closer. If the Government can hand out these facilities to industrialists at Rosslyn and Brits, then we should be given the same facilities here in Cape Town for the sake of the Coloured population. At the present time large factories in the Cape are moving to the north and I would like to see the Government encourage these industries to remain here. If the same facilities which are made available in border industrial <span class="col_6261-6262" refersTo="page_0278"/>areas are offered to these local industries, then they will remain here. Sir, I was interested to hear the plea made here by the hon. member for Moorreesburg for the establishment of an oyster industry. We are alt pleading for industrial development in the Western Cape. We want to get rid of the Transvaal complex that this Government has. We have planes flying over here direct to South America; they are not even aware of our existence here in the Cape. The trouble is that the Government has a Transvaal complex. They look no further than Pretoria or the Witwatersrand or the border areas.

<p>That is why he referred here to a so-called Transvaal complex which the Government allegedly suffers from. I would say that the hon. member suffers from all kinds of other complexes and is therefore not competent to make this kind of accusation against the Government. In the course of his speech he referred to a great many matters, and he has the right to plead for things which, here in the Western Cape and especially in Cape Town, are of importance to him. But at the beginning of his speech he reproached the hon. the Minister, who was himself a Western Province man, for not having looked sufficiently well after the interests of the Western Cape with the location of the new Iscor. Sir, what has happened here with the location of the third Iscor actually reveals the impartiality and the fair-mindedness of the Minister concerned and of the Government in their handling of these matters. They are not doing it in a spirit of over-eagerness, for the purpose of constantly pocketing benefits for their area. They are trying to serve the country as a whole in a very positive way.</p>

<p>Sir, this afternoon I want to speak about the small industries division of the I.D.C., but before I come to that I should like to make use of the opportunity to congratulate the I.D.C. on its annual report, on its exceptional neatness of presentation and its very useful content. But I notice from the annual report that as far as the small industries division is concerned, only 15 applications were approved this year, six of which were subsequently withdrawn. On the one hand this should cause one concern, although if one takes note of the basis on which this assistance is granted, one sees that assistance to small industries takes place within the framework of the I.D.C. Act which provides that the corporation shall encourage, expedite and continue with industrial development in the Republic, in accordance with sound commercial principles, by the financing of new industries and industrial undertakings, as well as schemes for the extension, better organization, modernization and more efficient implementation of the activities of existing industries and industrial undertakings. If one reads this one realizes that, although only 15 applications were approved, one ought actually to be grateful that this principle is applied because a greater measure of protection is thereby afforded to both those who receive the assistance as well as to the I.D.C.’s interests. But as far as I am concerned, there are two shortcomings which I should like to point out.</p>

<p>The I.D.C. Act provides that assistance be granted in terms of sound commercial principles, and then additional provision is made for &#x201C;the financing of new industries and industrial undertakings&#x201D;. My problem is that in practice one finds that, as far as the establishment of new small industries is concerned, assistance has thusfar not been granted. This is a shortcoming, in my opinion. Thusfar the granting of assistance has only been aimed at existing undertakings which needed help, and my plea this afternoon is that in future greater consideration should also be given to the establishment of new industries as far as this particular group is concerned. The second shortcoming to which I want to refer is that only financial assistance is given to small industries. In other words, the undertaking receives assistance in the form of rands and cents, but it does not receive the necessary information about how to spend those rands and cents to the greatest advantage, not only for itself but also in the interest of the country. I want to ask whether the time has not come for consideration to be given, by means of the I.D.C., to the granting of assistance on the three management levels; i.e. that not only money should be provided to extend an industry or to establish it, but that the necessary knowledge should be supplied, to the people who need assistance, on the three management levels, i.e. the financial, the technical and the marketing levels.</p>

<p>In practice one finds that these small industries that we are speaking about are undertakings which are actually under the management of one person. With the best will in the world that one person cannot command all the necessary knowledge to make a success of that undertaking on the three management levels. We are blinded by the financial assistance which we supply and in the meantime we are letting that undertaking go under, not as a result of lack of money, but as a result of lack of knowledge which that undertaking needs in order to be expanded into a large and powerful undertaking on the three management levels. Under these circumstances I wonder whether the hon. the Minister, through the I.D.C., would not give attention to this matter. I do not foresee that this help should only be supplied to borrowers; I foresee that it can be granted to anyone who wants to make use of it. I do not foresee <span class="col_6263-6264" refersTo="page_0279"/>the assistance as a free service, but that people will have to pay for it. It can become a paying undertaking; it need not cost the State anything. The State must merely take the initiative in making the necessary knowledge available and then all will be well. I want to make a very serious plea to the hon. the Minister in this connection.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I think as soon as the hon. the Minister sees me rising to my feet, he will know which subject it is I wish to discuss with him. The subject, as he probably knows, is the question of the siting of the third Iscor. I want to say right away that Kimberley and the Northern Cape are many things, but they are not bad losers. I would like to wish the Newcastle and Natal people, luck in the selection of the site for the third Iscor. Sir, I have read the Minister’s statement with considerable interest: I have studied it, and I think even the Minister must have had some qualms of conscience when he made the final decision, because I see he did say, after mentioning all the various areas and regions, that so far as the Northern Cape was concerned this area had been considered and that it had the understanding and the sympathy of the Government. Sir, in public work, as you know, sympathy and understanding have no cash value. These are wonderful things; they can be handed out free, but they accomplish nothing. I would like the hon. the Minister to do me the courtesy of explaining to me what he actually means when he says that the amount of R83 million will be spent on a regional development basis, because he also mentions that 1,100 white people will be employed and 3,900 Bantu between Postmasburg and Sishen. I think we are entitled to ask him to explain how he thinks we will accomplish what he had in mind when he said that there would be secondary and tertiary industries accompanying this development between Postmasburg and Sishen. This year, as you know, Sir, is the centenary of the discovery of the first diamond&#x2014;100 years ago. I do not think that the successive Governments of this country can take any pride in the neglect of the vast region to the west of Kimberley and of which Kimberley is the county capital or the county headquarters, as one might say, and on which the diamond industry was based. When the first diamond was found, Sir Richard Southey said in the old Cape Parliament: &#x201C;This is the rock on which the foundations of the prosperity of South Africa will be built.&#x201D; Sir, 100 years have gone by since then. In the Northern Cape we have this tremendous concentration of wealth in the shape of manganese, iron ore, asbestos, etc., and yet after 100 years we have failed to attract the interest of the Government. Here, Sir, I can speak with some authority because I have spent 25 years of my public career and life trying to persuade the Government to establish an iron and steel undertaking at Barkly West. I think the disappointing thing about the Minister’s statement regarding Newcastle, which economically has much to commend it but no more than the northern Cape region has, is the fact that he mentioned&#x2014; which I think was rather a tragedy&#x2014;this this decision had been made in terms of Government policy. Sir, when I listen to other speakers, particularly on the Government side, I get the impression that the Government’s policy comes first and that the people who live in these regions come a very bad second. I can say to the hon. member for Welkom that he will whistle for industry, if he expects it at Welkom, on a border industry basis. I see also in this report that the question of population is mentioned. During negotiations in which I have personally taken part, with deputations which I have led to a variety and succession of Ministers, we have always been told that the population of the area is not large enough and that there is no concentration of Bantu. You know, Sir, even in the case of the Vaal River in which the municipality of Kimberley was the first to interest itself by way of a weir, throwing back the Vaal River for a matter of 17 miles, the water has been taken out in the upper reaches and from the watershed of the Rand complex, which really is entitled to its share of the water in the Vaal Dam, and taken over to Pretoria. I am quite sure that, sooner or later, the complex at Brits, which incidentally is quite unjustified, will also receive water from the Vaal River. I can recall 50 years ago when as a small boy I heard about the Kromellen Boog scheme on the Vaal River. But in place of that the Vaal Dam was built; subsequently it was raised; then the Free State goldfields came on the scene and took water out of the Vaal River as well, so much so that eventually the Government built a dam, 30 or 40 years too late although it cannot ever be too late really, at Oppermans Drift, Bloem-hof. So we in the Northern Cape wonder what lies in store for us and what our future really will be. I have been on platforms together with the hon. the Minister and I have had the privilege of entertaining him. He knows what the feeling is of people in the Northern Cape about some form of government sponsored industry to give a fillip to the development which they feel is potentially there. However, we still go on waiting&#x2014;100 years after the discovery of the foundation stone upon which the prosperity of South Africa was built.</p>

<p>I was in Kimberley on Saturday when the news about the siting of the third Iscor was made public. I want to tell the Minister and to place it on record, that nothing could have been a more shattering disappointment to that community, the triangle Kimberley-Postmasburg-Kuruman, than that news. I believe that the hon. the Minister might apply his mind to reassuring or explaining to these people that they are not entirely the stepchildren of the Republic but that they do share and can expect to share in the prosperity which we believe <span class="col_6265-6266" refersTo="page_0280"/>is coming. I ask the Minister to do this for me and to place on record what his thinking is about the development of this enormously rich region. Much mining has taken place in the Northern Cape. At one time, when the diamond industry in Kimberley appeared to come to an end because of the low value of diamonds, the late Sir Ernest Oppenheimer&#x2014;tributes were paid here to his son, Harry&#x2014;put the diamond industry again on a sound basis. Further discoveries have taken place, as the hon. the Minister well knows. Many other discoveries have been made, at Bellsbank, at the Finch, as well as in other parts of the Northern Cape, even into Botswana. To-day will be the last opportunity for me to talk on this subject because it is now a <i>fait accompli</i> as far as steelworks are concerned. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to interfere with the plea of the hon. member for Karoo for industry for Kimberley. We in Natal have been blessed with industrial development and we are very grateful for the fact that we are going to receive the third Iscor. We like to think that we have attracted those industries which we have, on merit.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with two other subjects on this Vote. The first one is the amount of R150,000 placed on the Estimates for combating pollution of our sea by oil or other matter. Now, Sir, we know that the amount allocated last year has been increased by R50,000. We do know that storage facilities are being provided at Durban to store dispersants for use if we should in fact have oil deposits on our coasts or beaches. But what we would like to know from the hon. the Minister is what plans he has for distribution of this dispersant to wherever it might be necessary, and what plans of action he has in mind in case this should be necessary. We must face the fact that there is now a greater possibility of pollution of our sea and our shores by oil because of one factor alone, namely that more and bigger ships are using the sea routes along our coast. We must also accept the fact that this has been affected by the Suez crisis. We might in future lose some of these ships because of a proposed overland middle East pipeline, which might, in fact, lessen the number of ships using the Cape route. But I think this is something in the distant future. What we have to deal with now, is something in the immediate present. We know that the Government is aware of this problem, because we have had certain scares and actual problems to deal with already. I think, too, that we are fortunate that whilst our coastline has to be used by these ships, the design of these ships is improving. The construction of these ships is being improved from day to day and from year to year. We have evidence of this in the fact that the Convention have decided to increase the load lines of these tankers. I also understand that there is a lowering of the insurance rates of these super tankers, which shows that more and more confidence is being placed in the improved building methods which are being employed. Nevertheless, I think it is just as well that we are constantly aware of the threat of pollution of our sea and our beaches by oil. It exists in other countries, too. But I think we must be sure that our defences are kept in a state of constant readiness. I would like the hon. the Minister to outline for us how he intends to cope with such an emergency, should it arise.</p>

<p>The next subject I want to deal with, is the question of the subsidization of the shipbuilding industry. I notice that the amount provided for subsidies has been increased from R600,000 last year to R1,830,000 this year. I think it is not sufficient just to provide increasing amounts for the subsidization of the shipbuilding industry. We want such an industry in this country, but I think we must be realistic about it. The first question I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, is the following. When the Norval Commission reported on the proposed establishment of the shipbuilding industry in South Africa, it reported that it believed the only way of approaching the question of the establishment of this new industry would be by way of forming a consortium. Since that recommendation the shipbuilding industry has, in fact, come into being in South Africa in a larger measure than it has ever existed before. We have seen three companies work together on the construction of certain small vessels, but the consortium recommended by the Norval Commission seems to me to be much further away, or just as far away as it was when we started our investigations into the shipbuilding industry. In my own personal opinion, although we are building at the moment three vessels of 4,500 tons dead weight, of which one has been delivered and another one is about to be delivered, and we are undertaking the construction of a 25,000 ton vessel, I still do not think that the shipbuilding industry is properly on its feet in South Africa. You see, Sir, the shipbuilding industry is a highly competitive one. If South Africa is going to make a success of her shipbuilding industry, she will have to compete successfully with all the other shipbuilding nations of the world. It is going to be necessary to do some basic planning for the shipbuilding industry. I believe personally that, unless we are prepared to form a shipbuilding consortium, we will never get beyond the building of small ships on a profitable basis in this country. We see that already the most go-ahead shipbuilding company in the country is calling for further assistance by the State. I believe that the Minister should apply himself to the provision of further assistance to the shipbuilding companies. I want to refer him to a speech made by Mr. Rattray recently at the launching of a ship in Durban. Mr. Rattray, who is chairman of the Barens Shipbuilding Company, said:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6267-6268" refersTo="page_0281"/>It is my contention that, because of the national importance of our industry, the Government should be prepared to shoulder at least some of the very heavy costs involved in constructing repair and fitting-out quays at sites leased to marine engineering organizations. The burden of expenditure by private enterprise to provide these national assets is well nigh intolerable and I think it is with complete justification that we look to the State, or the Railways Administration as its agent, for some assistance.</block>

<p>So, I think this is a problem which will have to be faced in this country in the not too distant future. If we are going to make a success of the shipbuilding industry, we must decide what part the State is going to play, not only in providing more and more subsidization, but in providing facilities for the shipbuilding industry. We must also decide whether the shipbuilding industry can continue to exist as a number of small shipyards in the face of the competition which we meet from all parts of the world. I think this is a sign, not only of problems in the shipbuilding industry here in South Africa, which is a very young industry, but they are facing such problems in Britain, where the shipbuilding industry comes down from olden times. Here I see that in one area the Clyde Shipbuilders Consortium alone&#x2014; here they have formed a consortium on the river Clyde&#x2014;is asking the Government for a subsidy of £12 million to help them over the problems which they are facing, because they are facing exactly the same problems that our own young shipbuilding industry is facing today. I believe that we have to get down to a more definite basis. I believe we have to decide as regards these companies whether they can, in fact, exist as small units or whether, for the future of the shipbuilding industry and South Africa’s interest in it, these companies should not get together and form a consortium.

<p>Mr. Chairman, arising out of the announcement by the hon. Minister yesterday that a Commission of Inquiry into the fishing industry would shortly be visiting Walvis Bay, there is another matter which I should like to bring briefly to his attention, in regard to which great dissatisfaction is prevailing in Walvis Bay to-day. It deals with the violation of the territorial waters of Walvis Bay. In the past the patrol boats of the Administration sailed past foreign ships in order to try to apprehend the South African catchers of the factory ships there. The fishermen on the catchers were in some cases brought before the court and this caused great dissatisfaction because the fishermen then alleged that it was not fair that the South African ships should be caught while the foreign ships were allowed to carry on their catching activities in those waters unhindered. They argued: &#x201C;Why can these foreign ships make catches here, while we are not allowed to do so?&#x201D; The reply of the Administration was although the patrol boats had the authorization to apprehend the foreign ships as well, they did not have the physical power to apprehend the large foreign ships. Now it is being alleged by a considerable group of established fishermen at Walvis Bay that these catchers were still continuing to encroach on the territorial waters and to make catches where they were not authorized to do so. Of course their complaint is also aimed at the foreign ships. The accusation is being levelled by the South African catchers that the foreign ships are allowed to make catches, that they can make catches unrestrictedly right up to the coast but that only the South African catchers are being sought out and apprehended. This is creating a very unsatifactory state of affairs in Walvis Bay. One word is leading to another among these people. One infringement is leading to another. I therefore want to bring it to the attention of the hon. the Minister that he should instruct this commission to go into this matter so that the necessary steps can be taken to clarify this matter there, and so that the necessary protective measures can be introduced there.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the last two hon. members spoke about ships and shipping and pollution. I am sure they will excuse me if I do not follow them along those lines. I want to come back to the main theme of this debate, which has been a discussion of the hon. the Minister’s policy with regard to the development of the so-called border industrial areas. The hon. member for Pinetown and the hon. member for Pietersburg both mentioned the figures given on page 7 of the report of the Permanent Committee where mention is made of an estimated outlay of more than R314 million in the border areas since 1960 and that this has given employment to a total of 54,000 Bantu. The hon. member for Pinetown quite correctly came to the conclusion mathematically that this works out at an average of R5,815 per Bantu employee. He suggested that this was rather high. The hon. member for Florida who unfortunately is not in the House at the moment took him to task and tried to justify what he accepted as a high cost. The hon. member for Pietersburg also said that it could be accepted as a high cost, but that it was justified in the interests of the country and that it was the policy of the Nationalist Party. The hon. members for Florida and Pinetown are gentlemen who are used to handling figures. They know figures and can interpret figures. But I am afraid that I find that I am terribly confused with the figures that have been presented in this House. (Interjections.] Hon. members need not make such a noise. They will make more noise by the time I am finished with them. I can sympathize with the late Winston Churchill who once said: &#x201C;Figures can lie and liars can figure.&#x201D; Year after year I have mentioned in this House the unsatisfactory statistics which are available to us, particularly <span class="col_6269-6270" refersTo="page_0282"/>when it comes to replies to questions. Firstly, of course, there is the coyness of the Government in giving employment figures. Year after year I have asked in this House for the number of Bantu employed in each border area. I have never as yet been given a figure. But we have the total and I want to know how they get that total. How do they arrive at the figure of 54,000? It is always given in round figures. Is it an estimate? Is it an accurate estimate? Can it be relied upon? When we come to the question of investments you will notice that this report very carefully says &#x201C;An estimated outlay of more than R314 million&#x201D;. I would suggest that it is a lot more than R314 million. I asked the hon. the Minister on 7th June, 1968, what the total investment in the border areas was. At that stage, and this was the figure up to the end of December, 1967, a year prior to this figure, he gave me figures totalling R381,758,000. That is a lot more than R314 million. That was a full year before this. At that stage the employment figure that was given and which I can only accept, because I am not capable of getting accurate figures, was 49,000. This comes to an average cost per Bantu employed at that date of R7,800. That is a big increase on R5,800. I do not hear any noise from my hon. friends on the other side now. I do not hear any noise at all. I want to ask the hon. the Minister which figures are correct. Are the figures he gave me in reply to my question correct? Or are the figures, quoted in the report of the Permanent Committee for the Location of Industries, correct?</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Florida. He spoke of the heavy cost of the infrastructure. &#x201C;Especially in the first phase&#x201D;, was the phrase that he used. He went on to say that thereafter it costs less per employee, presumably as development comes and more people are employed. This side of the House has never been against decentralization, particularly where it has been economic. But it has of course been against the uneconomic development of so-called growth points for purely ideological reasons. It has been against the haphazard development of small uneconomic areas all over the place. The late Dr. Verwoerd and the hon. the Minister’s predecessor said that the policy was to establish growth points and that once these growth points were established they were to generate their own development. The hon. member for Florida and the hon. member for Pietersburg referred to the question raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point) about State socialism. I want to quote a statement from a Press release of the Chairman of the Permanent Committee for the Location of Industries, issued on the 2nd May, 1969, where he spoke about speculation in land in the border areas. This statement concludes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would therefore be incorrect to conclude that where industrial areas are developed with Government assistance and at the initiative of the Permanent Committee, adjoining land may necessarily also be developed for this purpose.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister once said that private enterprise must not think that they can capitalize on expenditure by the Government in these border areas. I want to know what these statements mean. Do these statements mean that the Government has taken a monopoly on development in the border areas?</p>

<p>But I want to hear from the hon. the Minister. Is the hon. member for Brakpan correct when he says that it is the Government’s policy to create a Government monopoly in the border areas? The hon. the Minister shakes his head. I do not know what that means and whether he is shaking his head to me or the hon. Whip who is worrying him over there. Or is the hon. the Minister doing it in despair? I am very serious about this matter. In Hammarsdale industrialists have been precluded since 1960 from developing on their own. They have been specifically told by Government agencies: &#x201C;Do not develop on this privately owned land, which has been zoned by the Town and Regional Planning Commission for industrial development. You may not develop there. Go across the road or across the river to the land which is owned by the Industrial Development Corporation and which they are developing. You can develop your factory there, but not here.&#x201D; This is land which was frozen by the Town and Regional Planning Commission in Natal in 1959. The same thing applies in the Cato Ridge area. The same thing applies on the outskirts of Pietermaritzburg, where private individuals are endeavouring to develop in line with Government policy. They are even trying to help the hon. the Minister with his policy in the development of these areas. The Government is refusing them the right to develop.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister’s Department as well as the Department of Planning. I have correspondence here from both Departments on this very point. There is another aspect on which I want to ask the hon. the Minister. Are industrialists in the two areas, namely Hammarsdale and Cato Ridge &#x2014;I leave Pietermaritzburg out of this&#x2014;still entitled to border industrial concessions? Will any industrialists who wish to establish industries <span class="col_6271-6272" refersTo="page_0283"/>there still get concessions in terms of the Border Industrial Scheme? I also have that on record, namely that they will not be granted concessions, or that it is highly unlikely that they will be. As I have said, the owners’ development has been frozen. Is this hon. Minister and the committee interested in the further development of industries in these areas? Are they interested in carrying out the thoughts of the hon. member for Florida, when he said that if we can get more industries in these areas, they will then become economic, and that the cost of the infrastructure will then be justified? I want to go further. The figures which have been given, and the figure which I quoted earlier, do not include the cost of the supply of power by the Electricity Supply Commission, the construction of additional roads, and the tarring of roads to get to these points. That is not included in these figures. What has therefore been the cost of the border areas? Nobody knows, because one does not know whether one can rely upon these figures.</p>

<p>As I have said, the hon. member for Florida suggested that if we were able to get a larger concentration of industries to these growth points, the cost per employee would drop. This I can go along with. Instead of these being uneconomic points, let us make them economic points. I would like to come back to this question and ask the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Does he stand by the policy of the establishment of growth points, which must then generate their own development?&#x201D; If he does so, the Permanent Committee must be advised that they must withdraw this statement they issued. Private enterprise must be given the opportunity of developing these areas, because it is quite obvious that the Industrial Development Corporation no longer wishes to do so. We have had statements to that effect. These areas must be released. This Minister must use his influence with his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Planning, to allow industrial development in these areas.</p>

<p>In the minute and a half which is left to me, I should like to refer to the hon. member for Pietersburg. I notice that he is not here once again.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) raised quite a number of objections to border area development. He is continually dabbling in particulars which have to be furnished in regard to this or in regard to that. Apart from the particulars he tried to correlate, the fact remains that it is the policy of the State that the I.D.C. should lend assistance to the border areas, but with the application of the Physical Planning Act by the Department of my colleague, the Minister of Planning, a damper is going to be placed on development in areas which have to rely on Bantu labour other than those which are classified as border areas. Now, this is as far as Bantu labour is concerned. There will therefore be limits. Industrialists will in future be obliged to have recourse to the points where we will in fact allow industries. I am now talking about admissibility as far as this effects the Department of Planning.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There are no limits as far as this is concerned. I think that what really happened in the case of Hammarsdale is that there are no suitable sites available there. It is full. What really happens is that they reserve certain sites with a view to the expansion of existing industries. Because the area was virtually full, sites were held back and were not allocated. They wanted to keep those sites in case the existing industries should expand. I think that that was a fair approach. My latest information is that at this stage no more industrial sites are available. It is therefore not the policy that private initiative should not be allowed to develop border areas. One cannot, with reference to this, say that that was in fact the case. There has never been anything like that. Now the hon. member is saying &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member must give me a chance now. I cannot speak and listen at the same time. The hon. member stated that my Department was prohibiting industries. That is not true: Perhaps he was referring to one case in regard to the I.D.C., but my Department does not prohibit industries at certain places. That is not our function, nor have we the power to do so. The hon. member is a representative of a constituency in Pietermaritzburg, and industries in that border area have been assisted. Does the hon. member want us to continue to do so?</p>

<p>Now he wants it, but he is always sowing suspicion against this policy. The hon. member does not know to what extent this policy of industrial development has helped his own city. I think that I should give him a little information in this regard, because he does not know what is going on there. I think that I must point out to him that, as far as Pietermaritzburg is concerned, four new applications were approved by the Permanent Committee during 1967-’68. Two of them have already been established. Applications <span class="col_6273-6274" refersTo="page_0284"/>for 20 undertakings which undertook expansions were supported by the Committee during the past two years. This is after all a considerable amount of development which has received support there, and which has taken place in his own constituency. But every time he has an opportunity of discussing industrial expansion he opposes this and undermines this policy. I think he should be a bit more realistic when it comes to development in areas like Pietermaritzburg. Considerable assistance has been granted in such areas. But apart from that expansion is still taking place in Pietermaritzburg. To a large extent that area can carry on under its own steam because there are very few industrial premises left in Durban. That is why they are beginning to move in that direction. They will move even further up the Tugela. The city council is now laying out a new area adjoining Eden-vale. This means that for Pietermaritzburg there will be further opportunity for expansion in future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi referred to polution of the ocean and problems which have arisen in that connection. I can inform him that we have made considerable progress as far as international agreements are concerned. The Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, a specialized committee of the U.N., determines routes which these tankers should follow. As far as Natal is concerned, that route lies approximately 18 miles from the coast. This agreement will most probably be ratified later on in the year, but in the meantime the oil companies have already issued instructions to their tankers to follow this route, so that they will keep a considerable distance from the coasts, and so that they will sail where accidents and collisions can be avoided. As far as local counteracting of pollution is concerned, there is close co-operation between Government Departments, local authorities and provincial administrations. At Durban, the three harbours in the Cape, and also in South-West, committees have been established and the necessary counteracting agents are being kept there. There is already an organization which can go into action very quickly in the case of oil pollution. Considerable progress has therefore been made in that field as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the shipbuilding industry which has been established in Durban. It is true that the report at the time indicated that they had to form a consortium. Unfortunately they could not succeed in doing so, but recently, with the launching of a ship, it was indicated that this was the appropriate thing to do. We think that unnecessary duplication, additional costs, etc., will result if there is no consortium. All the arguments are in favour of their forming a consortium. They are already, as a consortium, building a few smaller ships. One would like to see that being expanded. It is after all the tendency one finds in the United Kingdom and also in Europe, where even larger undertakings than those in South Africa are amalgamating. I think that it ought to happen here as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Omaruru referred to the 12-mile limit and stated that foreign ships were entering this limit. I take it that by that he meant overseas ships. In this connection I can state that the Defence Force is patrolling that area. We have received a considerable number of reports indicating that action had been taken and that ships had been forced out of this 12-mile limit. It happens that they enter the limit, but as soon as they see the aircraft, they leave. I have also received representations from the fishermen there. Today I received representations from the fishing community at Walvis Bay. In these representations they complain that factory ships are entering the 12-mile limit. They request that the patrol boats there should keep a more careful look-out. The position is that the two patrol boats which have now been taken over by the Administration are already worn out with age. They are virtually write-offs. However, we hope to send one of the new ships there in June or July, which will then have been completed, to undertake further patrols there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs referred to the I.D.C. and their small industries section. The assistance they are rendering is not only of a financial nature, but they are already undertaking considerable work in order to make the administration of these undertakings more efficient. They are doing this by way of regular visits to the undertakings in order to advise them as far as management problems are concerned. They are also publishing a regular bulletin in which advice is given, and which is circulated to all the industries supported by them. In addition lectures are held from time to time by the National Development and Management Foundation. These people are being encouraged to attend such lectures. Often there are new developments overseas, and these are studied by the I.D.C. and this knowledge is then conveyed to the smaller industries. As far as exhibitions are concerned, the I.D.C. has proceeded to participate in exhibitions. They have already done so in Lourenço Marques, Swaziland, Port Elizabeth, and recently at the Rand Easter Show. At the Rand Easter Show the I.D.C. arranged a small industries exhibit which enabled these small industrialists to exhibit there. The costs of the exhibition was borne by the I.D.C. itself. In the past, the limit set for a small industry was a total capital of R250,000. However, we feel that this amount is too small and that it must be increased. I can inform the hon. member that the I.D.C. will, at their next meeting, consider increasing this limit to R400,000 or R500,000. I think there is justification for expanding the assistance to small industries so that a larger number can be included within the framework of this assistance. The question is of course whether this service should not be expanded so that it can be made available to industrialists who are not at present receiving assistance from the I.D.C. The Trade Institute is at the moment investigating this aspect. The I.D.C. itself is considering whether they should not expand their own service. I therefore hope that in the near future methods will be found to give more management assistance, not only to the industries of the I.D.C., but also to others that do not receive assistance from them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg referred here to the development of Pietersburg. As a result of border area assistance, Pietersburg has developed considerably. Problems are being experienced in that area in so far as transport is concerned, particularly in regard to the exemption they must obtain from the Road Transport Board so that they can transport their products further. This is an aspect which the Permanent Committee has already taken up with the Department of Transport. Evidence was also given before the Marais Commission in this regard. They were granted permission, for example, to deliver goods as far as Potgietersrust, Zebediela and Tzaneen. But I think the hon. member would like to see that circle being drawn wider. This is an aspect which the Permanent Committee is aware of. They will discuss it with the Railways Administration again. However, we foresee that Pietersburg will develop considerably. According to an estimate made by the I.D.C., an additional 40 morgen of industrial land will of necessity have to be available by 1971 and this will have to be expanded to 560 morgen by 1976. We therefore foresee the need for industrial expansion in the Pietersburg area.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Welkom referred to the possibility of the goldmines in the gold-mining area there closing down. However, this is a matter which will only take place in the distant future. I want to give the hon. member the advice I gave the hon. member for Brakpan in the past. The problem at the time was the gold mines on the West Rand and even on the East Rand which would be closing down. Mention was then made of ghost towns. However, we did not think that a thing like that would happen. I think it can be confirmed here that such towns definitely cannot develop. The hon. member must therefore not anticipate the problem too much. The Government is aware of it, and was also aware of it at the time, and helped to get industries established by the private sector there. But I think the hon. member must not be too hasty about wanting all those industries at this stage already. The white labour will be there when the gold mines begin to close down. One will know when that is going to happen. The infrastructure will also be there, which will make it attractive for industrialists to utilize that white labour which will be unemployed when the gold mines close down. Therefore, it is merely a question of timing, which has to be right in order to do so. In the meantime, I am also aware of the fact that the Welkom area has already had industrial expansion in order to meet the local requirements. The hon. member also discussed the Free State itself. However, I just want to point out that the Free State has also had industrial development, particularly in the Sasolburg area.</p>

<p>As far as the H. F. Verwoerd Dam was concerned, it was the specific policy of the Government that the development should take place on the Free State side of the Orange River. I think we have a major problem as far as the Free State is concerned, i.e. the question as to what should be done with the mine at Jagersfontein which is going to close down Shortly. First we had the problem of Koffiefontein, and now it is Jagersfontein. I think the (problem at Jagersfontein will have to receive attention long before the problem of Welkom will require attention. But as far as assistance to the gold mines there is concerned, there are already certain mines in that area to which assistance is being rendered. The uranimum contracts with certain mines have been extended, precisely in order to help certain areas in that vicinity, which would have been affected as a result of the uneconomically low quality of the mines, to develop and to remain viable. Therefore the hon. member can be assured that the Department of Planning is aware of these problems. In the past the N.R.D.C. assisted with the development there. They are also fully aware of the problem which will arise in the gold mining regions. I think the hon. member can be assured of co-operation in this connection. The Department of Planning as well as the Provincial Administration of the O.F.S. are collaborating closely in as far as that problem is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown referred here to the Select Committee of 1902. That report was a very interesting one. The hon. member showed it to me. I am grateful for the fact that he brought it to my attention. I understand that he has also discussed it with an engineer from Fishcor. We shall go into this. Last night I indicated that I was prepared to see whether there should be expansions here which will meet the needs of the small boat owners. We shall give attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg also referred here to the complete Fishcor report. In this report a very good survey of our fishing industry is given. In particular he referred to the experiment which is being undertaken in regard to the cultivation of oysters. This experiment is receiving financial support from Fishcor. The hon. member asked that this experiment be expanded to other regions. He referred in particular to the Saldanha and Langebaan areas. As far as ocean farming is concerned, it has not developed very far in our country. In other parts of the world, development has progressed further. But even there it is not yet very economical. There are only a few places where this kind of undertaking is being tackled successfully. But a report <span class="col_6275-6276" refersTo="page_0285"/>on the improved utilization of our lakes, river mouths and harbours has been drawn up. Certain steps are being taken to acquire some of those areas for this purpose. Once these areas have been acquired I think it will be easier to tackle this kind of farming there. The hon. member referred to the fact that development of this kind could take place at Langebaan. I can only say that the Department has already received an application for development of a similar kind at Langebaan, and that we are supporting it. There are still a few technical problems which have to be solved, but I think it can be expected that there will in fact be development in this connection soon.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo put in a plea here for the development of Kimberley. He expressed his disappointment at the fact that the new Iscor is not going to be established in that area. I can inform the hon. member that the M.P.s for Kimberley, Upington, Gordonia and Namaqualand, together with other organizations in that area, submitted very strong representations to the Government to the effect that development should take place there. If these representations had not been submitted we might not have established precisely what development has already taken place in that area. However, those representations were taken into account, and as a result of them I was able to say that expansions would take place in that area.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo also asked how this is going to be applied. With regard to the development programme of Iscor for the next 10 years an attempt is being made to increase the capital investment in iron ore exploitation and refining from R13 million to R21 million. According to estimates the iron ore export project, and the associated refining process will require an additional spending of R50 million. Provisional planning in regard to manganese ore exploitation indicates a further spending of R10 million, as well as R15 million in respect of water provision for the area. What was being referred to here therefore was R83 million. It is these, Iscor’s activities alone which will result in the employment of an additional number of 1,350 Whites and 4,555 non-Wihites. I want to point out that the economic development programme expects the ore development in that area to grow by 7½ per cent.</p>

<p>These are the additions to Iscor only, then there are also numerous other undertakings, where manganese, lime, diamonds and asbestos are being exploited so that development can take place in that area. The hon. member asked why the development at Brits had to take place. I can also mention that the industrial sites made available at Brits have all been reserved and that the development there is justified. There was a demand for it. The hon. member must not try to create the impression that Kimberley did not have its share of development. During the last number of years Kimberley, as a city, has expanded a great deal. I note that building plans approved for Kimberley in 1967 amounted to more than 3¼ million. Therefore, development is taking place in Kimberley. There were other problems as well as far as Iscor itself is concerned. Iscor needs a great deal of water, and to have located the third Iscor in this area would have meant that water would have had to be drawn from the Vaal River. Water cannot be drawn from this river for Iscor. When the other dams in the Orange River area are completed in 10 years’ time, Kimberley will in fact have the necessary water. The problem was gone into very thoroughly and it was found that the cost of steel per ton would have been considerably higher if Iscor had been situated in that area. It would have been considerably higher than it would cost if Iscor had to be established in Newcastle.</p>

<p>This is a factor which also had to be taken into consideration in determining this. If this were to have been done Iscor would either have had to be subsidized further, or a higher price would have had to be charged for steel. I think the high quality steel which we have available at low prices has enabled us to build up our steel industry, and our steel processing industries are in this way being placed in a position where they are well able to compete with each other.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River put in a plea for the Western Cape. He stated that he did not approve of assistance being granted to Rosslyn in Pretoria since it was near a city, but on the other hand he still wanted the assistance here in Cape Town, even if it is near a city. He therefore has two criteria that he wants to apply. I want to say to the hon. member that he should not create the impression that the Western Cape is coming to a standstill. If we look at the number of new factories which have been registered with the Department of Labour then we see that in 1967 there were 169 new factories, 443 additions and 463 alterations; and in 1968 there were applications here for 172 new factories, 399 additions and 382 alterations. This therefore gives an indication of the industrial expansion which is taking place here in the Western Cape. Therefore, there is no stagnation, which was the impression created here. Just look at the development of Cape Town itself, the building plans which have been approved by the Cape Town Municipality. In 1967 the amount in this respect was R68 million, in 1968 R40 million and for the first three months of this year it was R13 million, which shows a further great increase; and that is only in Cape Town, leaving aside the northern areas and the southern suburbs, and leaving aside the other cities in the Western Cape which are all expanding very rapidly. So. that stagnation does not exist here; basically, the same problem does not exist here. But the hon. member stated that we should grant border area assistance here. But let us see what the position here is.</p>

<p>There is expansion here, but there is no <span class="col_6277-6278" refersTo="page_0286"/>surplus of labour available in the Western Cape. A number of Bantu have already left, but it is a problem for my colleague to get them there. But basically there is no surplus labour problem in the Western Cape; on the contrary, there is a shortage, and for that very reason use is still to a large extent being made of Bantu labour. I can mention that during the past three months only, from November to January, the demand in this area was for more than 12,000 workers, but as far as Coloured labour was concerned, work could only be provided for 1,800 of them, and the rest of the demand had to be met with Bantu labour. I am mentioning this to prove that there is no surplus of Coloured labour here.</p>

<p>The particulars do in fact indicate that there has been a decrease in Bantu labour, but I do not want to burden you with those particulars now. Therefore, there is development here; there is no surplus labour here, and there is no reason to introduce industrial development here in order to meet the existing labour supply. We are making our border area assistance available precisely in order to draw industries to those areas where a surplus of labour exists, or to where the Bantu labour that used to be in the white areas must go, such as the labour here in Cape Town which must be removed. So at this stage there is no reason for that border area assistance to be given.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to an important matter, viz. the motor industry at Blackheath which is possibly going to move, and he said that nothing is being done about it. I want to tell him that what he said is not correct, because next Friday, towards the end of this week, these people are going to hold consultations again with the Secretary of Industry in order to discuss this problem of the effect this merger of theirs is going to have. This possible removal is not a natural one; it arose as a result of the amalgamation of these two motor manufacturing companies. It is therefore an exceptional position. I was there myself. The Coloured labour there is doing very good work and you can be certain that we on our part will do everything in our power to keep that industry there. We have been engaged in this matter for a long time.</p>

<p>Reference was made to Saldanha and to possible developments there. In this regard I can only say that in so far as the shipbuilding industry is concerned negotiations are still in progress between the interested parties and other shipbuilding undertakings, and they have already made certain altered proposals to the Government. We will form an opinion on these after we have made a market survey of the position. We want to know what the possible costs will be, and what the possibilities are that it can operate successfully. As soon as we have those details, which I think ought to be soon, we will decide finally on the future of the shipbuilding industry at Saldanha.</p>

<p>May I ask for the privilege of the half-hour? As things are developing in South Africa to-day, the labour policy of the Government is becoming perhaps the most important aspect of government in South Africa. Therefore I hope that the Minister will assist the Committee in this debate by giving us a clear and definitive exposition of the Government’s labour policy, the labour policy of the Government particularly as it is designed to meet the one fact of our economic life which some of us have tried to deny or ignore in the past, but which none of us can escape, namely that our prosperity and the continued growth of our economic activity depend on the contribution which can be made to our economic life by every section of the people of South Africa, irrespective of colour. There was a time, for example when we debated clause 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, when Government members seemed to believe that one could wish away the contribution made by the Bantu and other non-Whites to the wealth of South Africa, that one could legislate against their contribution, and that one could protect the standards of the white workers in this country by denying to the non-white workers the opportunity to make their contribution to the economy of South Africa. But there are clear and very welcome signs to-day that the Government Party and the Cabinet are beginning to realize that for South Africa to prosper we have to train, educate and use every section of our population. This was brought home to us quite dramatically by an intelligent amendment moved by Senator Koster, to an Opposition motion In the Minister’s policy in the Other Place on 1st May. Her amendment thanked the Government for training and educating all sections of the people, and for taking adequate steps to meet the manpower shortage in South Africa. She coupled the two thoughts: the training and the education of all population groups in the country and the need to meet the manpower shortage.</p>

<p>What did you do about the matter in your time?</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The irrelevance of that interjection is absolutely staggering, and I think I must devote 30 seconds to it. When the United Party came into power in 1933, our problem was not a shortage of manpower, but the economic depression and the unemployment and the surplus manpower as the result of the stupid economic policies followed by the previous Nationalist Party Government. I have never heard such a stupid interjection in this House.</p>

<p>Now let me come back to my theme, because it is important. For our economic growth and for the prosperity we are experiencing today, we depend on the contributions of all <span class="col_6279-6280" refersTo="page_0287"/>sections of the South African population, and we see it in the statistics. We see, for example, in the latest but rather obsolete report of the Department of Labour, the one for 1967, at page 26, that the total number of people employed in the manufacturing industry in South Africa is about 1.2 million, and of those, in round figures, only about 300,000 are white: 25 per cent of the people working in the factories of South Africa are white, and 75 per cent are not white. And it does not matter where they are sited. This is one of the major bases of our prosperity. If one looks at the statistical news releases by the Bureau of Census and Statistics&#x2014;I have here those for April of this year and I have compared them with those of March of the year before&#x2014;one finds some very interesting figures indeed. I find that in mining, quarrying, manufacturing, construction, electricity, transport, etc. there were at the end of 1968 about 2¼ million people employed. Of those a little more than ½ million were white, 228,000 were Coloured, 69,000 were Asians and the Bantu were 1.4 million, showing a great preponderance of non-Whites. If one compares these figures with those of the year before, one finds that the number of people of all races employed in these major enterprises increased, as one would expect, but the rate of increase is significant. In the case of the Whites there were 4,000 more people employed. In the case of the Coloureds, who are only about half the number of Whites employed, the increase was 10,000, and in the case of the Asians, of whom there were only 69,000 as compared with ½ million Whites, the increase was 7,000, almost twice as high as that of the Whites, while the Bantu increased by 74,000. Now we may speak about separate development, but the fact remains that as things are to-day the South African economy is one. It means that in that one single economy the Bantu, the Coloured and the Asian are playing an increasingly important part in producing the wealth of South Africa. That is the truth we have to face in South Africa. That is the fact which a labour policy for South Africa, which must include the protection of the standards of living of the white workers and must afford opportunities for increasingly higher standards for the other communities also, must take into account. The Leader of the Opposition has on previous occasions, even during this Session, and especially in his speech on the Budget, stated the policy of the Opposition. One may not agree with it and I am not canvassing that policy at the moment, but I am stating the fact that we do state a policy to meet the situation. But what is the policy of the Government, except to approach the problem haphazardly, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, meeting each crisis as it develops, but with no plan and no clear indication to the people of South Africa that this is how we shall meet the situation and how we shall protect the interests of those people who deserve protection and how we will increase the standards of those who need increased standards and how we will avoid conflict and will give prosperity to the greatest number of people? They do not have such a policy; when crises come we have <i>ad hoc</i> decisions. For example, we had the hon. the Minister of Transport in the Railway debate standing up and blustering as always. He told us that he had substituted from 8,000 to 9,000 Bantu for Whites in jobs formerly done by Whites. This was an understatement, Sir. Those of us who have made a study of it are satisfied that there are many more than 8,000 or 9,000 jobs which have been taken away from Whites and given to non-Whites, because they had to be given in order to keep the wheels of transport moving in South Africa; and the Minister said he would do this irrespective of the wishes of the trade unions. Even if the trade unions refused, he would do it in the interests of South Africa, a completely <i>ad hoc</i> policy, but there is no clear indication of what is done to protect the interests of the white workers on the Railways except that the Minister said what we have said to him over the years, namely that if you do this not only will the non-white people benefit and not only will the work of the Railways be continued, but the white workers will be absorbed in higher occupations.</p>

<p>Now the Minister of Transport brags about this achievement, but there is no clear policy. We are told from Nationalist Party platforms that if ever there should be a recession in South Africa, these jobs will go back to the white people. Sir, what a pipe-dream! When these jobs are handed over to non-white people at wages which are about one-third of the wages which white people get in those jobs, what chance will the white man have of getting that job back during a period of depression, when there is a shortage of money and non-Whites will have to be dismissed to be replaced by Whites at wages three times as high as those of the non-Whites? Or is it the policy of the Government to replace the non-Whites in those jobs with Whites at the wages paid to the non-Whites? Sir, we want answers to these questions. We want to know where we stand. We want to know what his policy is, because a policy is urgently necessary. The hon. the Minister himself went down to Dundee during the Newcastle by-election and made a speech there in which he told us some very interesting things. He has modified his speech since then but the essence remains the same. He told us. &#x201C;that it would be sheer idiocy to hold back South Africa’s development by not allowing non-Whites into trades, said the Minister of Labour and of Coloured Affairs, Mr. Viljoen at Dundee last night&#x201D;, according to <i>The Star</i> reporter. The Minister afterwards told us that he was referring only to the building industry in Natal. I accept that, but then, of course, I want to say immediately that the Minister chose very strange words and figures and examples if he was limiting himself to the building industry alone. I find, for example, that he complained, &#x201C;even with 40,000 immigrants a year there are simply not <span class="col_6281-6282" refersTo="page_0288"/>enough white hands to do the work&#x201D;. Sir, there have never been 40,000 immigrants a year to cope with the building industry; that is the total immigration figure to deal with all the labour requirements of South Africa. But the Minister tells us that when he used these figures he was referring only to the building industry, and I am constrained to accept the Minister’s explanation. He made a bad speech, Sir: he chose his words badly; he was misunderstood, and I am glad that we understand him now. Sir, if it is in the interest of Natal, if it is in the interest of the building industry in Natal, that non-white workers should do work formerly done by Whites, on what possible grounds will it not be in the interests of South Africa if the same situation develops in other industries? Why must we accept that the building industry in Natal is <i>sui generis,</i> that it is something with no parallel anywhere else in South Africa or in any other undertaking in South Africa? Why should it be &#x201C;sheer idiocy&#x201D; to deny the inevitable in the case of the building industry in Natal and not in the case of other industries? For what reason must we believe that this was a statement of policy by the Minister which must be confined and limited only to the building industry in Natal? That, Sir, would indeed be sheer idiocy. No, Sir, it was a moment of truth for the hon. the Minister. He said something there which convinces me that fundamentally he is an intelligent man.</p>

<p>This problem is very serious indeed. I see in the <i>Provincial Gazette</i> that of the 15,000 posts for white teachers in the Transvaal, 7,200 had to be advertised at the beginning of the year because so many are filled by temporary people. Sir, this brings home to us more dramatically than anything else how short we are of skilled, trained manpower in South Africa. I believe that the first and the prime duty of a community is to see to the education of its young, and a community that fails to do that does not deserve to exist. That is the crisis, Sir. How is this crisis going to be met? Take an expert like Dr. Jan Marais, a man whose business acumen and economic insight we must all respect. Speaking at the annual congress of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut in Johannesburg in May of this year, he said he foresaw that by the year 2000 industry would contribute 36 per cent of the gross domestic product of South Africa as against 22 per cent to-day, industry most of whose enterprises use labour extensively. Sir, where will the workers come from? Dr. Marais then gave a clue; he told that same meeting that by the year 2000 the earnings of the Bantu people would have risen sevenfold compared to their wages to-day to reach R7,500,000 a year, seven times what it is today, according to Dr. Marais, and he added that this would result from the growing productivity of the African worker in South Africa. This learned and respected Afrikaner businessman has no doubt that the continued prosperity of South Africa will bring continued prosperity also to the Bantu people and make them more productive and make the role that they will play in the economic life of South Africa greater and more important. What is the policy of the Government? The Government is in trouble. They had a policy; they called it job reservation, reserving jobs on the basis of race, not for any economic reasons but purely on the basis of race. They wanted to retain a balance between the races in South Africa in occupations in South Africa. We know that in 1952, for example, 45.1 per cent of the workers in the clothing industry were white. In 1956 the Government introduced job reservation into that industry. Most of the agitation surrounding the introduction of section 77 referred to the clothing industry. They then introduced job reservation and said that the ideal would be to retain the number of white workers in the clothing industry at about 25 per cent and then. Sir, came the exemptions, one after the other, as the Government was forced to face the truth, as stated by the United Party at the time and ever since then; and to-day, Sir, the proportion of white workers in the clothing industry is not 45 per cent; it is not the ideal 25 per cent, it is only 9 per cent and it is still diminishing.</p>

<p>It is the result of the border industry policy to a large extent, as I will show in a minute. But, Sir, what is now the policy of the Government? Are they happy to see the clothing industry go completely black, which is the inevitable tendency all over the world? It is an unpopular occupation and if the white people can find better jobs, they will do better jobs, and the Government by job reservation will not compel the white people to stay in the clothing industry. Sir, that is the fact of the matter. In the transport industry the job of truck driver has been reserved for the Whites but most of those trucks are still driven by non-Whites today. Why? Because the Government does not combine with the job reservation policy a policy of the rate for the job or rather a policy of job evaluation. They still say that the rate for that job is, say, R30 a week and white people can get better work and better-paid work than work at R30 a week, so there are no white people to drive the trucks in spite of the Minister’s job reservation and exemptions have to be given. But what is the policy of the Government? We have to-day the tendency towards the fragmentation of jobs. Jobs are being made simpler. Fragmentation of jobs is used as an excuse to bring non-Whites into jobs previously held by Whites. In the case of painters in the building industry, the job is being fragmented. How? <span class="col_6283-6284" refersTo="page_0289"/>They say that the first coat can be put on by a Bantu but not the second or the third coat. The job is now fragmented into coats.</p>

<p>Sir, where will it end; what is the Government’s policy? We find that in some industries employers resist demands for wage increases, and if they resist long enough the white workers drift away because there is a terrific shortage of workers. They drift away from that job into a better-paid job and the employers then come to the Minister and then truthfully say: &#x201C;We cannot get white workers to do the job; give us examption,&#x201D; and then they get exemption. What is the policy of the Government? Is there a policy of job evaluation; is there a policy of the rate for the job, or is this process to continue indefinitely?</p>

<p>Sir, I want to be fair. From my reading and from the study I have made of this issue it seems to me that the Government has a new policy but they are nervous to state it. That policy is to encourage at all costs, even at the cost of the existing industrial areas of South Africa, the development of border industry, industries on the borders not of the homelands, but on the borders of the reserves and little locations, away from the existing industrial areas, because there, quietly and with the minimum of fuss, the Colour bar can be broken down, the rate for the job can be broken down, Bantu workers can be trained and put into more and more responsible jobs, quite rightly, but quite wrongly from the point of view that it is being done at rates of pay which in the long run are going to create in South Africa an economy where the black workers work at one level of income and the white workers at another level of income. Unfair competition and conflict are inherent in such a situation, and one dreads to think what the future prospects of South Africa are. Sir, what is the Government’s policy in respect of this?</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, when speaking to the Sabra Youth Congress at the end of March or the 1st of April or thereabouts, announced a scheme for the training of African factory workers in border areas by their employers, who would be subsidized by the State. Every establishment with 20 workers or more would be able to do this. The hon. the Deputy Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department will examine the facilities and the course (of training) and determine the competence of the instructors. If these were satisfactory, the training centre would be registered as a State-assisted industrial school, which would be subject to inspection. In this way every industry in the border area can train as many workers as it needs for its specific purposes. It can also be expected that a great number of State-subsidized industrial schools will come into being to give industrial training to thousands of Bantu.</block>

<p>In the border areas! That is good, Sir, but what in the long run is going to be the relationship with these newly trained Bantu workers whose low wage is a major inducement to industrialists not to start new enterprises in Johannesburg and Cape Town but rather in Newcastle or Rosslyn? What is going to be the ultimate relationship between those workers and the white workers of South Africa? Because it must be remembered, Sir, that this is not separate development; this is integration between white factories in white South Africa and Bantu labour in Bantu reserves and in Bantu locations like the one at Rosslyn or like the little black spot next to Newcastle where the new Iscor is to be established &#x2026;</p>

<p>It is a suburb of Pretoria with a location nearby. I have read reports that the motor factory there employs Tswana and Pedi and that the porcelain factory there employs Tswanas and South Sotho’s.

Where is the homeland development; where is the theory of separate development; where is the policy? <b>It</b> is a fraud; it is a bluff; it is a shameful bluff upon the people of South Africa and it is time, in the interests of clarity, in the interests of the future development of South Africa, in the interests of future industrial peace in South Africa, in the interests of future racial peace in South Africa, that the Government stated their policy in every aspect and got away from this <i>ad hoc</i> deception upon the people of creating greater opportunities for the Bantu workers of South Africa, which is a good thing, apart from the criticism that I have stated? We find from the latest report of the committee for the location of industry under Professor Rautenbach that they expect that the Bantu will generate from their own areas 35.000 work seekers every year. In the whole of South Africa 58,000 Bantu will come onto the labour market every year. From 1960, when this scheme was started, until 1967, 5,000 Bantu have been placed in border <span class="col_6285-6286" refersTo="page_0290"/>industries every year. The report says that in these first eight years at a direct investment of R314 million, work was given to 54,000 Bantu at a cost of R5,800 per job.</p>

What sacrifices are we going to make? Who is going to pay for it? To what extent is the normal development of the existing growth points in South Africa to be limited and to be restricted in the name of this ideology? Let us see what the experts of the Government have to say. I think of Dr. Rieckert, chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, who told a conference in Johannesburg in late April that in 1904 the urban Bantu were 10.4 per cent of our urban population. In 1960 they had grown to 31.8 per cent. By the year 2000, says Dr. Rieckert, they will be between 60 and 70 per cent of the urban population. What is the policy of the Government in this respect? We are told that this is bad, that it is evil, but it remains the projection of the Government’s experts. If they want to stop it, how will they stop it? Where will these people go? When will they start industrial development on the borders of the homelands to further the policy of separate development in which they believe and get away from the little dormitory at Rosslyn and the 15 or 20 farms that have recently been bought near Newcastle, 39 miles from the nearest homeland and, where Iscor is going to be established?</p>

As far as I know, not a single border industry has been established on the borders of the Transkei since the Government came into power in 1948. Where is the policy? I make a plea to the Minister of Labour, because he holds a key position in this matter, in this whole problem of race relations in South Africa. He holds a key position in the execution, the implementation of the policy of separate development. Let us have a frank talk. Let him take us into his confidence and tell us what is his policy and where we are going to. Can we under the policy of separate development dispense with the necessity of employing Bantu? Can we make white South Africa, in their terminology, less dependent upon Bantu labour than we are to-day? That is the crux and the test of the success of the policy of separate development. Can we become economically independent of the Black workers of this country? If we cannot, we must be honest and think again. One must admit that the policy of separate development, as expounded by the theorists of the Nationalist Party, is an impossible and an impracticable policy, which requires new thinking and a new approach by all of us in South Africa.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is very clear that we have been listening to-day to someone who is probably the greatest integrationist in the United Party. I think he must change places and come and sit next to the Progressive Party member. That is actually where he belongs.</p>

<p>I do not want to follow up on what the hon. member has said, because my time is limited. There are in fact a few matters which I regard as important and which I want to bring to the attention of the hon. Minister. [Interjections.] This is a serious matter. Apparently the Opposition regards these matters in a very light vein and would very much like to make cheap propaganda. I should like to return to the question of the training of our apprentices. Under the old system it took an apprentice more or less five years to undergo his training. Thanks to the National Party Government an investigation as instituted during 1960 and the National Apprenticeship Board was instructed to revise the system. Consequently certain recommendations were made by the National Apprenticeship Board and the Act was amended in 1963, as far as the training of our apprentices was concerned. The system was tremendously improved. I am not going to refer to all the improvements which were effected by this Act. I can just mention that as a result of this improved system it was found that our contracts of apprenticeship increased from 6,611 in 1963 to 9,090 in 1968. It was also found that as a result of improvements effected to the Act, the total current contracts increased by plus minus 44 per cent between the years 1964 and 1968. It was also proved that as a result of the improved system the educational level of apprentices which were now applying for apprenticeship was higher. I have tried to indicate what improvements have already been effected to his Act. But there are also certain problems. I think this side is prepared to recognize and admit the existence of problems and shortcomings. I should like to bring these to the attention of the hon. Minister, as well as the Department of Labour. I want to congratulate the Department of Labour on this occasion on the excellent work they are doing in this country of ours. I think the Secretary, with his Department and officials, is acting in such a way that we can do nothing else but <span class="col_6287-6288" refersTo="page_0291"/>convey our gratitude to them for the work they are doing. If we were to refer to the so-called obsolete annual report&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Yeoville is obsolete&#x2014;I just want to point out that in that year 10,011 new contracts of apprenticeship were registered. Of those 10,011 apprenticeship contracts 8,132 had been entered into with pupils with a Std. VIII or lower qualification. In respect of approximately 1,700 the qualifications were Std. IX or Std. X. Of the mentioned number it is clear that 80 per cent of the apprentices enrolled last year had a Std. VIII or lower qualification. Now I want to accept at once, and I do not think that anyone can deny this, that most of those young boys are Afrikaans-speaking. I think the Opposition will also accept this.</p>

<p>Are they not all South Africans?</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that it really is time he tried to use his commonsense a little, if he still has any left. I just want to refer to the results which were achieved with the qualifying trade tests. In 1964 38.6 per cent of the pupils who did those tests passed. In the metal and engineering industry only 37 per cent passed. In 1967 31.75 per cent passed and in the metal and engineering industry 22.2 per cent. This tendency is disturbing, i.e. that the number of passes among our apprentices is not what it should be. I refer to the school qualifications of our apprentices, and I indicated the number of passes in trade tests. The first shortcoming which I would like to bring to the attention of the National Apprenticeship Council in particular is that we have no prescribed books and trade set works in Afrikaans. Is it fair that that Afrikaans-speaking child should learn that trade in which he must equip himself in a foreign language? I want to ask that something should be done so that we can get the necessary Afrikaans prescribed books for those pupils. I may just mention that 90 to 95 per cent of all the prescribed works are in English. I think it is unfair that a child should have to serve his apprenticeship, through the medium of a foreign language.</p>

<p>There is a second point which also gives rise to concern. This is that the number of contracts of apprenticeship which were cancelled increased from 1,246 in 1964 to 2,023 in 1967. Is it not possible that an inquiry can be instituted into the reason for this increase?</p>

<p>There is a third shortcoming which causes me concern, and I wanted to ask once again whether an investigation cannot be instituted in order to determine whether the duration of apprenticeship training of bricklayers, electro-mechanicians, and instrument mechanics should be the same. We know that there are certain trade tests which they can take, but I nevertheless think that this matter should be investigated again.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another matter I want to refer to. Mention is so often made of our high productivity, and I want to make an appeal in this connection to-day. We have a small percentage of workers in this country, and now I am not talking about the jobless, but about those who no longer want to work. They may perhaps amount to 1 per cent. We get them in the factories. They live off their fellow employees. They live off the owner. They subsequently live off the Trade Union and then live off the State when they want workmen’s compensation benefits. To-day I want to request the co-operation of Trade Unions in this connection, so that we can in some way or other take steps against these people, so that they will also contribute their due share in this country. This must be done so that they will also contribute their share as far as the labour market is concerned. I know that this is not a popular statement I am now making, but there is a small percentage, even if it is only 1 per cent, who are displaying this tendency. We need their labour.</p>

<p>There is one last point I want to raise. We in this country are enjoying prosperity and tremendous industrial peace and industrial quiet. We bestow academic and scientific awards for achievements in those fields. We do the same in the Defence Force and the Police. Now I wonder whether it is not time we made similar awards to our labour leaders for their contribution to our continuing industrial peace and quiet in this country. I think that if we had not had responsible trade union leaders in this country we would not have had this industrial peace and quiet. I think we should also create a place for them so that we can bestow the necessary awards on them.</p>

<p>I also want to refer briefly to what the hon. member for Yeoville said. It was once quite clear that as far as they were concerned there was only one way the manpower shortage could be solved and that was, as I stated previously, to throw open the sluice gates and flood the labour market with black labour. It matters not what will become of the Whites and the Coloureds in this country. That is what hon. members want. They are the greatest champions of integration. Now they want to put a scare into the white worker by saying that he will have no guarantee of protection. The hon. member for Yeoville referred to what the hon. the Minister of Transport said here. Can that hon. member or any other hon. member on the opposite side to day show us one white person who is worse off than he was in the past, wherever he may have been working? I say that they are pedalling, but they are too ashamed to admit that they support the policy of the Progressive Party. Only when they have the courage to admit that will they be telling the truth. We know that we have manpower problems, but I think that this Government and this Minister is quite capable of solving the future problems as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, endeavoured to reply to the points raised by the hon. member for Yeoville, at the very end of his speech. However, he did not give any indication whatsoever to prove his accusation that this side of the House does not have the interests of the white worker at heart. Indeed, the hon. member for Yeoville clearly stated that we on this side of the House wished to see the position of the white worker safeguarded. We wish to see greater productivity amongst all the racial groups in South Africa, and not merely in one racial group. He did not in any way defend the actions of the present Government in regard to what he called &#x201C;defending the white worker&#x201D;. Ths hon. member for Yeoville clearly illustrated that job reservation is failing hopelessly. The number of exemptions which have to be granted, indicates that it is merely used from time to time to suit political ends. We on this side of the House believe that a grave danger exists, as far as the security of the white worker is concerned, where we are establishing industries in areas where the same work can be done at a far lower rate of pay by non-Whites. The hon. member who has just spoken, failed to appreciate this point, which was a major point made by the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>However, he also dealt with the question of the Apprenticeship Act. Here the hon. member tended to be relatively easy on the hon. the Minister and on the Government. But when one takes into account the serious situation in regard to the shortage of apprentices in the various trades, one soon realizes that this is a vitally important problem which is facing South Africa. We have a developing and growing economy. However, if one looks at the number of contracts that are in operation one sees that, for instance, in 1966 there were 11,285 new contracts registered while in 1967 there were only 10,011 new contracts registered during those two years. This is to meet a growing economy. We have a shrinking number of apprentices entering the various trades. If one looks at the building trade, for instance, there is a steady decline in the number of apprentices qualifying for the building industry. If one looks at the tables that are included in the latest report of the Department of Labour, one can only be alarmed at the situation as far as apprenticeships are concerned in South Africa. I believe that it is time for the hon. the Minister to ask for a full investigation by the Apprenticeship Board into the present system under the Apprenticeship Act and also the present system of apprenticeship. There is obviously a great deal to be done in this regard. The hon. member referred to the question of the academic qualifications of prospective apprentices. I served for some time on a juvenile affairs board. There one was shocked from time to time to find how inadequately equipped these people were academically to face the task of entering into apprenticeship which, in many instances, due to the advance of technology, requires a higher standard of education.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of the Minister’s Vote which I should like to raise in the Committee. This too, I believe, is an answer to the hon. member who has spoken before me and who indicated that we on this side of the House do not have the interest of the white worker at heart. We indeed have the interest of all workers at heart. I should like to deal with the question of the social security measures which are provided for in terms of our labour legislation. First of all, I want to deal with the Workmen’s Compensation Act. This is an Act which, incidentally, was placed on the Statute Book by a United Party Government. The Minister replied to a question on Tuesday, 18th March, when I asked him various questions concerning the fund which showed that the assets of the fund now stand at over R20½ million. The hon. the Minister then indicated that there was a possibility of reviewing the awards made prior to the amending Act of 1967. Here I make a special appeal to the hon. the Minister to give this matter his urgent attention. I believe it is most unjust that where improvements are made in regard to compensation in terms of the Act, those persons who are already receiving compensation do not receive any increase in their awards. It makes it extremely difficult for these people as they become older to have to exist on a hopelessly inadequate compensation bearing in mind the present day cost of living. Yet, when the amendments were made, such as were made in 1967, there was nothing in the amending legislation to assist those people who already were receiving such compensation.</p>

<p>This leads to the other point, namely the question of unclaimed awards in terms of the Act. The hon. the Minister in reply to another question in the House last week, indicated that there was something like R1½ million in unclaimed awards under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Here I believe an effort must be made to try and assist these people who are entitled to receive these awards, but who for various reasons cannot be contacted. It appears that additional steps are required, whereby the employer should also be made responsible for keeping contact with these people. There have been a number of cases where dependants of persons who have lost their lives in the course of their duties have had a tremendous struggle to exist whereas they were entitled to receive compensation. However, they have lost contact with the Workmen’s Compensation Office and consequently could not receive such compensation. If one refers to the <i>Government Gazette,</i> one sees the large number of African employees who suffer in this way. I believe that the hon. the Minister should give consideration to placing a legal onus on the employer to at least fully inform the employee that he is entitled to such compensation and that he should continue to make inquiries until such <span class="col_6291-6292" refersTo="page_0293"/>time as he gets the compensation. I know of various cases where people were eventually contacted by the assistance of others, sometimes after three or four years. However, during that period of time, the widow and the children of these employees who have lost their lives, suffered severe financial hardships. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will consider finding ways and means of seeing that the amount of unclaimed awards in terms of Workmen’s Compensation is drastically reduced.</p>

<p>The other part of the social security legislation which is administered by this hon. Minister, also requires investigation and that is the Unemployment Insurance Act. If we look at the position of the fund to-day, we find that it has grown by some R19 million over the last five years. It has grown from R114 million to R133 million, which is the latest available figure showing the credit balance of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. I believe important adjustments should be made in regard to the payments of benefits in terms of this Act. In terms of the 1962 legislation the payments of benefits have been curtailed considerably. One sees that many of these contributors have made contributions for a large number of years and yet when the time comes for them to claim such contributions, in other words when they have reached the retirement stage, are then discarded. Many are not paid any unemployment benefits as they are not considered as being available for the labour market. Similarly with maternity benefits, the persons should be kept fully informed as to what their rights are and what they are entitled to. In terms of the Act, a woman contributor claiming maternity benefits can claim for a period of 18 weeks prior to the expected date of confinement, and can claim for eight weeks post-natal benefits. However, where the contributor continues in employment for a period within the 18 weeks, she loses the benefits which are due to her. The contributor can then only receive the benefits from that period and eight weeks after the date of confinement. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this evening the hon. member for Yeoville once again played the same old two-stringed instrument hon. members of the Opposition have been playing all these years, and that is the manpower shortage. They are exploiting the manpower shortage and job reservation in order to make political capital from that. I just want to mention a few factors which will prove that the Government does not adopt a disinterested attitude towards the manpower shortage or towards the shortage of artisans. I can mention to hon. members the methods which are being employed for combating this problem. The following figures prove this. For the 10-year period 1938 to 1947, 36,847 apprentices were registered; for the 10-year period 1948 to 1957 71,338 apprentices were registered and in the 10-year period 1958 to 1968 87,899 apprentices were registered. At the end of 1947, 19,687 apprenticeship contracts were in force, at the end of 1957 27,418 contracts were in force, and at the end of 1968 35,082 were in force. In order to meet and combat the shortage of artisans, the Government amended the Apprenticeship Act in 1951, 1959 and 1963. That was done to meet the problem of a shortage of artisans which had arisen. In addition it had to try to supplement the shortage. The second step taken was the introduction of aptitude tests so that persons may be trained in the correct trades. Hon. members know that previously many people were not trained in the correct trades. Many of the Whites were untrained and to-day there still are many Whites who are untrained. In the third instance qualifying tests were introduced so as to enable people to acquire artisan status sooner. With certain qualifications men are now able to qualify within 2½ years instead of the original period of five years as the position used to be under the old set-up. The fourth step that was taken for combating this position was to increase the salaries of artisans. That was done to attract people to the trades. The hon. member for Yeoville also knows about this. In the fifth place the number of men who did qualifying tests during 1968 was increased to 6,300. Of this number of 6,300 apprentices 2,200 passed the qualifying tests, i.e. 30 per cent. But a very high standard is required of these people and a very high standard is being maintained. Therefore the tests are of such a nature that only the gifted who do extremely well pass the tests. We are obliged to keep these standards high. Thus these 2,200 artisans became available to the labour market a year or two sooner. In the sixth place the standard of education of prospective apprentices has continued to improve. During 1968 3,400 apprentices with standard VIII qualifications were registered and 1,150 with standard IX or X qualifications. The facilities for technical training are being extended continually. We also know from the Education Report what interest the Department of Education is howing in training these people in the right direction by means of vocational guidance, etc. Very important is the new aspect of training, i.e. the group class system, or the so-called &#x201C;block release&#x201D;, in terms of which apprentices attend classes for an uninterrupted period of 10 weeks per annum instead of the old arrangement of attending classes on one or two evenings per week.</p>

<p>Most industrialists prescribe this new system as a condition of apprenticeship. In addition there is the training of adults. In terms of the Training of Artisans Act, which this Government also placed on the Statute Book in 1951, adults are being trained at Westlake at present. Up to now 2,842 recruits have been trained and the cost to the State of the training these men have been receiving in this way are approximately R4 million. This means that every person trained in this way costs the State approximately R1,300. If these things do not <span class="col_6293-6294" refersTo="page_0294"/>prove that the Government is fully aware of the problems in connection with our manpower shortage as far as artisans are concerned, then I do not know what else there is we have to do.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the question of sheltered employment and there is one matter in this connection I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. In the first place, it is with a sense of appreciation that I take cognizance of the personal interest shown by the hon. the Minister in sheltered employment and in these people who are physically handicapped. I want to thank him very sincerely on behalf of these people. These sheltered employment factories are too often seen as charitable institutions and the way the Government is looking after these people is too often referred to as charity. This, in fact, is not true. The Government is giving these people the opportunity to retain their human dignity, to do their share as citizens of the Republic of South Africa and to be proud of the fact that they are not dependent on State aid but are able to earn for themselves and in that way retain their self-respect. We should not fail to realize that these people are handicapped persons and that they cannot have the same mental disposition as healthy and normal people. Many of us who are normal, bury our talents, whereas these people with the few talents they have and the ability they have, still earn their own living in spite of their handicaps. The problem is that they are very sensitive people. It is an art to work with these people and one has to have a great deal of patience and sympathy; one must have knowledge of their problem and of the way in which they must be assisted. What is more, these people are not highly trained people. They usually are people who have a low level of training. The instructors who have to assist and guide these people and who have to see to it that there is production so as to make these people feel like worthy human beings are performing a very special task. I believe that these instructors should be accomodated and that their wage structure will be revised. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Hercules also dealt with the question of the shortage of apprentices, but I now want to complete my argument in regard to maternity benefits, because I believe that the working wife and the working mother are playing a very important part in meeting the labour shortage that exists in South Africa. They do indeed play a vital role and therefore efforts should be made to assist them in regard to the question of the payment of these maternity benefits. I believe that they should all be able to qualify for a full 26 weeks benefits, provided they meet the other requirement of having been contributors for 18 weeks during the 52 weeks prior to the expected date of confinement. The other aspect is the question of payments to the dependants of deceased contributors. When one looks at the figures one realizes that there is a large number of deceased contributors’ dependants who would be able to claim these benefits if it was brought to their notice that such benefits are due to them. In terms of the legislation it is not possible to claim these benefits unless the claim is made within three years after the death of a contributor. However, there are cases where many of these people are unaware of the fact that these benefits are due to them as dependants of the deceased contributor, and I feel that this should be brought to the notice of these people.</p>
