<heading>Establishment of regional organizations by Natal local authorities for combating oil pollution</heading>

<question by="#mitchell" to="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<num>*4.</num>

<from>Mr. D. E. MITCHELL</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether it has been brought to his notice that the Natal Provincial Administration has requested the local authorities along the coast to consider the desirability of combining on a regional basis to perform certain public services, <i>inter alia</i> to protect the beaches from oil pollution;</li>

<li>(2) whether such regional organizations can obtain help from the Government for this purpose; if so, (a) to what extent and (b) in what manner; if not,</li>

<li>(3) whether he will have the matter investigated with a view to designing some form of Government help; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#mitchell">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No, but it is probably an indirect consequence of discussions an official of the Department of Industries had with the provisionally composed action committee for the combating of oil pollution along the Natal Coast. This Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Member of the Natal Executive Committee charged with local government and development, will function within the framework of the organization for the combating of oil pollution already approved by me in principle.</li>

<li>(2) (a) and (b) The question of financial assistance must be seen in the light of my statement last year in which it was indicated that the Government considered the prevention and/or combating of serious incidents of oil pollution as a problem of national importance and that the Department of Industries had been charged with the handling thereof.

<ul>

<li>In terms of this statement, and as has also been explained to local interests during the aforementioned discussions, the Government accepts responsibility for the costs which have to be incurred to combat such incidents of oil pollution.</li>

<li>Where local authorities or other bodies may, therefore, be of assistance to the Department of Industries in cleaning up operations in serious cases of oil pollution, they will, as in the case of the <i>World Glory,</i> on the rendering of accounts be reimbursed with all costs so incurred by them.</li>

<li>The hon. member will realize that, due to the nature of the matter, the Government cannot in incidental and negligible cases of oil pollution, as have often been experienced in the past, accept responsibility for either the cleaning up of beaches that may become polluted to a certain extent or for the cost involved in the cleaning up thereof. The handling of such cases should, as in the past, form part of the normal beach cleaning services maintained by local authorities situated along the coast; and</li>

</ul></li>

<li>(3) in the light of what I have already stated this part of the question falls away.</li>

<heading>Investigation into effects on air pollution of exhaust systems of motor vehicles</heading>

<p>The MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT (for the Minister of Planning) replied to Question *12, by Mr. L. F. Wood:</p>

<question by="#wood" to="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is investigating the effect upon air pollution of the emission of exhaust systems of (a) petrol and (b) diesel driven vehicles which are manufactured or assembled in South Africa; if so,</li>

<li>(2) whether the investigations have reached a stage when a report can be issued in regard to the carcinogenic effect of carbon monoxide and benzine derivatives emitted in the exhaust fumes from carburettor engines.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development" to="#wood">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) and (b): Investigation at Pretoria, Johannesburg and Durban revealed that the concentration of oxidizing agents, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon compounds in the atmosphere above South African cities is fairly low. It is therefore considered unnecessary to equip motor vehicles at this stage with apparatus for decreasing uncombusted exhaust gases.</li>

<li>(2) According to medical authorities carbon monoxide has no carcinogenic properties. The concentration of Benspyrene in the atmosphere of Pretoria, Johannesburg and Durban has been determined and the data obtained has been published in the American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal&#x2014;volume 26 (1965). It is, however, impossible to determine the percentage of these compounds actually derived from motor exhaust gases, as several other sources of these compounds are found in any major city.</li>

<ol>

<li>(1) What were the requirements in regard to a rising percentage of (a) domestic raw materials and (b) labour to be used by the firms supplying telecommunications equipment referred to by him in his statement of 18th February, 1969;</li>

<li>(2) whether these requirements have been met; if not, (a) in the case of which firms have the requirements not been met and (b) what steps has he taken in that regard;</li>

<li>(3) whether any funds from Government sources are invested in these companies; if so, (a) in which companies, (b) what amounts and (c) from what sources;</li>

<li>(4) whether the contracts with these companies contained any condition or reference in regard to the companies making shares available to persons or bodies in South Africa; if so, what are the particulars in this regard.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) and (b) The contracts stipulate that the local content of the equipment to be supplied, should increase as follows:

<ul>

<li>70% during the period 1.1.1968&#x2014;31.12.1968,</li>

<li>(2) (a) Messrs. Siemens, S.A. (Pty.), Ltd. were unable to meet the requirements in respect of the delivery of teleprinters only. This is due to the very complex mechanical nature of these machines which consist of at least 2,000 parts.

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to raise a matter in regard to the load lines certificate and particularly in regard to the matter of exemptions. I did not quite understand the purport of the Minister&#x2019;s remark yesterday in the Second Reading when he said that the matter of load lines was better dealt with by way of regulation. I wish to bring to his notice a particular case for clarification, and that is the question of varying the load line in our waters as regards tankers. I understand the decision has been taken that the summer load line in Cape waters will be allowed in winter time at the request of the Load Line Convention, presumably. Up to now we have been particularly careful and cautious about variations of the load line, so much so that when a ship loads at Durban and conforms with the load line in winter time and it enters Cape waters and the Cape Town port, and it does not conform with the winter load line in Cape Town, the captain is prosecuted. Such cases have occurred. But in this case we are permitting tankers&#x2014;and one knows the size of tankers to-day&#x2014;to observe the summer load line in winter time in the Cape waters. To my mind this seems to be inviting trouble. I go further. It is inviting disaster. We have these tankers, and members of this House have been particularly conscious of the question of oil pollution. Over and above the variation of the load line, I believe, subject to correction, that these tankers are allowed in shipping lanes within 10 miles of our coast. There is a mile wide lane going north-east and another one coming south, with a mile in between. That in itself appears to me, as a layman, to be a difficult operation with the weather that is experienced in Cape waters. In addition I would like to ask whether in granting this exemption, any marine authorities were consulted in this country&#x003F; Was it a decision of somebody sitting in Pretoria, taking this decision in good faith&#x003F; We have marine authorities in this country. We have shipping lines, registered under our own flag, and there is the South African Navy. It seems to me that we are inviting disaster in the future if this is the position. When I say there is a 10-mile limit, it means that such a ship is travelling 10 miles off Cape Agulhas and the ships, while they are new and in perfect order, may be quite safe and nothing may happen, but like everything else they age. Luckily up to now we have not had any major disaster in this respect, but it can happen and it can cause great consternation and economic ruin to industries on our coast. It would seem to me that not sufficient care has been taken over this matter, and I ask the Deputy Minister to clarify the matter.</p>

<p>Firstly, who asked for it&#x003F; How was the request made to our authorities in South Africa&#x003F; On my road home I travel along the coastline for about 85 miles and it is quite a common experience to-day in that stretch of 85 miles to see no less than five tankers, loaded.

But who helps us in South Africa&#x003F; The reply I got to my question only this morning from the Minister of Economic Affairs underlines the danger on the cost not only to individuals and to groups in South Africa but to the Government. A national disaster can take place. We would like the fullest information as to who asked for the application of the summer load line in our waters.

<p>I want to tell the Committee that the recommendation was actually made by the I.M.C.O., the International Marine Countries Organization. They made the recommendation. That means that the request was put by this international organization at the conference. Their recommendation was also that these tankers should travel in certain lanes, not too near the coast. Then it was adopted at the International Load Line Convention that the South African waters would be a summer load line area.</p>

<p>That is the point. It was adopted with our agreement. The lane, as I understand it, is only 10 miles off our coast. Our prevailing winds are north-east and south-east, and an accident 10 miles from our coast may have the result that within a matter of hours we have the oil on our beaches. I have myself been out by plane following the oil slick when it was over 60 miles long along our coast, coming from the <i>World Glory.</i> We went up to look at it from the air, to see exactly what was threatening our coast. All that saved us was that we had a southwesterly wind blowing, a most unusual occurrence at that time. It blew for four or five days. That is all that saved us because it kept the oil from moving towards our coast. Otherwise we would have had a catastrophe of the greatest magnitude on the south coast of Natal. But it can happen anywhere on our coast. We also had the case of a tanker coming to grief on the west coast. Ten miles is much too close to our coast. I myself saw a vessel the other day, a loaded oil tanker, heading straight for the rocks on which the <i>Aimee Lykes</i> came to grief five or six years ago. At the last minute, in the broad light of day and with hundreds of holiday-makers on the beaches, we watched her suddenly pur her helm over and slide past without coming to grief. And as I say, there are five tankers at any one time in a matter of 85 miles.</p>

<p>It is not only the load line; it is the arrangements dealing with the lanes in which they are allowed to travel. The lane is too close; it is only 10 miles from our coast. In regard to the load line, we had a ship the other day which struck a submerged object near Danger Point, an object that nobody knew anything about; it had never yet been charted. With a deeply laden ship, those dangers are always present. All that we should be concerned with, I suggest, is the complete and absolute safety of our own coastline, and to save it from the dangers of a catastrophe such as the British people had with the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> disaster a couple of years ago. I hope that the Minister will go into this matter and see whether even at this late stage it cannot be reviewed and something done about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the hon. members for Von Brandis and South Coast. There is another factor which we have to take into consideration, namely that our surveys of our coasts, with modern shipping and these deep draught tankers, are out of date. Where a ship might have been quite safe drawing 35 to 40 feet of water close in, these big ships drawing up to 55 and 60 feet are in grave danger. Recently a ship off Agulhas struck a submerged object which lifted up its plating, and when it came to Cape Town there was a certain amount of pollution here. But they were never able to find that object. According to the charts there was ample water there. That shows how out of date our surveys are. Until our Navy, which is working very <span class="col_4283-4284" refersTo="page_0629"/>hard on it at present, completes the re-survey of our coast, it is necessary for these tankers to stay our much further than they are doing at present. Certain companies with very big tankers make them stay out 20 to 25 miles. They do not take any risks. They know that the surveys are out of date and that it is possible to strike an under-water obstruction. Ten miles is little enough and there is a danger element in having these ships coming in so close.</p>

<p>I would like to get back to clause I (e), which changes the definition of load line ship to mean any ship of 45 feet or more in length instead of a ship of 25 or more gross tons. Now there is going to be a load line restriction on ships of 45 feet or more in length. I want to ask whether the Minister has given consideration to the question of our fishing craft which exceed this length. Some of them are big boats to-day and there is a danger element there. There has been loss of life and I think it is a matter that the Minister should give consideration to. They have gone from tonnage to length, and these big boats exceed that length, which constitutes another danger element. I should like to hear the Minister&#x2019;s views on this.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I think we should bear in mind in considering this Bill the original reason for the introduction of a load line. The introduction of a load line was to safeguard the lives of seamen and not necessarily the life of the ship, but that position has changed now. In the early days when ships sailed the coast and across the sea it was known that greedy merchants overloaded their ships and thus endangered the lives of the men on the ships. So a load line was originally introduced to safeguard the lives of the men. Since then the idea of a load line has gone much further because we have ships of such great value sailing the seas&#x2014;the modern ship costs a lot of money&#x2014;that the underwriters will not insure a ship at Lloyds if that ship is going to be used in any manner whatsoever which will increase the normal risk of that ship sailing the sea. So we have to get back to the facts contained in this Bill. We have allowed for an increase or an adjustment of the load line. No international convention down over the years, in my opinion, would accede to such a request if it in any way believed that it would endanger the lives of the men sailing that ship. And if they ensure the lives of the men sailing that ship then they must automatically be ensuring the safety of the ship. We have been discussing here instead, the problems of navigational errors and matters of that nature. This is what has happened. The hon. member for Salt River mentioned the example of a ship which ran into an uncharted submerged object. There was a case not many years ago on the East Coast of Africa where a ship hit an uncharted object, but afterwards it was found that the ship was 25 miles off course. The load line cannot account for errors in navigation of this degree. I believe that under the circumstances it is quite justifiable to increase the load line of a tanker which, after all, is a ship which is designed in many cases to be submerged to such an extent that it keeps the cargo cool. A tanker is designed not to float above the water so much, but within the sea to a larger extent. This stops the evaporation of a highly volatile cargo, this is a feature of the design of a tanker. After all, what will be the difference in the load line of a tanker&#x003F; How many inches is it going to raise or lower the ship in the sea&#x003F; To what extent is it going to contribute to the dangers which we have had presented here this morning&#x003F; I believe the increase in draught is infinitesimal. The object of this change is to iron out the passage of that ship so that it can pass from its loading point to the point of discharge without having to make allowances for variations in load line along the way. I believe the whole matter is as simple as this.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to provide hon. members with this information, and especially the hon. member for South Coast. If we did not agree and this decision was not taken tankers would have been entitled to come even closer to the coast. This limit of ten miles is a safeguard and if we did not decide upon that tankers would have been able to come even closer to the coast. The whole matter is, however, receiving further consideration. I also want to mention to the hon. member for Salt River that load line provisions are not applicable to fishing boats. Even the International Load Line Convention is not applicable to fishing boats. This is the position at present.</p>

<p>*The Department is nonetheless watching this problem very carefully. The Department is fully aware of the problem, and efforts are made to cope with the situation. Warnings are also issued from time to time to owners, shipmasters and canning factories to draw their attention to this danger.</p>

<heading>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause makes provision for compensation to any local authority in respect of fruitless expenditure where areas have been proclaimed and then de-proclaimed. The local authorities are placed in a difficult position, not <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the Department of Community Development or the Community Development Board, but <span class="col_4285-4286" refersTo="page_0630"/>in reaching finality, so far as the Department of Planning is concerned in the proclamation of group areas. The Minister has, in the course of the discussion during the Second Reading, referred to delays which took place within municipalities in areas which should be developed after proclamation. I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that I think the blame is put at the wrong door. In this connection he is now in fact making provision for fruitless expenditure under clause I. According to the reply given to me by the hon. the Minister of Planning, it is hazardous for a municipality to start developing as soon as a group area is declared. It is a most hazardous and a risky matter because there is no question of finality. From the replies given to me this morning it is clear that up to the 11th of April, 1969, no less than 21 areas in the Cape Province were proclaimed and then de-proclaimed and thereafter re-proclaimed for a different use. In Natal there was no less than four areas and in the Transvaal no less than 16. The question of fruitless expenditure is a difficult one, because by insisting that the local authorities incur expenditure, the Minister is hastily building up for himself terrific claims under this particular clause which is now before us. I want to give the hon. the Minister an example. At Aliwal North an area of 50 morgen was proclaimed a Coloured area on the 20th September, 1957. One would have expected that area to be developed and that any expenditure would not have been fruitless if it had been undertaken within a year or two of proclamation. Four years later, however, the Group Areas Board changed its mind. Anything spent in respect of this large area of 50 morgen, could run into a large amount of money. If one goes through this list of these 41 changes of mind, which in every case could have led to fruitless expenditure, in terms of this clause, one finds in respect of Elliot that an area was re-proclamated for another use eight years after the original proclamation. In the Peninsula itself the periods have been two years, three years and four years, in cases where there have been changes in the original proclamations. In Knysna, for instance, seven years after the proclamation in 1959 of a white area in which the Knysna Municipality would have been expected to go ahead and provide services for development, one finds, that is in 1966, the position was changed and the area was de-proclaimed for Coloured use. In some instances, as long as ten years elapsed after the original proclamation, before the areas were de-proclaimed or re-proclaimed. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister in assuming these powers&#x2014;we shall support this clause&#x2014;that if the Community Development Board is hasty in requiring local authorities to develop areas immediately after proclamation, whether he will not be getting a rather heavy bill if the present conduct of the Department of Planning continues. The delay in developing these areas and the reluctance of local authorities to do so immediately after proclamation, should not cause them to be blamed but the Department of Planning because of its vacillations in coming to finality.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Green Point. He has mentioned many of the fears and aspects I raised during the Second Reading debate. There are however other difficulties I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I want to ask him to move an appropriate amendment in the Other Place to accommodate them. For example, after proclamation, of a group area where there has been de-proclamation, in terms of the provisions of this Bill, the local authority will have the power to claim compensation. But it is not only local authorities that have incurred expenditure after proclamation and before de-proclamation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday during the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister told us that he would furnish details to us as to why it was necessary to insert a new paragraph (c) (ii) in subsection (2) of the principal Act. The argument of the hon. the Minister during the Second Reading debate was that that was necessitated by the removal of large numbers of Coloureds <span class="col_4287-4288" refersTo="page_0631"/>from the eastern side of the Fish River/Kat River line to an area to the west of that line. During that debate the hon. the Minister promised to inform us of the extent of the proposed removal and of the reasons why it was necessary to pay this compensation to local authorities, those that had planned for their Coloured areas which would no longer be used in view of the fact that the Minister was going to remove those people. I think the hon. the Minister should avail himself of this opportunity to supply this information to us.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to the request of the hon. member for Simonstown, I want to say that local authorities or private bodies and persons who suffer losses as a result of the removal of group areas, may make representations to us. The Department will either meet these representations or if it does not see its way clear to do so, these bodies and persons still have the opportunity of taking the matter to court. In court they may testify that they suffered losses because of the deproclamation by the Department and the court can decide the matter. As far as private bodies and persons are concerned, we cannot go any further than this. If they can prove to us that we have caused them to suffer losses, we shall adopt a reasonable attitude. If, however, we were unable to do anything and they were of the opinion that we were unreasonable, they could take the matter to court.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Newton Park that this clause not only makes provision for the removal of Coloureds to the east of the Fish River/Kat River/Aliwal North line, but also flows from the Government&#x2019;s policy in the Transvaal and other places to concentrate the Coloureds in certain areas. Now hon. members maintain that we will be held responsible for millions and millions of rand, but it is not as bad as that. The following claims have been put in up to now&#x2014;Bethal, R2,459; Dordrecht, R2,852; and Wepener approximately, this is not the final amount, R10,000. At the moment we have the right to make <i>ex-gratia</i> payments of this nature up to an amount of R1,000. Most of these claims actually exceed R1,000, and what we are now asking for is that we do not have to come to Parliament as a matter of necessity for each claim to be sanctioned. We want to pay these claims as the people need the money, and within 14 days after payment has been made by us, we shall table a statement of such payments, or if Parliament is not in session, within 14 days after the commencement of its next ensuing session. Consequently there is no question of any new principle being involved in this matter. We only want to be allowed to make payments exceeding R1,000.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I do not really know; the law advisers are not so sure about this point.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point raised the question of deproclamation. He said we might be confronted with large accounts, and said we tried to lay the blame at the door of local authorities whereas it actually ought to be laid at the door of the Department of Planning. We are not laying any blame at the door of local authorities. Let me tell the hon. member this. Many of these deproclamations take place at the request of local authorities. We have just had a case like this in Ladysmith, Natal. The local authority wanted changes to be made to certain proclamations which had been made by the Minister of Planning in respect of an Indian group area. The Minister of Planning and I undertook a personal visit of observation to that area. The Secretary for Planning undertook a similar visit to that area. The deproclamaiion was not initiated by us; we did not say that that area should be deproclaimed; we were quite satisfied. The local authority of Ladysmith approached us with the request that the Indian group area on this side of the river had to be deproclaimed and transferred to the opposite side of the river. This was done at the request of the local authority. I am not laying the blame at the door of the local authorities. This question of proclaiming group areas is something new. One does make many mistakes. Let me tell the hon. member this. I agree with him when he says that it is a very serious matter to deproclaim a proclaimed area. If one were to continue proclaiming and subsequently deproclaiming areas, one would be creating a condition of uncertainty and people would not know whether or not to develop such areas. This, however, is not something which is on the increase, it is on the decrease. I am really out of order now, Mr. Chairman, because I am discussing a matter which falls exclusively under the Minister of Planning. But as these two matters are so interrelated&#x2014;since we have to go ahead with planning as soon as the area has been proclaimed, we are, of course, intimately concerned in the matter. I want to give the hon. member for Green Point this assurance. We have had quite a number of cases in the Cape Province, Natal, the Transvaal and even in the Orange Free State where we proclaimed areas and subsequently saw that a mistake had been made. At the request of the local authorities we subsequently deproclaimed such areas. This is something which is occurring less and less frequently. I agree with him that to deproclaim an area is a serious matter. One is handicapping development, etc. This, however, is a phenomenon which is occurring less and less frequently.</p>

<p>This clause in point of fact seeks to achieve one object only, i.e. to remove the restriction on our right to make <i>ex-gratia</i> payments exceeding R1,000 so as to allow us to pay out larger amounts when we are requested to do so and after there has been consultation, etc. <span class="col_4289-4290" refersTo="page_0632"/>We subsequently have to report to Parliament on the <i>ex-gratia</i> payments made.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the position is simply this. We have nothing to do with the proclamation of group areas. That is done by the Group Areas Board which falls under the Minister of Planning. We only come into the picture after proclamation and then we have to develop the area. Normally we develop it through the local authority concerned. Let us assume a Coloured group area had been proclaimed under a certain local authority and then the local authority starts developing the area. After some time the Minister of Planning in his wisdom says the area must be deproclaimed. As I said, it is unfortunate but that does happen at times, although it is occurring less and less frequently. After discussions with me and all the interested bodies the Minister of Planning decides it must be deproclaimed, as has been decided in respect of that area I referred to in Ladysmith, Natal. Then the local authority comes to us and says, &#x201C;You have proclaimed this area a Coloured area and you have requested us to start developing that area. We did that and we have spent so much money on it.&#x201D; They can show me so many rands have been spent, to the last cent. They know exactly how much they spent. We must then pay back that money. That is all I envisage.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. There is no need for them to spend money before proclamation. It is their affair if they spend money before proclamation, I have nothing to do with that. I only come into the picture after proclamation. I do not care what they do before proclamation. That is the local authority&#x2019;s decision. The <span class="col_4291-4292" refersTo="page_0633"/>Department of Community Development only comes into the picture after proclamation. We then start to develop. We either develop the area ourselves or we ask the local authority to develop. Where we have asked a local authority to develop the area and it has spent a certain sum of money, and the Minister of Planning then comes along, after consultation with all the persons concerned, and deproclaims, the local authority says, &#x201C;You said we must develop, we have spent Rx; you must please pay us that money.&#x201D; Up to now we had power only to pay up to R1,000 and we now ask for authority to pay the entire amount claimed by the local authority. I cannot see anything that is not clear in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has told us his department only has to pay compensation money spent after proclamation if there is a subsequent deproclamation. He has not dealt with the question posed by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District), and it is a very real problem, one which many local authorities have experienced. They wish to proceed with housing schemes for a local community. There may be, for an example, an investigation under the Group Areas Act which takes a number of years. In the meantime, with the Government&#x2019;s authority, they erect buildings and flats for the use of the local community and spend money doing so. Then a group area for another group is proclaimed. Is that local authority not entitled to any compensation &#x2026; &#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>When this clause was discussed during the Second Reading debate, the point was made by the hon. the Minister, and first of all by the hon. member for Parow, that the powers asked for in this Bill were equal to and could be equated with the powers contained in Act 25 of 1945 in regard to the establishment of Native residential areas within municipalities.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Only clause 2.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, only clause 2. The hon. member was quite correct when he came to the proposed new paragraphs (aa), (bb) and (cc). But what precedes that right to recover is vastly different, and I think for the hon. member to suggest there is a precedent for this provision contained in this clause, as he did in this House by way of argument which the hon. the Minister grabbed as an argument to say we on this side were opposing a policy which had been adopted by this side in the past regarding powers which were given to the Minister over local authorities, is rather far-fetched. There are vast differences regarding the circumstances under which the proposed new powers can be exercised.</p>

<p>The powers that are provided for in this clause can be exercised in terms of the clause itself by overriding every authority and every law in incurring that liability. The points at issue are these. When the 1945 Act gave the Minister that power there was to be. first of all, a public inquiry authorized through the Administrator to investigate whether there was a need for action to be taken by the local authority. Notice was then given to the local authority of the Minister&#x2019;s decision about what it was required to do. That was given by the Administrator. Then it was only after default on the part of the local authority, after these levels of government had been recognized, that the hon. Minister could step in. To give the hon. member for Parow the opportunity of including in this legislation that which he wants, and in accordance with the attitude of this party in 1945, I propose moving that the prerequisites before these liabilities can be placed upon the municipality, the amounts recovered by way of action in a court or by declaring revenue to be payable to an appointed receiver or by levying a special rate, shall only be exercised if the municipality is in default and is given notice through the Administrator. In the circumstances, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;subsection&#x201D; in line 35, up to and including &#x201C;charged&#x201D; in line 39, and to substitute the following paragraphs:</block>

<block name="quote">2. (A) Whenever it appears to the Minister, after reference to the Administrator, and after a local inquiry held in public by an officer appointed by the Minister for that purpose, at which the local authority and other interested parties shall be entitled to be heard, that the provision made for the development of any defined area within the <span class="col_4293-4294" refersTo="page_0634"/>area of a local authority for the needs of persons ordinarily within that local authority area for normal requirements is inadequate or unsuitable, the Minister may, by written notice given through the Administrator require that local authority, within such time as may be stated in the notice, to so develop such defined area.</block>

<block name="quote">(B) Upon the failure of the local authority within the time fixed in any such notice or within any extension of that time granted by the Minister after reference to the Administrator, to comply with any requirement of such notice, the Minister may, after reference to the Administrator, and after written notice to the local authority authorize the board in relation to the exercise of a power or the performance of a function or duty with which it is vested in terms of any such proclamation.</block>

<p>The Minister earlier on gave us an indication that his attitude to this amendment will probably be that it is out of order in that it goes outside the scope of the principle of this Bill. May I deal with that for a moment in anticipation. Section 17 (1) of the principal Act at present gives the board power within a defined area. That is clear&#x2014;it can function and operate within a defined area but not outside. My amendment is intended to cover those powers so as they enable the board to function outside a defined area. It is for that reason that I consider these further safeguards to be necessary. Section 17 (1) gives the board the power &#x201C;within the defined area in question as if it were such a local authority, except in so far as the proclamation of this section otherwise provides&#x201D;.</p>

<p>That is correct. But that provision is now to be washed out. Now the Minister wants to provide that his board shall have authority within the defined area and that it may erect works outside the defined area. He need not, therefore, call upon the local authority to do that, but may do so itself. The board may set up quarries, a power station or sewerage disposal works&#x2014;outside the defined area.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am not for a moment pleading that the Minister should be totally without any remedy. The meaning of my amendment is that before the Minister enters upon the incurring of any liabilities in the name of the municipality concerned, these procedures, procedures which have been accepted by the House and are still the law, should also be observed in this connection. I know the Minister, when he gets a little bit frustrated, takes up an attitude of &#x201C;if they will not listen to me I will show them&#x201D;. However, I do not think that is necessary. He has seen the statement issued by the member of the Executive Committee that it is quite possible to achieve this objective in terms of the present law. It is for these reasons that I have moved my amendment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to make a fuss about this. The position is, however, that the present Act lays down, in section 17, a certain procedure I have to follow. As I interpret the amendment of the hon. member, it seems to me that it does not seek to amend section 17 but to substitute a completely new section for section 17. If this is so, his amendment is out of order as it goes beyond the scope of the Bill as read a Second Time. This Bill does not substitute a new section for section 17; it merely amends section 17. The amendment of the hon. member on the other hand substitutes a completely new section for section 17. This is how I see it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Section 17 (1) is not at all affected by this amendment. The amendment merely substitutes other words for certain words in subsection (2). The rest of the subsection, as well as subsection (1), is not affected. Consequently it is difficult to say that the amendment is out of order.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00e9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Apparently I have to do the Opposition&#x2019;s work for them. Not only do I have to give the hon. member for Durban (Point) a speech, but I also have to give the hon. member for Green Point an amendment! The argument we advance in this respect is that section 17 (1) lays down the procedure the Minister has to follow when he wants to issue a proclamation. For example, he has to consult the local authority and he has to refer the matter to the administrator as well. In addition to this, after he has acted as prescribed in section 17 (1), i.e. after he has first consulted the local authority and has referred the matter to the Administrator, the hon. member for Green Point now wants him to follow another procedure which the hon. <span class="col_4295-4296" refersTo="page_0635"/>member for Green Point wants to write into an additional clause. Sir, the hon. member referred to what I had said in the Second Reading debate. We on this side are adamant that this clause which we are amending contains a principle which has already been accepted, and we say that this clause merely defines what procedure the Minister has to follow. In this connection we are taking powers similar to those contained in subsection (4) of the 1945 Act of the United Party. Sir, the Minister never comes down out of the blue on any municipality in connection with a matter like this. The Minister has to comply with certain provisions laid down in subsection (1). There must be consultation&#x2014;and there is consultation&#x2014;and there must be a reference to the Administrator. Does the hon. member now want, in spite of all these things, that there should be certain additional procedures which have to be followed, as he now suggests in his amendment&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00e9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>This is where we differ. As regards the powers which may be exercised within such an area, we want to make use of powers similar to those the United Party had in terms of the 1945 Act, but we do not want to do what the United Party now wants to do. Sir, it is an accepted fact that the United Party always made a mess of everything before it eventually did the right thing, and in this case they now want us to do the same thing. Do you know, Sir, what they are asking for&#x003F; They want a public inquiry. Before anything happens they want a public inquiry to be held and they want the dirty linen of the different municipalities to be washed in public. I want to ask the hon. member who had such a great deal to say about the costs which had to be recovered from the municipalities, who will have to bear the costs of these public inquiries they want&#x003F; Sir, we only want to take what is good from the 1945 Act, and not, as the United Party wants to do, do the wrong things.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member this question: At what stage should the Minister hold an inquiry such as he proposes in his amendment&#x003F; As I have said, the Minister has to do certain things before he may issue proclamations, and he does in fact do these things. Here it is a question of consultation and negotiation, and usually the Department has endless patience and conducts proper negotiations as happened in the case of Stellenbosch in connection with Cloetesdal and as recently happened in the case of Cape Town in connection with Rylands. There are endless negotiations before the Minister takes such a step. But in addition to this, the hon. member now wants a public inquiry to be held. At what stage should the public inquiry be held and who should pay for such a public inquiry&#x003F; Sir, what will happen at such a public inquiry&#x003F; Suppose negotiations have been conducted with a local authority for months and years &#x2014;as happened in the case of Cape Town in connection with Rylands&#x2014;and the local authority refuses to take the necessary steps. Should a public inquiry then be held and should all these matters which formed the subject of negotiations be washed in public before the Minister may issue a proclamation&#x003F; Sir, the proposal of the hon. member is most unpractical, and I just want to tell him once again what I said a short while ago: As a rule the United Party first made a mess of matters before arriving at the right solution. We are not prepared to accept part of the provisions of section 3 of the old Act, because that would cause so much friction between these levels of government that one would never obtain the co-operation of the local authorities and the administrations.</p>

<p>The hon. member also advanced the argument that the hon. the Minister might go outside such a defined area to provide certain services. But surely this is obvious. If a new area has to be developed for the Coloureds or any other race group, certain services have to be taken to that area, services such as water, power and sewerage, which probably will have to come from outside as that area is an undeveloped one. Those services do not exist in that area and they have to be provided. If the mother municipality that has to provide services such as water, power and sewerage, in the adjacent area refuses to provide those services when the Minister asks it to do so, the Minister finds himself in a hopeless, helpless position. If the Minister does not take these powers, it will mean that the Minister himself will have to have these services such as power, water and sewerage, provided by the Development Board and the Development Board will not be able to pay for those services; it derives no benefit from those services. In the end the mother municipality is in any case going to get this newly developed area with all those services.</p>

<p>If the Development Board has to lay on these services from scratch, it will be vastly more expensive and eventually this will place a heavier burden on the shoulders of the mother municipality. Apart from the helpless position in which the hon. member wants to place the Minister and the Development Board, his proposal is completely unpractical and will entail infinitely more expenditure which will eventually have to be shouldered by the local authority. The whole object of the amendment of the hon. member is to land the Minister in a powerless and frustrating position so that the hon. member may eventually make more political capital out of it, and consequently we shall not be prepared to accept such an amendment.</p>

To suggest therefore that the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Green Point is going to tie the hands of the Minister, is going to make the Minister powerless to act and is going to waste money, is a reflection on his own Government, but it is also utter nonsense because that is the procedure that is being followed to-day by the Minister of Bantu Administration.</p>

<p>We want something more effective than the mere writing of a letter.

<p>I am very sorry that the hon. member for Green Point has allowed himself to be misled by the provisions of section 3 of Act No. 25 of 1945. The hon. member who has just sat down, said the procedure embodied in that section, was simply being taken over <i>verbatim</i> in the amendment of the hon. member for Green Point, but this is not completely true. There is a considerable difference, but I do not think the Chairman will allow me to point this out now. The old Act refers to persons in employment and the amendment refers to people within an area. But the 1945 Act does not give the full picture. This principle contained in the Act of 1945, and which has now been embodied in part in the amendment of the hon. member for Green Point, dates back to the year 1923. Do you know, Sir, when this procedure was created&#x003F; It was created at the time of the first Union legislation on Native housing in South Africa.</p>

<p>Do you know, Sir, what happened on that occasion&#x003F; At that time hon. Senators debated for many days on the desirability of housing for non-Whites. They asked whether that was the right thing and at that time it came to light for the first time that between 5,000 and 6,000 Bantu were living in the white areas in Cape Town. The then Minister of Native Affairs said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the local authorities do not discharge their duties properly in this respect, then in the last resort the Government may step in and on its behalf and at its expense make the necessary provision.</block>

<p>The hon. members may make their speeches in a short while. I am pleased that the Minister is rejecting this amendment. From a historic point of view I think these hon. members are basing their facts on wrong circumstances. But from a practical point of view, would we ever have been able to show the people of Sophiatown a better world if we would have had to have a public inquiry, a <i>quasi</i>-judicial institution, and would have had to say, &#x201C;Come, all you agitators, and submit your evidence; do you want to perish in the miserable conditions in which you are living or should new civilized structures be erected for you&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then there is a second matter. This procedure is as it has been standing on the Statute Book since 1923, and I now ask those hon. members to mention me a single opportunity on which this procedure has been employed. This is the important reason why it is still standing on the Statute Book, because it is unnecessary to repeal this procedure. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>Yesterday when the hon. the Minister was replying to the debate it was emite remarkable that he never made any attempt to reply to the points I raised, but I leave that there. But when he was questioned about this matter of consultation with the Administrator, the Minister by way of interjection waved his hand and said: &#x201C;I sent him a notice&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<p>What is the difference between a notice and a letter&#x003F; We do not call that consultation in the proper sense of the word. But what I do not understand at all is this. The Minister has a perfect example of how his own Government can function in co-operation with the Administrator over difficult problems of this kind. The hon. member for Green Point has referred to this briefly and I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the details of this particular case again. When I was a member of the Cape Provincial Council, the Administrator appointed a commission under a gentleman by the name of Rossouw, who is one of the Nationalist Senators to-day, to investigate the allocation of beaches in the Western Cape. This commission was appointed by the Administrator, who is an appointee of the Nationalist Government. That commission took the trouble to travel all over the Western Cape measuring out beaches and working for days on end to come to their conclusions and a fair division. Then what happened&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>It is relevant to show the way the consultation was carried out. Then a deputation of Government supporters from Mossel Bay came to see the Administrator and said that they objected to the way the beaches were being allocated. They were ratepayers and Government ratepayers, so attention was presumably paid to what they said. However, the Administrator was not prepared to alter the recommendations of the Rossouw Commission, the deputation from Mossel Bay notwithstanding, but they did have a hearing. Then while he was in the process of deciding how he was to carry this out, the hon. member for Klip River was appointed to head a Government Commission right over the head of the Cape Administrator, and he went into the subject at great length again.</p>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>But what has that to do with this Bill&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I want to show what the consequences of this action were. The Government had a draft Bill before this House to amend the Separate Amenities Act but the Minister, as the result of representations that were made to him from the province, did not go forward with that Bill, and to this day he has not done so. The Minister then decided that the wiser course to adopt was to continue consulting with the Cape Administrator, and now the irony of it is that the Cape provincial authorities, with all the necessary powers they already have in their ordinances and have in this case in regard to the clearing up of townships, as the result of pressure from the Administrator, got round the table with the local authority and thrashed the matter out. As a result the provincial authorities ultimately took the matter out of the hands of the local authority, put up the boards on the different beaches and charged the City Council for doing so. The Government has not been involved and that draft Bill has never been seen again in this House. It is precisely our contention here that there is nothing to prevent the Minister having similar consultations with the province in regard to this question of either clearing up slums or any other aspect of housing over which he has difficulties with the local authority. I think the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point is an extremely reasonable one and I would like the Minister to tell us why he cannot act in the same way and on the same basis of consultation as the other Minister did.</p>

<p>In all fairness to the United Party I have been trying all morning long to understand their argument, but the powers they want to be taken through this amendment moved by them, are powers which do appear in section 17 (1).

This is something completely different to what was laid down in the 1945 Act. That concerned housing for Bantu.

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg referred to the Commission headed by the hon. member for Klip River and pointed out that it is better to let those people with local knowledge handle matters of this nature. And I find support for that argument from the hon. the Minister in his reply to the debate on clause 1. He said that at the moment an area in Ladysmith is being reproclaimed at the request of the local authority. This has been the crux of our arguments, namely that the local authority knows best. The local people know the local conditions and they should be left to do it. They should not be forced to comply with a policy of a political party. Then the hon. the Minister told us that he did consult and that he always will consult.

<p>I am going to fetch that water. The clause provides that the State President may lay down any conditions for the development of such an area. The State President may, for example, lay down that I may force local authorities to provide services. If the local authority does not want to provide the services, as, for example, supplying water, even if its reservoir is situated outside the defined area, it nevertheless has to supply the water. If the local authority does not want to supply the water, I can see to it that it will be done. I really think hon. members opposite do not have a point. They say they are in favour of separate residential areas, and group areas, but they do not want to apply the principle in practice. We, however, are going to apply it in practice, and in this connection I do not want to say anything more.</p>

<summary>(Instruction)</summary>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I might briefly mention that the Bill before the House imposes certain additional obligations on tenants in that they will now be required to pay deposits up to one month&#x2019;s rent to provide cover for damage which may be caused to the premises. It seems appropriate that the Committee might consider whether the rights of statutory tenants might not be reviewed, and hence I move the following instruction which appears on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Committee of the Whole House on the Rents Amendment Bill have leave to consider the advisability of making provision therein for statutory tenants to have the right to sublet the premises occupied by them.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. member for Green Point not to insist on the acceptance of this instruction. I want to tell him that I am quite sympathetically disposed towards this matter. As his amendment reads at present, however, it contains certain implications which may place the lessor in a very difficult position. We have to see to it that protection is given not only to the lessee, but also to the lessor. This amendment does not contain the necessary protection for the lessor. I am having the matter investigated at present and I give the hon. member the assurance that if we can find a solution&#x2014;and I think we shall find one&#x2014;I shall rectify the matter in the Other Place. If it takes a little longer for us to reach a decision, I shall ask the Minister of Justice to make provision for it in the General Law Amendment Bill. In principle I am in full agreement with the hon. member. It is merely a question of devising a formula which will do justice to both the lessee and the lessor. I hope the hon. member will accept my assurance in this connection and not insist upon this instruction.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate I drew the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that in certain premises on the Rand gas or fuel is, like electricity, supplied through meters. In this clause the Minister is making provision as far as electricity is concerned. In order to cover gas as well, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 27, after &#x201C;current&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;gas or fuel&#x201D;.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have made inquiries, but we were unable to find any cases where gas is provided in the same manner. However, I take it there may be cases such as these, and I therefore have no objection to this amendment being accepted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, paragraph (d) refers to the definition of &#x201C;value&#x201D;. In terms of the proposed new definition, when in future a rent board determines the reasonable rent value of premises &#x201C;any one or more or all of the following&#x201D; factors may be taken into account. We are aware that there were discussions by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor regarding some sort of preference which should be given to sworn valuations or building society valuations which were likely to be more accurate than the other factors listed which must be taken into account.</p>

<p>The point I wish to make is this. If this provision becomes law it would be possible for a rent board hostile to the lessor to take into account for instance only item (b), namely &#x201C;any municipal or divisional council valuation of such premises or land&#x201D;. It would technically be permissive in terms of the amendment contained in this clause. Previously a rent board had to consider all the factors and establish a value on balance.</p>

<p>The object of this was to enable a realistic valuation to be made for instance by preventing valuations from taking preference over other factors, but equally it forbids the opposite being done. It forbids a completely unrealistic value being established. Let us take a building built 20 or 40 years ago at R40,000. It might be worth R&#x00BC; million to-day. The actual cost of erection could have been R20,000 or R40,000. In terms of the proposed amendment a rent board would be entitled to say, &#x201C;We establish the value of this building at R40,000 because that was the actual cost&#x201D;, despite the fact that to-day the building in question is worth R&#x00BC; million or even R&#x00BD; million. I want to ask the Minister whether he has any intention administratively of ensuring that such an eventuality cannot occur. A rent board may be having a fight with a particular landlord and it might say, &#x201C;Right, we are going to revalue, and use only one of the factors for this purpose to the exclusion of the others in order to create an artificial value&#x201D;. On the other hand, tenants may be creating some difficulty and the rent board decides, &#x201C;Right, we will fix those tenants&#x201D;, and uses one of these factors to create an artificially <span class="col_4313-4314" refersTo="page_0644"/>high valuation. There is yet another aspect. It is possible&#x2014;I do not say it will happen&#x2014;that influence could be brought to bear in an endeavour to ensure a higher valuation for a building and hence a higher rental. What steps can the hon. the Minister take to ensure that by allowing any one or more of these factors to be used as a basis for valuation no injustice shall be done, either to an owner or a tenant&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think there is much merit in the contention of the hon. member. First of all, I cannot accept when he talks about &#x201C;a hostile rent board&#x201D;. After all, these rent boards are in the nature of a court of law. We go out of our way to obtain the services of either a retired magistrate or of another retired legal man with at least ten years experience to act as chairman. The other members are appointed after due consultation. May I add here that I have had representations from chambers of commerce and sakekamers that businessmen should also be on these boards. I have asked them to submit to me a panel of five names out of which I will then choose one. These rent boards are full-time bodies. The salary being paid to its members is not too large. The result is that it is difficult to get anybody else than a retired person to serve on these boards. In any event, should a rent board be hostile, as the hon. member puts it, there is a remedy available to the owner. He can appeal to the Rent Control Board, which is a body of high standing. As a matter of fact, I would say that this body has about the same status as one of our superior courts. So, when a person considers that he has been done an injustice he can appeal to the Rent Control Board, whose decision will then be final. I do not think we should limit the Rent Control Board by prescribing too tightly what it should take into consideration and what not. I am satisfied that the present machinery protects the landlord as much as it protects the tenant.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Let me eliminate any misunderstanding which could arise by my using the expression &#x201C;a hostile board&#x201D;. By that I do not mean that a board may be prejudiced, but merely that there may be an argument, as there often is, which may create an attitude of, shall we say, conflict between the owner and the board. Where there is a dispute such dispute may often lead to harsh words. In any event, I did not mean that the board will be unfair or prejudiced. I do not want to have any misunderstanding about this.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I must say that I am very unhappy about this proposed amendment. It entitles owners of unfurnished flats, who previously could only ask for deposits in respect of gas, light, water or sewerage, now to demand deposits in respect of damage as well. But let me make sure first that I am correct in my interpretation of this, so that I shall not waste the time of the House. The position as I see it, is that under the present law the owner of an unfurnished dwelling is entitled to demand a deposit not exceeding one month&#x2019;s rent for gas, water, sewerage and other services. In terms of this amendment, however, he can now demand a deposit in respect of damages as well. Is that the position&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>As far as furnished flats are concerned&#x2014;I am coming to unfurnished flats in a moment&#x2014;I want to tell the hon. member why this provision is being made. As far as furnished flats are concerned, the owner could up to now demand any deposit. This legislation provides that he may now demand a deposit equal to one month&#x2019;s rent only. This places furnished flats on exactly the same basis as unfurnished flats. In the past the owner of an unfurnished flat could only demand a deposit in respect of electricity, water and so on. Now damages are being added. Tenants can, of course, damage the flat itself. I should like to hear what the hon. member&#x2019;s objections are to this. As far as I am concerned, I cannot see grounds for any objection.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry but what the hon. Minister has just said confirms my fears. The position in future will be that throughout the length and breadth of South Africa, in every city, the owner of an unfurnished flat may demand a deposit equivalent to one month&#x2019;s rent. Up to the present the owner of unfurnished flats could demand such a deposit only in respect of lights, water and gas. In cases where the tenants paid the electricity themselves and water is free no deposit could be demanded. In other words, the owner could only demand a deposit for expenses he had to meet. In future, however, he will be entitled to demand a deposit in respect of any damage to his flats. This means that people who in the past paid no deposit, because they paid there own electricity and water was free, now have to meet a deposit in respect of damages.</p>

<p>Let us look at the result of this from both sides, i.e. from the side of the tenant and from the side of the landlord. Let us, for argument&#x2019;s sake, take a block of 200 flats with an average rental of R100 per month per flat. This means that the landlord can demand R20,000 as deposit. On this he is going to pay the tenants 2&#x00BD; per cent, or whatever the interest is on Post Office savings. He, on the other hand, invests that sum at 8 or per cent, <span class="col_4315-4316" refersTo="page_0645"/>which means that he will be making about 7 per cent profit. Over that there is no control. So, he sits with this R20,000 which the tenants had to deposit against the possibility that some tenant may break a wash basin, a toilet, a window or a door. This deposit will run into many millions of rand if taken throughout the country. This goes into the pockets of the landlords and he is making a profit on it.</p>

<p>But let us, on the other hand, look at the position of the tenant. It is the position of the tenant that concerns me really, and I wonder whether we should not have another look at this. The tenant may be a low-salaried worker. Let us take for example a widow bringing up children and earning R100 per month, that is to say if she is lucky, because she may only be earning R80. She is paying R30 or R40 per month rent, and having to feed and clothe children on the remaining R30 or R40. Suddenly she is asked to pay not R40 but R80 rent. Assume it is somebody who has an income of R80. She has to pay half of her income in rent, which many do. If she has to pay double that amount in one month, she will have nothing to live on for a whole month. Even if she earns R100, and has to pay R40 rent plus R40 deposit, she will have R20 on which to live, feed and clothe herself and her children.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but with an income of R100 she should not be paying more than R25.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>They have no option; they have no choice. This is a lovely theory that you should not pay more than one-fifth of your income in rent. However, in practice, what does a person do when he cannot find a flat&#x003F; These people have to live somewhere, they have to have a roof over their heads. I know of people who are paying between 30 and 45 per cent of their income in rent. They come to see us as M.P.&#x2019;s and to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s department. They ask us whether we cannot find them a cheaper flat. Where will one find a modern flat to-day with two bedrooms which one can rent under R60 or R65 per month&#x003F; What is the rent of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own flats&#x003F; In Durban they vary from R84 for the bigger flats down to R45 for bachelor flats. One has to pay R65 for the smallest flat that a family can occupy. These are the flats of the Department of Community Development. What does a man earning, say R150 or R120 per month do&#x003F; He has to have somewhere to live and pays the R60 and has to live on the other R60. If people are to pay a month&#x2019;s deposit, it will put thousands and thousands of them into an impossible position. I would like to plead that we have another look at this. I accept that the owner must be given some protection, but I do not believe that he needs to be protected to the extent of a complete month&#x2019;s rent for the possible damage. What can be damaged in a flat&#x003F; The bath, the basin, the toilet, the paintwork and windows. The repair of windows is in any case usually the responsibility of the tenant, but one can include that in the list too. In any block of flats, think of the amount of money which that landlord will hold against the possibility of a maximum of a few hundred rands worth of damage.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, the flats in Durban have no fridges and stoves. They are unfurnished. In the Transvaal the fridges and stoves are included. Then the picture is different, but then it starts to be a furnished flat. In the case of a furnished flat, the landlord was allowed in the past to demand a deposit. If stoves and refrigerators are included, it will be a furnished flat, because those are items of furniture. It is no longer an unfurnished flat. As soon as there is furniture in the flat, surely the landlords can demand protection. I accept that there must be some protection, but I am worried that this can put people in an impossible position. If nothing else, there must be a limit and a progressive payment of the deposit by people already in a flat, so that the man who has been in a flat for 30 years, will not suddenly be asked to pay double rent. I should like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view before going further.</p>

I visited Springs recently and the interest and redemption on a three-bedroomed house there amounts to as little as R34. Nevertheless. I think the hon. member for Durban (Point) has a point. He has brought something to my notice which I shall investigate. I can quite appreciate that what he suggested may happen. He only has to accept that I shall discuss this matter with my officials. I shall also be very glad if he will discuss this matter with me after I have discussed it with my officials. Then we can see whether we cannot rectify this matter in the Other Place. I am quite willing to do so.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading the hon. member for Parktown suggested that those deposits be invested with a building society. To my mind this is an excellent suggestion, and I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4317-4318" refersTo="page_0646"/>In line 54, after &#x201C;deposit&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;which shall be invested with a building society in such manner as the lessor may think fit (proof of which investment shall on demand be furnished to an inspector)&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I hope this will produce the large amount of money the hon. member for Parktown anticipates. Although we say that deposits may be levied, there are, of course, many people who do not require a deposit. On the other hand, notwithstanding the fact that certain people are not entitled to require deposits, they nevertheless do so. However. I am quite prepared to incorporate this provision in the legislation, because it may be very useful to building societies if large amounts of money are received.</p>

I would certainly like to discuss the matter with the hon. the Minister and I hope we can find a solution. The amendment which the hon. the Minister has moved creates an anomaly.

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Minister said that he will go into the aspect of the deposits. I just want to draw his attention to another matter which I think also needs attention and that is the words in subsection (2), in lines 46 and 47. The words which are being used are &#x201C;in respect of any damage to such dwelling&#x201D;. It seems to me that the words &#x201C;or furniture or fittings or contents&#x201D; should be inserted after &#x201C;dwelling&#x201D; in order to cover the landlord&#x2019;s right to recoup damages to electrical equipment or something of that nature. I think the hon. the Minister could go into that matter as well when he deals with the other matter.</p>

<p>In regard to the deposits at the building societies, I should like to add a word. The position irrespective of the amendment which the Minister has moved, will be that the landlord will receive income from the interest on the deposit. He will then be taxable on that income, but he will be able to deduct from his income the amount of the interest which he has to pay back to the tenant when he pays back the deposit. In other words, the landlord will be taxed merely on the difference between the Post Office interest and the interest he receives on the money. I think the hon. the Minister should look further into the matter in order to ensure that the landlord cannot profit by holding a deposit. In other words, the deposit is merely for security and should not enable him to make profit out of it. If that <span class="col_4319-4320" refersTo="page_0647"/>is done, I think the danger of this provision being applied generally by landlords will fall away. Where a tenant has been in residence for a long time, the landlord will not bother to ask him for a deposit, if he cannot make any money out of the deposit. If the hon. the Minister goes into this matter further, it is important that he should see that the tenant gets back the interest which is earned on the deposit, so that there will be no profit in the deposit for the landlord.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I support what has been said by the hon. member for Green Point because once the landlord can make a profit on it, you have to consider the position of an agent who is acting as trustee for an absent landlord. He would be guilty of negligence if he did not demand a deposit in every case. The owner of the building would be entitled to say, &#x201C;Why did you not ask for a deposit and deposit the money at such and such a rate of interest and make a profit on my money&#x003F;&#x201D; He should not be put in that position. It could be regarded as a dereliction of duty. Therefore I think it is absolutely essential that there should be no profit made on any deposits taken. I realize that this matter will receive the Minister&#x2019;s further consideration and I appreciate that he is sympathetic towards this matter, but I think it is only right to point out that there are many cases of absentee landlords or oversea organizations which have money invested in this country and have asked their representatives here to invest their money in property. I know of cases like that in the city from which I come. I would therefore ask the hon. the Minister to consider the proposition that there should be no profit on these deposits and that the deposits should be regarded as trust funds.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member. I am quite sure that we will find a formula which is acceptable to all of us in this connection. As far as the inclusion of furniture is concerned, I will go into the matter, but there is only one danger and that is that ordinary depreciation of furniture will be looked upon as damage. I think we must protect the tenant in this regard. I have a fair amount of knowledge of subletting. You sublet your house and when you return after six months you think that your furniture has been neglected but in fact there has been nothing more than ordinary wear and tear on the furniture. However, I will look into that matter as well.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this is an important clause. It endeavours to obviate what has been happening throughout South Africa with regard to accommodation, and that is that invariably people with children who apply for accommodation find that they cannot get it. The amendment in this clause quite rightly aims at preventing persons who advertise accommodation for letting from saying in the advertisement that preference will be given to people without children or to people with children in a certain age category. There are certain landlords who invariably seem to be able to find ways and means of circumventing certain provisions of the Rents Act, and I would like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that this clause will prevent such landlords from circumventing the provisions of the Act&#x003F; What often happens is that where a person applies for accommodation, the agent or the landlord requires him to sign a lease in terms of which the occupancy of the flat or dwelling is restricted to certain adult persons. They indicate that where two persons occupy a flat, they shall be adults, and they also incorporate in such a lease that should a third person occupy the flat the lease will then become null and void and they can then invoke other sections of the lease to evict the persons concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>But then they break the law. The law says they cannot do it. If they cannot advertise it, they can obviously not put it in the contract.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that they do not specify that it is a child who is involved: it merely specifies a third person living in the flat, and thereby they manage to get around the position as regards a child. As it is here, it mentions that preference will be given to people without children, or children within a certain age category. My difficulty is that this has actually happened to me personally in Cape Town, where a person was able to invoke a clause in the lease and a child was the cause of the lease being cancelled. My difficulty is that although children are mentioned in the clause, there is a possibility of certain landlords obviating the provisions of this Bill, which are very good provisions, by merely saying that it is a third person, without indicating that that third person might be a child. I would be grateful if the Minister could give some indication that the amendment he proposes in this clause will meet that situation.</p>

<p>I have no objection to what was said by the hon. member for Umbilo. I just want to say that notwithstanding the provisions prohibiting the owners of dwellings and flats from discriminating against families with children, this is general practice to-day. We are all glad that the Minister is making a further attempt in this legislation to curtail those malpractices because all of us want parents to have children. But I want to say that this matter should be given a great deal more publicity, namely that people have the right to complain if they are refused as tenants. The people are not aware of this. Many <span class="col_4321-4322" refersTo="page_0648"/>people approach me and say that they cannot get a dwelling because they have children and because the owner does not want to let the dwelling to them. We have to tell our people publicly that they should lodge a complaint if a case of this nature arises so that steps can be taken against those lessors. I am sorry this legislation applies only to houses under rent control. It should be the general practice that nobody should have the right to refuse a prospective tenant by reason of the fact that he has children.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The case mentioned by the hon. member for Umbilo is, of course, a contravention of the law and he can. obtain redress by going either to the Rent Board or to the police. It is a contravention of the law. If the lessor wants to include this condition in the contract of lease and impose it on the hon. member for Umbilo, the hon. member may go to the police, because it is a contravention of the law. I do not know whether there is any other way of preventing this. I think this is the only possible way in which to do so.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Umbilo what I have done in an attempt to prevent these practices. In terms of the law as it reads at present one is not allowed, in the case of buildings under rent control, to refuse a person because he has children. This provision only deals with cases where an attempt is made to circumvent this by advertising in the Press. All we are doing here, is to lay down that it is a contravention of the law to place an advertisement in the Press indicating that children are not allowed. I take it that both the person who places such an advertisement and the newspaper which publishes the advertisement, will be guilty of contravening the law. I may just add that I have already negotiated with the National Press Union to ask them to ask their newspapers to refuse such advertisements.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Umbilo raised and dealt with this question of children. But we are concerned about the question whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment goes far enough, so far as protection as regards children is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo also raised the question of where a person signed a lease for two adults to occupy a flat. Subsequently, when the wife has a child, the lease is terminated. So, the landlord uses that opportunity to cancel the lease on the grounds that the conditions of the lease have been broken. Therefore the tenant has to leave. While the Minister is protecting the tenants as far as the children and the parents are concerned, I wonder if it gives all the protection which the hon. member for Umbilo requires. If it does not give that protection, I think it is a matter to which the Minister should give further consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I explained this morning that all possible protection is given in terms of the present Act. As regards buildings under control, they may not exclude children. But this clause does not deal with children in those flats. It deals only with advertisements, or notifications to the public.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, exactly. They circumvent the law by saying &#x201C;preferably a business couple without children&#x201D;. Therefore they only want to allow two. That is circumventing the law.

That is only an additional safeguard.</p>

<p>Yes, but this now makes it an offence. In the past it was no offence to accept advertisements like that, but this makes it an offence to accept and place such an advertisement, trying to circumvent the law. I really cannot think of anything more I can do about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has indicated that this merely refers to the question of advertisements. But if we look at the clause, it does state &#x201C;by way of advertisement or otherwise&#x201D;. I presume that that section, read together with the new provision here, namely &#x201C;or that preference will be given to persons without children or to persons with children in certain age categories&#x201D;, does to a certain extent go beyond the question of merely the advertisements. It reads &#x201C;by advertisement or otherwise&#x201D;. Perhaps the hon. the Minister could give some indication as to what steps will be taken in cases such as those mentioned by the hon. member for Pinetown, whereby the person will accept tenants and will require from them to sign a lease, restricting the occupancy to two particular persons. When a child is born and introduced into that flat or dwelling, the definition of a child is circumvented by the landlord then stating that this is, in fact, a third person. Thereby the protection we have here in regard to the child is circumvented by the landlord and the agent. To illustrate this point, I should just like to refer to a typical type of letter received in a case such as this, where occupancy was granted to two adults, and then on the birth of a child a letter was received, saying:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4323-4324" refersTo="page_0649"/>According to your lease the flat at Holyrood was let to you and your wife only, and no other person may reside therein. If you take up residence at Holyrood and introduce any other person, we will take immediate steps to terminate your tenancy, in terms of clauses 26 and 28 thereof.</block>

<p>The question therefore is whether the protection the Minister aims to achieve in terms of this clause, will in fact be achieved to meet situations apart from the question of advertisement; because when one reads the clause as a whole, it states &#x201C;by way of advertisement or otherwise&#x201D;. I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister could give some assurance that this particular circumvention which is taking place, can be met in terms of this clause and the powers he asks for.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Umbilo is reading this clause <i>in vacuo.</i> He is reading this clause as separate from the original Act. I just want to read to him section 26 of the Rents Act (Act 43 of 1950)&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) No lessor who has in any manner whatever made known that he has a dwelling to let shall&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) refuse to let such dwelling to any other person merely on the ground that such other person intends to permit a child to reside therein;</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>That is very clear. Thus the lessor may not enter into such a contract. I would even go so far as to say that by signing that contract, even the lessee is committing an offence. But the lessor is definitely committing an offence by including in the provisions of his lease a stipulation that the lessee may occupy the flat, but if he brings in another person, a child, the contract lapses. I think that is completely illegal. I do not think the remedy lies with me. The remedy lies with the Police. It is quite clear that under the original Act of 1950 no landlord may prevent a person from living in a building under rent control if he has children.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Umbilo signed a contract like that and if he is held to that, it is an offence. Then he must go to the Police.</p>

I will see whether there is something in what the hon. member for Umbilo says; but as far as I can see, the law is very clear on this point. If there is any other loophole, I would be very pleased if the hon. member for Umbilo will come and discuss that with me. If there is a loophole, I will definitely plug it.

I raised a question yesterday as to what would happen if the Commission handed over the scheme to the Bantu Trust. I pointed out that it is not only taking over financial interest, like loans and that sort of thing; they can also take over the land.

Yesterday the present Minister of Community Development referred to Bills which are still to be introduced, namely the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill. That Bill provides for the taking over of these properties. But the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill has not been passed yet and we may not discuss it. But I want to know from the Minister of Community Development, who is handling this Bill, what restrictions there are in this Bill against the Bantu Trust taking over land involved in a housing scheme, and if the Bantu Trust does take it over, what powers the Bantu Trust will have in dealing with that land. I would be glad if the Minister answers this question before we get on with the discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member is discussing matters about which I do not know very much. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development referred to a separate Act dealing with this. All I have had to do with it, is that we lend the money to, say, the Municipality of Durban to establish a housing scheme at Kwa Mashu and other places. Kwa Mashu is now becoming part of the Bantu homeland, and all that we are saying in this legislation is that the Bantu Trust may now take over all the assets, liabilities, obligations, etc., of the local authority. Surely this is clear enough. What the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development is going to do, I do not know.</p>

<p>The hon. member does not know anything! I am really not going to get myself involved in a legal argument with the hon. member for Transkei. I simply refuse to do it. The matter is simple enough to me. The Durban City Council borrowed money from the Housing Commission for Bantu housing. They established a housing scheme in Kwa Mashu. Everything has not been paid off yet. In fact, it will probably take another 30 years before this happens. Now the Bantu Trust is taking over and it is becoming a part of the homeland. Sir, I am also a businessman, and to me it is really simple enough. I cannot think of any other argument. If the hon. member for Transkei would like to get involved in a legal argument, he should rather choose a lawyer like Mike Mitchell for that purpose and not me!</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one thing which I, and I think the whole House, appreciates is the honesty of the hon. the Minister. He has admitted he does not know much about this; indeed he knew nothing about it. I remember a previous dialogue I had with him concerning the interpretation of laws when he wanted a Bill passed here and he ended the discussion by saying he did not like taking part in a discussion which he was going to lose. That is all very funny and is a source of laughter especially for hon. members on that side of the House who do not know much about it either. But it does not help this House and this Committee. We have to pass his law and surely we are entitled to know what is involved. The Minister has been <span class="col_4327-4328" refersTo="page_0651"/>quite frank with us and he has told us that in terms of this clause the Bantu Trust can acquire the land. That is quite right. Then he said what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was going to do with the land he does not know.</p>

<p>The Minister says this legislation will entitle the Bantu Trust to take over this land, but he does not know what is going to happen to it after it is taken over. He has to rely on the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and he can do what he likes with it.</p>

<p>Normally we would oppose and vote against a clause of this nature because of uncertainty on the part of the Minister, but we will support the clause on this occasion because it is quite apparent to us that what this Government is going to do is this. It is accepting United Party policy. The Bantu Trust is going to acquire this land and next we will find the Trust selling land to the Bantu living in that area and then we will have home ownership which we on this side have pleaded for so long. This is the start and I would not be surprised if this Minister knew something about that. That is why he was wanting the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to take responsibility.</p>

<p>I can assure the Minister and the Government we are aware of what is happening, we are aware they are trying to avoid the consequences of their policy, but we shall watch what happens. We shall approve of this because it is not contrary to our policy. While we are giving our approval here we are looking forward to the Government accepting more and more of our policies regarding the Bantu.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. member for Transkei very sincerely for his compliments. However, I just want to say this to him. This is not United Party policy. If it is United Party policy, then they accept the idea of independent Bantu states. [Interjections.] Yes, yes. We say this. In a Bantu residential area a Bantu may get rights of ownership, but not in a white residential area. That is what we say. Kwa Mashu is going to become a Bantu residential area now, a part of the Bantu homeland. Therefore they can get rights of ownership there. This is not so strange. This is the same as that part at East London. While we are still engaged on the consolidation work, the presiding officer will rule me out of order if I go into this matter any further. However, I just want to say that I am very glad that the United Party is supporting this clause. But it is not a case of our having accented United Party policy; on the contrary, it is quite evident that the hon. member for Transkei has now accepted National Party policy. I want to congratulate him on that and say to him that it is the most sensible thing he has ever done in his life!</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is my last chance. The hon. the Minister mentions Kwa Mashu, but Kwa Mashu could be acquired because the Government is presently buying up all the land within the native area and the scheduled area. They could acquire the land at Kwa Mashu without passing this Bill. They could acquire the land for Bantu occupation and they said they were going to do so. They said they are going to give them home ownership which is part of our policy. But I am not talking about Kwa Mashu, I am talking about Soweto, Langa and all these other places; that is what I am talking about. The Minister has let the cat out of the bag. He said we on this side were accepting Nationalist Party policy because the Bantu would live in Bantu homelands and on Bantu land. In terms of this Bill the Government can take over Soweto, Langa, Guguletu: they can take over all these urban areas and they will then have the Bantu living on Bantu land. That is what the Government is getting at here, because it belongs to the Bantu Trust. This is an excuse for the failure of their policy. They will say the Bantu are not living in white areas, not living in white South Africa, not living on white-owned land; they will say the Bantu are living on Bantu Trust land. This is an admission of their failure to carry out their policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite obvious, Mr. Chairman, that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s political past is now beginning to have a good effect upon him. He was a member of the United Party once, and this is obviously filtering through. The one thing the Minister is obsessed with is Kwa Mashu. It is a good example of the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards their dilemma in Natal. In Natal it is very easy. You have in Durban two huge new complexes of housing for Bantu. The one is Umlazi. Umlazi was always Crown land, it was always land owned by the Trust. Therefore in Umlazi, which borders on the boundary of the municipality, the Bantu could live, they could own their homes, they could live the sort of life which we believe they should live in the urban areas simply because they are permanent dwellers in those areas. Then you have Kwa Mashu which was not Crown land, it was not land owned by the Trust, and Kwa Mashu can in fact be owned under existing legislation simply by buying a small corridor of land from the reserve which exists and Kwa Mashu. I am referring to the Inanda reserve. When they have that small corridor then suddenly everyone in Kwa Mashu has been &#x201C;removed&#x201D; from a white area and they are suddenly part of the homelands. Then they do not exist in the urban area any more, they do not exist at all. That is so, despite the fact that Kwa Mashu bounds my constituency and that of the hon. member for Pinetown. <span class="col_4329-4330" refersTo="page_0652"/>Despite the fact that it is part of that complex suddenly it becomes a homeland because they buy the land. This is a wonderful solution. You then have the ideologies of the Nationalist Party and the practicality of the United Party. This is a practical world we live in and this Government has to face up to it, just as the hon. the Minister of Transport is facing up to it. Despite the Government&#x2019;s ideology the Minister of Transport has to face up to it. He says, &#x201C;I do not care what your laws are, I have to run a business and I am going to do what I want to do&#x201D;. Now we find the Government doing exactly the same thing in this respect.</p>

<p>What is fascinating about the Committee State so far is the fact that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, when he saw what was happening, suddenly walked out in a fit of pique. I do not know why it was. He said, if my note is correct, &#x201C;Dan loop ek &#x2026;&#x201D; So he did; he just walked out of the House, he &#x201C;looped&#x201D;.</p>

At this stage we do not know anything about the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill. As my hon. friend said, we may not anticipate it or discuss it. If this is passed into law like this and Parliament has adjourned after the State President has signed it, what will the position be&#x003F; We will have an Act of Parliament which gives the Bantu Trust the right to buy the land in a township. It will be an Act subsequent to the 1936 Bantu Trust Act, so that is quite irrelevant. That Act says that the Trust may only buy land which abuts on to an existing scheduled or released area, or which is in fact in a scheduled or released area. The Bantu Trust may buy it. If they buy it, are they not then entitled to give home ownership to the Bantu&#x003F; Are the Bantu not entitled to own land which the Bantu Trust has bought&#x003F;</p>

<p>With great respect, this has everything to do with it. That is what this clause is all about. The Bantu Trust may now take over that ownership of the local authority, which entitles them to charge a rent for the houses built on that land. But for the fact that they are owners, they could not claim rent, but they do. Now the Bantu Trust is going to take over ownership of this area. This is very fascinating.

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday when I started with a few observations I wanted to make in connection with this Bill, I pointed out that we on this side of the House would not oppose this Bill. We considered it a good principle that the Post Office be granted this greater measure of independence in regard to its staff matters and that this be done as soon as possible. I should like to quote from Hansard what the hon. the Minister said in his speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The main object of this measure is to detach the Post Office, as regards the remuneration and conditions of service of its staff, completely from the rest of the Public Service.</block>

<p>We have no objection to that. We agree with that wholeheartedly. It would be a good thing if, as far as this principle of the Bill is concerned, we could just obtain clarity as to what is involved and precisely what powers are being repealed and what powers are now being granted to the Post Office Staff Board by clause 3 of this Bill in terms of which section 12 of the principal Act is now being repealed. Section 12 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10 (1), (2) and (3) of this Act, a recommendation under section 6 (2) (g) or (m) of the Public Service Act&#x2014;(a) made by the board, shall have no force unless it has been approved by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of the Interior and, in so far as the recommendation in question is subject to the provisions of section 7 (2) of that Act, the Minister of Finance; &#x2026;</block>

<p>In order to grasp the implications of this we should look at those particular sections of the Public Service Act which are mentioned in section 12. Section 6 (2) (g) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission shall make recommendations as to the scale of salaries, wages and allowances of all the various classes and grades of officers and employees; &#x2026;</block>

<p>The powers the Public Service Commission had in the past and has also up to now been able to exercise partly in connection with the salaries, wages and allowances of all these various classes and grades of officers and employees, are now being removed and granted to this new Post Office Staff Board. At the same time this new Post Office Staff Board is also being granted the right to exercise the powers of the Public Service Commission in that they can make recommendations concerning the determination of the regulations that are issued; in other words, concerning regulations in general. The hon. the Minister quite rightly devoted the major part of his speech to that important repeal of section 12 of the previous principal Act.</p>

<p>An interesting part of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech was when he outlines how these steps were taken and how year after year progress was made along these lines until this point was reached. I do not wish to outline the historical survey in as detailed a manner as the hon. the Minister did, but I do want to say that I do not agree with the impression he created in that survey. He created the impression that positive steps had been taken by force of circumstances and virtually as a result of inherent daring and enterprise on the part of the Government. I think the facts are quite different, even if we accepted the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figures and dates and if we looked at the delay there was before we eventually reached the present stage, the day on which we can adopt this sound measure. The Government was in power for 20 years and it took them ten years before they got the idea of detaching the Post Office as regards its staff; I do not wish to refer to the financial aspect of the matter, for it does not concern this Bill at all. It took ten years!</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall gladly comply with what you said. We must bear in mind that it took from 1959 to 1963 before the Post Office Staff Board was established. Subsequent to that it took another three years, from 1963 to 1966, before the Wiehahn Commission, a good commission, was appointed. That Wiehahn Commission also took quite a while&#x2014;I suppose they had to&#x2014;before their recommendations were embodied partially or fully&#x2014;we do not know to what extent, because we did not see that report&#x2014;in the 1968 Bill. But the Government was in power for 20 years and delayed for ten years, and if we consider the distress this caused, we cannot pay tribute to the Government in this regard. If we consider how much money those commissions cost the Government, if we consider how much time they took, if we consider for what length of time the services of the Post Office were affected by the staff shortage and the dissatisfaction amongst the staff, because they could not make their own regulations, if we consider the deterioration this brought about, which was so bad that when the hon. the Minister took over the reins in 1958 he had to exclaim that the Post Office was in a critical position, then we must realize that these are the consequences of what the hon. the Minister kept from us.</p>

<p>I do not quite understand what that hon. verkrampte member means. Ten years after the present Government had come into power, the then Minister had to admit that the position was critical. But last year, when this clause which is now being repealed was agreed to, we warned the hon. the Minister that he was taking a wrong step. We told him that he would come back to this House in order to get that clause repealed or amended. His reply was that he was a new Minister and that he wanted to test this clause. For years and years there was evidence before him and before the Cabinet to the effect that this section which we are repealing to-day, would never be any good in the form in which it was cast originally. This was proved by the events of the past year. I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister a few things which we said to him and which he is putting into practice to-day. I quote from the Hansard report of 2nd May, 1968. We told him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, I want to deal first with one matter and refer to clause 12 &#x2026;</block>

<p>The section which is now being repealed.</p>

<block name="quote">I personally believe that the Minister in this respect is living in a dream world. As the new clause reads now, the Minister will not be able to give effect to his objects, because it means in effect that the approval of the Public Service Commission would still be necessary in this case. Sir, this Bill is being introduced so that the Post Office can be administered on business lines. Whoever heard of a business not being able to determine the whole structure of its staff&#x2014;its managers, its accountants, its salesmen, its bookkeepers, its secretaries, its storemen&#x003F; The hon. the Minister will not have the full power that he should have to determine the wage scales of the staff.</block>

<p>We warned him last year. I told him that I was sure that in this regard the members of his staff and most of the staff associations would be most disappointed. And they were disappointed because they had expected more. But I approve of this step which is being taken to-day, for it is at least quite a major step in the direction of what we asked for last year. I told the hon. the Minister that I was prepared to leave it to the future to show who was right. The fact that he wants to repeal section 12 to-day, proves that we were right. But, Mr. Speaker, last year we had some support from that side in this regard. I see that my hon. friend the hon. member for Harrismith is present. As far back as last year he felt deep down that this section 12 should be repealed.</p>

<p>At the Committee Stage last year in this very same House the hon. member for Simonstown introduced an amendment which would have had similar consequences to those of clause 3 of this Bill. We wanted to amend that section 12 in such a way that everything which the hon. the Minister envisages with this Bill, would have been possible, and then he says that it is not true. The Hansard report bears witness to the fact that he voted against it and that all the members on the other side voted against section 12 being amended, and to-day this section is being amended by the hon. the Minister. I am praising him again. I hope you will not take this amiss of me, Mr. Speaker; I am, after all, praising the hon. the Minister. I am also praising the hon. member for Harrismith, The hon. member for Harrismith said last year that it was painful for him to have to agree with me; he said that the United Party was right in its attitude in regard to this matter, and a few days later he said that allowance should at least be made for a trial period, a trial period of up to five years. But to-day, after 12 months &#x2014;not after three, four or five years&#x2014;the Minister introduces this Bill and admits that we were right.</p>

<p>But there was one aspect in the speech made by the hon. the Minister yesterday which I find rather disappointing. We must bear in mind that all of the more than 40,000 members of the Post Office staff and the Post Office Staff Association&#x2014;which is a major, important association &#x2014;said: &#x201C;Just wait until 1st April, until this Bill will have been passed, then the great day will dawn for the Post Office; then we shall be able to work out our own Post Office system; then we shall be able to work out our own staff structure.&#x201D; They thought that a great day would really dawn for them. I also hoped for that. But what does the hon. the Minister say&#x003F; Here he comes along with cold water and this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The introduction of new salary scales or general conditions of service are, in any event, matters in regard to which the Post Office will never be able to act unilaterally. Such proposals always have to be considered by the Cabinet, and the Cabinet bears joint responsibility for the decisions taken in this regard.</block>

<p>These were the words the hon. the Minister used yesterday. Is he already intimating in anticipation that the Post Office staff will not receive what they have been hoping for&#x003F;</p>

<block name="quote">The main objective of this measure is to detach the Post Office, as regards the remuneration and conditions of service of its staff, completely from the rest of the Public Service.</block>

<p>This is the only principle we are discussing here to-day in regard to the Second Reading; we are not dealing with clauses I and 2 of this Bill. These are the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own words, and they appeared in yesterday&#x2019;s Hansard, not in last year&#x2019;s.

The <span class="col_4337-4338" refersTo="page_0656"/>administrative matter is to repeal section 12 and the point of policy is how salaries will be determined in the Post Office, which has nothing to do with this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, Mr. Speaker, the section which is being repealed now, provides that any recommendations under section 6 (2) (g) or (m) of the Public Service Act made by the Post Office Staff Board, shall have no force unless it has been approved by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance. This is the original section 12; this is the section we are repealing now. Those parts of the Public Service Act refer specifically to the right of the Post Office and the Public Service to make regulations, to work out staff structures, to determine conditions of service and to determine salaries. On that basis this was subsequently accepted by the Staff Association. I shall not elaborate on that any further. I am merely mentioning that this is and will be a source of disappointment, i.e. that the Minister is apparently throwing cold water on the high hopes of the staff.</p>

<p>Sir, I conclude with a warning to the hon. the Minister. We in the United Party have cooperated in and agreed to this greater measure of independence in regard to Post Office staff matters having to be granted to the Post Office. Whereas in the past the Minister experienced problems and told us that he did not have the necessary powers, we are granting him those powers to-day. My warning is that now that he is going to receive these powers, he will in future have no excuse whatsoever for any dissension, for any dissatisfaction about postal services on the part of the staff of the Post Office or on the part of the public. We are now granting him the weapon and telling him that he should use that weapon, and his entire political reputation is going to depend on the extent to which he makes use of it. He no longer has any excuse whatsoever for saying that he does not have the necessary powers.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove made a long speech here about a small and insignificant matter. He tried to convince the House that this amending Bill was actually the fruit of the efforts of the Opposition. On the basis of quotations from Hansard I shall indicate that the present Minister of Posts and Telegraphs already expressed certain trends of thought here in 1968. The attempt by the hon. member for Orange Grove to create the impression here that the Opposition made a significant contribution to this progress in respect of the control and financing of the Post Office does not impress this House at all. The hon. member cannot point out to me one proposal or amendment moved by the Opposition which was accepted during the discussion of that legislation. However, I want to concede to the hon. member that the Opposition did move an amendment last year in connection with the particular section which is now being amended. The hon. member rightly said that in the Committee Stage I myself also pleaded for the complete detachment of the Post Office from the Public Service. The Staff Board is now to be exclusively composed of Post Office staff members. At that time there was still one member of the Public Service Commission on the Staff Board, and it was in that connection that I stated quite frankly in this House that I was not happy with it. But no amendment was accepted by this side for the implementation of an Opposition suggestion. Therefore, absolutely nothing that was done in the past years by the Opposition has made any contribution to this progress in the Post Office. The hon. member for Orange Grove said that he was glad that the Minister had now decided to take positive steps to comply with their proposals. Sir, before reading out quotations here on which to base my statement that the hon. the Minister already had that step in mind, I want to refer to the hon. member&#x2019;s remark that over a period of 10 years this Government failed to take steps that were very necessary and to bring this legislation before the House. However, the situation in 1963 was as follows. Shortly before this the Union of South Africa became a Republic. We experienced disturbances in the country. Our Defence Force was not as powerful as it ought to have been. A start was made with the implementation of this tremendously great task, separate development. This all required gigantic sums of money and therefore attention could not be given at that stage even to the possibility of reserving the Post Office&#x2019;s funds for itself. It still had to be paid into the Treasury. I am merely pointing to the reasons why it was not possible at that stage. The hon. member has also seen, in the recent Estimates, what tremendous amounts can no longer be used by the Treasury as a result of the Post Office gaining its independence. Therefore, you can see that at that stage it was altogether out of the question. But commissions of inquiry were appointed, the Wiehahn Commission, and subsequently the Du Plessis Commission, and such commissions take a tremendous amount of time before issuing their reports.</p>

<speech by="#deputy-speaker">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY-SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order: The hon. member must come back to the Bill. He is a long way back in history now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come back immediately and merely refer to the fact that the recommendations of those commissions were to a large extent adopted and have already been entrenched in legislation. Another reason to which I just want to refer is that while we are now making the Post Office completely independent through the amendment of sect&#x2019;on 12 by the new clause 3, the Postmaster-General and his staff controlled the finances the organization and related matters very efficiently and successfully before we had reached this stage. It therefore goes without saying that, as was referred to here, with criticism being exercised about the system of financing <span class="col_4339-4340" refersTo="page_0657"/>of the Post Office, because the Minister cannot act exclusively on the recommendations of the Staff Board, he must take the matter to the Cabinet. This is also the case with the Railways. When a board makes a recommendation, with reference to salary structures, opportunities for employment and employment benefits, it must subsequently be referred back. These statements which I am now making are all relative to section 12, which is now being amended, because by the amendment of section 12 the Post Office is now, as far as its staff matters and finances are concerned, being detached completely from and being made independent of the Public Service Commission. Therefore I have perhaps transgressed in your opinion by ranging too widely. The hon. member claimed to have pleaded for these matters, but I want to quote from column 4415 of the Hansard of 1968, where the hon. member for Orange Grove said&#x2014;</p>

<p>Our main reservations about this Bill &#x2026;</p>

<p>This is the Act which we are now amending&#x2014;&#x2026; centre round this Board. We wonder whether this Board is indeed going to be as effective as the Minister is trying to tell us.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>You did not come forward with an amendment. It is very clear from what you said here. But I further want to point out that in the course of his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of the recommendations of the Committee and the proposal of the Public Service Commission, legislation was adopted in 1963 in order to grant the Post Office its own staff board.</block>

<p>This is a result of that staff board, which will now consist of three members chosen exclusively from the officials of the Post Office and will no longer include a person from the Public Service Commission. I say that a result of that is the total independence of Post Office matters in the financial sphere as well. These are therefore the logical consequences as they have developed over the years. It is an indication of the development which there was, and because of that we have come to this stage of legislation; and quite to my own surprise I want to say that I have somewhat of an appreciation for the logic of the hon. member for Orange Grove as he has now displayed it here in not opposing all these clauses tooth and nail as well. With the acceptance of this legislation and the total independence of the Post Office, we now also envisage a period of more rapid growth and expansion for it.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I have seldom heard an hon. member on either side of the House taking so much trouble to discuss an amendment moved by the opposite side of the House a year previously as was the case with the hon. member for Harrismith to-day. He seemed more concerned with the amendment that I moved in this House last year than with the provisions of the Bill before the House, and to refresh his memory I should like to refer him to column 4821 of the Hansard of the debate on the Post Office Readjustment Bill last year, where we moved that all reference to the Minister of the Interior, and therefore to the Public Service Commission, should be deleted, for the very reasons which have prompted the Minister to come to this House to-day with the Bill which we have before us. We said then that the independence given to the Post Office had strings attached to it, and we pointed out that it would not be long before the Minister would have to come back to this House to ask for full independence to be given, meaning independence from the Public Service Commission. For that reason we moved the amendment that the Minister of the Interior should be excluded from the ambit of the Bill that was before the House last year.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will rule me out of order if I discuss the long history which precedes this matter, and therefore I do not propose to do so, but I think we are entitled to say that the arguments from this side of the Hmuse over the years have been in respect of salaries and the structure of posts in the Post Office. the power to make regulations and the conditions of service in the Post Office. Our arguments over the vears have been justified by the appearance before us of this Bill, because this Bill does in fact make the Post Office independent of the Public Service Commission. The Post Office from now on will be able to arrange for payment of its own salaries and for determining the scales and posts in the Post Office and to make regulations. That is in fact real independence and as such we on this side of the House welcome it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove stated here that they had converted me last year; I have now become a convert to the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint in regard to this matter of principle which is involved in this legislation.

<p>I made the Minister withdraw it.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I withdrew what I had said, i.e. that you know it, but I can still make the statement that it is not true. In all probability the hon. member did not know it, and that is why I withdrew it. When I spoke in this House last year, it was the first occasion in the 16 years I had up to that stage been a member of the House of Assembly, on which I took part in a debate on Post Office matters. On that occasion I rose and in introducing the Post Office Readjustment Bill, I said the following in regard to the independence of the staff. That was before hon. members opposite could speak so as allegedly to convince me and make me a convert to their standpoint. This is what I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As regards the staff, there have also been inevitable delays in the daily administration of the Post Office in that the Public Service Commission itself has to take decisions on so many matters of lesser importance. But a more significant problem is to be found in the fact that the Post Office staff structure&#x2014;in other words, the grouping of the various levels of the staff for carrying out the work and administering the Department &#x2014;must necessarily follow the same pattern as is the case with the rest of the Public Service. For the Post Office with its many divergent services which differ so much from those of the rest of the Public Service, this arrangement could really never be an effective one.</block>

<p>I continued and in the same speech, in introducing the Bill, I came back to this matter.</p>

<p>I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This brings me to a matter to which I referred earlier on and of which I should like hon. members to take notice &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove has obviously never taken any notice of it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; i.e. that in terms of the existing arrangements the staff structure of the Post Office had of necessity to follow the pattern of the rest of the Public Service, even when it was not the most suitable pattern for the Post Office. This measure establishes the machinery whereby the Post Office, as regards its staff structure, can move away from the pattern which applies in the rest of the Public Service, and will in the course of time be able to effect its own staff structure which will have been adjusted to its needs as a business undertaking. Obviously the Government as a whole will have to decide about any changes of this magnitude&#x2014;the Post Office will not be able to introduce them unilaterally. But this is now being made possible and it is a matter to which the Post Office must necessarily give attention as soon as is practicable. Its efficiency is to a very large extent affected by this.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>What attention have you given to it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I attended to it at once. The Bill which is before the House at the moment is proof of this. Proof of this is the fact that in September already the Cabinet took a decision, in terms of which the Post Office staff will be detached from the Public Service, and which has been announced. I could hardly have attended to this matter sooner than I did. This is the position and it is no use the hon. member for Orange Grove trying to score points of political propaganda for his Party through the statement he made here. Nobody will accept it. Everybody knows what the position is. Everybody knows that at that time I had only just taken over as Minister and that when I took over, the Post Office Rearrangement Bill had already been drafted. I also said on that occasion that I did not want to delay the Bill any further as a result of my having become Minister of this Department shortly before, and that was why I wanted to introduce it. But I explicitly gave the undertaking here that the matter would be investigated and that as soon as I had found that in practice it did not work out to the best advantage of the Post Office staff&#x2014;of which I was already convinced, and I expressed my conviction here&#x2014;I would put it right. Since I did not want to follow the precipitate course which the United Party follows in everything they do, I preferred to try out the matter in practice first, and at the first opportunity that offered itself, within three months after Parliament had prorogued, this decision was taken by the Government. Now I do not know what the hon. member is trying to prove by saying that that side of the House made me a convert to their standpoint. The fact of the matter is that as far as this whole matter of the independence of the Post Office is concerned, it took the United Party many years to arrive at this standpoint, and now they are trying to pretend that they were responsible for the change. This is a matter for which the spadework had already been done by the previous Minister of Posts, but now they are trying to score points for those steps which he originally announced and which they originally opposed. The country knows this, and the hon. member for Orange Grove can talk until he is blue in the face, but the country will know that this Government granted the Post Office its independence, and that this Government is also the Government which detached the Posit Office staff from the Public Service.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to the second point that was made by the hon. member. He said that I had immediately tried to throw cold water on the high expectations of the Post Office staff, <span class="col_4343-4344" refersTo="page_0659"/>because in introducing this Bill I had said that the salaries and conditions of service of the Post Office still remained matters for which the whole Cabinet was responsible. Is this really a valid argument to advance in respect of a Bill such as this&#x003F; Is it a valid argument in respect of any other piece of legislation&#x003F; The Government is here and it does, of course, bear joint responsibility for every decision taken by every Minister of every Department. To what precisely does the hon. member object&#x003F; When the hon. member asked me yesterday whether the salaries and conditions of service of the Railways also had to be submitted to the Cabinet, my reply was: &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. I told him that these matters were submitted to the Cabinet and that they were approved there.</p>

<p>Yes, but I definitely do not intend to flatter the hon. member, because he does not deserve it. Now I want to say something to the hon. member for Orange Grove, because we must understand each other very well. He need not give me warnings in respect of what my duties are towards the Post Office staff, nor in respect of my work as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The hon. member really pretended that it was by his good grace that it was possible for me to obtain these powers, and that it was by the good grace of the United Party that it was possible for me to obtain these powers to place this legislation on the Statute Book. Sir, I am not dependent on the grace of that hon. member or of the United Party. I am in fact dependent on this side of the House, on the National Party, which was placed in power as a government by the nation. I do not need a friendly warning nor a serious warning from that hon. member. I know what my duty is towards my Department, of which I am the Minister. I know what my duty is towards the Post Office staff. The hon. member is welcome to find out from the Post Office staff what they think of me as a Minister, for in this short while I have done for them everything I could possibly do.</p>

<p>No. I am not prepared to reply to questions now. The hon. member has already had a chance to speak and he can again put questions at the Committee Stage. I am satisfied with what could be achieved in the course of the past years, i.e. so that this legislation could be placed on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown did not say much. He obviously wanted to sing the same tune as was sung by the hon. member for Orange Grove. He also said, as the hon. member for Orange Grove did, that they had warned me last year that it would not take me long before I would come back to this House to ask for these powers. Sir, the idea the hon. member for Simonstown got, is not a very original one. I said it myself. Let me read out to the hon. member what I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If experience in practice indicates that the arrangement in regard to the Post Office Staff Board can be rationalized even further in order to meet the requirements of the Post Office as a business undertaking in a more advantageous way, we shall give careful consideration to any amendment which can promote this purpose and such amendments will be submitted to Parliament without any delay. But I will not allow the Opposition to force me, with the consideration of this Bill, to effect precipitate changes in regard to this matter before I have seen through practical experience how the entire system works.</block>

<p>I kept my word, but not necessarily to the Opposition. I kept my word because I had seen in practice what the position was, and because in terms of that the best arrangement could be effected in the legislation which is before the House at the moment.</p>

<p>This is a great occasion for the Post Office staff. They have aspired to this for years. As a Post Office staff they also aspired to becoming independent of the Public Service at a time when the United Party had been in power for many years, at a time when a select committee of this Parliament recommended to that former Government that the Post Office be granted independence&#x2014;a recommendation to which that Government never responded and in regard to which it never took any steps. The Post Office staff will appreciate that it was a National Government, and a National Government alone, which had granted them independence of the Public Service.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The object of this measure is to adjust the Broadcasting Act, which was passed in 1936 <span class="col_4345-4346" refersTo="page_0660"/>to establish the South African Broadcasting Corporation, so as to grant the Corporation various additional powers, and also to bring the Act, where it has proved to be necessary, into line with practical considerations and modern circumstances. The most important of the additional powers for the Corporation envisaged by the measure is to allow the Corporation to acquire broadcasting stations outside the Republic and South-West Africa, to issue free listeners&#x2019; licences itself, and to expropriate land.</p>

<p>At the moment, Sir, the S.A.B.C. only has statutory authority to erect broadcasting stations within the Republic and South-West Africa. Especially after the introduction of the new overseas service of the S.A.B.C. on 1st May, 1966, it became evident that there was a need for the Corporation to have powers to acquire broadcasting stations outside the borders of the country as well. The overseas radio service is important to our country. By means of that service a strong and objective picture of South Africa is presented to the outside world, knowledge about our country is disseminated, and understanding of its problems is promoted. The S.A.B.C. is handling this service in an excellent way as far as the presentation and contents of its programmes are concerned. There is ample proof of the acceptance this service is finding in the outside world, the increasing interest in our country that is generated by it, the goodwill it creates, and the high regard that is shown for the objectivity of the broadcasts. But it is not enough that the service is handled efficiently. It must also be well-equipped technically if it is to be and to remain effective under the conditions of to-day, when there is stronger and stronger competition for the ear of the listener by the numerous countries that maintain overseas radio services. The four short-wave transmitters used by the S.A.B.C. for its External Service&#x2014;at the H.F. Verwoerd transmitting station near Johannesburg&#x2014;have an output of 250 kilowatt each. This compares very favourably with the transmitting power of the external services of America, Britain, Germany and other major countries. But just as the broadcasting services of other countries have found it necessary to erect relay broadcasting stations outside their borders in order to ensure better reception in the countries the programmes are meant for, it may become necessary for the S A.BC. to do so in order that the programmes of the external service may be broadcast further and more effectively. It may also become desirable for the Corporation to be able to erect broadcasting stations in neighbouring countries with a view to improving the efficiency of the internal services of the S.A.B.C. All stations that are erected or acquired outside the borders of the country will obviously be subject to the requirements of the countries in which they are erected, and it goes without saying that such stations can only be erected or acquired by way of negotiation and agreement.</p>

<p>Clause 6 (a) deals with the granting of the relevant power to the S.A.B.C. As hon. members will notice, the Corporation will be able to exercise this power only with the approval of the Minister, and it will therefore be necessary for the Corporation to satisfy the Minister as to the necessity and desirability of every proposal of this nature.</p>

<p>Sir, the second of the new powers for the S.A.B.C. which I have mentioned is the issue by the Corporation itself of free listeners&#x2019; licences. Clause 10 deals with this. As the Act reads at present, the issuing of free listeners&#x2019; licences to the parties entitled to them is undertaken by the Post Office, just as in the case of radio licences for which fees have to be collected. At present free listeners&#x2019; licences may, according to the Act, only be issued to educational and charitable institutions, and hospitals. Investigations were made by the Post Office in regard to the efficiency and cost of the arrangements in terms of which radio licences are administered at present, and in consultation with the S.A.B.C. it was found that from an administrative point of view it would be simpler and more efficient if the S.A.B.C. were to receive all applications for free licences, and to issue those licences and keep records thereof itself. With the present number of free licences that are issued annually the simplification will already be considerable, and the possibility exists that the number may increase substantially in the future. As hon. members will notice, clause 10 provides that free licences can by law also be issued to categories of persons that are prescribed by regulation. This will make it possible in future rather to grant free licences to some deserving category of persons than to lay down a nominal licence fee for them, as is done at present. The problem with a nominal licence fee of, say, 25c, is that the compensation the S.A.B.C. has to pay the Post Office for the work involved in the issuing and control of such a licence may be more than the actual licence fee. It will be advantageous to the S.A.B.C. if such nominal licence fees are discontinued and free licences are issued in lieu thereof, if the category of persons concerned justifies it.</p>

<p>To obviate any possible misunderstanding I should like to stress that the S.A.B.C. will not, under the Act as it is now being amended, be able to decide on its own who may receive free licences. The regulations in terms of which it may be provided that a certain category of persons may receive free licences, are not valid without the approval of the Minister. It goes without saying that the Government will have to give careful consideration to every case where a category of persons may make representations for free licences, and take into account not only the merit of the representations, but also the effect it will have on the revenue of the S.A.B.C. if the representations are granted. Sir, here I must warn that those who are paying nominal licence fees at the moment, must not deduce <span class="col_4347-4348" refersTo="page_0661"/>from what has been said here that when the Act is amended, they will be entitled to free licences. This amendment of the Act does no more than to create the authority to issue free licences to a category of persons as well, and not only to educational or charitable institutions and hospitals. Every type of case will have to be considered strictly on merit.</p>

<p>The third of the more important new powers to which I referred is the power for the S.A.B.C. to expropriate land, which is embodied in clause 14. For the erection of the F.M. network, which has reached an advanced stage but is still continuing, it is necessary to place radio transmitters on mountain tops and to build access roads and take power lines there. The S.A.B.C. does not have a wide choice of localities when such a transmitter has to be erected, because it has to be in a specific position in order to function most effectively and to give the best possible reception throughout the area it has to serve. The Corporation often experiences great difficulty in acquiring the sites that are necessary and in obtaining wayleave rights for the access roads, because an owner may ask an excessive price for the small piece of mountain land and the wayleave in the knowledge that the Corporation is obliged to use that piece of land. Moreover, for the erection of an ordinary short-wave transmitter it is often necessary for technical reasons that only a specific piece of land be used, and where this is the case, the possibility immediately arises that the owner may exploit the position in order to ask an excessively high price.</p>

<p>An efficient, and economic broadcasting service is in the wider public interest. For this reason it is deemed justified also to grant the S.A.B.C. powers of expropriation such as those, for example, of the Electricity Supply Commission. However, I want to stress here. Sir, that these powers will apply exclusively to radio transmitters themselves and access to the sites of those radio transmitters, and to no other land or other buildings which the S.A.B.C. may require. Furthermore, in any particular case the powers may be exercised only with the approval of the Minister and only after the S.A.B.C. has satisfied the Minister that it is not possible to come to a reasonable agreement by negotiation, and that it is necessary to acquire specifically that land and that wayleave for the radio transmitter.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the other additional powers for the S.A.B.C. envisaged by the Bill are of a more domestic nature. In clause 6 (f) and (g) the Corporation is authorized to establish a housing fund, a bursary fund and an aid fund. The Corporation already has the basic power to grant housing benefits to its employees and to assist in financing in the interests of the Corporation the training or further training of its staff or of persons who intend to work for the S.A.B.C. At present, however, these things must be done out of the General Fund of the S.A.B.C. For the orderliness of its finances it would be better for the S.A.B.C. to have statutory funds specifically for housing and bursaries.</p>

<p>As regards the proposed aid fund, a need exists for an arrangement according to which the Corporation can render assistance to an employee who may perhaps require temporary assistance as a result of special or unforeseen circumstances, by for example granting him a loan out of such a special fund. From the nature of the case this will be a smaller fund. It will be possible to prescribe by regulation what contributions the Corporation may pay over to it and how the fund should, <i>inter alia,</i> be controlled.</p>

<p>Two other smaller powers for the S.A.B.C. that are embodied in the measure are that the Corporation should be able not only to acquire, but also to deal with and dispose of copyrights and performing rights, and that the Corporation should be able to distribute not only literary matter, but also recordings. These things are common practice with broadcasting organizations. A further power that is granted by the measure is that the Corporation can obtain rights to broadcast programmes of foreign radio organizations here, without the prior approval of the Minister. These rebroadcasts, such as of overseas cricket matches, occur in the course of the Corporation&#x2019;s daily broadcasts and it is neither necessary nor practical to approach the Minister in each case for his approval. The additional powers mentioned here are contained in clause 6. Another domestic power that is granted is contained in clause 11, which will enable the Corporation to raise short-term loans to meet any casual deficits that may arise in its general fund. In the course of the Corporation&#x2019;s activities it inevitably happens that it has an overdrawn account for a day or two at some or other bank. This power is a normal one for an organization such as the S.A.B.C., and will simplify the management of its financial affairs.</p>

<p>Mr, Speaker, I have now dealt with all the additional powers embodied in this measure. The other provisions of the Bill are aimed mainly at simplifying the domestic activities of the Corporation and at clarifying the provisions of the Act or adapting them in minor respects to modern conditions. With the exception of one or two provisions I will briefly deal with, I think that these provisions can be discussed more profitably during the Committee Stage. I do not think hon. members expect me to go more closely into the details of the Bill on this occasion.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should just refer to the renaming of the controlling body of the S.A.B.C., which is dealt with by clause 1. The designation &#x201C;control board&#x201D; is now being introduced by law. As the Act reads at present, the name of this body is still &#x201C;board of governors&#x201D;, and a member of the board is referred to as a &#x201C;governor&#x201D;. These terms are outdated, and also confusing. The board is already generally known as the &#x201C;control board&#x201D; of the S.A.B.C.</p>

<p><span class="col_4349-4350" refersTo="page_0662"/>Clause 8 deals with the adjustment of the Act as far as South-West Africa is concerned. As the Act reads at present, the conditions of the licence under which the S.A.B.C. broadcasts are determined by the Minister as regards broadcasting in the Republic, and by the Administrator of South-West Africa as regards that territory. For the sake of uniformity the same authority should determine the conditions of the licence for both the Republic and South-West Africa, and therefore this power is now being conferred upon the Minister. In any case, the licences are to all intents and purposes the same at present. In clause 17 the provisions of the Act are also made applicable to South-West Africa specifically so that the S.A.B.C. will, for example, also be able to issue free listeners&#x2019; licences to bodies and persons in South-West Africa and to exercise powers therein as regards the expropriation of land for transmitting stations.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary to say any more about the Bill at this stage. I trust that both sides of the House will support it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that the impression the hon. the Minister has tried to create, that this is such an innocent and a non-contentious Bill, is not quite the right impression. After all, we have before us now a Bill giving at least two vast new powers to the South African Broadcasting Corporation which it did not have before.</p>

<p>The first one is the right to expropriate property for its own purposes. I know it will be with the consent of the hon. the Minister, but it will be able to expropriate property wherever it wants to erect new stations or similar buildings. In that respect it will have the same power as the Minister or the Government has to-day.</p>

<p>The second vast power is this. The S.A.B.C. is now asking us in Parliament to give it the right to erect broadcasting stations in any other country. The Minister spoke about a relay station for our short-wave service. That is not all this Bill says; this Bill says much more than that. It gives the S.A.B.C. the right to build and erect broadcasting stations and installations in connection with broadcasting in any other country in the whole world. These two matters, as well as others with which I shall deal later, prompt me to say that this is a dangerous Bill. We object to the extension of these powers to the S.A.B.C., and in particular we object to the extension of these powers on account of the fact that, as I shall show later, the control of this sovereign Parliament of the Republic of South Africa over the S.A.B.C. is lessened by this Bill. Because of that I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, in view of the conduct and activities of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, declines to pass the Second Reading of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill as it, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) further extends the powers of the Corporation without providing for any control by Parliament or scrutiny by the Auditor-General; and</li>

<li>(b) further limits the already inadequate information concerning the activities of the Corporation to which the Minister, the public and its representatives in Parliament are presently entitled.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>You will see, therefore, Sir, that we are objecting first of all to the further extension of the powers of the Corporation. We are objecting to the fact that we as Parliament will not have the control over those further powers which we are entitled to have.</p>

<p>We must realize that the powers we have at the moment as a sovereign Parliament, which are now being limited, are very tenuous. Let me enumerate them shortly. Firstly there is the licence given by the Government to the S.A.B.C. to conduct a broadcasting service. The licence is a mysterious document, one that has never yet been tabled. I saw it once and I was allowed to make a copy of one or two of the clauses, but this document in itself gives no control whatsoever to Parliament over the S.A.B.C. as such. It is a document issued 30 or 40 years ago and there is very little in that really.</p>

<p>The second form of control is this. The S.A.B.C. is obliged to submit an annual report to Parliament of its activities. That is the one occasion, except when a Bill such as this is before the House, to discuss the actions of the S.A.B.C. in a particular instance. If one looks at clause 15 of this Bill one sees what I regard as a very ominous provision. One finds that in future the S.A.B.C. will not be forced, as it is at present, to give certain information to this House in regard to buildings and some of its funds. It is being given vast powers now to do these things without you, Sir, or the Minister or myself knowing what is going on with these funds which are moneys collected from the listeners by way of licence fees, from advertisers, and from funds voted by this sovereign Parliament.</p>

<p>The Minister is cutting down on the annual report, but a few weeks ago we pointed out to him in this House how, due to circumstances which might be acceptable, we were unable to discuss the report of the S.A.B.C. which is now being limited by this Bill. In fact anything the S.A B.C. might have done in January, 1968, this Parliament will not be able to discuss until March, 1970, unless there are reports in the newspapers or outside sources of information. In other words, the report itself is no form of control over the S.A.B.C. We have an opportunity during the no-confidence debate of raising it, as has been done.</p>

<p><span class="col_4351-4352" refersTo="page_0663"/>We also have the annual Post Office Appropriation Bill on which we can discuss the powers of the S.A.B.C., an account can be given regarding the use of those powers. But nowhere in this Bill is there a provision which gives us further extended powers, which places the Corporation under greater parliamentary control, as should be done. After all, when you give a corporation such as this the same rights as the Government itself has, as the State has to expropriate land, then surely we in Parliament should have the right to discuss that matter to find out what land has been expropriated and what is being done with the money of the country.</p>

<p>What is more important is this. The S.A.B.C. now takes unto itself the power to erect broadcasting stations in other countries and we in Parliament are not to know about it. That is the important thing. We are not to know about it. This Bill is removing the compulsion on the S.A.B.C. to report on the erection of all these buildings in future. This is a secret move, this is a secret measure. It is a measure empowering the S.A.B.C. to conduct secret deals and other transactions, to give away stations, to sell stations, to assist a country like Malawi in a way I shall point out shortly.</p>

<p>I just wish to say in passing that my amendment mentions the fact that no powers are given, as we have always pleaded, to the Auditor-General to go into what is being done with the funds of the S.A.B.C. My amendment specifically asks for that scrutiny. We believe it to be essential, we believe it to be ten times more essential now that we are going to have a measure in terms of which the S.A.B.C. will be able to erect buildings, buy land, and to expropriate without us in Parliament getting a full account of what has happened in that case.</p>

<p>Now I want to come more specifically to this report itself which is being limited by clause 15 of the Bill. This clause lays down that certain paragraphs which set out certain of the matters on which the S.A.B.C. must report annually are now removed from the annual report. Clause 15 lays down that paragraphs (b), (e) and (f) &#x201C;of the said subsection&#x201D; are to be deleted. I hope the House realizes the implications of the deletion of these paragraphs.</p>

<p>In the past we were entitled at least to hear once a year in the annual report of the S.A.B.C. the amount of the security for the loans still outstanding and the interest thereon. Now the Minister is taking away our right to know this and I think Parliament requires an explanation of why this is being done. However inadequate the information was, the S.A.B.C. was compelled in its annual report to do the following, and I am reading from the Act&#x2014;&#x201C;to report on the erection and the construction, the repair, the improvement or alteration of any plant, equipment or building, and the cost thereof&#x201D;. That information we were entitled to under the original Act, however tenuous the information might have been that we did get. Now that right of Parliament is being removed and we are entitled to ask why is this being done&#x003F; Why may we not know about the erection of buildings by the S.A.B.C., about the construction or the alteration of any plant or of any building&#x003F; Why may we not know more about the cost of these buildings&#x003F; It is no small amount involved. Last year no less than R4,160,000 was spent on buildings and on erections under this section, and at least these matters were mentioned and very shortly explained in the report that we had, but now we are not to hear a thing about this. Why is this being done&#x003F;</p>

<p>We read in our newspapers about a huge building being erected near Auckland Park costing R20 to R30 million. We should have liked to have read about that in the report which should be tabled on 30th April in this House. But now we are not going to get it. Why not&#x003F; We should like to know about the land deal that went on between the R.A.U. and the S.A.B.C. in regard to that land and the site for the building. There must have been negotiations. The Chairman of the Board of Governors of the S.A.B.C., Dr. Meyer, must have conducted negotiations, and he conducted them with the Chairman of the committe responsible for the R.A.U.&#x2014;also Dr. Piet Meyer. It is a very fine arrangement, but Parliament would like to know about these things. Yet they are no longer to be mentioned in the report that is tabled here every year. This will be a matter of R20 or R30 million a year, and even more in future. I will not go into details, but we heard in connection with another body, the Transvaal Provincial Council, where the Auditor-General could point out how money was actually wasted &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I want to object to the argument of the hon. member on the grounds that if there is any restriction on the powers of this Parliament then it is laid down in the principal Act. As far as this amendment is concerned, and in respect of that matter, no further restrictions are imposed on the powers of Parliament. The entire position remains unchanged in this regard.

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Sir. The important thing that is being deleted is this, in the report mention must be made about the construction and repairs and improvements of any building or equipment, and I therefore do believe that in terms of this Bill some of the powers and control of Parliament are being taken away. After all, if we are not to have a report from the S.A.B.C. on these buildings then something must be wrong, and we are entitled to that. We grant the funds for buying these buildings. The listeners pay licence fees and that money is also used for these constructions. Are the public not to know what happens to their money&#x003F; There are no shareholders in the S.A.B.C., as in other companies. I submit we are entitled to information on these lines.</p>

<p>The other important point which the hon. the Minister mentioned as being part of this Bill is that the S.A.B.C. will now have the right of expropriation. Sir, up to the present moment land has been expropriated for buildings used by the S.A.B.C. Can the hon. the Minister tell me whether that has been done by the Post Office in the past or by the Department of Lands or by the Department of Public Works&#x003F; I am not quite sure how it was done in the past. I could not get this information from the report. It would help if the hon. the Minister at some stage or other could give us that information, if he cannot give it immediately. It is quite clear that there were powers of expropriation in the past, and that such powers were exercised by a State body which is responsible to Parliament. Now the S.A.B.C. is being given the right to expropriate any land anywhere for the purposes mentioned in the Bill without reference to Parliament. There is one small safeguard, namely that the hon. the Minister must in each case give his permission. But when and how and where is the hon. the Minister going to give his permission&#x003F; We would like to know about that annually; we would like him to table that information in this House. We cannot put a question on the Order Paper every month or two to find out for which expropriation under this new clause the hon. the Minister has given permission. Sir, this particular provision is a very wide one. Clause 14 provides in the proposed section 23 (A)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law, the corporation may, with the approval of the Minister and subject to such conditions as he may impose, acquire by expropriation&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) any land required for the site of a radio transmitter and the buildings &#x2026; connected therewith;</li>

<li>(b) any land required for an access road &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>Then it says that the Expropriation Act shall apply but it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the purposes of such application thereof any reference therein to the Minister and the State shall be construed as a reference to the corporation.</block>

<p>In other words, in regard to expropriation the S.A.B.C. is now taking over the power which in the Expropriation Act is allocated to a Minister, to the State. This is the creation of a State within a State; this is a highly undesirable state of affairs. I admit that the S.A.B.C. has the right to have land for its buildings and on occasion land has to be expropriated for such buildings, but why not let the expropriation be done by the appropriate Government Department, by the Post Office, or Public Works or Lands or whichever body up to now has had the power to expropriate land for the S.A.B.C.&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned another important point in this Bill, namely the power which the S.A.B.C. will have in future to issue licences, a power which has previously been exercised by the Post Office separately.

The S.A.B.C. will now have the power to issue those licences and to do work done in the past by the Post Office. In other words, it will be an improvement in the general administration. I do not know why the hon. the Minister is so extremely upset about this, because I believe that basically this is not a bad provision.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I have said that; must I repeat it&#x003F; I know that the hon. the Minister must still give his approval. After all, I quoted the original Act and that part of the original Act which made the old concession subject to the approval of the Minister, has not been removed; it is still part of the Act. It has not been amended. Sir, I do not want the country to get the impression that this is a huge and wonderful concession that is suddenly being made, because we must remember, as the hon. the Minister himself indicated in passing, that the S.A.B.C. had pretty extensive powers in the past to grant licences, not free, but at a low rate. The original Act 22 of 1936, which has been in force now for 34 years provides (sec. 25):&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Different fees may be prescribed &#x2026; for different classes of listeners, and educational and charitable institutions and hospitals may under the said paragraph be exempted from the payment of fees in respect of such licences.</block>

<p>That has been in the Act for 34 years. There has been no vast change here. The limited change by the hon. the Minister is a change to which I personally would agree. I agree that it is a good thing that the S.A.B.C. should have the right to say that certain classes of persons and certain individuals need not pay a fee for their licence. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us in his reply which categories of persons or which persons have, up to now, been given licences at the low rate of 25 cents a year. I put a question in this respect some years ago and as far as I remember&#x2014;I speak subject to correction&#x2014;the reply was that in the main they were the employees of the S.A.B.C. itself. Those people were issued licences at 25 cents. A good case can be made out that they should get their licences at a reduced rate or even free. I am not objecting to that in principle. This provision has been on the Statute Book for 34 years. Surely with the powers which the hon. the Minister had, he should have done much more. This is no new vast, wonderful concession that he is making.</p>

<p>I know that in the past old-age pensioners received this concession. They have to pay more; I believe it is R1 or more. I trust that now we are giving the Minister these powers he will seriously consider the question of giving old-age pensioners free licences. These are members of a deserving sector; they are people who served their country well during their working years, and I do appeal to the hon. the Minister to use his powers once this Bill is on the Statute Book, to advise the S.A.B.C. to let the pensioners in South Africa have their listeners&#x2019; licences free. Let him extend the number of institutions which are getting their licences at a reduced rate.</p>

<p>The Bill mentions charitable institutions. I trust that the word &#x201C;charitable&#x201D; will not be interpreted in a narrow sense as referring only to institutions which receive their moneys from the Government only, because there are many old-age homes in the country&#x2014;I am thinking of homes such as the Queen Alexandra Home in my constituency, of Randjieslaagte, and institutions such as those&#x2014;which do not derive their funds entirely from the Government and which accommodate old-age pensioners who deserve to get these licences either free or at a low rate. They should not be required to pay this vast sum of more than R5 per annum for their licences. I hope that we shall hear from the hon. the Minister in this respect.</p>

<p>Sir, now I come to what I regard as an almost alarming provision in this Bill. I refer to clause 6, which is the clause which empowers the S.A.B.C. to erect broadcasting stations outside the Republic. This provision reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The corporation may, for the purpose of carrying out its objects, within or, with the approval of the Minister, outside the Republic and the Territory of South-West Africa acquire or erect broadcasting or television stations &#x2026;</block>

The hon. the Minister told me during the Budget debate that it was a business transaction. If it was a business transaction, he should know what the figures are. Would he be so kind as to tell us what was the value of the station that was erected, how much was paid for it, what is the value of the broadcasting station itself, aside from the buildings, which is going to Malawi, whether it was valued and what was paid for it, if anything was paid for it. I spoke about a state being created within a state. This is no mere business transaction. The S.A.B.C. is here becoming an instrument of Government policy. It is creating policy.</p>

<p>I have no objection to the &#x201C;uitwaartse beleid&#x201D; being propagated. That is not the question we are discussing here, but what I do object to is that this &#x201C;uitwaartse&#x201D; or &#x201C;verkrampte beleid&#x201D;, or whatever you might call it, is now being placed partly in the hands of the S.A.B.C. and that it can do these things without reference to this Parliament. If we do have a foreign aid programme, good and well. Then we can discuss it under the Foreign Affairs Vote. If the S.A.B.C. is asked to assist in that foreign aid programme, good and well, but let us know about it here in Parliament. Let us know about the amount of money being spent, and let us have an opportunity of discussing it under the Foreign Affairs Vote when it comes before Parliament. I would like to know from the Minister in what countries is it intended that these broadcasting stations are to be erected in future&#x003F; He must know. According <span class="col_4359-4360" refersTo="page_0667"/>to his speech, these stations must be erected according to the laws of those particular countries, whether they are in Africa or in Europe. That is fair enough, but I think we are entitled to know in what countries we are going to erect stations through the S.A.B.C. without the knowledge of Parliament but with the money of Parliament. Am I being unreasonable in asking for that&#x003F;</p>

<p>I certainly do not want the S.A.B.C. to go to Russia or to Ghana to erect stations there. Does the Minister want them to do so&#x003F; I certainly do not want the S.A.B.C. to erect a broadcasting station in Red China, because it is sure to be expropriated in a very short time. The hon. member has just asked me a silly question. [Interjection.] That hon. member asks whether I object to one at Tel Aviv. I should like to know from the Minister whether there are plans for erecting a station at Tel Aviv. Let him give us the particulars and I will gladly discuss it here. We will deal with the matter on its merits. We will gladly reply to the hon. member for Middelland as soon as we have the full particulars.</p>

<p>I have come to the end of what I have to say. I am not going to use the full time allowed to me, and I want to conclude by saying that this is no innocent Bill. Ours is a sovereign Parliament and a responsible Parliament. We are a body of people who have responsibilities to the public. When things are done as part of national policy, it must be Parliament which has to approve of it, which has to discuss it and analyse it. When vast powers in regard to expropriation are granted to an independent corporation, we in Parliament should at least have the facts, so that if we are not satisfied with those facts we can discuss them. On this side of the House we object strenuously to the provisions of such a Bill which to a large extent is making the S.A.B.C. more than ever a little state within a state without the control of us on this side or of the Minister or the hon. members on that side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove came along here with a speech this afternoon which simply amazed me. Here before us this afternoon the Minister has a Bill which is inherently not much more than a lot of small amendments. The hon. member for Orange Grove has now come along here with a whole lot of statements, <i>inter alia,</i> that as a result of the powers of expropriation which the S.A.B.C. is now going to receive and, secondly, the stations which it is going to erect outside the Republic, tremendous powers are now being entrusted to the S.A.B.C. I want to begin with his last remark about this station in Malawi.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that he had seen in newspaper reports that a broadcasting station had been erected in Malawi and that &#x201C;it was presented to them by Mr. J. N. Swanepoel&#x201D;. He quoted what the Minister had supposedly said about the promotion of the outward-moving policy and he said a whole lot of things which I think are unheard of.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>We do not dispute that. The hon. member said that he did not, for example, want the S.A.B.C. to erect a broadcasting station in Russia or in Ghana, but just the other day he and his party gave Russia ammunition against the Western world. He and his party blessed the arms of Russia. They were members of the Friends of the Soviet Union. That was what his party did. Does he want to deny that&#x003F; That is what they did to promote Communism. [Interjections.] You did not fight the Nazis, you promoted Communism. You blessed their arms, and their arms still carry that blessing to-day. He also spoke about Ghana. That was when the National Party, actually Afrikanerdom in the main, was fighting with all its might in 1960 to get a Republic in South Africa. The Opposition then said they should first wait to hear what Nkrumah had to say about Ghana. And where is Nkrumah now&#x003F; The hon. member will still go the same way in his party.</p>

<p>The hon. member objected to the implementation of the outgoing policy, but what of the broadcasting stations erected in South Africa&#x003F; It is not at all necessary to erect broadcasting stations elsewhere to broadcast the voice of South Africa to the world. Our stations are powerful enough to-day and they broadcast in many languages. I have previously stated in how many languages they broadcast and I do not want to repeat it, but they broadcast to Africa, Europe and the whole world. Do you want to deny that we make these broadcasts and that the world tunes in to South Africa, and do you want to deny that the world is happy with what is broadcast&#x003F; And what is broadcast is the National Party&#x2019;s policy in this respect that it reflects the way of life of the Whites in South Africa. My way of life and yours, whether you are a United Party member or a National Party member. It is the way of life of the Whites in this country about which broadcasts are made, and these broadcasts are received throughout the world. What is more, that hon. member knows how many letters from all over the world are written expressing satisfaction with this. It is simply not necessary to erect a station outside in order to broadcast something to the outside world. As far as the expropriation is concerned, the hon. member objected so greatly to the S.A.B.C. being able to obtain fixed property outside the borders of South Africa, but these are powers which the S.A.B.C. already has. I may just refer to section 13 (1) of the old 1936 Act. The Corporation may, for the purpose of carrying out <span class="col_4361-4362" refersTo="page_0668"/>its objects acquire, <i>inter alia,</i> movable or immovable property or interests therein and erect any building which may be required by the Corporation. This simply means that it may obtain land under the old Act. It is a fact that the S.A.B.C. can obtain that property. It is simply not stated clearly whether this applies internally or externally. As it stands here, one may obtain it wherever one wants to. It is now merely being more clearly defined in this amendment by stating that this can be done internally or externally. The hon. member surely knows that these amendments are merely being introduced for greater clarity. The stations may be erected for various purposes. After all, the S.A.B.C. has no power, for example, to go and erect a broadcasting station in any country without the approval and the co-operation of this Government and the Government of that other country. This can, after all, not happen. Now I want to ask the hon. member whether he is opposed to us engaging in business transactions with foreign countries, since it was stated clearly that it was a business transaction in Malawi&#x003F; This station was erected in Malawi and, after all, those people are not getting it for nothing. Or do you think that the S.A.B.C. is now giving everything away&#x003F; But the hon. member insinuated that the S.A.B.C. was now stealing the country&#x2019;s funds and distributing them to other people, that Parliament would have no say about that, and in addition, that it would never be brought to the attention of this Parliament. The hon. member knows very well that Parliament is not being deprived of any of its powers. The hon. member knows that, before the 30th April, the S.A.B.C. must submit its report for the previous year ending on the 31st December&#x2014;it is stated very clearly in the Act. The hon. member knows that this is so. Now he acts as if such a report will no longer be submitted.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>However, the hon. member put the matter in such a way that it seemed as if no further reports would be submitted to this Parliament. The position is unchanged. As in the past, a report will still be submitted to this hon. Minister. That report will be tabled in this Parliament. What is there that will be taken away&#x003F; The hon. member said that certain powers were being taken away and that certain information referred to in this old Act would no longer be given in future, for example, the amount of loans and securities provided. That hon. member knows that a great deal of this information is redundant. What is contained in that old Act is actually very unpractical. The hon. member also made the statement that the listeners are paying certain moneys, and that in future they would no longer have the right to know on what that money would be spent. He put it as if this were the only source of income which the S.A.B.C. had. I have here the Revenue and Expenditure account of the S.A.B.C. for 1967. According to the report the amount received in that year from listeners&#x2019; licences was R7,288,896. The gross revenue from advertising services, after deduction of commission, was R5,146,330. In addition there was still a great deal more revenue, such as the amount recoverable in respect of external services. The amount received for that was R1,358,703.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the question of the broadcasting station at Malawi. It was a business transaction. It was an export product of another form. South Africa cannot only live by the gold it exports. After all, this is a vanishing asset. South Africa must export. We do not only export raw materials, articles which we manufacture, South Africa also exports its services. We have now entered a field where South Africa is exporting its brain-power. Does that hon. member now want to tell me that South Africa must not export its brain-power&#x003F; This country has the knowledge and the ingenuity to construct broadcasting stations for the S.A.B.C. We then also construct them for other countries, thereby earning foreign exchange. What does that hon. member have against that&#x003F; I say that if Ghana were to come along and ask us to construct an S.A.B.C. station for them and we were paid for it, consideration would have to be given to whether it ought to be done, for the sake of having an export product. Build them a powerful enough station so that they can receive the message of South Africa, hear about the way of life of the white man. Then we shall be able to tell them so that they may know about it. Then a few agitators will not merely be able to sit there and say what they like. Then it will be possible for the voice of the white man from the southern tip of Africa to be heard throughout Africa and the world. We have brainpower. If we think of Dr. Barnard, who has now performed the fifth heart-transplant operation, is this not something we can be proud of&#x003F; This small white population has the brainpower. We must utilize this brain-power of ours. However, that hon. member is opposed to that. He does not want to see us in South Africa exporting our brain-power.</p>

<p>Why, then, cannot this hon. Minister introduce this legislation&#x003F; It can most certainly not be done by the Department of Foreign Affairs. What does the Department of Foreign Affairs have to do with this legislation and with the S.A.B.C.&#x003F; It is surely this hon. Minister, this Cabinet, this Government and the National Party which is responsible for that. That hon. member had a great deal to say here about the powers of expropriation. He quoted a great deal here and made a great fuss, intimating that the S.A.B.C. were bent upon robbing the country. He professed that the people would be robbed. The S.A.B.C. had these powers to a large extent; they are now merely being clarified. What is wrong with clarifying something in a Bill&#x003F; What is wrong with defining something more clearly in a Bill, so that one may know what one is heading for&#x003F; This hon. member objected most strongly to the fact that as a result of these few additional definitions this Parliament&#x2019;s powers would now be decreased, However, this Parliament has never controlled the S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s funds via the Controller and Auditor General. The hon. member now pretends that something terrible has happened, merely because these few additional items can no longer be audited and controlled by the Controller and Auditor General. I want to tell that hon. member that the funds of the S.A.B.C. are examined by professional firms. The firms doing so are all firms of professional auditors. I now want to ask the hon. member whether he has any grievance or complaint about the statements of the S.A.B.C. Does the hon. member have any grievances or complaints about the way in which the statements of the S.A.B.C. are examined and controlled&#x003F; Does the hon. member know that it is done by professional men, who adhere to a strict code&#x003F; These are honest people and the hon. member knows that they are controlled by the Public Accountants&#x2019; and Auditors&#x2019; Board. If there is merely the slightest error in their work he can, after all, report them to the Public Accountants&#x2019; and Auditors&#x2019; Board. Why do they not do so&#x003F; I challenge that hon. member to report any mistake in connection with those people! What is more, sufficient information is supplied in these statements annually. Information is very definitely not withheld from Parliament, as that hon. member claims.</p>

<p>That hon. member also made another far-fetched statement. He said that stations would be erected abroad and that the stations, for example in Malawi, would be given away to them in secret. Where has the S.A.B.C. ever given away anything in secret&#x003F; That hon. member made an accusation against the S.A.B.C., and indirectly against the hon. the Minister, to the effect that the S.A.B.C. was giving something away for nothing. I think that that hon. member owes it to Parliament and to the S.A.B.C. to state very clearly where this happened so that action can be taken, because if this is the case it is theft. The hon. member said very clearly that the S.A.B.C. was giving things away in secret; in other words, he is accusing the S.A.B.C. and its Control Board of secret, underhand transactions and donations, of things which in fact do not exist. That hon. member did not count his words. He came along here with accusations and I think that he owes it to the country to say what happened, where it happened and when it happened, if something did, in fact, happen at all.</p>

<p>Sir, that is not what he insinuated initially. He made his statements and then tried to find an example. Afterwards he came along with a newspaper report about Malawi&#x2019;s broadcasting station. Nothing in respect of this broadcasting station is being done in secret. It is not being given away at all, as that hon. member&#x2019;s accusation has it. I think that that hon. member owes it to this House and to the hon. the Minister this afternoon to say where and when it happened. He said that the listeners are paying for the erection of those buildings. He also said that the Minister was, for example, removing certain securities, etc., and that as much as R20 million, or R30 million may be involved in the future. What did the hon. member mean by that&#x003F; And with these so-called secret dealings which, according to him, would take place&#x003F; I think that that hon. member said something which was beneficial neither to himself, nor to his party, nor to the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the free listeners&#x2019; licences. He very much wanted to know to what categories of people they would be granted. It is stated very clearly in the Bill. It is stated here to whom they will be granted. The hon. member also made the statement that, in reply to a question put by him previously, it was said that it would chiefly be the employees of the S.A.B.C. who would obtain these licences. That hon. member surely knows to which bodies these licences will be issued. He even cast suspicion in this regard by saying that in the future the S.A.B.C. would not act properly in the granting of these applications. That hon. member surely knows that in the past the hon. the Minister was responsible for those free listeners&#x2019; licences. He remains as responsible for them in the future. What difference has come about&#x003F; Whether the Postmaster General and his staff grant them, or whether the Control Board of the S.A.B.C. do so, what is the difference&#x003F; It nevertheless still remains the responsibility of this Minister. I want to ask the hon. member please not to make so many statements and so many insinuations here, and not to cast suspicion on matters which do not warrant it. We know that, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member has a grievance against &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;. He expects them to hold a talk every evening <span class="col_4365-4366" refersTo="page_0670"/>about him alone, and expects them to sing his praises as if he were South Africa&#x2019;s hero. That hon. member should actually have held a panegyric on the S.A.B.C. this afternoon on behalf of his party. [Interjections.] Sir, did you hear what the Opposition said this afternoon&#x003F; Did you hear their snorts and groans about the S.A.B.C.&#x003F; The S.A.B.C. is to-day most certainly the institution which, apart from many things, fulfils certain functions &#x2026;</p>

Just think, for example, of our aged who receive these free listeners&#x2019; licences. I think that they are entitled to them. They are entitled to them, because they can apply for them when they are living at certain approved homes. The S.A.B.C. is bringing their religion to them, because as a result of physical disability they cannot move. It brings them programmes throughout the day, and the best programmes that are broadcast on any broadcasting station in the world. We do not have its equal and nothing superior, not by any manner of means. I should like to know what broadcasting station in the world is better than ours. It gives those people their news in good time, it affords them pleasure and relaxation, gives them talks, etc. It also affords them relaxation in the form of music. It gives them a joy of living and happiness. But this Opposition wants to break this down. The fact that now, in terms of this Amendment Bill, provision is being made for this small sector of our population, these old people, so that the S.A.B.C can give them free listeners&#x2019; licences, is simply not good enough for the Opposition. I thought that they would give it a little praise. I thought that they would perhaps ask for still more. I think that this afternoon the Opposition ought to have thanked the Minister for these amendments and for what he is doing to provide these services.</p>

<p>Many other services are performed by the S.A.B.C. There is, for example, the Parliamentary news which is broadcast every morning. We are three to one here, but they still receive 50 per cent of the publicity.</p>

<p>The Opposition moved an amendment consisting of two points. In conclusion I just want to say that there are no sinister powers embodied in this amendment Bill which the S.A.B.C. does not already have. There are a few matters being dealt with here, such as the changing of the name of the Control Board. That hon. member surely knows, as the Minister has also said, that for years the annual report has made mention of the control board and not of the governers, as contained in the old Act. I still want to draw attention to a few other matters. I specifically want to refer to employees of the S.A.B.C. We are very grateful for the housing scheme, the bursaries and the auxiliary fund which has been instituted for the employees of the S.A.B.C. At present there is a great manpower shortage in South Africa. As a result of the tremendous economic boom in our country, the private sector is, of course, also offering tremendous competition to attract people. These additional advantages which have now been introduced are to the benefit of the S.A.B.C. We want to thank the Minister for the fact that this is being done.</p>

<p>&#x2026; that the hon. member for Orange Grove had a great deal to say about broadcasting stations that are erected beyond the Republic&#x2019;s borders. This also implies the erection of a broadcasting station beyond the borders as far as South-West Africa is concerned, because it is not a part of the Republic. In other words, that hon. member is opposed to the erection of a broadcasting station in South-West Africa. [Interjections.] By implication this legislation must be amended, because it cannot merely be applicable within the borders of the Republic. If we were to erect a broadcasting station in South-West Africa it would surely be beyond the borders of the Republic, because South-West Africa does not form part of the Republic, although the Republic administers it. That is purely technically speaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I mention this in conclusion to prove that that hon. member did not by any manner of means give thought to this matter. That hon. member did not realize what it was all about. He merely noticed that there was a Bill before him and he jumped up to see how much venom he could extract from this Bill. [Interjection.] Does that hon. member now want to say that South-West Africa is part of the Republic&#x003F; Although this Bill is applicable to South-West Africa, this is a technical point. Such amendments have specifically been moved to resolve technical points. But that hon. member for Orange Grove did not notice it. We are very glad that these amendments have been submitted. We want to thank the Minister and say: May the S.A.B.C. flourish and prosper, because it provides South Africa with a service which few other institutions can provide for their mother country and their people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to follow the hon. member who has just sat down, I believe would take some doing. One no sooner has to scratch that hon. member, then out will trot the usual &#x201C;liberals, agitators, communists, dangers to the Whites&#x201D;, the whole gamut of race relations in South Africa. He also went so far as to start his speech by saying that we sent arms to Russia during the war. I thought this was quite amusing, because the thought suddenly occurred to me that we would have even given arms to that hon. member if he would have helped us during the war.</p>

<p>The other point, of course, is that the hon. member forgot to remember that not more than two or three weeks ago one of his own Ministers on that side of the House informed us with a fair amount of glee that we trade with Communist China. Of course, we will trade with anybody in the world.</p>

<p>I am replying to the points he made, Mr. Speaker. I do not intend to reply to them one by one. I believe that that would be a waste of time and subjecting the House to too much suffering. Hon. members on that side of the House have now on three successive Bills told us that no change is being brought about in the Bills we are discussing. We have had the same argument from the hon. member who has just sat down. It seems that we have had no change in any of these Bills. I wonder why the time of the House is being wasted in discussing them, particularly this one here. I agree entirely with my colleague, the hon. member for Orange Grove, when he pointed out that this Bill again gives more power to the hon. the Minister. It seems to give more power to the hon. the Minister and less information to this House.</p>

<p>It seems that the S.A.B.C. has now entered the field of foreign affairs by the establishment of the station in Malawi. But in entering this field of foreign affairs, we are going to be in the hands of either the hon. the Minister or the Board of the S.A.B.C., but not in the hands of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It would be quite interesting to dwell upon some of the problems that may arise with regard to this station in Malawi.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down, called it merely a &#x201C;trade transaction&#x201D;, we were &#x201C;trading&#x201D; with Malawi. He was very pleased at this fact. I think we all are. But one wonders if the S.A.B.C. has now entered the field of commerce and industry. Because if they have, I think the hon. the Minister should better look to his laurels, for he might find one of his colleagues wanting to take over his affairs as well.</p>

<p>I want to raise one or two matters with the hon. the Minister which appear to need some explanation when one looks at this Bill. In the Bill there is talk of a housing fund for &#x201C;officers and other employees&#x201D;. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he would inform me what is exactly meant by &#x201C;other employees&#x201D;&#x003F; Does it also mean, for instance, the Bantu employees at the S.A.B.C. who produce the Bantu Affairs programme&#x003F; Are they also considered as &#x201C;other employees&#x201D;&#x003F; If so, will that entitle them to the benefits that are shown in the Bill under the housing fund&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think I would rather have the answer from the hon. the Minister than from my hon. friend to the left, whose knowledge about these matters and most other matters is extremely limited.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer the hon. the Minister to clause 13 where it is stated that an insurance fund will be established. In this connection I should like to ask him whether tenders will be called for in establishing this fund; whether quotations will be obtained. I say this because too often we feel that insurance funds of this sort, or aid funds of this nature, are allocated to certain companies without due regard to the normal competition of business. I should like the assurance from the hon. the Minister that if the S.A.B.C. enters this field, competitive quotations will at least be obtained from the companies in this field.</p>

<p>I should like, too, to refer the Minister, as the hon. member who has just sat down did, to the question of licences. The Minister has said that not a great deal of the original Act is being altered. I agree, but I should like to point out to him a difficulty that has cropped up in regard to licences for old age people. The hon. member for Sunnyside told us how much pleasure old age people were deriving from listening to the radio. I agree entirely with him. I think they derive a great deal of pleasure. In fact, to most of them in South Africa it is the only pleasure they get in life. But I can assure him that they do not get any pleasure from Current Affairs. In fact, they do not listen to Current Affairs. They <span class="col_4369-4370" refersTo="page_0672"/>listen to all the serials on the commercial station. [Interjections.] They do not listen to Current Affairs. If the hon. member is so anxious about entertainment for old age people, I think he ought to speak to the hon. the Minister, and perhaps we can even get television for these old people. But I think that narrow-minded members would not like them to have something as marvelous as that. In regard to these old age pensioners, some years ago it was possible for certain homes to get concessionary licences from the department under this section of the Act. This was withdrawn from these old age homes, because it was maintained that they were not, in fact, subsidized homes. They were neither subsidized by the provincial authorities nor by the local authorities. Therefore the right for a special licence was withdrawn. But I should like to remind the hon. the Minister that even though perhaps local authorities or provincial councils did not subsidize the homes, by their very nature they were subsidized, even if it meant by street collections and other charitable actions. I mention in particular homes like the M.O.T.H. homes, which were at one stage on the Minister&#x2019;s list. But they were taken off that list because it was held they were not subsidized. I think that is something that could easily be investigated by the Minister, because obviously any old age home is subsidized to some extent, even if it is subsidized by the man in the street and not by a local authority as such. So, the Minister should give consideration to this matter. There are people living in these homes who still enjoy a reduction in their licence fees, because they were there originally, but newcomers to the homes do not enjoy the same privilege. In terms of the Act, as it is at the present time, old age pensioners who live alone are entitled to a concession. But hon. members probably know that many old age pensioners do not live alone. They live with, perhaps, friends who are also old age pensioners. They have no such concession. I think that when the Minister gives consideration to these concessionary radio licences, a little deeper consideration should be given, thereto, because there are certain groups of people who are not being given these concessions, which they should have.</p>

<p>I should like to conclude by merely repeating what I have said earlier in supporting my colleague&#x2019;s amendment. I do so in the belief that the S.A.B.C. is getting out of the control of the Minister himself. One wonders whether the S.A.B.C. controls the Minister, or the Minister the S.A.B.C.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Port Natal will pardon me if I do not go into what he said. In actual fact he said nothing. He spoke about assistance to Malawi, which I shall come back to at a later stage, and in addition he put certain questions to the hon. the Minister, to which he suggested certain malicious replies. In my opinion the hon. member did not want information, he merely wanted to sow suspicion.</p>

<p>Actually this measure merely brings about small amendments to the existing Act, but it nevertheless has important implications for South Africa, and therefore it is lamentable that it should be discussed by emotional persons in an emotionally charged atmosphere, people who commit gross exaggerations. They give an altogether erroneous representation of the actual object of the Bill. One would expect something good to come of a calm discussion of this measure. A balanced person with reasonable arguments, who furnishes constructive criticism, can make a contribution to a discussion where there is no political gain to be had, no political scavenging to be done and where constructive criticism can also come from the other side. But we did not have this here to-day. We had an emotional outburst such as we are accustomed to from the hon. member for Orange Grove.

Why this concerted feud, this campaign of hate and disparagement&#x003F; Is this service which the S.A.B.C. furnishes to the South African nation really so poor that it deserves no praise from the other side of the House&#x003F; Any straight-thinking person must, after all, ask himself this question, because on every occasion, whether it be the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote which is being discussed, or whenever, we always have this damning tirade of negativity.</p>

<p>I am coming back to this measure. I should just have liked to give the reason for this argument. Why are these accusations being made about the S.A.B.C.&#x003F; It is because the S.A.B.C., as well as this legislation before us to-day, supplies a service to the South African nation. The S.A.B.C. stands foursquare on South African soil, and for that reason and that reason alone it can supply a positive service to the South African nation. Because hon. members opposite have not yet given their hearts to South Africa they reject the S.A.B.C., which has, in fact, already done so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, clause 6 has a bearing on the more efficient implementation of the services of the S.A.B.C., by the obtaining of concessions beyond our borders and outside of South West Africa. The hon. member for Orange Grove also launched a tirade about this. It is surely self-evident that when the S.A.B.C. wants to construct repeater stations in an area outside of South Africa, negotiations must take place&#x2014;perhaps at diplomatic level&#x2014;to obtain those rights and concessions. The Governments of other African states may grant us those concessions subject to special conditions. There may be a condition of secrecy. We know what the world situation is. We know what blusterers and braggards there are at the U.N. and the O.A.U. The international situation is becoming ever more difficult. The hon. member said that it was an &#x201C;alarming&#x201D; state of affairs because it has not been blazened abroad here that we have, for example, now obtained broadcasting rights in Malawi. Can one imagine anything more ridiculous&#x003F; If we have obtained the right to have a repeater station in a foreign area under certain conditions&#x2014;i.e. conditions of secrecy&#x2014;must it now be blazened abroad so that hon. members opposite can make a fuss again which can be used by our enemies at the U.N.&#x003F; That is what the hon. member wants. I say &#x201C;It will be an alarming position&#x201D; for the U.N. and the O.A.U., but not for South Africa, if we can obtain such repeater stations. For us it will only be a tremendous asset to have such repeater stations elsewhere.</p>

<p>Our external service has expanded tremendously in recent years. The voice of South Africa is carried over by our transmitters into all the countries of Africa, Western Europe and North America. With a view to the venomous and distorted propaganda from the North which is concentrated upon the people of the African states, propaganda from transmitters which are communistically inspired, transmitters which broadcast statements describing the Whites here as &#x201C;the White pigs of South Africa&#x201D;, it is necessary for us to expand our external services and to make them as effective as possible. Therefore this right which the S.A.B.C. is now obtaining for the erection of repeater stations beyond our borders as well, is a very important one. It will enable the people of Africa to listen to the sympathetic, helpful and friendly voice of the South African nation. If we were to be forced to introduce television in South Africa, I foresee the possibility of also making use of these repeater stations. It will probably be a very effective means of refuting the distorted propaganda of our enemies. We shall be able to show the people of Africa what the actual position is. They will be able to see it on television with their own eyes. I know that when that happens the hon. member for Orange Grove will again say that he pleaded for it, because he pleads for everything that is impossible. I hope he lives to see that day.</p>

<p>These powers mentioned in the Bill are nothing new. All 73 countries with external services have such powers. They erect repeater stations in other countries to make their transmissions more effective. Why does the hon. member begrudge us this&#x003F; I say it is because his full loyalty and full allegiance are not vested here. Hon. members opposite also claim that these powers are being requested in order to use our external service for propaganda purposes. But the then Prime Minister of South Africa, Dr. Verwoerd, assured the world at the inception of our external service in 1966, that South Africa would be true to the international legal regulations signed by 37 countries in 1946 and which were endorsed by the General Assembly of the U.N. in 1945. This agreement provided, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;and it is interesting to note this&#x2014;(a) that no transmission which is intended to undermine the order and safety of other states shall be undertaken (b) that no transmissions shall be undertaken which are aimed at inciting two countries to war; (c) that in times of crisis care should be taken that transmissions meet with the requirements of truthfulness and accuracy and (d) that transmissions which would disturb good international relations be prohibited. Sir, in its external service South Africa still maintains this international agreement, and the S.A.B.C. will also continue to do so in its external service. It will confine itself strictly to this agreement. It is surely interesting to note that the people who are to-day shouting for the banning of South Africa from international conference halls are specifically those people who have no respect for international rules and regulations, and that they transgress them as they please. With its external service the S.A.B.C. has made great breakthroughs in the past. The voice of South Africa is heard everywhere in the world and has made many friends for us. This is confirmed by the thousands upon thousands of letters which the S.A.B.C. receives annually. For example, in 1967 almost 15,000 letters were received from 92 different countries in appreciation of the factual quality, accuracy and matter-of-factness of the service, thousands of which were also received from 39 African states. This proves the value of the external service to South Africa, but that hon. <span class="col_4373-4374" refersTo="page_0674"/>member said that the external service was there for the National Party! What value does the external service have for the National Party&#x003F; The external service carries the voice of South Africa abroad and not that of the National Party, because, after all, we cannot recruit members from abroad. I can foresee that if such a service were to be directed at areas further away from Africa it would mean a tremendous amount for our country.</p>

<p>In conclusion I merely want to add the following in connection with clause 10. The hon. member for Orange Grove pleaded for free licences to be granted to all pensioners. Is he doing this with a view to a little political propaganda&#x003F; Because here in the Act it is stated that the S.A.B.C. is now being empowered, with the approval of the Minister, to exempt certain groups of aged persons from payment of licence fees. I want to thank the hon. the Minister heartily for that. I know that all pensioners definitely do not need to be exempted from the payment of radio licence fees, and therefore this cannot apply as a general rule; it would be foolish to do so, but I also trust that this rule will definitely be made applicable to all State-supported institutions for the aged, because it is a fact that the radio is of tremendous value to our old people &#x2014;I express my thanks for that in anticipation. While the lonely aged would otherwise have pined away and died in their loneliness, radios are to-day becoming their only and their finest companions. They can enter into the spirit of their church services, their national festivals; they know what is going on in the world.</p>

We further complain about inadequate information concerning the activities of the Corporation, information to which we believe the public and their representatives in Parliament are entitled. As the hon. member for Orange Grove pointed out, the only control which appears to us to exist over the S.A.B.C. is by way of the issue of a licence to that Corporation and by way of the tabling of an annual report for Parliament to discuss. Over the years this side of the House has taken the line that we should have a very much more direct control over the activities of the S.A.B.C. than we have. We have seen time and time again in this House that questions have been put to the Minister concerning the S.A.B.C. and that we have very often been told that it is not the concern of the Minister and that the Corporation is an independent one.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Both hon. members who have spoken from the Government side believe that this is a very important Bill although to my astonishment the hon. member for Sunnyside indicated at the commencement <span class="col_4375-4376" refersTo="page_0675"/>of his speech that the Opposition was getting excited about a Bill which was not particularly important. But what was most impressive to me was the extent to which both those hon. members dealt with one aspect of this Bill, namely clause 6, and the establishment of radio stations, television stations and sub-stations outside of South Africa. Not only did the hon. member for Sunnyside commence his speech by talking about this clause, but be came back to it approximately three times and ended with a tirade about the Opposition and its attitude towards broadcasts outside South Africa. I think that the reason why the Bill contains this clause 6, which gives the S.A.B.C. the power to establish radio stations outside of South Africa, is that the S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s idea of en outward policy is not quite the same as that of the Government. They would be far happier to establish radio stations outside of South Africa themselves than to have the Minister of Foreign Affairs do so; they would have far greater control over the programmes to be exported over those stations.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to welcome certain features of this Bill. I should like to welcome the benefits which are being conferred on the workers of the S.A.B.C. The benefits which are referred to in clause 6 (f) and (g) are, I think, substantial benefits: the establishment of a housing fund for the provision of housing for officers and other employees of the Corporation upon terms and conditions such as the Corporation may determine. Frankly, I think it is a pity that those terms and conditions are determined by the Corporation. I would have preferred them to have been the normal terms and conditions laid down in respect of Government departments. They may well be, but it is a pity that we do not know whether they are or whether they are not. Secondly, I naturally welcome the establishment of the bursary fund to finance or to assist in financing in the interests of the Corporation the training or further training of existing or prospective officers and other employees of the Corporation. All of these are very worthy objects and they are naturally welcomed by this side of the House. The hon. member for Port Natal has already referred to the issuing of free licences, and here I should like to make a plea to the hon. the Minister who. after all, is the last arbiter on the issue of free licences, for more concessionary licences to be given, particularly to organizations such as, for example, the Moths organization. If free licences can be given to some of those elderly people who have served their country well, I think it is something that will be very much appreciated, not only by this side of the House, but also by people outside. I would therefore ask the hon. the Minister to give consideration to the question of issuing free licences more freely than has been the case in the past.</p>

<p>Then I come to the question of the establishment of radio stations outside of South Africa, a matter which is dealt with in clause 6. The establishment of radio stations within the Republic is apparently within the functions of the S.A.B.C., without ministerial approval. Am I right in saying that the S.A.B.C. may establish radio stations in South Africa without the Minister&#x2019;s approval at present&#x003F; Paragraph (a) then goes on to say that the S.A.B.C. may establish radio stations with the approval of the Minister outside the Republic and the Territory of South West-Africa. The point I want to make is that very wide powers are given to the S.A.B.C., albeit with approval of the Minister, to acquire or erect broadcasting or television stations or substations and such studios or plant as may be required in connection with any such station, and acquire any equipment therefor or rights connected there with. What is not clear to me is whether those radio stations are South African property, whether they are South African radio stations or whether, in terms of this clause, the S.A.B.C. can erect those stations for the benefit of another country&#x003F; I take it that that is what happened in the case of Malawi, the case to which the hon. member for Sunnyside referred. As I understand the position, the S.A.B.C., presumably at the behest of the Malawian Government, erected a radio station there, possibly because Malawi itself could not do it, and Malawi then paid for it. Is that correct&#x003F; If that is the case, we naturally have no objection to assistance being given to friendly States, and we naturally have no objection to the S.A.B.C. erecting stations in friendly States for the purpose of broadcasting to them from South Africa. That makes good sense to us, but we would like to have more details about these contracts the S. A.B.C. can enter into with friendly states We would like to know the financial implications. We should like to know who approved these agreements. I take it the Minister must approve all of them. It is interesting, in terms of this clause, to see it is possible that while we are going to be able to erect television stations for other friendly countries, we shall not necessarily have it for ourselves. That is, of course, a matter which lies very near to the heart of the hon. member for Orange Grove. To-day we feel there should have been very much more frankness by this Minister when he came to Parliament with this Bill. We believe that this is one of the occasions where a lot of jumping to conclusions by us and other people outside could have been avoided had the Minister come to us with a White Paper explaining in great detail the objects and the provisions of this Bill. I think, for example, the hon. member for Sunnyside would perhaps not have been quite so confused in his approach to this Bill had there been a White Paper issued and made available not only to him, but also to this side of the House. For the reasons the hon. member for Orange Grove has given in his amendment, we object to this Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>The Opposition has seen fit to move an amendment to this legislation, which <span class="col_4377-4378" refersTo="page_0676"/>reads that &#x201C;this House &#x2026; declines to pass the &#x2026; Bill as it (a) further extends the powers of the Corporation without providing for any control by Parliament or scrutiny by the Auditor-General&#x201D;. The hon. members stated in their speeches how the control of this Parliament would now, to a larger extent, be curtailed by this Bill, and they mentioned as examples the powers of expropriation. I stated specifically in my speech &#x201C;in addition, it will only be possible to exercise these powers in any specific case with the approval of the Minister&#x201D;. If the Minister still has to grant his approval, then, when all is said and done, the Minister still remains responsible to this Parliament and has to report to this House on it, and then questions can be put to him in regard to matters of this nature. Now I should like to know where the control of this Parliament is in any way being curtailed in respect of these powers of expropriation&#x003F; In regard to free listeners&#x2019; licences, I stated that the regulations in terms of which it can be specified that a certain category of persons may receive free licences are not valid without the approval of the Minister. There is no curtailment in this case, either of the control of Parliament, for the Minister is responsible to Parliament; and the same applies to radio stations abroad. It will therefore be necessary for the Corporation to convince the Minister of the need and desirability of each proposal of this nature, and these powers can only be exercised with the approval of the Minister. But are the powers of Parliament being curtailed in any way by these amendments&#x003F; The Opposition cannot show me one instance where justification exists for the first part of their amendment, i.e. that the powers of the Corporation are being further extended without in any way providing for any control by Parliament or careful scrutiny by the Auditor-General.</p>

<p>Now. in regard to the Controller and Auditor-General and the request of the Opposition in this regard. This is not a matter that this amending measure now seeks to change. This is a matter for which provision was made in the principal Act of 1936. At the time the United Party Minister, the late Mr. Clarkson, introduced the measure in this way and had it accepted by Parliament in this way, that it should not be the Controller and Auditor-General who scrutinizes the accounts of the Corporation, but in fact appointed accountants, appointed by the Corporation itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<p>But the 1948 Commission did in fact recommend that it should be done.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That has nothing to do with it. The fact of the matter is that in 1936 the United Party Government made provision for that, and the position of Escom, which is also a utility company, is precisely the same as that of the S.A.B.C.&#x2014;the Auditor-General has no powers in regard to the accounts of Escom.</p>

<p>In addition the amendment states that the already inadequate information concerning the activities of the Corporation with the Minister is furnished to Parliament is being further limited. They mention the &#x201C;already inadequate information&#x201D;. The hon. member has, during the past year, since I became Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, asked me a great number of questions, and I did not withhold from him one single detail in regard to the affairs of the S.A.B.C. which he requested from me. What right has the hon. member for Orange Grove to talk of the &#x201C;already inadequate information&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member is trying to create a totally wrong impression now. After all, he knows as well as I that the loans which are made available to the S.A.B.C. by this Government are not made available under the Post Office estimates, but under the estimates of the Minister of Finance, and the occasion will arise when I shall have to give an account of those loans made to the S.A.B.C. The hon. member is trying to create a totally wrong impression. But since the hon. member for Orange Grove is talking about this&#x2014;and this is the important point&#x2014;have I refused to reply to one single matter raised by hon. members on the opposite side of the House on the affairs of the S.A.B.C. under the Post Office Vote&#x003F; But he knows that this is not the case, and that I have replied to everything. I accounted for everything in full. There is not a single question to which I did not reply. I want to say that I think the Opposition has in the past introduced many ridiculous amendments, but I think this one tops them all. for not a single word of this amendment is true. There is nothing in this amending measure they can produce to lend substance to their amendment. I have had&#x2014;and this is propably my fate and I shall simply have to endure it &#x2014;to listen to a great deal of nonsense from the hon. member for Orange Grove, but I have never listened to more arrant nonsense than he spoke here to-day on this measure.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove returned to the so-called gift as he called it, to Malawi by the S.A.B.C. and then he referred to words I used in the House in reply to his allegations, but the hon. member must at least try to listen to the tone of voice one uses when one is joking with him. But on 28th March the hon. member for Orange Grove put a question to me. He asked whether I had any knowledge of donations or cases of assistance rendered or the sale of equipment by the S.A.B.C. or the Post Office, amounting to R1,000, to countries beyond the borders of South Africa, or to bodies in such countries. I told him that I knew only of sales in the case of the Post Office. My reply on the matter was clear and unequivocal. After all, the hon. member for Orange Grove cannot now embroider on the <span class="col_4379-4380" refersTo="page_0677"/>information I gave him as recently as 28th March and say that I did not furnish him with the details. But he is coming back to the subject. (Interjections.) But I told him I only had knowledge of the Post Office. Now the hon. member is saying that he does not have the details to raise it under the Foreign Affairs Vote. But why does the hon. member not put the question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs&#x003F; Why does he not try to seek the information there&#x003F; I am not prepared to help the hon. member for Orange Grove, when he deliberately plays the ignorant, to help him in his ignorance. He knows better. He is too good a Paul Pry not to know what procedure he should follow in this House. More than anything else he is a Paul Pry. That is one thing he can do well, to pry and to thrust his nose into everybody&#x2019;s business. Must I go so far as to help the hon. member in this pastime&#x003F; I would fail hopelessly if I had to help him to pry about some more. I think that I shall still have to learn what he has forgotten about all the methods of prying.</p>

<p>A great deal was said about free listeners&#x2019; licences. This amendment arises from an amendment to the Radio Act which I still intend introducing this year and which will be introduced into Parliament soon, in terms of which the collection of radio licence fees will be changed. Certain things arose from that in terms of which it will no longer be necessary for the Post Office, which in fact acts as agent for the S.A.B.C. as far as the collection of these fees is concerned, to keep a register of radio licences; and since the 25 cent licences where the person pays only 25 cents, which can in fact be regarded as a free listeners&#x2019; licence, will not in future be collected by the Post Office, and it will as a result no longer be necessary for them to keep a register of this list, it is being left to the S.A.B.C. to keep a record of these free listeners&#x2019; licences, and to publish it themselves. This saves the S.A.B.C. the expense of paying agents&#x2019; commission, to put it like that, to the Post Office, and it will, in all probability, save those people who receive the free licences that 25 cents. That is one of the harmless changes which are being effected in regard to the free listeners&#x2019; licences, i.e. to authorize the S.A.B.C. to issue the licences itself. But the conditions under which they will be issued will still be determined by the Minister. The powers of the Minister are not being diminished in any way, and therefore the powers of control of this Parliament are not being diminished in any way. Consequently, all those ulterior motives which hon. members opposite see in this, do not exist.</p>

<p>No, but others did. The other harmless change is that provision is being made for free licences to be granted not only to educational and charitable institutions and hospitals, but also to deserving categories of persons. That is all that is being done, but apparently if one effects harmless changes like this, one is suspected of curtailing the control which Parliament has over these matters, etc. The hon. member for Orange Grove asked me to state to whom these 25 cent licences were being issued. I shall furnish the list:</p>

<block name="quote">1. To blind persons whose applications for such licences are supported by recommendations from associations for the care of the blind, acknowledged by the Board of Managers.</block>

<block name="quote">2. To needy invalids who find themselves in circumstances which the Board of Managers regards as justifying the issuing of a licence.</block>

<block name="quote">3. A person who is the husband or wife of, and lives under the same roof as the holder of an amateur radio station licence holder in terms of the Radio Act of 1952, which person must also be in possession of a listeners&#x2019; licence in order to obtain an amateur radio station licence.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am speaking under correction now, but I think that the number is plus-minus 4,500. I shall return just now, when I am replying to the hon. member for Port Natal, to the question of these licences. In regard to radio stations abroad, I just want to say that as the Bill provides, the S.A.B.C. is being authorized to erect radio stations. Now, the hon. member for Orange Grove is insinuating that provision is also being made for television stations here. He also put the question as to whether we would now find ourselves in the untenable situation that this hon. Minister is making provision for the erection of television stations for South Africa abroad, whereas we in South Africa do not even have television&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<p>I was only pulling the hon. Minister&#x2019;s leg.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, now it is simply a matter of leg-pulling. The hon. member said this in all earnest. What impression was he trying to create by doing so&#x003F; He was simply creating confusion by trying to create the impression that I now, for the first time, wanted to make provision here for the erection of television stations. However, the hon. member knows as well as I do that provision has already been made in the principal Act for the establishment of television stations. Provision has also been made for the establishment of such stations at home. This is quite <span class="col_4381-4382" refersTo="page_0678"/>obvious, because if I had omitted the word &#x201C;television station&#x201D; in this amending measure, that hon. member for Orange Grove would have shouted and carried on to such an extent that one would have been able to see his tonsils. He would then have imputed to me that I was engaged in the most sinister, the most secretive of activities. Of course, there is nothing to prevent him from creating the confusion, uncertainty and doubt on the other hand, with what he calls &#x201C;only a joke&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It may become desirable for the S.A.B.C. to acquire broadcasting stations beyond the borders of the Republic of South West Africa. I mention to you the reasons for strengthening and improving our overseas service. I have always thought that the Opposition was very strongly in favour of South Africa&#x2019;s point of view being represented abroad. If the reply to that is in the affirmative, what objection can the hon. Opposition then have to an improvement in our overseas radio service&#x003F; The B.B.C. has powerful short-wave transmitters on Ascension Island. Along the Ivory Coast the &#x201C;Voice of America&#x201D; radio stations have been erected for the reception and re-broadcasting of their programmes in order to strengthen their overseas radio service. So why cannot South Africa make the same provision&#x003F; But no, the hon. members on the opposite side must kick up a major fuss about this. The hon. member for Orange Grove cries out that Parliamentary control is being curtailed as a result of this, and that this is a dangerous Bill. When these steps are taken, that is the kind of thing we get from the Opposition side. The S.A.B.C., also in the interests of its domestic services I may add, may find it necessary to acquire transmitters beyond the national borders, for example in Mozambique or Botswana. The hon. member for Simonstown is trying to imply that we want to establish a radio station in Malawi, and that that radio station belongs to us. But did I not tell the hon. member in my introductory speech on what conditions we would establish radio stations abroad. Why should I repeat it now&#x003F; Did the hon. member not listen to me&#x003F; After all, I said that for the obvious reason that it was being established in another country, consent would first have to be obtained from that particular country through normal diplomatic channels. I also told him that this could not take place without the consent of the Minister. When I say &#x201C;without the consent of the Minister&#x201D;, then that is most certainly not without the consent of the Government.</p>

<p>A great fuss was made about the expropriationary powers. Escom has the same powers we are granting to the S.A.B.C. here. This is also in the interests of the improvement of our home services. After all, a radio service is a service which is undertaken in the interests of the country. The establishment of the F.M. network, with which we are still proceeding, includes the erection of transmitters on mountain peaks, to which access roads and power lines had to be laid on. The S.A.B.C. often experiences major problems in regard to acquiring the sites and the through-access roads to the sites on the mountains, because the owners charge quite exhorbitant prices in the knowledge that the S.A.B.C. is compelled to make use of the specific sites. I just want to mention two examples of cases like this. We had a case where a land owner, after prolonged negotiations, would not accept a price of less than R7,500 for a piece of land, 5 morgen in extent, which had officially been valued at R40 per morgen. His original price was R20,000. Eventually, however, it was sold for R7,500. After three years of negotiations the Corporation is still engaged in trying to persuade that man to allow a power line more than a mile long to be erected across his farm in spite of the fact that he has already been granted the right to take power to his house, as well as other concessions by the S.A.B.C.</p>

<p>In another case the S.A.B.C. was also denied the right to lay on power to the F.M. site across farmland unless power, at a cost of R15,000, was supplied to the farm owner as well. But surely this is a simply impossible state of affairs. Surely it is essential, and in the interests of the domestic services, that these rights of expropriation be granted to the S.A.B.C.</p>

<p>The S.A.B.C. did not have any such powers of expropriation. I now want to grant them this power here for the first time. After all, it can be deemed justifiable that the S.A.B.C. should be granted these powers. However, hon. members are forgetting that the S.A.B.C. must still convince the Minister of the desirability and the need for such an expropriation. Eventually they must also obtain his approval. Hon. members on the opposite side, however, are not stating that restrictions are being placed on Parliamentary control. Where do they get such statements from&#x003F; I shall not allow myself to be lured into a discussion of the principal Bill, because this is most certainly not the occasion for that. If the principal Act, which is not being amended in this respect, imposed a certain restriction in respect of domestic matters, which cannot be disclosed in this Parliament, then I am definitely not prepared to make any statement on that occasion; not on an occasion such as this where entirely different matters are being dealt with.</p>

<p>No, Sir. The hon. member for Port Natal referred to concessionary licences issued to pensioners, and he advocated that such licences should also be given to those who do not live alone. This matter was carefully considered b/ the Government on previous occasions, and although these people have my sympathy, it is simply impossible to accommodate them all. When the hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) raised this aspect at the right stage&#x2014;it should never have been raised under this Act&#x2014;I told him that we hoped to receive an increased revenue as a result of the change in the method of collecting radio licence fees, and that I could assure the hon. member that the matter would receive sympathetic consideration. We must also consider the revenue of the S.A.B.C.; that is obvious, because they also have their obligations which they have to meet, and that is also in the interests of the country.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member referred to the words &#x201C;other employees&#x201D; as they appear in the Bill. With the words &#x201C;other employees&#x201D; which have been inserted throughout the legislation, it is the intention to make it clearer that the S.A.B.C.&#x2019;s powers extend to all categories of its staff. This is not anything terrible or secretive as the hon. member for Port Natal suggested. In this definition Bantu employees are also included. At least, the S.A.B.C. is now able to allocate accommodation privileges to Bantu. I also want to inform the hon. member that if concessionary licences have to be allocated to these organizations for which street collections are held, it would be so wide that it would not be possible to lay down a fair criterion for issuing them. In any case, municipalities allow street collections to be held according to their own judgment and how should one now determine what organizations are deserving and what organizations are not&#x003F; The present criterion is in my opinion the best criterion, i.e. that concessionary licences are only allocated to organizations which have been investigated, registered and subsidized by the State. At the moment, however, we cannot take these concessions any further.</p>

<p>As far as insurance schemes are concerned, I just want to say to the hon. member that the corporation receives quotas on the basis of the regulation requirements of the corporation, and that it always complies with them. I think that I have replied to virtually all the arguments which were raised. I want to repeat: It is a pity that the Opposition, when we come forward with a measure like this one, should waste the time and the money of the House and the country through having made a poor study and through not having learnt their lesson, by moving a ridiculous amendment such as the one moved by the hon. member for Orange Grove.</p>

<heading>DEEDS REGISTRIES AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members will perceive from the long title of the Bill the principal object of the proposed legislation is to make provision for two matters. Firstly for the discontinuance of the procedure whereby documents relating to immovable property in a township in the area of the Rand townships registration office are registered also in the Deeds Registry in Pretoria, and secondly for altered procedures regarding the registration of transfer of land expropriated by, or by law vested in, the State or certain other bodies, and the transfer of any right of servitude or right to minerals so expropriated or vested.</p>

<p>Duplicate registration of deeds as far as it relates to immovable property in a township in the area of the Rand townships registration office in both the Johannesburg and the Pretoria registries has its origin in the Townships Amendment Act, 1908, of the Transvaal. The Rand townships registration office was established in terms of this Act, falls under the Department of Mines at present, and is for administrative reasons combined with the Office of the Registrar of Mining Titles.</p>

<p>Deeds registration is completely foreign to the objectives and functions of the Department of Mines. In fact, what it amounts to is that that Department is burdened with control over a section which in no respect has any connection with the primary functions of that Department. Consequently interested Departments are agreed that the Rand townships registration section, which deals solely with the registration of deeds, should be transferred to that Department under which all the other Deeds Offices fall, at present the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. Inter-departmental negotiations in regard to the transfer are already in progress.</p>

<p>Section 53 of the Townships Amendment Act, 1908, provides briefly that all documents, of any nature whatsoever, which relate to proprietary rights to land situated within any township in the mining district of Johannesburg, Boksburg and Krugersdorp (at present incorporated into the mining district of Johannesburg) can be registered either in the registry of the Registrar of Deeds, Pretoria, or in the registry of the Registrar of Rand Townships, Johannesburg. This necessitates the drawing up of said documents, which consist for the most part of deeds of transfer and mortgage deeds in triplicate, so that the registry at the one centre can submit a copy to the registry at the other centre for registration. In addition this implies that the offices in question must each notify the other of all transactions affecting said deeds. This is done in order to enable the various offices to make the necessary endorsements on the filed deeds in question and to make the requisite entries in the registers.</p>

<p>The application of the provisions of section 53, and the resultant procedures as explained, obviously entail tremendous duplication of work for both offices, something which ought to be eliminated in view of the manpower shortage in the Public Service. In this way, for example, no fewer than 14,999 deeds of transfer and 12,756 mortgage deeds (a total of 27,755) which were registered in one year in the Rand townships registration office were also registered in the Pretoria office.</p>

<p>A further aspect of duplicate registration is the question of the costs for the public of Johannesburg, as well as of Pretoria, but more specifically those of the former centre. Most transactions in the jurisdiction of the Rand townships registration office are first registered in Johannesburg, while a relatively small number are first registered in Pretoria. The prescribed conveyancers&#x2019; fee for the preparation of a triplicate copy of a deed amounts to R2, and in 1966 it cost the public in Pretoria R55,510 in respect of duplicate registration of deeds of transfer and mortgage bonds.</p>

<p>The said system of duplicate registration does not exist in any of the other registries, and the maintenance of such a system in respect <span class="col_4387-4388" refersTo="page_0681"/>of the area concerned is not considered to be in the public interest. Provision is therefore being made for the discontinuance of duplicate registration, with effect from a date to be determined. In addition provision is being made for incidental matters in regard to the Rand townships registration office as an independent office in order to effect uniformity as regards the appointment of Registrars, Deputy Registrars and Assistant Registrars, and the qualifications required for such appointments.</p>

<p>Apart from duplicate registration of deeds, a further anomaly has arisen there with the passage of years and as development in the Witwatersrand area took place, viz. that a number of townships are laid out in such a way that small portions thereof, or even a portion of an erven, is situated outside the boundaries of the area of the Rand townships registration office. This causes confusion with the registration of transactions in connection with those erven. It is desirable that the boundaries of the said area, as presently defined in paragraph (h) of the Second Schedule to the Deeds Registries Act, be amended to eliminate the intersection of townships and erven, and to correspond to existing surveyed boundaries. This matter has been investigated by the Surveyor-General and it has been found that only approximately 100 erven are intersected by the existing boundaries. Consequently it is being proposed that the latter erven be included in the area of the Rand townships registration office and that the description of the area in paragraph (h) of the Second Schedule of the Deeds Registries Act be amended accordingly. To prevent a similar problem being experienced in future, it is further proposed that section 49 of this Act be amended by providing that no township will be established or laid out or approved by the Administrator of the Transvaal unless the land which has to be included in the township is either situated entirely within or outside the area of the Rand townships registration office.</p>

<p>I should like to make it quite clear that the adjustment of the present boundaries of the Rand townships registration area is exclusively aimed at eliminating the present intersection of townships and erven, and as already indicated, only a few erven are concerned in the boundary adjustments. This step must not therefore be deemed to be an indication that my Department is in favour of decentralization.</p>

<p>In terms of section 31 of the Deeds Registries Act, the transfers of land which has been legally expropriated can take place by way of a deed of transfer which can be executed by the Registrar of Deeds concerned, i.e. without the person from whom the land has been expropriated playing any part in the transfer. Where a servitude on land or a right to minerals is expropriated, Section 32 of the Act provides, however, that the servitude or right to minerals must be registered by way of a notarial deed which must be signed by the owner of the land, or if he refuses to sign it or to authorize its signature, the deed must be executed by a nominee of the expropriating authority. Apart from the fact that no justification exists for the registration of an expropriated servitude or right to minerals having to take place in the first instance with the co-operation of an owner who may be unwilling or who cannot be traced, whereas this is not the case with land which has been expropriated, the procedure is clumsy and time-consuming.</p>

<p>The Railways Administration in particular has submitted representations for the simplification of the procedure which is at present being followed for the registration of expropriated servitudes, and is particularly concerned about the servitudes which are being expropriated in regard to the pipeline which is being constructed between Durban and the Witwatersrand via Richards Bay. Some of the properties between Durban and Richards Bay belong to numerous Indian owners, of which a few cannot be traced at all. This complicates the registration of the servitude rights according to proper survey charts. The latter is regarded as essential in order to prevent a repetition of what happened at Pietermaritzburg when the oil pipeline was damaged by the bulldozer of a building construction firm as a result of the fact that the situation of the pipeline was not specified by means of proper registration.</p>

<p>The registration procedure in regard to expropriated servitudes and rights to minerals have also been investigated by the departmental committee of enquiry into the simplification of work in the deeds offices, which proposed <i>inter alia</i> that section 32 of the Deeds Registries Act be amended to make provision for the registration of expropriated servitudes and rights to minerals by way of a deed which; can be executed by the Registrar of Deeds on the same basis as in the case of expropriated land. Provision is therefore being made for transfer of said expropriated servitudes and other rights by way of a deed of cession which has to be drawn up by a conveyancer and executed by the Registrar of Deeds. In addition provision is being made in sections 31 and 32 for authorization to be granted to the Registrar of Deeds to endorse an expropriation deed or expropriated servitude or right to minerals only against the registration duplicate of a title deed when a sworn statement is submitted to the effect that the transferee or cessionary, as the case may be, was unable to obtain the deed of transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House want to support this Bill. We cannot see any reason either for it being necessary that duplicate registration should take place on the Rand and in Pretoria. In view of the fact that the Government is experiencing a great shortage of officials, and cannot obtain the necessary officials, we will help them to facilitate registration in this way Consequently we support this measure.</p>

<heading>MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy-minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY-MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill contains a number of divergent amendments of the 1968 Marketing Act, and I shall consequently explain the various amendments point by point for the convenience of hon. members.</p>

<p>The marketing of meat, maize, dairy products, wheat and tobacco was, before the introduction of the Marketing Act in 1937, regulated by separate legislation which had been passed by Parliament. The Livestock and Meat Industries Control Board, the Mealie Industry Control Board, the Dairy Industry Control Board, the Wheat Industry Control Board, and the Tobacco Industry Control Board, all owe their establishment to this legislation. With the passing of the Marketing Act in 1937 special provision was made for the introduction of schemes under the latter Act in respect of the products for which the aforesaid boards were established. The Marketing Act provides that all provisions of the old Schedule Laws, as they were generally known, which were compatible with the provisions of published scheme for the products, should be suspended during the period in which such a scheme was in force. Shortly after the passing of the Marketing Act, schemes in respect of all the aforementioned products were introduced. Certain powers granted by the Schedule Laws, which were not embodied in the Marketing Act were incorporated into the schemes. Although the aforesaid laws were therefore suspended for the duration of the schemes in question, they still had a specific use in this respect that certain provisions of the scheme were derived from the aforesaid laws.</p>

<p>With the passing of years the Marketing Act has undergone a complete metamorphosis. The provisions of that Act have been expanded to such an extent that the provisions of the aforesaid schemes are now almost completely covered by the Marketing Act. In one case only, the imposition of a levy by the Meat Board, is the authorization of the scheme vested in the previous Act. This is the Livestock and Meat Industry Control Act of 1934.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the Schedule Laws have at present almost fallen into general disuse, it is now proposed that aforesaid laws should all be repealed and that provision should be made in the Marketing Act for the Meat Board levy, and for the re-introduction of the said control boards in terms of the various schemes under the Marketing Act. I should also like to bring it to the attention of hon. members that prior consultations were held with all the boards in question in this connection, and that they support the proposals. With the re-introduction of the said boards the opportunity also presents itself to simplify the former clumsy titles. &#x201C;Mealie Industry Control Board&#x201D; will for example be simplified to &#x201C;Mealie Board&#x201D; which corresponds to the name by which the board is known in common parlance.</p>

<p>The repeal of the Schedule Laws also entails that the Marketing Act will of necessity have to be adjusted in certain respects. Although these proposed amendments are for the most part of a technical nature, and I do not want to burden this hon. House with them, I do nevertheless want to refer briefly to the proposed repeal of section 27 of the Act. This section provides at present that if the Mealie Scheme should cease to relate to sorghum a separate scheme can consequently be introduced for sorghum and that a board other than the Mealie Board may implement such a scheme. The provision was originally included in the Act as a result of nature of section I (3) (f) and 8 (2) (d) of the Act, i.e. that sorghum is deemed to be the subject of the Mealie Control Amendment Act of 1935, and that the board which was established in terms of that Act, is also deemed to have been established in respect of sorghum. The Mealie Control Amendment Act of 1935 is one of the Schedule Laws, the repeal of which is now being moved, whereas section I (3) (f) and 8 (2) (d) will also have to be deleted in order to correspond with the proposed repeal. With the deletion of these sections the purpose of section 27 lapses, and there is no reason why it should continue in force. However, it in no way detracts from the existing legal machinery which will be required for the introduction of a separate sorghum scheme if it should subsequently be decided that the introduction of such a separate scheme is justified.</p>

<p>In addition the measure makes provision for the suspension of certain restrictions in regard to the imposition of a levy on a controlled product. Sections 41 and 44 of the Marketing Act grant a control board the power to impose a levy and a special levy on the product in respect of which such a board controls a scheme. Although these provisions are very generally phrased the application is however, considerably curbed by the restrictive nature of the provisions of section 42 which allows that a levy can only be payable by certain specified classes of persons. These restrictions on the classes of persons by whom the levy has to be paid has recently resulted in problems in that it is not always possible in view <span class="col_4391-4392" refersTo="page_0683"/>of the divergent nature of the various marketing systems, to confine the application strictly to the specified classes of persons. Since the sections must now be amended in any case in order to make an allowance in respect of the classes of persons who have to pay the Meat Board levy, i.e.&#x2014;(a) in the case of the uncontrolled areas, the abattoir owner who at the same time must receive a right of recovery from the butcher and the butcher in turn from the owner of the animal in respect of the amount of a levy paid; and (b) in the case of the controlled areas, the handling agent who brings the animals into the area, who at the same time must be granted the right to deduct the amount of a levy paid on the yield of the meat, it is now being proposed that all restrictions in the section on the classes of persons who can be required to pay the levy be repealed so that this class of persons can be prescribed in the schemes according to the circumstances peculiar to the regulations in respect of each separate product. The alternative of course is to prescribe specifically in the Act the various classes of persons, with reference to the various products, but it is felt that such a provision will not be in line with the other provisions of the Act which are all phrased in general terms.</p>

<p>The Act makes provision for the promulgation of a prohibition on the sale of a product unless it has been packed and stamped according to the grade prescribed by regulation. Such a prohibition applies at present in the case of meat which is sold in the urban areas of the Republic. The requirements in regard to the grading and stamping of carcases are being strictly enforced in these areas, but practical problems are being experienced in regard to the application of the prohibition in the case of meat cuts and portions of carcases which originated in adjoining territories or which are remains of meat which cannot be profitably exported or canned. This meat is at present being sold in the controlled area by means of public auction, under the supervision of the Meat Board. Such meat cannot be stamped in accordance with the prescribed grades, firstly, because meat grading in the uncontrolled area where it comes from is not compulsory, and secondly, because carcases which are intended for export cannot be stamped on the meat itself. Consequently this meat is at present being sold contrary to the aforementioned prohibition.</p>

<p>The only practical solution appears to be to exempt such meat from the operation of the prohibition until such time as a method can be devised to grade meat which is no longer in carcase form. However, the Act at present provides only that exemption can be granted when the product is sold by way of experiment. It is consequently being proposed that provision be now made for the exemption of a product which is sold under special circumstances, as is the case with meat cuts.</p>

<p>In a memorandum which was published at the same time as the Bill, a summary is furnished of the contributory causes as to why it has become necessary to obtain authorization for the imposition of a levy on uncontrolled products, and purposes for which the yield from such levy will be applied. Owing to the financial implications of the introduction a full marketing scheme in terms of the Marketing Act is not always justified from an economic point of view in the case of the lesser important industries. Although such industries cannot afford the prescribed marketing schemes, it does not necessarily mean however that such industries cannot in addition be assisted by way of a simpler and cheaper scheme. It is therefore being proposed that provision be made for a system by means of which it will be possible for the Minister and his Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing to adopt measures in regard to the production and marketing of uncontrolled agricultural products, and to obtain any funds which may be required in that connection by way of a levy from each such industry. The Department will administer a separate account on behalf of each industry concerned, and all payments in respect of the measures adopted in regard to the product concerned may be debited from it.</p>

<p>The purposes for which the fund may be utilized are deliberately being phrased in general terms in the Bill since it is not clear at this stage precisely which forms the measures will take, particularly as a result of the divergent marketing requirements of the different products. What is being envisaged for the most part however is to counteract the prejudicial effect of surplus conditions, with which certain industries are faced from time to time, by rendering assistance for example in regard to the removal of surpluses from the markets at an appropriate juncture.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. Deputy Minister quite rightly mentioned the original Marketing Act which was passed in this House in 1937. Since that time no changes as to the principle have as yet been made to that Act. As the hon. Deputy Minister also quite rightly said, the principal purpose of that Act was to afford farmers the opportunity of submitting certain schemes to the Minister and of affording the farmers a greater say in the marketing of their product. The principal aim was to effect price stability. For those products for which schemes were introduced, special levies were also imposed in order to combat expenses in regard to those products.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask for the privilege of the half-hour&#x003F; I have a large number of subjects to discuss with the hon. the Prime Minister this year and I intend to group them under four different heads. The first group will concern matters flowing from personal decisions taken by the hon. the Prime Minister as Leader of the Government. The second will concern what I regard as faults and weaknesses in the administration of certain Ministers, defects so serious that they demand the intervention of the head of the Government. The third will concern policy matters in respect of which there appears to be confusion in the ranks of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s party &#x2026;</p>

<p>And what about your party&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; confusion, I believe, induced by the lack of leadership by the hon. the Prime Minister. The last group concerns certain developments in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy in the field of foreign affairs.</p>

<p>The first matter I want to raise under the first head, that is matters flowing from personal decisions by the Prime Minister, has to do with international sport. Hon. members will recall that the hon. the Prime Minister outlined his policy in respect of international sport in two speeches early in 1967. Since I want to deal with the D&#x2019;Oliveira case and the subsequent developments arising from that case, I want to quote that portion dealing most pertinently with cricket. We find it in Hansard, Volume 20, at column 3994 in the English edition. Briefly, this is what the Prime Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member asked me other questions arising from the cricket question. There my policy remains the same as it is in regard to rugby. I am not going to prescribe to anybody, but the reservations which I added in that case apply in this respect as well, and I want to repeat them, i.e. that politicians must not intervene in the matter to impair relations between countries, that sport must not be dragged into politics in order to achieve some purpose or other and that it must not create difficulties for me at home. Those are the three conditions which I laid down. And if that should happen, I would have the courage of my convictions and would say to the country in question that I was sorry but that as a result of such and such an occurrence I would place my domestic relations, or I would place our international relations, above those of the sport and that I would then rather sever the sport relations.</block>

<p>That is perfectly plain and I emphasize those three conditions because of subsequent developments, because in effect I accepted them in column 3998. I dealt with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement and the Prime Minister interjected to say, &#x201C;With a proviso attached&#x201D;. I then replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the proviso attached that it might create internal disturbance and that it might create international incidents. I accept that. On that basis we would not play against them in any event.</block>

<p>There is no doubt that this statement led, and quite understandably, to the belief that an M.C.C. team, including the Coloured cricketer D&#x2019;Oliveira, would not be unacceptable to South Africa. Now we hear that by February, 1968, long before the team was chosen or there was any question of it, the Prime Minister had privately warned Viscount Cobham that D&#x2019;Oliveira would not be acceptable. If that warning had been given publicly, of course it would have meant that the team would not come as the M.C.C. had made it plain that they would not be dictated to. I must say at once that I was unaware of this conversation until I saw it reported in the Press. When I saw it reported in the Press, I took the trouble to telephone Viscount Cobham in England. He is an old friend of mine and he is an old friend of South Africa. His mother was a South African, and he is a man who is very well disposed towards us. I gave the hon. the Prime Minister an account, privately, of what was said in the course of that telephone conversation so it is no surprise to him to-day. Here is what he said, and I think it is as well that we should deal with it. He said that Mr. Vorster had never made mention to him, as suggested by <span class="col_4395-4396" refersTo="page_0685"/>Hennessy in <i>The Times,</i> that we might run a risk of violence if a white umpire were to give D&#x2019;Oliveira out. He says the Prime Minister never said that and he himself was never guilty of saying anything of that kind, nor had Mr. Vorster ever suggested to him that South Africans would be prepared, if necessary, to reimburse D&#x2019;Oliveira for any loss of earnings. He said there was no question of that; that is out of the question. He says that he never made it public that he had seen the Prime Minister; that he had merely said to Billy Griffiths, secretary of the M.C.C., privately that Mr. Vorster had said that D&#x2019;Oliveira would be unacceptable to the Government; that somehow this had leaked out, not from Viscount Cobham; that he was &#x2019;phoned by the <i>Daily Mail</i> at 12 o&#x2019;clock one night and asked whether he had seen Mr. Vorster; that he replied &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, but gave no further details of any kind.</p>

<p>I may say, Sir, that he wants to tender his apologies to the Prime Minister if he has embarrassed him in any way, because this is not his intention or desire. Sir, before dealing with the statement I want something else to be very clear indeed, and that is that I am satisfied from the facts, in so far as they are available to me, that the coaching offer to D&#x2019;Oliveira, of which we are hearing so much to-day, was neither sponsored nor inspired by the Prime Minister and his Government or by the South African Cricket Association. I accept that unequivocally. Sir, my concern with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s action lies in a different direction. I want to know and I think the public of South Africa wants to know, because this story of the interview with Viscount Cobham is now public property&#x2014;it has been published in the Press and the warning has been published in the Press&#x2014;what caused the Prime Minister to give this warning to Viscount Cobham, as I believe he did early last year. I want to know which of the three conditions that he laid down operated in this case.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am quoting from col. 3994 of Hansard, vol. 20. The Prime Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that politicians must not intervene in the matter to impair relations between countries;; that sport must not be dragged into politics in order to achieve some purpose or other, and that it must not create difficulties for me at home.</block>

<p>Those were the three conditions. Which of those could have applied in February, 1968, to cause the hon. the Prime Minister to make that statement&#x003F; It is true, D&#x2019;Oliveira had played during that English winter in a series of test matches in the West Indies where he had not done very well; the series against Australia had not yet started and it was very uncertain whether he was going to be selected. What would cause the hon. the Prime Minister to make that statement&#x003F; I think the public is entitled to know which one of those provisions he felt applied and why he thought it necessary to make that statement. I feel that the Prime Minister also owes it to the public to tell us what he told Sir Alec Douglas Home. Did it differ any way from what he told Viscount Cobham&#x003F; We have heard that the M.C.C. preferred the advice of Sir Alec Douglas Home to that of Viscount Cobham, but we do not know exactly what took place. Sir, this brings me to another point, and it is that all this is important because there is an allegation in a publication which is known to the hon. the Prime Minister &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, I raise this more in sorrow than in anger because I am one of those who are very anxious to see that the New Zealand rugby tour comes off. I think the time has come for us to have a clear and unequivocal statement from the Prime Minister.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You have had it in both senses of the word.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There is one sense in which I have not had it, that is quite <span class="col_4397-4398" refersTo="page_0686"/>clear, but maybe the Prime Minister has had it. The other thing is this. We must get absolutely clear, there must be no doubt at all, what the position is in regard to the New Zealand rugby tour next year. That is the first thing I want to raise with the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The next matter I want to raise under this head concerns an apparent administrative decision as a result of which it would seem that the secret services of the army, the navy and the air force will now be removed from the control of Defence and will be placed under the charge of the hon. the Prime Minister himself. I see the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote includes an amount of R4 million plus for secret services, while military intelligence is down to R39,000 from R830,000, but the Police Vote under the head is up to R1 1/4 million. This means there is going to be a big increase on what is spent upon secret services. It means they are going to be under the control of the Prime Minister. What I want to know and what the public want to know is whether all security and intelligence agencies are now under one central control. We understand Defence intelligence is now controlled by the Prime Minister who is also controlling the security police who previously were under the Minister of Police and whose vote is still provided for under the Police Vote. Secondly we want to know the reasons for this vast increase, we want to know the reasons for this change, and we want to know also whether they are carried out with the approval and support of the Minister of Defence and the chiefs of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, there are many examples in other parts of the world of intelligence services falling under the chief executive, but they have not always been so happy, because intelligence services operating externally sometimes resulted in foreign involvement. Those foreign involvements can be pretty awkward indeed if the intelligence service concerned is controlled by the chief executive and not by a Minister other than the chief executive himself.</p>

<p>I have been dipping into some books on the activities of intelligence agencies. One concerns the Central Intelligence Agency in the U.S.A. I quote here from &#x201C;The Central Intelligence Agency&#x201D; by Andrew Tully, page 57, where he deals with the revolt of the French generals. Here is what they write&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The evidence indicates that there were C.I.A. operatives who let their own politics show and by doing so led the Challe rebels to believe that the U.S. looked with favour on their adventure. Here again, C.LA.&#x2019;s critics could draw up their favourite indictment that America&#x2019;s super-secret intelligence organization was over-eager to get mixed up with policy-making operations. The indictment, perhaps, should be drawn up only against those operatives, na&#x00EF;ve and politically ignorant, who could not resist taking a detour from pure intelligence to dabble in King-making. But the responsibility for keeping such people in hand rests at the top. When that responsibility is not exerted strenuously Moscow has a propaganda carnival, as it did with the revolt of the French generals.</block>

<p>Then there is another passage in that book which is significant. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The arrangement was questioned by Admiral Ernest J. King in March, 1945, when the Secretary of the Navy asked him what he thought about the proposed C.I.A. King admitted he saw the logic of such an organization, but suggested it had inherent dangers. He said he did not like the possibility that a central intelligence agency might acquire power beyond anything intended. This, he said, raised the question of whether such an organization &#x201C;might not threaten our form of government&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Then there were other critics who pointed out that intelligence might get mixed up with politics. If one looks at the history of the C.I.A., even after the Second World War, one finds that they have been involved in many external adventures. There was the Algerian generals&#x2019; revolt; there was trouble in Guatemala; there was the overthrow of Mossadeq; there was the prevention of a revolt in Jordan; there was an attempt to prevent one in Iraq; there was the position in Egypt with Naguib, and then Nasser; there was the Hungarian revolution. So I could go on. There is no doubt that they were involved. What worries me, and I think the public as well, is that something of this kind might happen in which the Prime Minister himself will be involved. I think what we want from him is an assurance that it is not the intention that this central control will result in involvement outside South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I have a third issue under this head which I want to raise with the hon. the Prime Minister. Last year, when the Prime Minister was still Minister of Police as such, he caused the Police, in this case the Security Police, to investigate the origin of two pamphlets which were called &#x201C;smear pamphlets&#x201D;.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>One, not two.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I accept it. The hon. gentleman says one. It was distributed evidently by enthusiastic young Afrikaners who were apparently disappointed in the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s departures from some of the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policies. The whole matter gave rise to a great deal of comment in the Press. Hon. members will be familiar with the facts. It is not necessary for me to go over them again. As a result, I asked the hon. the Prime Minister three questions through the Press. I asked the hon. gentleman, first of all, what alleged crime were the Police instructed to investigate&#x003F; What charges, if any, have been laid&#x003F; Is it usual or desirable for <span class="col_4399-4400" refersTo="page_0687"/>the Minister concerned, in this case the hon. the Prime Minister as Minister of Police, to reveal the identities of the suspects before they have been charged, and if charged, before they have been brought to trial, and to attack them at a public meeting for political actions without specifying any crime of which they may be guilty&#x003F;</p>

<p>Before I deal with the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s reply, I do want to deal with just one other item of news which appeared at the same time. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to the political correspondent of a Cape Nationalist paper, the names of the pamphlet writers have been handed by Mr. Vorster to Nationalist leaders. The paper quoted Mr. Ben Schoeman, Leader of the Nationalist Party in the Transvaal, as saying this week that Mr. Vorster had disclosed the names of the pamphlet writers to him and that a decision had been reached on how to act against them.</block>

<p>I see the hon. the Minister of Transport sitting there. I take it this is correct&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Sir. Now, the hon. the Prime Minister replied to me and said that this investigation, in fact, was nothing unusual, that the first pamphlet had purported to come from communist or fellow travellers, and that while investigating this matter, the Security Police became aware of the identity of the writers of a second pamphlet. They, in fact, came and revealed their identity to them.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister said that the second pamphlet was investigated because of a mention of the State President.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p><i>Inter alia,</i> but it was not even necessary to investigate it, as I told the publishers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. They admitted that they were responsible for a pamphlet. This was the reply of the hon. the Prime Minister which was published in <i>Die Transvaler</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The suggestion that he had made public the identity of the suspects was nonsense. In so far as these names had been made public, this was done by the people themselves or by certain newspapers.</block>

<p>Did the hon. the Prime Minister not reveal these names to the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<p>That is not making it public.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>So it is not public if it is revealed to the hon. the Minister of Transport. I see, the hon. the Minister of Transport has the right to know before people are charged. This is the point I was getting at. The hon. the Prime Minister says it was not made public. However, it was revealed to the hon. the Minister of Transport.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>So what&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Transport is also Chairman of the Nationalist Party of the Transvaal. It was revealed to him in order to decide what steps should be taken against them by the Nationalist Party of the Transvaal, and not what State action should be taken against them, not whether they should be prosecuted or not. This was used for party political ends, and not for the administration of justice. That is the point I am trying to make.</p>

<p>After that appeared in the newspaper I replied to the hon. the Prime Minister; I think it is worth-while having that in some detail. I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Even a casual glance at the letter shows that it is simply another move in this elaborate and rather boring display of shadow-boxing between verkramptes and verligtes in the Nationalist Party. Mr. Vorster surprises me. He dealt expertly with underground sabotage organizations, but he allows himself to be fooled by some youngsters who distribute an anonymous leaflet outside a Pretoria cinema in connection with the film &#x201C;Million Dollar Brain&#x201D;. The youngsters with their tongues firmly in their cheeks praised the film, because it showed co-operation between the Russian and Western Secret Services to prevent an atomic war. Applying this example to South Africa the youngsters asked why the terrorists on the country&#x2019;s borders should be resisted when the whole matter could be settled by discussion.</block>

<p>Need I read any more&#x003F; What absolute nonsense this is! Who could take a pamphlet like this seriously&#x003F; It is investigated by the Security Police. What for&#x003F;</p>

<p>With regard to the second pamphlet, the following also appeared in the article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Vorster&#x2019;s explanation of the second smear letter distributed on the eve of the prorogation of Parliament, contains a reference to the State President.</block>

<p>This was my reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is an offence to criticize or ridicule the office of the State President. But are we to understand that the phrase which appeared in the letter constitutes criticism or ridicule&#x003F;</block>

<p><span class="col_4401-4402" refersTo="page_0688"/>The phrase which appeared in the letter reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be clear to all sober-minded South Africans that our present State President was right when he said years ago that South Africa could not always swim upstream against world opinion, because it does not accord with our live-and-let-live policy.</block>

<p>Is that criticism&#x003F; I think it was a very sensible remark the hon. the State President made before he was State President. Is this the reason for the Police being called upon to examine this document&#x003F; I have raised this matter before and I have raised it again, because of the dangerous implications arising from this sort of action. This was criticism of the hon. the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Nationalist Party. This is not the first time the Security Police have been given surprising tasks. Hon. members will remember that the Security Police were called upon to investigate when the <i>Sunday Times</i> published information they got from certain documents which appeared to originate from Broederbond sources. What happened&#x003F; They confiscated the documents and these documents have never been handed back. However, they were perfectly legally in the possession of the <i>Sunday Times</i> and no charge has been laid at any time. Why were they used for this purpose&#x003F; I can give other examples. I must say that I very seldom find myself in agreement with Mr. S. E. D. Brown, in fact very seldom indeed! [Interjections.] My friend says that we are not bedfellows. I do not think that we are even in the same dormitory, as a matter of fact, I do not think that we are even in the same building. This is what he has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Once the party in power utilizes the Security Police to keep its political opponents under surveillance, the Security Branch becomes not only a political weapon, but also an instrument of oppression.</block>

<p>What has been the upshot of all this&#x003F; The upshot of all this has been that many people of all shades of opinion in South Africa have rejected the explanation which was given by the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of this investigation. I think it is right that he should know this. What I want and what the public want, is an assurance that the activities of the Security Police will be limited to matters affecting the security of the State and the safety of South Africa. We also want to be assured that their activities will be directed against the enemies of South Africa, and not the opponents of the Nationalist Party or the opponents of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The fourth matter I want to raise has to do with the position of the hon. member for Ermelo. I am very sorry that he is not in his place this afternoon. The Prime Minister has dropped him from his Cabinet without a public word of thanks, as far as I have been able to ascertain. He dropped him from his Cabinet last year and ever since he ceased to be a Cabinet Minister, the hon. gentleman has kept his counsel and has not responded to the questions in the minds of the people, which have been posed from all sides in South Africa.</p>

<p>Last Monday in this House the hon. gentleman broke his silence. I must say it was an astounding speech. It was astounding, because until recently he enjoyed the confidence of the Prime Minister as a member of his Cabinet, and, if one were to judge from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s silence since Monday, he still enjoys his confidence. It must be one of the most grievous blows to the ideal of national unity; certainly the most grievous blow since I have been in this House. I do not ask the House to accept my judgment on the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. Holding the position I do, I shall no doubt be regarded as prejudiced. Therefore I shall call a witness; a witness who by all standards should be prejudiced in the favour of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Party.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am very grateful and I hope I shall not have to make too much use of the time of the House.</p>

<p>I call the editor of <i>Die Burger</i> who analysed the speech of the hon. member for Ermelo, not immediately, but only on the following Wednesday after he had had ample opportunity of considering the implications of the speech very carefully. In that article he saw the speech as establishing a dividing line between &#x00E9;lite Calvinist Afrikaner Nationalists and incurable English Nationalists who should always be suspect because of their alleged susceptibility to leftist influences. The editor of <i>Die Burger</i> in his leading article, described such a categorizing and labelling in our broader national life as being as inaccurate as it was pernicious. He found it regrettable that a Nationalist politician could have been seduced into such action which he described as contemptuous insinuations against the English-speaking community which deserve repudiation with contempt rather than serious consideration.</p>

<p>It would be difficult for anyone to condemn the speech of the hon. member in more stringent terms than those which I have referred to. This is how a prominent Nationalist newspaper saw and heard what the hon. member for Ermelo has said. I know that he has given an explanation. I really do not think it helps him very much. Sir, while <i>Die Burger</i> has spoken out, the Prime Minister has remained <span class="col_4403-4404" refersTo="page_0689"/>silent. He has told us many times that he wants national unity in South Africa. I wonder whether he could be happy when one of his front-benchers differentiates between an Afrikaner &#x00E9;lite and incurable English who must always remain suspect. If <i>Die Burger&#x2019;s</i> judgment is right, the Prime Minister can be true to his protestations only if he repudiates and denounces the speech of the hon. member for Ermelo.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister is the Chief Executive of the Government and the Leader of his Party. Can he lead the nation if he cannot lead the political organization which has raised him to the highest political post in South Africa&#x003F; Leadership as South Africa expects it, implies not only that loyalty is demanded from those who follow you, but also that you are loyal to them as well. If <i>Die Burger</i> is wrong, and if there is nothing wrong in that speech, why then has the hon. the Prime Minister not spoken up in defence of the hon. member for Ermelo&#x003F; I do not think he can reconcile the responsibilities of his leadership with the attitude of <i>Die Burger</i> on this issue and at the same time condone the sentiments of the hon. member for Ermelo. Not only his followers in this House and outside, but also the people of South Africa have the right to demand from the hon. gentleman that he should have the courage to tell us where in his view the truth lies&#x2014;with the hon. member for Ermelo or with the leading article of <i>Die Burger.</i></p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am rising to deal at once with certain matters raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. With some of the points he raised I can deal later and tell him why I am doing so.</p>

<p>Because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised the D&#x2019;Oliveira question first, I got the impression that he regarded it as the most important one. [Interjection.] I am speaking to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition now. When I want to speak to the Deputy Leader I shall draw his attention to that fact. As far as this matter is concerned, I have stated my point of view very clearly and unequivocally. It stands recorded in the Hansard from which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition quoted. In fact, I do not think I left any doubts as to what my standpoint was, because if I had in fact left any doubts in regard to my standpoint, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would have asked me to clarify them, and he would have insisted on further replies. I must assume, therefore, that when we originally discussed this matter, we considered all its consequences.</p>

<p>I do not want to repeat everything I said on that occasion, but I laid down the following as one of the basic premises: After I had referred to the traditional sport relations between Britain, the British, and South Africa, I stated most clearly that we had never in the past, and that we would never in the future either, play the role of selection committee for Britain or for any other country, for the moment one tried to do that, one destroyed those sports relations immediately. Because no country in the world is going to allow one to act as its selection committee in advance. Surely that is clear to all of us assembled here. I laid that down as a principle.</p>

<p>I now want to say at once that neither the Government nor I, nor the cricket people, as far as I know, and I think I know everything there is to be known about this matter, have played the role of selection committee for Britain in this regard, just as&#x2014;and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows far more about cricket than I do&#x2014;we did not for one moment play the role of selector for Britain in the days when Subba Row&#x2014;and the hon. member can perhaps mention the names of many more people than I can&#x2014;as a black man was at the peak of his cricket career and was omitted from the team which came to South Africa. We did not at the time, either through the Government or through the Cricket Association, say to these people that they could not, or should, bring this man to South Africa. Those people, taking into consideration the particular sport relations which existed between them and us, took that decision themselves.</p>

<p>In the first place now, I want to confine myself to the first fact, which is that neither the Government nor I adopted any official standpoint towards either the British Government or the M.C.C. as an organization in this connection. It is perfectly true that Lord Cobham saw me, not at my request. It is also true that I saw him for a few minutes, from 2 p.m. to 2.15 p.m. until the bells of this House rang. It is true that we spoke about cricket. It is equally true that I spoke to Sir Alec Douglas-Home, again not on my own initiative, but on his, and that he discussed cricket matters with me. Now I want to make it very clear that Lord Cobham told me that he was a former president of the M.C.C.&#x2014;the hon. the Leader can correct me if I am mistaken&#x2014;but was no longer associated with the organization.</p>

<p>Home and Cobham both.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and they are no longer associated with that organization. I want to make it very clear that neither of them was competent to speak on behalf of the cricket organization or did speak on behalf of that organization. They spoke to me as private individuals. As far as these talks are concerned then they were personal, private conversations between gentlemen, and it has never been my policy to divulge personal, private conversations between gentlemen across the floor of this House, to newspapers or to any person. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition may take it amiss of me now if he wants to, and hon. members opposite can <span class="col_4405-4406" refersTo="page_0690"/>take it amiss of me if they want to, but I do not intend to deviate from that principle. I repeat therefore that no official communications whatsoever went out from either the Government or the Cricket Association in South Africa, not as far as I know from the Cricket Association and certainly not from the Government. What did in fact happen&#x2014;and this is common knowledge; every member of this House knows it, and every person outside knows it&#x2014;was that this person was not chosen and that a political uproar broke out in Britain. I want to state this very clearly once more, and I challenge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to deny this: If D&#x2019;Oliveira had been a white man and had not been selected, that uproar would not have taken place. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has a different standpoint on this matter, he must tell me, because I say that he cannot have a different standpoint. Nor does he have a different standpoint. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also knows what things were all brought into the D&#x2019;Oliveira issue at the time, and that is why I adopted the standpoint I did in fact adopt, and I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that I accept full responsibility for that standpoint which I adopted in consultation with the Minister of Sport in Bloemfontein after we had discussed the matter. I said on that occasion that the team which was coming to South Africa was no longer a sports team, that it was no longer the team of the M.C.C., but that it had become the team of Sanroc and the political enemies of South Africa. For that reason, as I had said here in my speech in this House, I had the courage of my convictions to declare in public that under those circumstances this team, with D&#x2019;Oliveira included, would not be welcome in South Africa. I want to go further, Mr. Chairman. I believe that what I said at Bloemfontein I was saying not only on behalf of my people, but on behalf of most people in South Africa, including the people of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Consequently I want to say to him that I accept full responsibility for having, as a result of events which I do not want to elaborate on now&#x2014;if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to do so, he may do so, and other hon. members will reply to that further&#x2014;adopted the standpoint (and this remains my standpoint) that I will not play the role of selection committee for any country, but that if these conditions I laid down are prejudiced in any way, in whatever sport it may be, I shall act in the same way as I acted before. Let there be no doubt about that. While we are on this subject, I want to say that I made it very clear in that 1967 statement of mine that sport here in South Africa would be practised separately by our inhabitants, and would continue to be practised separately. There must be no misunderstanding about that, and I want to make it very clear that if any other country, or the representatives of any sport, want to put it to us as a condition that they will only maintain sport relations with us provided we allow mixed sport here in South Africa among our own people, then those sports relations will immediately be broken off. There must be no doubt about that either.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me what my standpoint was in regard to a rugby team from New Zealand which included Maoris. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows the reply to that as well as I do, because I have stated my standpoint in public on a number of occasions. In fact, I have stated it here in Parliament, and what I said in Parliament I repeated on a number of occasions outside and at my congresses. It is as follows: We have on previous occasions had New Zealanders with Maori blood in this country who came to play rugby here. I said that such persons would come here again. I said that eight such persons had been here before. I have the names with me here and I can mention them if it should be necessary. Such persons will come here again, and we shall receive them in exactly the same way as we received them in the past. These are the sport relations we have with New Zealand, and they not only satisfy us, they satisfy New Zealand as well. I do not know on what grounds the hon. Leader has now raised this matter in Parliament. Has he raised it here because he wants to stir up trouble in this connection&#x003F; Surely the hon. the Leader is aware, and this has been mentioned in the newspapers, that no problem exists between the South African Rugby Board and the New Zealand Rugby Board.

The hon. the Leader is also aware of the fact that leftist elements in New Zealand are doing everything in their power to wreck this tour, and anything which we may now say in this debate is going to be grist to the mill of those people who would like to wreck the tour. That is why I am concluding that aspect of the matter &#x2026;</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Pinelands now wants to know something about <i>Veg,</i> let me tell him this. The editor of <i>Veg,</i> together with the son of the Leader of the Opposition, is addressing a meeting to-night, and he can attend it and ask his question there. I really do not feel myself called upon to occupy myself in this Parliament with such slander and gossip. If the hon. <span class="col_4407-4408" refersTo="page_0691"/>member takes pleasure in doing so, then he can take all the pleasure in doing so that is necessary. I say that we shall serve no purpose in discussing these sporting matters any further at this stage, that is to say, if we really have the interests of the sport relations of South Africa at heart. I would for example not have taken it amiss of the hon. the Leader if he had discussed the New Zealand question if there were any snags in this regard between our Rugby Board and theirs. I did not interfere in this matter, because it is a rugby matter. If there were snags between them, and it was my fault, or the hon. the Leader thought it was my fault, then I would not have taken it amiss of him if he had raised the matter here. But knowing full well that there are no problems or difficulties whatsoever, I cannot understand why the hon. the Leader should have raised the matter here. I am proceeding to the next point.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader asked me about the question of secret services. In the first instance he quite rightly pointed out that the amount was much larger now, i.e. a little over R4 million. But if the hon. the Leader had looked at the Estimates he would have seen that this amount includes the salaries, vacation bonuses, etc., of the staff in question. This is not an amount which is hanging in the air. But now the hon. the Leader has the right to ask me why the number of people receiving remuneration is not mentioned there. My reply to him is that it is not customary to do so, because the moment one mentions the number of people one may just as well proclaim from the rooftops what kind of organization this is, that is, if you are going to make known its staff. For that reason I do not deem it advisable or in the interests of public safety to do so.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we understand. For the sake of the record I just want to say that last week already I offered to furnish the hon. the Leader of the Opposition with information on this matter. He then preferred not to be informed before this debate. He said that he would prefer to be informed after the debate. [Interjections.] No, there is nothing in connection with that. That was the hon. the Leader&#x2019;s standpoint, and I accepted it as such. I told the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that he would understand that I would, for security reasons, say as little as possible across the floor of this House. That is why I am in fact going to say as little as possible.</p>

<p>But I want to reply to the questions which the hon. the Leader put to me. In the first instance he asked me what the reasons for the increase were. I have just informed him that the reason for the increase is that the salaries of a large number of people are included in that, but I am not prepared to say how many people, because it is not customary to do so. The hon. the Leader asked me the reason for the change that has been made in this regard. Now, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will know that previously we had a combined or umbrella organization as far as these matters were concerned. In practice it did not work as one would have wanted it to, for reasons which I need not go into now. That organization has been disbanded. In its place a new organization has been formed. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Durban (Point) will remember that I said, on the occasion when the announcement in respect of General Van den Bergh was made, that the Security Police would continue to fall under the Police. We devoted a great deal of attention to this matter. The Minister of Defence, the Minister of Police and I discussed this matter in all its consequences for days on end. The different spheres of the police organization, the Military Intelligence Section of the Defence Force and this organization of General Van den Bergh have been properly demarcated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F; Do the Security Police in fact serve under General Van den Bergh or not&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The answer is no. The Security Police do not serve under General Van den Bergh, in the same way as members of the Military Intelligence Section do not serve under General Van den Bergh. That proper demarcation of functions was made, and the Military Intelligence staff fall under the Commandant General, while the Security Police fall under the Commissioner of Police. General Van den Bergh&#x2019;s organization is an independent one. Each, as I have said, has its own functions. That is as far as I am prepared to go at this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me whether this new set-up had met with the approval of the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Police and the heads of those departments. My answer is yes. To tell the truth, attention has been given to this matter since 1960 already, when an interdepartmental committee was appointed, the chairman of which was the present Commandant General. I anticipate that this new dispensation can only be of advantage to South Africa. I want to put it to the hon. House, and I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me, that in view of the threat hanging over our heads, and in view of the time which lies ahead for us, the aggregate amount which is being requested for Defence, Police and this central organization under General Van den Bergh, is little enough to pay for the security of South Africa, definitely little enough. We are making a start with a new organization here. As such, everything must be purchased for it, and therefore I want to state quite candidly to this House that we have, under the circumstances, estimated on the generous side, and that a portion of the amount will in all <span class="col_4409-4410" refersTo="page_0692"/>probability remain, money which will not be spent. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to put further questions to me on this matter, I shall gladly give him any further information he desires.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the State Security Organization, the State Security Bureau.</p>

<p>I now come to the next point raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He had raised this matter when I was still Minister of Police, because this happened when I was still Minister of Police. I am referring here to the pamphlet which appeared at the time, a pamphlet which purported to be from a communistic or communistically inclined source. The pamphlet was anonymous. I received the pamphlet a few days after it appeared in Pretoria. Upon receiving it I immediately got into touch with General Van den Bergh. He was in charge of security in Pretoria at the time. I asked him whether he knew anything about the pamphlet. It was my intention to direct him to investigate the matter, but when I asked him about it, he said that he not only knew about it, but had received one himself, the one that was marked for his personal attention. He had received it the day after it had appeared in Pretoria. In any case, when I got in touch with him in connection with the pamphlet, he was already instituting an investigation in order to determine from what source that pamphlet had derived. Consequently it was not necessary for me to direct him to investigate the matter. However, let me make it very clear that if General Van den Bergh had at that stage not yet instituted an investigation, I would in fact have directed him to do so. Let me also make it very clear to this House that I accept full responsibility for everything that happened in connection with that pamphlet. I accept full responsibility for that. In any case, General Van den Bergh had the matter investigated and traced the writer of the pamphlet. I am talking about the first pamphlet now. As far as the second pamphlet is concerned, I have already stated in public that it was not necessary for General Van den Bergh to investigate this pamphlet. It was not necessary for him to ascertain who the writers of that pamphlet were, because the writers of the first pamphlet told him who the writers of the second pamphlet were. They gave themselves away the moment they were interrogated. But as far as this second pamphlet is concerned, the House would be interested to know how it happened to be posted in Stellenbosch. I am only mentioning this because the hon. member mentioned the name of Mr. S. E. D. Brown here. The second pamphlet purported to have come from Stellenbosch. It was posted here. In fact, the impression the pamphlet wished to create was that it had originated in Stellenbosch. In actual fact it had been drawn up in Pretoria and had been duplicated there. It may interest the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to know what one of the writers of the second pamphlet said in a sworn statement in regard to the matter. After they had drawn it up in Pretoria their problem was, so he said, to get it here to the Cape so that the impression could be created that it had originated in Cape Town or Stellenbosch. They deliberated upon this problem a great deal. In his sworn statement he says&#x2014;i.e. a certain Mr. S. F. van Huyssteen&#x2014;that after three weeks had elapsed and they had still found no way of getting the pamphlets to the Cape they turned as a last resort to Mr. Brown of <i>The Observer,</i> because they were aware that he had lived in the Cape for many years and might know someone there who would be able to post the documents. He and another writer, a Mr. Van der Merwe, then in fact turned to Mr. Brown and put their problem to him. He undertook to help them. Mr. Van Huyssteen said he subsequently took the pamphlets to Mr. Brown and the next he heard was that the pamphlets had been posted here in Cape Town.</p>

<p>So what&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not I who raised this matter; the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did. If this proves embarrassing for the hon. member for Yeoville among his new friends, Mr. Brown and others, I cannot help it. In all fairness I just want to say that Mr. Brown claims that Mr. Van Huyssteen is lying; he did not receive the pamphlets, knows nothing about them, and did not undertake their consignment either. They will have to settle among themselves who is telling the truth and who is not telling the truth.</p>

<p>As far as this matter is concerned, the position therefore is that this was a pamphlet purporting to have derived from a communistic source. The matter was investigated by the Security Police on their own initiative. If they had not done so themselves, I would have directed them to do so. Without any need for the origins of the second pamphlet to be investigated, the writers of that pamphlet came to the attention of the Security Police through information supplied by one of the persons concerned with the first pamphlet. It is true that those people were called in. They were asked whether those were in fact the first persons, and they said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. They all made statements to that effect. Of course, I not only told my colleague the Minister of Transport, I also told my other colleagues. Why should I have omitted to do so&#x003F; I do not know what point the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to make in that connection. I want to repeat that I mentioned no names to the Press. These names appeared in the Press, and in particular they appeared in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> for a very good reason. The reason is that, in spite of the cloud of dust kicked up in this connection, there is in fact a very close information tie-up between Mr. Barry Botha, who was the writer of one of these pamphlets, and Mr. Serfontein of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> That is <span class="col_4411-4412" refersTo="page_0693"/>why the names appeared in the newspapers in the first instance. It did not come from me. It did not come from one of my colleagues, and it did not come from the Police. I now want to repeat to hon. members on the opposite side that if any pamphlet appears in South Africa purporting to be of communistic origin, such a pamphlet will be investigated here in South Africa, whether hon. members on the opposite side like it or not. Hon. members simply have to accept that. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition deduces from that that the Police were used in regard to political matters here, that is simply not the case. He also tried to put up an argument with reference to the Broederbond documents. Does the Leader of the Opposition not know that we were dealing with stolen documents in that case&#x003F;</p>

Was it wrong for them to have done so&#x003F; Was it wrong for them to have solved the case&#x003F; I want to make it very clear now that in my time any matter could be investigated by any policeman. This will also be the standpoint of the present hon. Minister of Police in future. Whether hon. members on the opposite side like it or not, makes no difference to me. And if hon. members see anything sinister in that, as though a member of the Security Police is an untouchable who may only be used in certain circumstances and not under other circumstances, I want to say to hon. members on the opposite side that the fact that they are able to sit in this House to-day, in this tension-free atmosphere which prevails in South Africa, is owing to the Security Police, among others, and it is by no means fitting that hon. members should throw stones in that connection. I repeat therefore that this matter was investigated because the pamphlet purported to have derived from communistic sources and, secondly, a charge was laid in connection with the other documents, which is why the Security Police took action.</p>

<p>The reply of the hon. the Prime Minister on the other matter is unsatisfactory in a number of respects. I raised the matter of the conversations between the Prime Minister and Viscount Cobham and the conversations between the Prime Minister and Sir Alec Douglas Home because they have become public property. It is not he who made them public property. I accept that and I respect his desire that such conversations should, if possible, not be discussed over the floor of this House. But the tragedy is that they have become public property and certain deductions have been made from them. That is the difficulty with which I am faced, because I believe I am probably more anxious than the hon. the Prime Minister that we should have the New Zealand rugby tour.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister will hear in a moment. The Prime Minister says there are no difficulties between the South African Rugby Board and the New Zealand Rugby Board. I accept that. And there were no difficulties between the S.A. Cricket Association and the M.C.C. Nobody expected any trouble at all. What is worrying is that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s interpretation of the three conditions he laid down was such that in February of last year he was already prepared to say that D&#x2019;Oliveira was unacceptable. The hon. member for Innesdal is reported, in the journal to which the hon. the Prime Minister does not like referring, as having said that the Prime Minister gave him the assurance last year, before there was any question of D&#x2019;Oliveira being selected or not, that an M.C.C. team with D&#x2019;Oliveira would not be acceptable and also that no Maoris would be acceptable. Sir, I want the Prime Minister to deny that or the hon. member for Innesdal to get up and say that he never said that; because already there <span class="col_4413-4414" refersTo="page_0694"/>is trouble brewing in New Zealand as the result of what has happened, and we have seen this tragic position that the trade unions have now proceeded to choose sides.

That is why I raise the issue. The hon. the Prime Minister, replying to the hon. member for Pinelands, said that if he wanted to know anything about theft he could attend the meeting to be addressed by Mr. Barry Botha and my son at Stellenbosch this evening. Sir, my son is chairman of an organization at Stellenbosch called Aktuele Aangeleenthede. The fact that he is chairman does not mean that he associates himself with the views of Barry Botha. [Laughter.] They ask speakers of all types of political parties to address them. The Prime Minister left the wrong impression and I think it is right that that impression should be corrected. They might even ask the Prime Minister. That would not suggest that my son agrees with the Prime Minister. I am sorry that we have to leave this question of international sport on this basis. I think the Prime Minister had an opportunity&#x2014;I raised it to give him an opportunity &#x2014;to remove any possibility of the use of arguments which people opposed to this tour might use.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister does not seem to realize that we know the Minister of Planning very well indeed. That has been his tactics over the years. Let him make his own speech.</p>

<p>There is a second reason why I am unhappy. The Prime Minister has told us that General van den Bergh is now in charge of the State Security Bureau, but police security remains under the control of the Police. As I understood the difficulty outlined at one time by the General himself, when he was under the Minister of Police, his worry was that police security and what was then Military Intelligence had not been co-ordinated. There was a case called the Plotz Case, and we were told that had the information which Military Security had at its disposal been made available to the Police, the arrest might have taken place two years earlier and the Harris bomb outrage might have been avoided. Have we overcome this difficulty by means of the new arrangement&#x003F; That is what we want to know because it does not seem to me that we have avoided the very difficulty that existed at that time.</p>

<p>Then comes the third issue, and that is the question of the use of the police in respect of what has been called the &#x201C;Smear&#x201D; letters. The Prime Minister says he did reveal those names; he revealed them to his colleagues.</p>

<p>I accept that entirely. That makes it worse. That is exactly my point. It was not revealed to him in his capacity as a Minister, to decide whether there should be a prosecution. That would still be understandable. It was revealed to him as a politician, as chairman of the Nationalist Party in the Transvaal, to decide what political action he was going to take against them. I say the Prime Minister had no right whatever to do that, because the moment the Prime Minister does that, then I am entitled to accuse him of using those police for political reasons and not for security reasons. Sir, the hon. gentleman has told us that in an excess of zeal, he sought to instruct General van den Bergh to investigate that first letter. Well, Sir, it is a matter for his judgment. I can only say that if our Security Police are to be used to investigate tripe like that, then they can have very little to do in South Africa and that it is going to be an awful waste of time.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to dwell on this matter any longer. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition touched upon a large number of subjects here, but I think it apposite to deal with one matter at a time, and therefore I think it fiting for us first to settle the matter which he raised here initially in connection with sport. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows as well as any sportsman in this country, and as well as any member in this House, how delicate the sport relations between South Africa and other countries have become, and not because of our standpoint. I think that, to a greater or lesser degree, the Opposition agrees with our standpoint on sport within the country itself. These sport relations have become delicate as a result of the efforts of hostile elements abroad, elements making use of the field of sport not only to get at the National Government but also to get at South Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of that and for that reason I cannot understand why he raised this matter in this spirit to-day, levelling the reproach at the hon. the Prime Minister that he has not acted in accordance with the declared sport policy as enunciated here by him two years ago. If one takes a look at the D&#x2019;Oliveira case and at events which followed upon the action taken by the hon. the Prime Minister when it had become clear that D&#x2019;Oliveira was eventually included with a political motive, one is struck by the comment of a prominent person in the South African cricket world, Mr. Wallie Hammond, the chairman of the Cricket Association at the time. What was his comment&#x003F; The policy had been laid down by the Prime Minister, and what had happened was precisely in accordance with the policy statement of the Prime Minister, he said. In other words, at the highest level in cricket circles, outside political circles, there was the greatest degree of clarity about what the policy statement of the Prime Minister embraced in respect of international sport, and cricket in particular. But what was the reaction of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on that occasion&#x003F; His reaction was not to see how we could best serve the sport relations between South Africa and the outside world, but once more to see whether he could not fish in troubled waters, because on that occasion the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s comment was that the hon. the Prime Minister had put his foot down against an M.C.C. team containing a D'Oliveira, &#x201C;because he wanted to obtain the support of the verkramptes&#x201D;. That was the comment of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. When people in sporting circles are satisfied and agree that the Prime Minister acted precisely in accordance with his policy statement, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must try to make political capital out of these matters, because he is not going to succeed in making any; he is going to lose by it. We also deplore the efforts of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to complicate relations with New Zealand, which have proceeded very well, as the Prime Minister said. From all sides there is proof of excellent co-operation between our Rugby Board and theirs in order to make a success of the tour, and we therefore deplore the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made an attempt in this connection too this afternoon to gain some temporary political advantage from this matter.</p>

<p>Sir, was it we, the Opposition, who indicated that the M.C.C. was not welcome in South Africa, or was it the Prime Minister&#x003F; When the Prime Minister makes a statement which affects the sport of every citizen of South Africa, surely it is not only the right but also the duty of the Opposition to try to give the hon. the Prime Minister <span class="col_4417-4418" refersTo="page_0696"/>an opportunity, as my Leader did, to try to clear the air. And what has happened&#x003F; Instead of clearing the air, the hon. the Prime Minister has evaded the issue. He was asked a specific, unequivocal question: Did he state in advance, well before the question of the selection of a team ever came up, that D&#x2019;Oliveira would not be welcomed in such a team&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister&#x2019;s answer was that he stood by his three conditions. Is his reply then an unequivocal &#x201C;no&#x201D; to the question whether at any time prior to the selection of the team, he indicated to anyone, whether it be the information conference at Pretoria or anyone connected directly or indirectly with the M.C.C. that D&#x2019;Oliveira would not be welcome&#x003F; In that case I ask him to repudiate the hon. member for Rissik who was reported in <i>Die Beeld</i> to have said in the course of a speech that there would be no sport between Whites and non-Whites in South Africa; that there would be no mixed sport between our own players or between South African teams and foreign teams&#x003F; Does the hon. member deny that he was reported as having said that&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member repudiates <i>Die Beeld.</i> Sir, to my recollection that was about August of last year. Why has that hon. member not repudiated <i>Die Beeld</i> before&#x003F; This is an ascertainable lie. This should have been reported or repudiated, but that hon. member has stood silent. He remains silent and allowed the verkramptes to believe that he stated that there would be no non-White in any foreign sporting team and he has remained silent about it until to-day, the 21st April, almost one year later. He has allowed that impression to stand for the whole time since the appearance of that report. He now says that <i>Die Beeld</i> incorrectly reported him. I hope the hon. member will get up and say what he in fact said.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal was reported in <i>Veg</i> and in the <i>South African Observer.</i> but the Prime Minister has not repudiated those reports. I specifically ask the Prime Minister to repudiate those reports to the effect that at the information conference of the Nationalist Party in Pretoria, he gave an undertaking that there would be no non-Whites in visiting teams to South Africa. This we want clarified in a clear and unequivocal repudiation. These reports were repeated in other newspapers and I believe the Prime Minister owes South Africa an answer.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to another aspect raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, namely the question of the Secret Service. The hon. the Prime Minister said that the reason for the increase in the vote was that it included salaries and allowances. The vote in regard to military intelligence has gone down from R830,000 last year to R39,000 for 1969-&#x2019;70. Did this amount not include salaries and allowances&#x003F; The Police Vote has gone up from just over R1 million to R1,218,000 for Secret Services. This Police Vote for 1969- &#x2019;70 has increased from R1.8 million, and the total, including Bantu Secret Services, to R5.3 million. Salaries were surely included before. They must have been included under Military Intelligence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was not included and you know it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, the R830,000 was over and above salaries in the case of the Military Intelligence vote under Defence. The hon. the Minister then asks us to accept that an increase from R1.8 million to R5.3 million is due basically to the inclusion of salaries of Military Intelligence personnel which now falls under the Bureau for State Security. This means that our military forces must have had a very hefty Military Intelligence, because more than R3 million was paid out as salaries for Military Intelligence personnel.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You were talking about R39,000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The vote has dropped from R830,000 to R39,000 in respect of the Military Intelligence Service. The Prime Minister said this did not include salaries. In other words, R800,000 was the vote for Secret Services excluding salaries. That means that R2,200,000 must have been spent on Military Intelligence salaries if there has been no major increase. This does not make sense. I cannot believe that our Military Intelligence personnel were drawing salaries amounting to approximately R2 million per annum. I asked the hon. the Minister of Defence a question in regard to the take-over. The hon. the Prime Minister then took that question over from the hon. the Minister of Defence. I wanted to ask the hon. the Minister of Defence whether he had made representations in regard to this matter and whether this Supreme Command and those concerned with Military Intelligence were satisfied. The hon. the Prime Minister said that the matter was discussed for days and that they were all satisfied. This does not agree with the information I have. My information is that there was, and still is, extreme dissatisfaction in military circles over the take-over. I ask the hon. the Minister of Defence specifically whether he had received any complaints or any reaction or any criticism from his own forces and particularly those concerned with Military Intelligence in regard to this matter. The indication is that there are even people talking about resigning because of their dissatisfaction over the take-over.</p>

<p><span class="col_4419-4420" refersTo="page_0697"/>There are various other aspects about this matter which I do not want to deal with because of my lack of time, but there is one matter I think I must refer to. I would like to get on record that the hon. the Prime Minister regarded the first smear letter as a serious communist document. He regarded it seriously enough &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes. In other words, the hon. the Prime Minister took the letter seriously. He regarded it as being a possible communist document. Those of us who read it, and I think everyone who read it laughed at what was obviously written with tongue in the cheek because it was a humorous document. We must now accept that our Prime Minister regarded that document as serious enough to warrant investigation by the Secret Police. If that is the judgment of the hon. the Prime Minister and if he can take an obvious lighthearted childish prank like that as a serious communist threat to the security of South Africa, we must have some doubt about the judgment he will apply to the division of responsibilities between the Bureau of State Security, the Security Police and Military Intelligence. The hon. the Prime Minister is the person who in discussion has divided the responsibility. He regarded a childish prank as being sufficient of a security threat to use the Security Police. Is that the judgment which is to be applied to the division of responsibility between Military Intelligence, the new Bureau of State Security and the Security Police&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down suggested in the first part of his speech that the attempt the United Party made to discuss sporting affairs this afternoon, was not, in the first place, a blatant attempt to drag politics into sporting affairs and, in the second place, to try to gain a few votes here this afternoon through this thing we call sport. This is not the first time hon. members on that side of this House have tried to drag politics into sporting affairs. On various occasions we pleaded with and asked them that the administration of sport and the whole matter of sport be kept out of the political arena. For record purposes I want to say that I know of five occasions on which those hon. members blatantly tried to drag sport into the political arena. Sir, you will remember what happened during the general election when the hon. member for Wynberg wanted to make political capital out of the establishment of the Department of Sport and Recreation. We all know what happened then and I do not want to repeat here what she said at that time, because it has often been repeated in this hon. House. Sir, you know how the hon. member for Karoo&#x2014;and I am glad to see the hon. member back in this House after his illness&#x2014;responded the first time we discussed this Department of Sport and Recreation in this House. We know how the hon. member for Yeoville behaved when the Additional Estimates were discussed on a subsequent occasion when we gave that hon. member the title of &#x201C;sportsman of the year&#x201D;. We know what the response of hon. members opposite was when my hon. Leader made a statement at the beginning of the year in connection with the D&#x2019;Oliveira case. All these things simply go to show that, when dealing with this delicate matter of sport, we should confine ourselves to things of real importance. When considering the positive steps taken by this Government in this connection, one has to pay a tribute to the leaders of this young nation of ours. I cannot fail to point out once more that the Department of Sport and Recreation was established by this Government. It was my Leader who framed a formula for future generations, a formula as regards our participation in international sport. I make bold to say that future generations will also pay tribute to my Leader for having drawn up this formula by means of which he has placed international sport on the basis on which it should be. What did we have here this afternoon&#x003F; We had a blatant attempt openly to drag a matter such as the tour by an All Black team across the floor of the House, a matter in connection with which we are having no problems at present and a matter in connection with which there was only the finest co-operation between our own sporting authorities and foreign sporting authorities. This is getting under the skin of the hon. member for Durban (Point) now, and he cannot contain himself and now we have this blatant attempt &#x2026;</p>

<p>As regards international sport, all the nations of the world can benefit such a great deal by making the best use of our international sporting bodies. But, as my hon. Leader has put it, it depends on the course the world wants to take. Does the world want to use sport as a means to create goodwill, harmony and fellowship among the nations of the world or does it <span class="col_4421-4422" refersTo="page_0698"/>want to exploit sport for political gain and use it as a platform for the world&#x2019;s political agitators&#x003F; As far as this side of the House is concerned, it will always approach sport and the practising of sport, international sporting affairs and sporting relations in the right spirit. That is why we have the right to say to our young men, &#x201C;Put back into sport that what you got out of it.&#x201D; To our older sportsmen we can say: &#x201C;Practise sport in such a way so that you will always remain the heroes of the younger generation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has simply repeated what the hon. member for Stellenbosch said, i.e. that we are trying to drag sport into politics. But it was not us who did it. It was the Nationalist Party: the Prime Minister, Nationalist Party speakers and pro-Nationalist Party publications, which brought this matter to a head. Nobody can say that the <i>Observer</i> and <i>Veg</i> are United Party publications. On the contrary, they claim to be the true Nationalist Party. [Interjections.] I will not waste my time on that supid interjection. The point I want to make is that there were good relations between the sporting bodies. But these relations were harmed by political statements. The hon. member should know that the Leader of the Nationalist Party leugbond in the Transvaal a month or so ago had a copy of the Loskop speech by Dr. Verwoerd printed and circulated. Why&#x003F; Why should he have chosen the Loskop speech, which was a blatant statement that mixed sport would not be allowed in South Africa, a policy which has been modified by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is not so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The Loskop speech by Dr. Verwoerd set out a completely different policy to that of the hon. the Prime Minister, quite different. [Interjections.] Well, then I do not know what words mean. If the Prime Minister can say that his policy in regard to sport and that contained in the Loskop speech are the same, then words have lost their meaning. The Nationalist Party Youth Chairman of the Transvaal did not take the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech on sport and circulate that to the Nationalist Party youth; he chose the Loskop speech to print and circulate. Therefore tiiis matter has become a matter which we want clarified from the Nationalist Party. The Prime Minister has made his stand clear, and members of his party and publications have given a different slant. I repeat the question: I think we are entitled to ask whether the Prime Minister gave any assurance to his Pretoria information conference. We have had no word from the hon. members involved and this is a matter on which we are entitled to demand a clear and unequivocal statement.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the question of security. I want to come back to the question of the division of responsibility. My Leader asked a clear and unequivocal question when he asked whether the new Bureau of State Security would have any foreign involvement, what was its relationship to foreign involvement. It was a clear and specific question.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Other countries have open organizations. In America the C.I.A. have almost a village, they have a building housing 10,000 openly known workers of the C.I.A. alone. The world knows about it and we are now going to be the secret boys who are going to say: &#x201C;No, we are not going to have foreign involvement,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Yes, we are going to have foreign involvement.&#x201D; Because, if the answer is no, then who is going to deal with foreign information&#x003F; If the answer is yes, then what is going to be the link that will prevent the sort of clash which happened in America between the F.B.I., C.I.A., and Military Intelligence&#x003F; If the Prime Minister has studied the record he will find that things were so bad in Korea that General McArthur is alleged to have refused to make any military intelligence whatsoever available to the C.I.A. who were responsible for foreign intelligence. The clash between the military and C.I.A. came to a head at great cost to the campaign of the U.N.

<p>We have the Prime Minister&#x2019;s word for it that this will not happen. But in reply to questions we had assurances from the Prime Minister when he was Minister of Police, as well as from the Minister of Defence at the time, that there was complete co-ordination. I am talking about the time of the Plotz affair. We were told there could be no clash. But when there was an inquiry into the matter we found that the police and military intelligence were in fact at loggerheads and that information had not been passed. The hon. the Prime Minister remembers the incident. I do not want to deal with the details. It was ridiculous that this information should have been available and not co-ordinated. If that could happen when we had assurances that the machinery was available, can we be blamed if we question whether the position is going to be better now, when Military Intelligence is, to my knowledge, unhappy about the situation that has now developed&#x003F;</p>

One must just say: &#x201C;It is a strange world we live in &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>I did not query the Police Vote, I queried the Secret Services Vote in the Police Vote. That was the Vote that I referred to. Not the Police Vote as a whole but the Police Force Security Services specifically. I want to ask the Prime Minister to give his attention to some special compensation for those of our police who are securing the safety of our country on and outside our borders. The present position is that a man who is killed in Rhodesia or Angola, or where-ever it may be, or who is injured, gets ordinary workman&#x2019;s compensation, the same as a workman who is injured in a workshop accident in any Government Department. He gets the ordinary Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act award which, I believe, is an inadequate compensation, even for normal peace-time duties. Surely those who serve our country in the security field, protecting our lives and our future, are entitled to more than that if something should happen to them. I know they get a field allowance. But if something should happen to them their families, or they themselves if they are injured, should get more than simple workman&#x2019;s compensation. I plead with the hon. the Prime Minister that he, as a matter of national policy, should ensure that members of the police and the army, if they are serving South Africa and as a result of that service are killed or injured, get from the nation the tangible material compensation which we are able to give with our wealth. We should not deal with them as we would with an ordinary workman who has hit his thumb with a hammer or who has lost a foot through an accident. This is one group of our security forces which I believe should get a better deal from South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have never yet encountered a member who can misunderstand and misread as the hon. member for Durban (Point) can. I want to tell him that he should study Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s Loskop speech very carefully and then compare it with the policy statement on sport which was made here by the hon. the Prime Minister. He must also compare it with the statement which the Prime Minister made in Bloemfontein when the inclusion of Dolly had become an actuality. If he does that, he will find that there is no difference between the policy statement of Dr. Verwoerd and that of the hon. the Prime Minister. [Interjections.] That is so.</p>

<p>In addition, I want to refer the hon. member to the standpoint which he adopted here. He repeatedly asked the hon. the Prime Minister whether the latter had, before the time, adopted a standpoint about whether D&#x2019;Oliveira could come or not. The Prime Minister stated very clearly here that he had adopted no official standpoint towards any official British cricket body.</p>

The Prime Minister said very clearly that he did not lend himself to that.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>I was not present at that information conference. I am now speaking about the statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader said here that that statement was now &#x201C;public property&#x201D;, if I may put it like that. But who is now making it public property&#x003F; It is the hon. the Leader who is making it public property. Let me now ask the hon. the Leader and the hon. member for Durban (Point) this. I want to know something from him and from the hon. member for Durban (Point). The hon. the Leader of the Opposition issued a statement immediately after the Bloemfontein meeting at which the Prime Minister had made his statement. The Leader of the Opposition said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement in Bloemfontein makes nonsense of his previous statement about his Party&#x2019;s policy concerning South Africa&#x2019;s international sport relations unless (he added an &#x201C;unless&#x201D;) he has irrefutable proof that the selection of D&#x2019;Oliveira to replace Cartwright was motivated by political considerations, and not by cricket ability. While he was apparently prepared to accept the good faith of the M.C.C. Selection Committee when they originally excluded D Oliveira, it would now appear as if. is hinting that they gave way under political pressure.</block>

<p>This is precisely what I want to mention here. The Leader of the Opposition implied that he would have been satisfied with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement, provided the M.C.C. had given way to political pressure. But he did not believe that this was the case. I now <span class="col_4425-4426" refersTo="page_0700"/>want us to investigate the matter a little. Let us see what the position in Britain was. Eighteen months before the M.C.C. team was chosen, Operation D&#x2019;Oliveira was already under way under the auspices of the anti-apartheid organizations, which included certain members of the Wilson Cabinet. As long ago as that the way was being paved for the tour to be cancelled if D&#x2019;Oliveira was not chosen. That was common knowledge.</p>

<p>But let us investigate the position in respect of D&#x2019;Oliveira himself. What was this man&#x2019;s position and what was his cricket ability&#x003F; D&#x2019;Oliveira himself is a batsman and a bowler. He had been on a tour through the West Indies and in Pakistan. It is admitted that he was not a successful bowler on the hard wickets.</p>

<p>No, I am merely giving the proof. During the last West Indian tour he took only three wickets and had a bowling average of 97.66 runs per wicket. But what happened then&#x003F; The M.C.C. decided to select a team and exclude Dolly. I am not a selector, but I do want to quote to hon. members what the chairman of the Selection Committee, Mr. Doug. Insole, said. This was published in the <i>Daily Mail</i> on 29th August, 1968. He spoke in reply to a question by a certain Fred Labuschagne. The report reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Doug. Insole said bluntly last night, we have the bowlers we want. Thus D&#x2019;Oliveira had to be lined up as a batsman next to players like Colin Milburn, David Green, Alan Jones and at least half a dozen others.</block>

<p>That is what happened. [Interjections.] No, the hon. member must not be ridiculous. Can he not understand&#x003F; This man is a bowler, but he is not even considered as a bowler. He was considered as a batsman. Here the chairman of the M.C.C. Selection Committee stated that he could not even be considered. Then the team was announced. Let us hear what Dolly himself said when this Fred Labuschagne telephoned his home that night to find out what he had to say. He could not even speak over the telephone, so great was his disappointment. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">A friend who answered the telephone at his flat told me, &#x201C;You must excuse Dolly. To-night he had been so sure of realizing his dream of playing in South Africa that he had booked passages for his family to coincide with the tour&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It seems to me as if this man was brought under a completely wrong impression, probably by the leftist organizations, that he would, in fact, be selected, but what happened when he was not selected&#x003F; A tremendous dispute broke out in Britain. A storm broke loose.</p>

<p>The whole matter suited the purposes of the anti-apartheid bodies. A deputation was sent to the British Government and held discussions with the Minister of Sport. He declared that he himself was &#x201C;speechless&#x201D; about the fact that D&#x2019;Oliveira had not been selected. Cowdrey, the captain of the team, made a statement and gave the British public the assurance that the team had been chosen according to cricket ability. The M.C.C. were accused and severely criticized for having allegedly yielded under political pressure from South Africa. The anti-apartheid bodies said the tour should be cancelled. But what happened then&#x003F; A specialist bowler, Cartwright, who had been chosen, suddenly became unfit for some reason. There was then a vacancy in the team and this extraordinary event took place. A man who was considered for his batting ability &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, Sir. Let us just look at what a British newspaper had to say. This is not what I say, it is what the <i>Daily Express</i> said. It had the following to say: &#x201C;One cannot get past the fact that the M-C.C. yielded to pressure from agitators who are seeking political gain in respect of race relations in South Africa&#x201D;. That is what the <i>Daily Express</i> had to say. But in the light of all those circumstances, in the light of what happened, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition still asked the Prime Minister to afford him proof of political motives. Did he perhaps want sworn statements&#x003F; Is he that naive&#x003F; I am pointedly asking the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the House: If the Leader of the Opposition had been Prime Minister under those circumstances, would he have allowed that team to come or not&#x003F; The hon. member for Port Natal would have said that the team should come, not so&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am very glad to hear that. But I am very sure that other members of the Opposition would have acted exactly as the Prime Minister did, and would, under those circumstances, not have allowed themselves to be dominated and dictated to by anti-apartheid bodies in Britain. It is for that reason that he did not allow the team to come. But I again ask hon. members, and the hon. member for Durban (Point) as well, whether, under those circumstances, they <span class="col_4427-4428" refersTo="page_0701"/>would have agreed with the view of Dennis Brutus.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall be coming back to deal with what the hon. member for Pietersburg has said; but I first just want to deal with one or two matters on the way. I was very glad, incidentally, that he did not repeat the accusation made by two members that the United Party was trying to make political capital out of this matter. I want to remind them that the hon. the Prime Minister himself at the time he made his speech in Bloemfontein on the 18th September of last year, said:</p>

<block name="quote">We on our part, very correctly, said nothing whatever, and I want to thank our politicians, editors, writers and sportsmen for not saying anything about the issue at the time.</block>

<p>Nor have we on this side of the House said anything since, that I can recall. Now, however, during the last week certain facts have broken. We are giving the hon. the Prime Minister an opportunity to clear the air and help ensure that this tour from New Zealand takes place. So much for that.</p>

<p>But then we had the statement from the hon. member for Pietersburg that the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy in regard to sport is identical with that of the policy of the late Dr. Verwoerd. If I understood the interjection from the hon. the Prime Minister himself, this, indeed, was what he was maintaining. This, surely, is a most staggering proposition. How well do I not remember banner headlines in <i>Die Burger</i> at the time of the Loskop speech &#x201C;Maori&#x2019;s kan nie kom nie&#x201D;. And how well do I not remember the equally big banner headlines in <i>Die Burger</i> after the statement by the hon. the present Prime Minister, &#x201C;Maori&#x2019;s kan kom&#x201D;. If we wanted to have it any clearer, we surely have it in the words of the hon. the Prime Minister in this House when he made his sports statement. When he dealt with the question, he set out the various conditions which he made in allowing touring sides to choose their own teams. He went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">I want to make it quite clear, however, that if politicians take a hand in the matter with the object of clouding relations between countries or of dragging sport into politics, as they did in 1963, or of creating domestic-difficulties in that way, I would not hesitate to adopt the attitude adopted by my predecessor at Loskop.</block>

<p>It is perfectly obvious that it is a very different attitude.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the hon. member for Pietersburg. He defended the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attitude. In doing so he inevitably had to cast a serious aspersion upon the M.C.C. I believe that this is where the hon. the Prime Minister himself made a mistake. Let us assume that things happened as they did. We know that towards the end there was a certain amount of a howl, partly by people who are our political opponents, when D&#x2019;Oliveira was not chosen. That is perfectly true. There was a howl partly by them, but partly by sincere people who felt that he had been left out wrongly. When that had happened, it would have been perfectly possible for the hon. the Prime Minister to have said that in view of this whole situation, he in terms of the third condition which he had placed, namely that this could create difficulty for him with his people in South Africa, can no longer accept the M.C.C. team. The hon. the Prime Minister thereby would not have had to cast any aspersions on the integrity of the M.C.C. and their selectors. However, this is what he did. The hon. the Prime Minister cast quite unnecessary aspersions upon them in suggesting that they had allowed themselves to be overborne by these anti-apartheid movement bodies and the Sanroc body and that they dictated the selection of the M.C.C. team. That was quite unnecessary for the hon. the Prime Minister to have said. I suggest that that has greatly harmed us in our cricket relations, in our position in international sport and in our relations with a friendly country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>On that opportunity I will do so, because now I want to deal with a certain matter which I think is most relevant. [Interjections.] The hon. the Prime Minister, backed by the hon. member for Pietersburg, has said that it was impossible for the M.C.C. to come because the left-wing movements have made a hullabaloo. He has also said in his speech to-day that there are many left-wing movements in New Zealand at the moment which are making a hullabaloo. Can we be certain that a distinction will be drawn between a tour of the M.C.C. and the tour of the All Blacks, because the same people are making the same trouble&#x003F; They should be no more influential than the other people. Are we to understand from the hon. the Prime Minister that as a result of this, he is going to take up the same attitude as in regard to D&#x2019;Oliveira&#x003F; I think it is most important that the hon. the Prime Minister should give us answers on various points we have made. That is the reason why I do not want to concede my time. I should like to know why we have not had a clear denial by the hon. the Prime Minister of what has been reported in <i>Veg.</i> I am referring to the account which was given in the February 1969 issue of <i>Veg.</i> Everybody else who has spoken here has spoken about the information congress. According to the report in <i>Veg</i> it was at the time the sports policy was formulated and accepted, in April, 1967, that the hon. member for Innesdal and certain other members of the Nationalist Party caucus spoke to the Prime Minister and got an assurance from him that neither D&#x2019;Oliveira nor the Maoris would come as members of their respective teams. It is absolutely essential that we should get a denial in this regard, because it clearly complicates the position in regard to the New Zealanders. In the light of the unwillingness of the hon. the Prime Minister to reveal his side of the story in regard to Lord Cobham, I should say that he makes it doubly complicated. It is all very well for the hon. the Prime Minister to say what he said when he stated his point of view. Those confidential communications have been revealed to a cer-1 tain extent and it is on record that the hon. the Prime Minister apparently indicated that D&#x2019;Oliveira was not acceptable &#x2026; In the light of that situation and in the light of the situation as outlined in <i>Veg,</i> which has not been clearly denied, I can well imagine that this could raise complications for us and cause the New Zealanders to be unhappy about continuing, up to the very point of embarking, to come to South Africa. Therefore I sincerely hope that the hon. the Prime Minister will reflect upon those matters and that he will give us a clear repudiation of what has been reported in <i>Veg.</i> If that statement of <i>Veg</i> of February, 1969, stands, this is a heinous defamation upon the hon. the Prime Minister. It is a heinous defamation upon the hon. the Prime Minister and I have no knowledge that the hon. the Prime Minister has denied this. I have no knowledge that he has issued summons or is contemplating it against <i>Veg</i> in view of that statement. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I shall do it, if the hon. the Prime Minister is willing to give categorical answers on the questions which I have put to him. The United Party attitude in regard to this matter was initially made clear by my hon. Leader who said that he would leave it to the cricket bodies. He also made it clear in the debate to-day that he would in fact have had those same three conditions which were imposed in the debate. I feel quite confident that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would have taken the view that he would not impugn the integrity of the M.C.C. selectors, that he would have had the courage of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s original convictions and would have said that South Africa was big enough and able enough to handle a visit of that kind.

<p>I have followed this sports matter for many months and I would say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the tone he adopted in this House was far more subdued than the one he adopted outside and in the Press, and I want to tell him why. When it was announced that the M.C.C. team would not come here because of D&#x2019;Oliveira, this was the sort of language the Leader of the Opposition used, compared to what he said in this House to-day. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Vorster should have kept his nose out of sport.</block>

<p>I did not hear him say that to-day. To-day he said he agreed with the three guide lines that the Prime Minister had laid down, but then he said Mr. Vorster should keep his nose out of sport. He referred to &#x201C;his nonsensical attitude&#x201D;. He said it was the biggest lot of tripe <span class="col_4431-4432" refersTo="page_0703"/>when the Prime Minister maintained that the M.C.C. was politically influenced. I want to know from the Leader of the Opposition whether in fact the attitude he adopted then indicated for one moment that he accepted the guide lines given by the Prime Minister because, you see, it did not. When the Leader of the Opposition says there was no political influence brought to bear on the M.C.C., I do not want to quarrel with the M.C.C., but I want to ask the hon. member and other hon. members opposite whether they are unaware that when the original tour programme, the itinerary for the M.C.C. tour of Southern Africa, was put to them, they said that they would not play in Rhodesia&#x003F; [Interjection.] We are talking about Government political influence, but the Leader of the Opposition said there was no political influence. That is what actually happened. They themselves turned down visiting Rhodesia. I would like to remind the hon. members that the same request was made to the British Lions rugby team and they said: No, we are going on with our Rhodesian tour. And I read in the Press that the Barbarians are going on with their Rhodesian tour. But let me read to hon. members a few items from the minutes of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, because I am getting sick and tired of this sort of thing.

<p>I will come to the point. They say they did a great deal of work to reverse the International Olympics Committee&#x2019;s decision to re-admit South Africa to the 1968 Games. These are the people who have been opposing South Africa and I can quote other things to the same effect. But the hon. member for Pinelands asks what that has to do with it. I want to tell him what it has to do with it. When D&#x2019;Oliveira was left out of the original side, on the lines mentioned by the hon. member for Pietersburg, do you know what the Minister of Sport in Britain said&#x003F; But I as Minister here have never opened my mouth. When the Press asked him: &#x201C;What do you have to say about leaving out D&#x2019;Oli-&#x2019; veira&#x201D;&#x003F; he said: &#x201C;I am officially supposed to be speechless and that is exactly what I am&#x201D;. What was the insinuation&#x003F; And what happened shortly after that&#x003F; The Minister had an interview with a deputation, and who was in the deputation&#x003F; The Anti-Apartheid Movement. But the hon. member for Pinelands says there was no political influence and asks what this has to do with it. They came to interview that Minister. Canon Collins or Bishop Reeves was there&#x2014;I forget exactly who it was, but they were all people who were against South Africa. They were the people who brought influence to bear. The hon. members say the Prime Minister was wrong in what he did, but they refuse to answer his questions. I do not mind, because it was printed in the Press and I want to read from an article in the <i>Sunday Express</i> in South Africa. This was the Leader of the Opposition talking&#x2014;</p>

<p>But this was in italics. Why does not the hon. member for Pinelands come out with the answer&#x003F; What I want to know is this. If those hon. members agree with the three guide lines the Prime Minister gave, how then can they make a feature of D&#x2019;Oliveira in this debate&#x003F; Because politics was brought into it from the start when the M.C.C. refused to play in Rhodesia. I will not even talk about the Colin Bland incident, which did not affect the M.C.C., but where Bland went to play in Britain and was turned back. As I say, that had nothing to do with the M.C.C., but this incident does have something to do with the M.C.C. The point made by the hon. the Prime Minister is quite correct. All this hullabaloo was caused because D&#x2019;Oliveira is a non-White. Nobody said a word about any of the Whites who might have got <span class="col_4433-4434" refersTo="page_0704"/>into the team, but only about the non-White. The Leader of the Opposition said he supported the Prime Minister&#x2019;s guide lines. Then I want to know how he could use the extravagant language he used immediately after the announcement was made and how he can still maintain that he supports these guide lines of the Prime Minister and still say that he would have allowed D&#x2019;Oliveira to come to South Africa with a cricket team to play here&#x003F; Or would he not&#x003F; Would he have allowed the team to come here with D&#x2019;Oliveira, or would he not&#x003F; That is the position.</p>

<p>I have given the background of the position. On the same basis the M.C.C. did not go to Rhodesia. Why was that done&#x003F; Was it because of politics or not&#x003F; That is why I say pressure was brought to bear in the case of D&#x2019;Oliveira. Not from the M.C.C., because when they picked the team without D&#x2019;Oliveira they said it was the best team. They said D&#x2019;Oliveira was not the man to be chosen. Then D&#x2019;Oliveira was forced into the side. Under those circumstances South Africa and the Prime Minister correctly said that this team, on the basis on which it was formulated, was not acceptable to South Africa. Then there is another point.

<p>The hon. the Minister of Sport became somewhat emotional when replying to the allegations in regard to the D&#x2019;Oliveira incident and the fact that this had become political. I want to ask the Minister whether he does not think that some of the blame for the political aspect of the D&#x2019;Oliveira incident in fact belongs to his own side&#x003F; The Prime Minister said earlier this afternoon that if D&#x2019;Oliveira had been a white man and had been omitted by the M.C.C. Selection Committee, there would have been no outcry about his omission. Now I would like to ask hon. members whether exactly the same does not apply to the fact that the hon. the Minister of Police interrupted a political meeting of his at Potchefstroom in September last year to announce that D&#x2019;Oliveira had not been chosen for the M.C.C., and his statement was greeted with wild applause&#x003F; Did this in fact not mean that the Minister of Police was making a political matter out of the non-selection of D&#x2019;Oliveira&#x003F; I lay it fairly and squarely at the feet of the Minister of Police that in fact this immediately became a highly political matter in England. I am not saying that there were not blunders on both sides and that the matter was not handled tactlessly on both sides. But I say that to put all the blame for the D&#x2019;Oliveira matter&#x2019;s becoming political on the M.C.C. and on the British Press is so much nonsense, because the minute the Minister of Police&#x2014;and I think at that stage he was discoursing on the iniquities of students and he was giving advice to all sorts of sections of the community&#x2014;interrupted this highly political speech apropos of nothing at all to announce that D&#x2019;Oliveira had not been chosen, there was wild applause from the audience. Now I want to ask the Minister of Sport, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Police, whether he would have bothered to interrupt his meeting at Potchefstroom to announce that D&#x2019;Oliveira had not been chosen if D&#x2019;Oliveira were a white man&#x003F; Of course not.

<p>I think it was a most mischievous speech in every possible way, not only as regards the other things he said to which I will return later this session, but in particular because he made a point of doing this. And do not think that this was missed in England. It was taken up by the British Press the next day. There were echoes throughout the British Press. It immediately highlighted the fact that South Africa was only waiting for the non-selection of D&#x2019;Oliveira for it to be acclaimed as a political triumph, and this of course immediately threw the whole matter into the political arena. Why does not the Prime Minister reproach the Minister of Police for being so tactless&#x003F; Why does not the Minister of Sport have something to say about this matter&#x003F; Oh no, because as long as something is pro-Government, it is then not dragging sport into the political arena, but the minute it is anti-Government or anti-Government sentiment, then of course the matter is a political one and sport is being dragged into the political arena. Let us have a little less double talk so that we know where we stand on this matter.</p>

<p>That is all I wanted to say about the D&#x2019;Oliveira matter and I now want to say a few other things to the hon. the Prime Minister. Sir, I was one of those who read with interest the results of a <i>Sunday Times</i> survey. Just how statistically significant this survey was I am in no position to say, but the survey came out with the interesting statement that, I think, between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of English-speaking South Africans thought that the hon. the Prime Minister was doing a fine job, and that something like 90 per cent of Afrikaans-speaking South Africans thought the same thing and that only .3 per cent thought that the Prime Minister was making a pretty poor job of it.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is exactly the point to which I am coming. I was not part of the survey, but I want to say, as the Americans <span class="col_4435-4436" refersTo="page_0705"/>say: I would like to stand up and be counted among the .3 per cent. I do not think that the hon. the Prime Minister is doing such a good job and I would give him many reasons why I think so. The Prime Minister prides himself on the law and order and the peace and quiet and the absence of tension in South Africa. I do not think that the hon. the Prime Minister begins to know the amount of seething unhappiness that exists amongst 80 per cent of the population of South Africa. He is not interested because these are non-voters; they do not affect him. He is worried, of course, about the murmurings that might be going on among his own people but I am not interested in those minor dissensions. They may be major dissensions but they are minor issues as far as I am concerned. On the one racial issue that confronts this country one does not hear of dissension; the fringe benefits for white spectator sportsmen are not what affects the lives of 80 per cent of this population. The fact that thousands of families are being uprooted in this country and removed to areas far distant from their places of work, that families are being split daily and, the fact that an hon. Deputy Minister can refer to the wives and children of the African people as &#x201C;superfluous appendages&#x201D;, without one word of reproach from the hon. the Prime Minister, show that he does not know what is really going on in this country. I know that the Deputy Minister of Justice&#x2014;Justice of all things; God help us &#x2014;has denied that he made the statement; he said that what he said was that these areas must be developed and that as far as the &#x201C;superfluous appendages&#x201D; are concerned, they can sit idle and do nothing in the reserves just as they are doing nothing in the urban areas. Sir, this statement shows a complete absence of regard for the human aspect of this thing. To believe that families can be split in this manner, that the wives and children are people who are not in permanent employment in the urban areas, can simply be shifted holus-bolus to the reserves without any reaction on the part of those families, is something which to me is quite incredible, but it does not strike anybody on the other side that this is so. I cannot imagine how the hon. the Prime Minister can talk about law and order and peace and quiet in South Africa. There is peace and quiet but does he think that it is the peace and quiet of contentment, or does he think that there is in fact deep discontent below the surface, or is all this due to agitators&#x003F;</p>

<p>If the hon. the Prime Minister thinks that this is an issue which should occupy him, I will give him the details of that case, but I am not going to waste my precious ten minutes on that; I have many important things to raise with the hon. the Prime Minister. Sir, I want to know whether the hon. the Prime Minister is going to do anything about the perfectly disgraceful situation which has now arisen in South Africa where we have reached the stage that 1,600 people a day are arrested for pass offences. Even allowing for the fact that a certain proportion of those people should not have been arrested at all in terms of the instruction given to the police, that they should not take into custody people who say that they simply left their registration books behind, the fact remains that the influx control laws of this country make it necessary for the Police to be given the power to accost Africans any time on the streets, in their homes, in their places of work, and to demand their papers to see whether they have the right to be in the urban area. As a result of this we have a huge section of our Police Force bottled up with this sort of activity, instead of attending to serious crime, and we have the incredible situation that 1,600 people a day are dragged off to gaol to await trial.

<p>Firstly, I feel that in the interests of South Africa, and of sport in South Africa, this D&#x2019;Oliveira matter and related matters should never have been raised in this debate. Secondly, I feel that so much has already been said about this matter by the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister concerned that very little remains to be said. But since this matter has, in fact, been broached, it is perhaps as well for us to try to see it in some perspective. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition put a few questions to the hon. the Prime Minister in a very friendly and courteous way. The hon. member for Durban (Point) was very concerned about the accusation having been made here that the Opposition wanted to derive political advantage from it. The hon. member for Pinelands also asked a few questions here. Mr. Chairman, since time immemorial white teams from South Africa have taken part in sport on the international level, especially against Commonwealth countries. If I let my thoughts go back over many, many years, I cannot recall this sort of problem ever having come to the fore, i.e. the inclusion of non-Whites in South African sports teams or in visiting teams from overseas. What can one deduce from that&#x003F; I am now speaking of the years when the United Party was in power, and that was for many years. From that one can deduce that the <span class="col_4437-4438" refersTo="page_0706"/>policy which is being followed to-day was also the policy of the U.P. This problem never came to the fore and the obvious reason for this is perhaps that non-White sport virtually did not exist at that time. It is a fact that this matter only became a problem after the National Party had come to power and had laid down as its policy that something should be done for the non-Whites in the field of sport as well. It was only after the National Party had put forward its policy of separate development and had begun to implement that policy, making it very clear that it wanted the non-Whites to develop along their own lines, also as far as sport was concerned, that we came up against the problem of hostility both at home and abroad. Since then bodies such as the Anti-Apartheid Movement and&#x2014;I am sorry to say&#x2014;also certain clerics, under cover of their clerical garb, have come forward as the greatest enemies of South Africa in respect of its policy of separate development, and then these matters were specifically raised. This eventually led to our having the D&#x2019;Oliveira affair last year. The Opposition asked here why the hon. the Prime Minister had&#x2014;allegedly&#x2014;made certain statements to certain gentlemen. The position is very clear to me. If a discussion takes place between certain gentlemen, and is regarded as confidential, and certain parties to the discussion subsequently divulge what was discussed, contrary to the understanding that the discussion would be regarded as confidential, it is most definitely not the task of the Opposition to blame the hon. the Prime Minister if he, as one of the parties to the discussion, keeps his word. In conclusion I want to say this: If the Opposition wanted to make a positive contribution here to-day in respect of this matter, it should have unequivocally stated its standpoint in respect of the participation of non-Whites in sport here in South Africa and in respect of the inclusion of non-Whites in visiting sports teams. We would then have known where they stand. I cannot say that hon. members of the Opposition are trying to make political capital out of the matter, but there are nevertheless certain things which I find strange. I found the Opposition&#x2019;s &#x201C;timing&#x201D; very conspicuous. This D&#x2019;Oliveira matter once again reared its head two weeks prior to this debate. We have here a wonderful coincidence. Why has this D&#x2019;Oliveira matter been raised by the Opposition specifically at this stage&#x003F; It was not broached overseas again. Why must the Opposition to-day once more launch an attack at the Government about this matter&#x003F; All we have thus far had from the other side has been &#x201C;Dolly&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Dolly&#x201D; again. If the Opposition wants to do South Africa and sport in South Africa a service, I believe this to be the opportunity for them to tell us unequivocally where they stand in respect of the matter. It was not necessary, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) said, &#x201C;to clear the atmosphere&#x201D;. We must stop talking about this matter. I actually blame the hon. member for Pinelands to some extent for having given the people who are agitating against the coming of the All Blacks, some ammunition with the questions which he put and the ideas which he expressed here. This is now the opportunity for the Opposition to tell South Africa and the entire world where they stand in respect of sport in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir De VILLIERS GRAAFF: The hon. member who has just sat down has invited me to make a clear statement as to where we stand in respect of this matter. I am only too happy to oblige him. What worries me is that I cannot get answers out of the hon. the Prime Minister on certain issues. The hon. the Minister of Sport made a most interesting contribution. He told us that this whole M.C.C. tour had been riddled with politics from the beginning &#x2026;</p>

<p>Did he take any action as a result of this&#x003F; This is a ridiculous state of affairs. What politicians intervened&#x003F; The Anti-Apartheid League and Sanroc intervened and the only people who gained a victory out of this were the Anti-Apartheid League and Sanroc. When it came to political influences and the selection committee of the M.C.C. that hon. Minister of Sport who is so anxious to wound but so frightened to strike, would not say that they were politically influenced. He would not attack their <i>bona fides,</i> but he tried to leave the impression that something happened. I said categorically at the time, and I say categorically now, that I dc not believe that the interference was such that it justified our refusing to accept that team I do not believe the sports authorities in South Africa could not have handled this question so satisfactorily that it would not have impaired relations between the two countries. I believe that we could have had triumph for South African sport if the hon. the Prime Minister had the confidence in the sports authorities in South Africa which I have had and still have. I believe they could have managed the affair.</p>

<p>But I want to go further. I am still left with my worry and my worry is that it is now public property that the Prime Minister said long before that team was selected that D&#x2019;Oliveira would not be acceptable. I want to know that if that is so, which of these three conditions apply, which one he was putting into force when he made that statement&#x003F; That is where the hon. the Prime Minister is getting away from the issue. I concede that there may be differences of opinion when the selection was changed. The Prime Minister took his decision; I would have taken a different one and I believe that I would have been right. We still have not had a denial of what the hon. member for Innesdal was reported to have said. We still do not know what the Prime Minister would have done if D&#x2019;Oliveira had been selected the first time the team was chosen and we still do not know where we are in respect of other sporting teams coming to South Africa. We thought everything was in order and now we find these doubts created because of these reports in the newspapers. These are possibly irresponsible reports, but it is for the hon. the Prime Minister to say that he did not make those statements. When questioned, the hon. the Minister of Sport said that he was not prepared to say anything about it. Does he not know what happened&#x003F; It was reported in the Press the following week. I was on my way to a dinner in Johannesburg which was going to start an hour and a half earlier than I thought. I was waylaid at the airport by a Pressman who asked me a number of questions when I had just spoken the night before at Hartsfontein, near Kimberley, and dealt with the whole question.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now repeated precisely what he and other hon. members on that side of the House have been saying all afternoon. The hon. the Prime Minister has repeatedly replied to these questions of the Opposition. It is a case of the hon. the Opposition not wanting to see and not wanting to hear&#x003F;</p>

<p>I now want to come back to what the hon. member for Durban (Point) said in connection with security services. Even after the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s explanation, that hon. member is still chasing up hares and trying to sow confusion. This is being done while Sanroc, the Anti-Apartheid Movement and the Organization for African Unity are not being criticized or repudiated at all by hon. members on that side of the House. In this House the hon. member then wants to cast reflections on our Security Services. The hon. member has done South Africa and our Defence Force a great disservice by pretending to have information from the inner circles of the Defence Force about so-called dissatisfaction which has supposedly arisen as a result of this step of the hon. the Prime Minister. I challenge the hon. member for Durban (Point) to make available the information which he has; if it cannot be made available to the entire House, then let it be made available to the hon. the Prime Minister or to the hon. the Minister of Defence. I challenge him, because he cannot do so. I am certain that if the hon. member does have such information and handed it to the hon. Prime Minister it would be dealt with and handled with the greatest degree of responsibility. After the reflection which he cast upon our Defence Force and our Security Services, he does, in fact, owe that to this country and specifically to the Defence Force, to which he has done such a great disservice by attaching such a stigma to it. As an ex-soldier the hon. member knows well that the Military Intelligence Service is there to anticipate possible military action from a possible enemy, and to keep the Supreme Command abreast of matters. As the hon. member knows, military intelligence services are limited to the military sphere, and we believe that in this connection our Military Intelligence Service has done excellent work and is still doing so. Military intelligence services go up to a certain point and then link up with other matters. It is then necessary to draw a dividing line somewhere. As such, the Security Branch of the S.A.P. also has its defined field of activity which likewise goes up to a certain point and then links up with other matters. It is then also necessary to draw a dividing line as far as the Security Branch of the Police is concerned, as the hon. member knows, or ought to know. Therefore the establishment of the State Security Bureau by the hon. the Prime Minister was a completely logical development. It is then also perfectly logical that these extra funds should be voted for it and that more than the normal expenditure should be incurred. But the hon. member does not want to understand that and he wants to make capital out of it in a bad way. In addition, funds spent on the security of the State can hardly be regarded as having been wasted. It should much rather be regarded as an insurance policy, and not only an insurance policy, but also an endowment policy for the security of our country. It must be regarded as an essential investment. This new branch which has been established under the control of General Van den Bergh in no way detracts from the work being done in the Defence Force or Police spheres. It is an essential, co-ordinating body which, in the special circumstances prevailing in South Africa and in Africa south of the Sahara, is actually a vitally necessary institution. Here we have a refined sphere of action. The hon. the Prime Minister is exceptionally well-equipped to keep an eye on this and we and our country have the fullest confidence in him. We and the country outside regard General Van den Bergh, who was so severely criticized by the hon. members, as a highly competent officer. We can therefore only congratulate the hon. the Prime Minister on his clear vision and his guidance in this respect.</p>

<p>Such as whether he did assure the hon. member for Innesdal at this information meeting that D&#x2019;Oliveira would not be allowed in South Africa and that the Maoris would not be allowed either. What puzzles us is that the Prime Minister has intervened in this debate since my Leader put that question to him, and he avoided it. What puzzles us even more is that, when the hon. member for Innesdal is in the House, he has not stood up in support of his Prime Minister to say that he was wrongly reported in <i>Veg.</i> I think it is much more important in the interests of our political life in South Africa that the hon. member for Innesdal should get up and support the Prime Minister and repudiate <i>Veg</i> in this instance. His silence to me is most strange and remarkable. I think also we should get certain things on the record, and <span class="col_4443-4444" refersTo="page_0709"/>one of them is this. The Prime Minister by way of interjection earlier this afternoon seemed to indicate that his policy was still the same as that announced by Dr. Verwoerd at Loskop on 5th September, 1965. I want to say immediately if that were true then all this talk we have heard in the Press and all this honour that has come to the Prime Minister for following a new outward policy must have been based on a misconception, because nothing can be clearer than that at Loskop on the 5.9.1965 Dr. Verwoerd made it clear that a rugby team from New Zealand containing Maoris would not be welcome in South Africa. That is how it was understood by every Afrikaans and Nationalist newspaper in South Africa and by every Opposition newspaper in South Africa. Moreover, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) emphasized, &#x201C;En wat is dit&#x003F; En wat is dit&#x003F;&#x201D; Here in front of me I have a Press report of that speech by Dr. Verwoerd and it is impossible to conclude anything but that from the speech. Dr. Verwoerd made it perfectly clear when he said, &#x201C;Just like the Springbok rugby teams in New Zealand which have subjected itself to the conditions and customs there, the South African Government expected the New Zealanders to do the same when they were the guests of South Africa.&#x201D; I do not want to read very much, but he made it perfectly clear in this speech that for reasons of avoiding social integration and because it is our custom we would compete in South Africa against white teams only. He made it perfectly clear that he was surprised that people could doubt this. I have the cutting here and the Prime Minister can see it. Surely, that is not the attitude of the Prime Minister as we understood it from him before&#x003F; His attitude quite rightly is the same as that of the Leader of the Opposition, that as far as possible, subject to certain provisos which have been read again and again to-day and which he has confirmed and which the Leader of the Opposition has confirmed, the selection of teams is a matter for the sporting body concerned, and we do not dictate; we do not try to be the selectors.</p>

<p>How can the Prime Minister claim that his policy on this subject is the same as that enunciated by Dr. Verwoerd, which created a crisis and led to the cancellation of the tour of South Africa&#x003F; It is just impossible. Either we have not understood the hon. the Prime Minister correctly or the Prime Minister has not meant what he said to us in the past.</p>

<p>The second thing which I think is most important, is this. Questions have been asked across the floor of the House by hon. members on that side, to the hon. member for Pinelands and others, about the attitude of this side of the House, and it does surprise me that those questions should be asked at all, because we have never dilly-dallied about our attitude and our policy. We have no doubts. We do not have hon. members on this side of the House reporting in little newspapers that our leader gives secret interviews repudiating his own attitude and his policy at obscure meetings. We have no problem about this.</p>

<p>I want to remind the hon. the Prime Minister of what was said by my hon. Leader in this House on 11th April, 1967, when he himself restated our policy towards participation in international sport beyond all doubt. Just in case there is any other hon. member who would like me to repeat it, I shall read it again. I quote from Hansard, volume 20, column 3950, when my hon. Leader said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We made it quite clear that we desired of the Government that it should remove the immediate causes which threatened to deprive South Africans of their traditional participation in international sport by&#x2014;</block>

<li>(2) entrusting the control and administration of sport in the Republic to the recognized sporting bodies;</li>

<p>With those principles on record it must be quite clear that this unfortunate incident has done tremendous damage to South Africa&#x2019;s part in international sport. What happened in the case of the D&#x2019;Oliveira incident could not have happened under a United Party government.</p>

<p>Because we do not look for politics where we do not have to seek politics, because we do not attach as much importance to stupid little organizations like Sanroc as the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation attaches to it. Moreover, we would not allow the Government of South Africa to be used to give those organizations victories over the people of South Africa. All that the Government has achieved in this case is to give those enemies of South Africa, the Anti-Apartheid Movement and Sanroc, the satisfaction that they have scored a victory over us. They have embarrassed South Africa; they have embarrassed every sportsman in South Africa, and they have made us look fools internationally.</p>

<p><span class="col_4445-4446" refersTo="page_0710"/>All I want to do is to appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister.

That is the greatest compliment that has ever been paid to a Nationalist Prime Minister. He is trying to be more reasonable and sensible than some of the past Nationalist Prime Ministers. I want to appeal to him now in all seriousness to take this opportunity created for him in good faith by the Leader of the Opposition once and for all to dispel any doubt about the policy of the Government towards the possible inclusion of Maoris in the All Blacks team that will be touring South Africa next year. The reason why it is necessary to dispel this doubt which should not have arisen is because of this report that appeared in this magazine, <i>Veg,</i> which was published in other newspapers and which attributes certain statements to the hon. member for Innesdal. These statements, although they have been prominently published, have been denied neither by the Prime Minister nor by the hon. member for Innesdal. We are creating an opportunity for both these hon. gentlemen to reassure South Africa and to prevent a further international incident which will damage and tarnish the image of South Africa in the field of international sport.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I had had the slightest doubt in my mind as to the Opposition&#x2019;s having selected this debate in order to wreck the All Blacks tour, if this were at all possible, then I am perfectly sure of it now. Whether or not the hon. the Leader of the Opposition intended to do so, he and his party are heading is that direction. I want to tell the hon. the Leader now that if this tour falls through he would be exclusively to blame for it. I shall tell the hon. the Leader why I maintain this. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is perfectly aware, and I want to repeat it now, that there is complete agreement amongst the South African Rugby Board, the New Zealand Rugby Board and the International Rugby Board. He is also perfectly aware that all the arrangements have been made and that the fixture list for the tour has been published. He is also perfectly aware that I stated in public, and that it was published in the public Press and in the New Zealand Press, that I did not know of one single reason why this tour would not take place. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows just as well as I do that all the arrangements have been made and that this tour will take place. Since he knows this, Sir, I want to ask him where this comes from and what his motives are for wanting to drag this matter into this debate on this occasion.</p>

<p>Let the hon. the Leader of the Opposition quarrel with me about the D&#x2019;Oliveira affair as much as he pleases. I shall come back to this presently. But if the hon. the Leader had wanted to make sure to the finest detail in any respect whether this All Blacks tour could take place, all he had to do was to ask me, if he wanted to discuss it in public at all, whether the All Blacks tour was going to take place or whether there was any obstacle to prevent its taking place. That would have been a fair question on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. In that case I would have told him, &#x201C;Yes, the tour is going to take place. I am not aware of any obstacles.&#x201D; That would have been the end of the story. But that is not what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is doing. That is not what hon. members opposite are doing. They keep harping on this matter to see whether they can get out of it as much as they possibly can which might lead to this tour falling through. That is all the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is after. I say that if I had any doubts before the hon. member for Yeoville spoke, then I am now absolutely sure that this is indeed the case. I now want to make an appeal across the floor of the House to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his people. I want to do so for the sake of rugby and of sport in South Africa. Kindly refrain from doing this sort of thing. If he wants to engage in politicking, there are so many matters in regard to which he can do so. Why does he not avail himself of those opportunities&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now accused me of allegedly adopting a different attitude from the one adopted by the late Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was sitting in this House when I made my speech. He is familiar with the background that prevailed when Dr. Verwoerd made his Loskop speech. What was that background&#x003F; Politicians in New Zealand had adopted the attitude that the Prime Minister of South Africa and the Government had to issue a statement. They would include Maoris in the team which would come to South Africa. This was the demand that was made to the then Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was not prepared, and quite rightly so, to have such demands made to him. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was sitting in this House when I made my speech of which the hon. member for Yeoville has the Hansard report before him. He will find that I made it very clear in that speech that we were dealing here with a specific sport relationship between the Whites of South Africa on the one hand and the New Zealanders on the other hand. Did the hon. member for Yeoville hear me say that at the time&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville will remember very clearly that I said it was wrong to view this as a sport relationship between Maoris and white South Africans, because this has never been the case. This has also been recorded in Hansard. Then I added that if the same circumstances presented themselves again as they did in the time of Dr. Verwoerd at Loskop, I would not hesitate to do as Dr. Verwoerd had done at Loskop. That was the attitude we adopted. It is not necessary for me to repeat it here this afternoon. Everything has been recorded like that in Hansard. I said it at that time already. Where do these absurd stories come from now&#x003F; What purpose do we serve by telling them&#x003F; The only purpose we can possibly serve by telling them, is that we are doing our best to wreck that tour. I want to tell the hon. member that neither I nor any member on my side of the House will take any further part in this discussion, because this discussion was closed with the words which I had already used in public and which I shall now repeat to the hon. member. In the past there were touring sides here which included members who had Maori blood in their veins. I can mention their names to hon. members. But I do not consider it necessary to bandy them about across the floor of the House. Such people were here in 1928-&#x2019;29. Later on, with the last All Blacks tour here in the fifties, such people were again included in the touring side. People with Maori blood in their veins will come here again. I made that very clear. They will be received in the same manner such people were received before. The people of New Zealand are satisfied with that. On that basis they accepted the invitation, and on that basis the tour will take place. What more does the hon. member want, other than What I have already said in public, i.e. that the tour will take place and that I do not know of any obstacle which would prevent the tour from taking place&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now hon. members are coming back to the hon. member for Innesdal again. I now want to make it very clear to the hon. the Leader that, if hon. members opposite think that I am now going to comment on what smear publications like the <i>Observer</i> and <i>Veg</i> have to say in respect of these matters, they are making a mistake. Hon. members can now say just what they please. These allies of the hon. members opposite may write just what they please. I do not intend to respond in this House to such smear articles and by doing so to prejudice South Africa&#x2019;s interests. This is my conclusive reply in respect of that matter.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also put another question to me. He asked me whether I would have accepted D&#x2019;Oliveira if he had been selected in the first place. If I were to reply to that question just as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition put it, I would not be doing sport a favour. I shall tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition why. It is not only because it is a difficult question to answer, but also because it could give rise to implications. If I were to say now that I would have accepted D&#x2019;Oliveira, or that I would not have accepted him, I would surely be placing myself in a terribly vulnerable position. Then I might, in regard to future tours, be asked whether I would accept A, or whether I would accept B, or whether I would accept C or D. Surely this would lead to an absurd position. Let me put it this way to the hon. the Leader. Suppose eleven South African Bantu were to go over to Britain and were to be selected for the M.C.C. to tour South Africa. What would the position be&#x003F; If I were to say in advance that I would not take this man or that man, I would surely be playing the role of and anticipating the selection committee; then I would not only be acting as the selection committee for the present, but also as the selection committee for the future. The attitude I have adopted all along is that I am not prepared to act as the selection committee. The hon. the leader of the Opposition knows that I expressed that view. He did not attack me on it. It was not because we said that Subba Row should not come, that he did not come to South Africa in the past. He did not come because those people had taken into account the position of the particular sport relationship which existed between them and us. Nepia did not accompany the New Zealand touring team either, in spite of the fact that he was the best full-back in the world. That was not because South Africa or the Springboks had said that they did not want him here. New Zealand had decided of its own accord not to select him. No instruction had been issued or request had been made to the effect that they should not bring him along. It was an understanding which had developed traditionally between these two countries. Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants me to say in anticipation that I shall not accept this man or that man or that man.</p>

<p>Well, in that case the hon. member should not make such absurd remarks before he knows what is happening. [Interjections.] The hon. the Leader of the Opposition may blame me for this, but I just want to say that as far as I am concerned, both of these discussions were conducted as private discussions. I am not prepared to say that they spoke along these lines or along those lines; I am not prepared to say that they told me this or that I told them that, because private discussions between gentlemen remain private discussions between gentlemen. Let them have said certain things on their part; I do not know what they said, but I, for my part, am not prepared to break such a rule of etiquette. This is and this will remain my point of view in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>In spite of my explanation the hon. member for Durban (Point) once again referred to the intelligence set-up. In order to eliminate any misunderstanding in respect of the matter between me and the hon. member for Durban (Point) or any other member, I just want to read out to him what the position is. The position is, as I have already informed the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, that a clear-cut demarcation of duties has been effected as regards the Military Intelligence division of the South African Defence Force, the Police and the State Security Bureau. The new set-up has been recorded in writing. Nothing which falls under the Defence Force or the Police has been taken away from them. The Ministers of Defence and Police and I as Prime Minister, together with the heads of departments, have reached complete agreement in regard to this matter. If the hon. member still says that he has other information, I shall be most surprised. I do not think it is in the interests of the security of South Africa that there should be any further discussion in regard to this matter. I want to repeat the offer I made to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition last week, i.e. that I am prepared to furnish him and the chairman of his group, I think it is the hon. member for Durban (Point), with information in so far as I can do so with due regard to the security of South Africa. I cannot be more reasonable than that.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Prime Minister has made it public that he has offered to inform me concerning this new State Intelligence Bureau. That is perfectly correct. I refused, because I knew I was going to raise it in this debate, in fact I told him so &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. the Prime Minister has said that I could raise it in any event, but I am far too sensitive about this sort of thing. I never want to be accused of revealing information which is confidential and which might slip out by accident. Therefore, I did not accept it then and I raised it now I have got a statement for the public. If there is any further information that can be usefully discussed, I shall be glad to do so.</p>

<p>Now Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister has taken exception to my asking him whether he would have accepted D&#x2019;Oliveira if he was selected the first time. I put that question because I wanted to know how he applies the three conditions which he has laid down. That was why the question was put to him, because there is no doubt that different conditions applied on the first and the second occasions. While I have told him that there could be a difference of opinion about the second occasion, there could have been no difference of opinion about the first occasion. It seems to me that the hon. gentleman is still trying to run away from this issue. He is not prepared to comment on publications in what he calls smear journals. I am afraid he may find that they have been taken up by other papers. I think the least he can do is to undertake in this House to discipline the hon. member for Innesdal to make sure that things of this kind are not published in any sort of journal.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the second group of subjects that I want to raise with the hon. the Prime Minister which concerns faults and weaknesses in administration of certain portfolios, which I think are so grave that they demand the intervention of the head of the Government. In this regard I want to say at once that I am not dealing with agriculture on this occasion. I believe the position there is serious. I am not dealing with it because there have been opportunities before and there will be opportunities again. I want to direct the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attention in the first place to the crisis which I believe is arising in the Civil Service at the present time.</p>

<from><span class="col_4451-4452" refersTo="page_0713"/>Sir. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I raised it during the Budget debate but I received no satisfactory answer at all. I feel it is my duty now to bring it to the notice of the Prime Minister, because I am satisfied that drastic and urgent action is necessary. I think most of us have been conscious from time to time that the position in the Civil Service has been steadily deteriorating for some years. It has been commented on by civil servants in high places. It has been the subject of many articles in their journal, namely <i>The Public Servant.</i> The position in the Railways is bad too. That has been raised on other occasions. The General Manager of the South African Railways in his latest annual report makes no fewer than five references to shortages of staff and the problems they create in his Administration. Before the Budget I thought it necessary to warn how bad things were and to suggest that steps should be taken to combat the loss of senior civil servants on whom the whole running of the Service depended. I think I cannot do better than to quote as an illustration the position of the Department of the Controller and Auditor-General as revealed in his last report dealing with the position in his own department. It appears on pages 49 and 50. I think we should have it fairly fully before the House. The hon. gentleman reports that he is required to audit the following accounts: Revenue Votes, 52; Loan Votes, 16; Bantu Education Account; Fixed Statutory Appropriations; Marketing Boards, 20; other statutory boards and so forth. It is a long list and he outlines his activities in respect of the South African Railways and Harbours, the South-West Africa Administration and various Bantu territories. He also says that his inspectors are responsible for making inspections <i>in loco</i> at more than 2.500 Government and other offices. This is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the purpose of carrying out the abovementioned duties the department has an authorized establishment of 569 posts of which 35 are for non-audit work.</block>

<p>That means 534 are for audit work. He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the end of October, 1968, 407 posts were filled by permanent, 68 by temporary and 35 by part-time units, leaving 59 vacant posts, of which 32 were in the administrative grade of Auditor or higher. The filling of these posts with suitable candidates continues to present a problem. Over the past year 70 new and untrained recruits were appointed, but during the same period 70 officers with an average of three years&#x2019; service each resigned. These included one Senior Work Study Officer and two Auditors. The position is further aggravated by the fact that for a number of years not only has the majority of the recruits come from the B-stream matriculants but in addition to the wastage due to the retirement of trained and experienced staff, the department has consistently lost the best of these recruits after some years of training. The seriousness of the situation is evidenced by the fact that of the 247 Administrative Assistants in service at the end of October, 1968, only 86 had completed more than four years service and that apart from the 59 vacancies mentioned above, approximately 54 per cent of the staff employed on audit work proper either had less than four years experience or were temporary or part-time employees. In view of the added responsibility devolving on this department as a result of the continuous increase in the scope and complexity of governmental activity, the deteriorating staff position gives cause for serious concern, especially from the long-term point of view.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize that approximately 54 per cent of the staff employed on audit work proper either had less than four years&#x2019; experience or were temporary or part-time employees. I think this paints a disastrous picture from the point of view of the Public Service. I do not think I can be contradicted if I say that I believe the picture is equally bad in many other Departments, and in some cases actually worse. In fact, I am satisfied that the reason why the Minister of Finance in imposing his new purchase tax imposed it at source in the factory and in the bonded warehouse and not at the retail outlet, which would have been very much fairer, is because the Department of Inland Revenue is crippled by a staff shortage and probably could not render the services necessary to apply the tax in that way. I therefore say that the Government has been taking what I regard as timid and inadequate steps to cope with this problem and I wonder whether they appreciate what they are really up against. Let us see what they have done to date. They have subsidized interest on housing loans for public servants. They tardily granted salary increases. They have reduced pension contributions and increased pensions. They are considering the report of the M&#x00FC;nnig Commission and they have set aside R15 million towards increasing the salaries of professional staff. What has the reaction of the Public Service been&#x003F; So far as one can judge from their mouthpiece, it has been one of bitter disappointment and concern about the future of their profession. What has been done up to the present just is not good enough. The Government can never suggest that it has not been warned in advance. I want to give a few examples. The Public Servant warned, as I did, of the widening gap between the upper and lower personnel strata which made it increasingly difficult to fill posts in the higher ranks. It suggested that with the present trickle of matriculated recruits it may soon become unbridgeable. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>The problem touched upon by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is one which one has to accept in the Public Service of any country. It is not that <span class="col_4453-4454" refersTo="page_0714"/>this side of the House is not sympathetically disposed towards the Public Servants. We do, in fact, have sympathy with them and if you look at the figures you will find that salary increases are granted to Public Servants every year. But if we think that Public Servants can at some stage actually receive the same salary as the private sector can offer, we can forget about it. That is a matter of impossibility, because from the very nature of the Public Service there is no competition between an employee in the Public Service and one in the private sector. In the private sector the position is such that as big a salary as possible is given to employees because there is a profit motive throughout the industry. The Public Service, on the contrary, is a service organization in which there is no profit motive whatsoever and in which there can therefore be no competition for the various employees. Seen in that light, one must accept the fact that the salaries and conditions of service of Public Servants will always lag behind those in the private sector.</p>

<p>But the Public Servant, on the other hand, has other benefits which the private sector cannot offer, and this is a matter which Public Servants must now take into account. What the Public Service can offer and the private sector cannot offer is stability of employment. When a depression comes the people in the private sector are the first to have to go. The people in the Public Service are permanently employed and remain there for a longer period. The point is simply that there will always be a shortage of Public Servants because we have a booming economy at present. We shall never be able to increase the salaries of officials to such an extent that they can compete with the private sector. But the Public Service is, in fact, in the process of giving as many possible built-in economic benefits to officials as possible, and I do not think the Leader of the Opposition is correct in his criticism when he says that nothing is being done. A great deal is being done for the officials, but it is a gradual process, and we want to express our gratitude to the officials for the patience which they are displaying and the services which they are rendering under very difficult circumstances.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Fortuitously the hon. member who has just sat down has raised a point which was to have been the next point on my list of warnings to be given in respect of the Public Service, because it is pointed out that the disparity between Public Service salaries and those in ordinary business is as much as 36 per cent. That is pointed out by Dr. Enslin, President of the Public Service Association. The problem is that where it gets as big as that, what do you find&#x003F; You find, as Dr. Enslin showed, that in some sections of Government Departments they are 60 per cent under-staffed, and because of that big disparity there is frustration and dissatisfaction and there is a high percentage of resignations.</p>

<p>But another warning to the Government in this regard is this. The point has been made that the vacancies quoted by the Public Service Commission are not a true reflection of the critical situation which in fact exists, because in many cases posts are merely abolished or they are filled by temporary workers. Imagine where we are when Mr. Kitshoff, Secretary for Industries, tells the conference of Public Service Departmental Heads in Pretoria that the Public Service was losing its backbone, the promising productive men in the middle grades. Then we find ourselves in the sad position that the Public Service Commission itself admits that its research programme into conditions of service has been held up by staff shortages. That is the stage we have reached. I know the Prime Minister has taken an interest in this situation, and that is why I raise it with him again, quite apart from the crisis proportions this matter has reached. It was he who announced last year the improvements in the pay of Public Servants as from 1st April this year. Sir, I am afraid he will have to give this matter further consideration, because he has not got the solution yet. Now, what should he be doing&#x003F;</p>

<p>I believe there are three or four things that should be done. Firstly, I think he will have to rethink the whole salary structure of the Public Service to make it more competitive with private enterprise. I do not say it can be made completely competitive but the gap to-day is too big. Secondly, I think he will have to give special consideration to the status and salary of senior men in the Service, to give scope to able and ambitious young men and women who are prepared to make the Service a career. I think the State will be entitled to expect greater efficiency in return for such improvements, but that in its turn will depend on certain things. It will depend, first of all, on better training, on better organization, on the use of improved methods and the more generous recognition of merit. I want to say that in the Service, too, the responsibility of sound management to achieve efficiency must be acknowledged and accepted. The Prime Minister knows that the efficiency of his administration is largely going to be judged by the efficiency of the Public Service. I want to tell him that this matter demands his personal attention at present, because there are signs of breakdown in many Departments, I shall be very interested to hear from him what his plans are in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised the question of the manpower shortage in the Public Service. Let me say at once, and I am very grateful for being able to say this here, that if there is one thing of which South Africa can be very proud, then it has a very good cause to be proud of the way in which all its officials are carrying out their duties. As Prime Minister it is a particular pleasure to me to give this testimonial to the Public Service. There is no doubt about that. And their <span class="col_4455-4456" refersTo="page_0715"/>achievements are even greater if regard is had to the phenomenal growth which has, particularly in the last decade, taken place in South Africa. But it is unnecessary for me to repeat that here. We have heard from the hon. the Minister of Transport and from the other Ministers as well that, in spite of all those shortages, more work is feeing done by the officials in question. This is a matter in which I take a great personal interest, but it is also a matter which did not develop yesterday or the day before. It is a matter which has a very long history. I wanted to make sure of the history, because I anticipated that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would raise these matters here, and therefore I wondered how far this thing went back. This is what I found in the report of 1946. You should bear in mind, Sir, that we had large manpower resources available in 1946, consisting of people who had been released from the military services. There was unemployment at the time. People did not find it easy to obtain employment, for at that time development had come to a standstill in South Africa. This is what was said in the 1946 report of the Public Service Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Departments, particularly those providing the daily essential services to the public, had occasion during the year to report to the Commission that shortages of personnel had become so acute that there were serious risks of breakdown. The position gave the Commission cause for concern and investigation revealed a state of affairs so serious as to compel it in August, 1946, to invite the attention of Ministers to the manpower position in relation to the ever-increasing demands for additional public services and the expansion of existing ones.</block>

<p>That was in 1946. Then I come to 1947&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission again finds it necessary to report on the general unsatisfactory staff position in the Public Service and the difficulties encountered by the Departments, particularly those providing essential services to the public, in coping with the situation owing to the shortage of personnel.</block>

<p>That was the position in 1947. Then I come to 1948&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This report and the statistics contained therein will afford some indication of the extent of post-war developments and activities in the Public Service and serve to emphasize that, contrary to popular belief, the heavy strain so readily borne by Public Servants during the war has not been lessened. The manner in which problems have been tackled and the results achieved by attenuated staff are most praiseworthy.</block>

<p>This is, therefore, a problem which has existed all these years. I am only mentioning this for the simple reason that people may perhaps gain the impression, from the speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, that this is a problem which has arisen under this Government only. This is simply not the case. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me to take a personal interest in this matter. I am taking a personal interest in this matter. I am not only taking an interest in it, but this is also a matter which is constantly receiving the attention of the Cabinet. We have had opportunities in this House to discuss this matter in detail and such opportunities will again present themselves when the Votes of the Departments concerned come up for discussion. From the nature of the case I am not going to discuss this in full detail on my Vote, but I have fully acquainted myself with the problem, and most of the matters were mentioned by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself. I ascertained that every possible step was being taken by the Ministers concerned, the Government and the Public Service Commission to meet this problem.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of this matter is, after all, the question of salaries. The question is whether the Government has paid sufficient attention to that matter. One can argue about what is sufficient and what is not. But these things develop according to a pattern. I asked them to tell me how the position had changed over the past 30 years, and I want to give hon. members the figures that were furnished to me. Take the ordinary clerk who joins the Public Service. In 1938 his salary was R280; at present it is R1,272, or rather, that was the figure in 1968, before the increases which were granted recently. In other words, percentage-wise the increase was 430 per cent, and surely the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me that the cost of living did not increase by 430 per cent. On the contrary, it increased by much less than half that figure. In other words, the fault is not to be found there. The salary of an administrative officer increased by 130 per cent; that of a professional officer increased by 256 per cent over that period; the salary of a senior professional officer increased by 218 per cent, and that of a secretary by 165 per cent.</p>

<p>Sir, I mention this to prove (a) that it is not a question of there having been no appreciation on the part of the Government for the work that was done, and (b) that there was no stinginess, regard being had to the finances at the disposal of the Government, in paying higher salaries. The adjustment of salaries is a process which goes on all the time. Not only have increases now been granted once again and will further increases be granted next year, as has already been announced, but in the meantime provision has been made in these Estimates for R15 million to fee approved by the House of Assembly, to give effect to the recommendations of the M&#x00FC;nnig Commission which the Cabinet will adopt. Therefore, from a financial point of view, from an incentive point of view, I be <span class="col_4457-4458" refersTo="page_0716"/>lieve that this Government has done everything it can possibly do.</p>

<p>I am quite prepared to listen to hon. members who are able to suggest ways in which one may improve the position even further, because it is not only the Government and I who are concerned in this matter; all of us are concerned in it. I adopt the attitude that everything that could possibly be done, has been done, and when the Votes of the Ministers concerned come up for discussion, they will be able to go into the details. But I myself ascertained that what can be done under the circumstances, is in fact being done.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there is no intention on our side to make any reflection upon the Civil Service at all. I think the Prime Minister will agree with me that we had no such intention. But we are concerned when we find the position as serious as it is to-day. The other day I put a question to the Minister of Finance on the very important question of the collection of revenue. I think the Prime Minister will concede that the collection of revenue is essential, otherwise the whole fabric of finance breaks down. In Johannesburg we have the position that out of a total establishment of 86 in the Inland Revenue Department, 34 posts are filled by temporary staff and 30 remain unfilled.</p>

<p>The total establishment for the Inland Revenue Department as a whole is 501, and we find that 104 posts are temporarily filled and that 90 are unfilled. If that state of affairs continues or if there is no improvement, the Minister is going to find himself in considerable difficulty and the Government is going to find itself in difficulty in collecting taxes. Then I come to another Department, the Department of Customs and Excise, which the hon. the Minister of Finance indicated the other day will administer the sales tax. He also indicated that prices would be watched and kept under control. When I asked the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs how many posts were provided for the administration of price control, his reply was &#x201C;none&#x201D;, but he went on to indicate that 55 posts were filled by permanent staff and 12 by temporary staff. What we are finding, as the years go by, is that there is a tremendous increase in the number of civil servants, and we would like to ask the Prime Minister whether the Cabinet as a whole has given its attention to the introduction of modern methods in so far as office and administrative records are concerned. We find that Mr. Jan Marais, the chairman of Trust Bank, in a paper which he delivered the other day, quoted figures recently given by a University of South Africa professor in respect of our Civil Service. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The number of Civil Service employees has increased by 276 per cent during the period 1937 to 1966. In the same period the white population has increased by only 70 per cent. If this rate is maintained the Civil Service staff will have increased by another 72 per cent by 1980, while the white population will have increased by only 27 per cent.</block>

<p>To what extent is the Prime Minister satisfied that we are getting the maximum productivity from the Civil Service&#x003F; How many senior Civil Servants are writing out letters in long-hand and sending them to a typist bureau to be typed&#x003F; I wonder if the Prime Minister would get one of his officials to check up at Marks Buildings to find out how many senior responsible officials have to write out their letters in long-hand and then send them to a typist pool to be typed. He would be surprised to find how many of them have to do that.</p>

<p>Sir I am not going to give any department away. I respect the loyalty and the diligence of many senior Civil Servants. They just cannot get the people in the middle echelons to do the work. If th&#x00E9; Prime Minister were to go time that departments he would find time after time that modern appliances are not being used there. On the other hand, we have certain Government departments using a modern appliance such as a computer, but using it as a status symbol. These Computers sometimes work only four to five hours a day. If a computer is to be used. efficiently, it has to be used 24 hours a day. Attention may also be given to the question of shift work in Government departments. I am sure that this idea will horrify some Civil Servants, but if the Prime Minister goes overseas he will find that in an organization like the Post Office in Britain computers work 24 hours a day, right round the clock, because they find that a computer works most efficiently when it is kept running. In this country, however, we find numbers of Government departments each having its own computer as a status symbol. We know that our people are becoming interested in computers but the time is going to come when Government departments may find themselves in the position in which a certain municipal department found itself when all the computer programmers left the department simultaneously and the whole department folded up We know that they have had difficulties in the Inland Revenue Department; we know that difficulties have been experienced in the Department of Customs and Excise. When one sees this growing army of civil servants, one is entitled to ask whether we are just getting number or whether we are getting quality or whether we are doing any training. I want to direct the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attention to the recent investigation which was conducted by the Fulton Commission in Britain There the Civil Service Departments have started implementing the two major recommendations contained in the report. The first recommendation was to change the structure of the civil Service by abolishing the traditional system of occupational classes and ensuring an open road to the top. To what extent is the Government giving consideration to the question of allowing young men to move up to the top&#x003F; Wherever we go in <span class="col_4459-4460" refersTo="page_0717"/>industry to-day we find that all the big industrial organizations are putting young men of 35, 36 or 37 years of age into top positions. It is almost unheard of in any Government department to do the same. Has the time not come to do some re-thinking in this matter and to allow bright young South Africans who have degree qualifications and experience in administration to go to the top&#x003F; We do it in the army and we do it in business. Surely there must be some re-thinking on this matter to give young men an opportunity of going to the top instead of having to wait for dead men&#x2019;s shoes. I know that this suggestion will horrify senior public servants with the traditional public service outlook. They will regard this as heresy. But, Sir, it is not heresy in the outside world.</p>

<p>I suggest that it is time that the hon. the Prime Minister made some inquiries from the various departments himself. [Interjections.] My whole purpose in raising this matter is to bring it to the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister. Sir, I often have the opportunity of seeing various Government departments at work; I meet civil servants and I hear their complaints, and I see the methods which are being used, methods which have been discarded in commerce and industry years ago. Let the hon. the Prime Minister make a test and find out how many tape recorders are being used in the various Government departments as against the number used in commercial organizations. Take an organization like Escom or an organization like Iscor and compare the number of tape recorders used in those organizations by responsible staff with the number used in the Civil Service. That does not suit them best. They are carrying a large number of junior officials. The ratio of juniors to seniors is not satisfactory. It is the people of the middle income group whom we find are leaving the Civil Service. They become frustrated and disillusioned and then leave the Civil Service. It is time that the hon. the Minister gave consideration to giving better prospects in the Civil Service. He should also consider the erection of a Civil Service College to give training to people as is done in Britain to-day. In Britain they are seconding Civil Servants to the private sectors to give them the opportunity of training in business methods. All we are doing to-day is to recruit numbers of civil servants. They then get their promotion by going to the Bantu Development Corporation, the Xhosa Development Corporation or various other development corporations. They are using the Civil Service as a stepping stone to obtain work in these quasi-Government departments. The Civil Service is not being strengthened. In fact it is being weakened as is evidenced by the number of temporary staff we have in the Civil Service and the growing complaints which we have from the Civil Service organization itself, as reported in our daily Press and also in the financial Press from time to time.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. the Prime Minister has already said, we welcome this discussion on this topic. We are all aware that this is indeed a problem. I think we must emphasize that the labour shortage is not a problem experienced in the Public Service only; it is a problem in all the various sectors in the country and, indeed, in the world as well. One of our greatest problems is that our highly trained people receive such wonderful offers from other parts of the world, not only inside South Africa in the private sector, but also from beyond the borders of South Africa. This is a fact of which we take cognizance and which we want to face up to. However, we realize that these circumstances, as outlined by the hon. the Minister of Planning a few days ago, are the result of the rapid development which South Africa has experienced over the past years. However, the fact remains that the labour shortage is a problem, irrespective of the causes. Therefore we merely have to go on saying to what extent it can be solved and whether enough is being done to cope with this problem. As far as the Public Service is concerned, I should like to point out that the hon. member for Pinetown was correct in saying what he did just before I rose to speak. He said that the Public Service was to a large extent actually being used as a training field for the private sector. The Public Service Commission has tried all ways and means of training young men for the Public Service. It does everything to acquaint them with the activities of the Public Service and to inform them properly so that they may be able to do their work. We are doing everything in our power to train these people and to grant them bursaries so that they may pursue specific courses of study. However, it so often happens that these people, once they have been trained properly, are snatched up by the private sector. This is in actual fact something we can I not avoid. After all, it is common knowledge <span class="col_4461-4462" refersTo="page_0718"/>that Government Departments cannot set about matters in the same way as the private sector does. It is not so easy for us, when a person applies for a post, simply to make an adjustment in accordance with his needs and his requirements and his qualifications. Certain scales have been laid down. From the nature of the case it is, in view of the complicated machinery of the Public Service, inevitable for us to have complicated machinery of salary determination. The hon. member for Green Point will agree with me that, when a person is approached by a private firm and he is not satisfied with the salary offered to him, the owner of that concern can very easily say to him that they are prepared to pay him an additional R1,000 per year. These people do not even apply; they are approached by the private sector. From the nature of the case we have the problem that we cannot do so in the Public Service. I think that the hon. members on that side will realize that this cannot be done in the Public Service. Just take the Police as an example. Even in the Police Service we are also losing many men. Picture to yourself a young man who goes to the Police College after having matriculated or even after Std. VIII. In the College he is disciplined. Admittedly, he is not being trained to ply a certain trade; he may not be trained in commerce, but he is disciplined, polished and prepared for life. Once he has been in the Police Service for a few years, he receives an attractive offer from outside, not because he has received special training, but because he is a disciplined person, the way we trained him in the Public Service. These are the problems we have to contend with. We should merely ask ourselves what can be done in order to cope with this problem. As far as I am concerned, I assume that this matter will probably be discussed in greater detail under my Vote. I shall gladly listen to the suggestions hon. members opposite are able to make. Once they have done so, I shall reply to them and be able to say whether something has already been done along those lines.</p>

<p>However, we are continually engaged in training people for the Public Service. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to training which had to be provided. He said that promotion should be granted on merit and that bursaries had to be made available. All those things are being done. I can just give the assurance that in recent times this has been done to a greater extent than was ever the case in the past. Administrative training has already been given to more than 1,600 senior officials. During 1967-&#x2019;68 symposiums were held on physical, economic and social planning. At a later stage the symposiums were repeatedly supplemented so as to include additional aspects of public finances, the computer and administrative aids, communication in the Public Service and leadership. All these steps are being taken in order to train our people. In addition there are all the incentives we are using to encourage them to improve their academic qualifications for the Public Service and for the work they are performing. We are doing so by making bursaries available. Take the Department of Justice as an example. The hon. the Minister of Justice will be able to tell us about all the things that are being done by that Department. However, this is. not the only Department; other departments are also doing it. The hon. the Minister will be able to tell you, Sir, what that Department is doing so that bursaries may be made available to young men in order to enable them to go to university or even to study while they are in the service of the State. By means of these bursaries they can train themselves and make themselves available for the service of the State. In addition a great deal is being done in order to bring about reorganization in the Public Service. In this way attempts are being made to make the Public Service function more smoothly. By these means certain posts are eliminated. With this saving in respect of posts, 7,200 posts in the Public Service were either abolished or prevented from being created. From the nature of the case this constitutes a tremendous saving for South Africa in equipment, accommodation and capital expenditure, apart from salaries. Such a saving is being effected by means of better working methods.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should just like to say that it is very easy to talk. However, it is much more difficult to do something. We are aware to-day that the only thing that really counts, is the salaries. Time and again we are outbid by the private sector. Our great difficulty is that when we improve salaries, the private sector comes along and tenders slightly more and pays more. I admit that there were years when the Public Service had something which the private sector could not offer. However, to a large extent those circumstances no longer prevail to-day. Formerly the Public Service used to offer its employees security. It offered something which the private sector could not offer. At that time our private sector was not what it is to-day. It was not as extensive and available to the man who sought employment as it is now. That is why they used to say: &#x201C;Join the Public Service because it offers security.&#x201D; To-day we find, however, that the security which the Public Service offers, is also being offered by the private sector to as large an extent. An employee did not only know that he had security and that he would receive his salary at the end of the month; he also knew that when he retired, he would receive a pension. This was, so to speak, something that was unknown in the private sector. However, to-day this is no longer the case. Consequently we have the position to-day where we have to compete with the private sector on an equal footing. Previously we used to have an advantage because of the security which attached to the Public Service. That is something we must take into account. In fact, the only thing that really counts to-day, is the money, the salaries, the rands and the cents. We shall have to try to remedy the position in <span class="col_4463-4464" refersTo="page_0719"/>that way. I agree that incentives, the considera tion of merit, the training, holiday savings bonuses, holiday allowances, and whatever goes hand in hand with them, pension contributions, etc., are all factors which play a part to a certain extent. However, after all is said and done, it is really the money that counts. Hon. members will recall that the Government announced improvements in the conditions of service of public servants in March last year. These improvements cost R25 million. In November last year improvements in salaries to the amount of R85 million were announced. This amount is, admittedly, not being spent immediately, but over a period of two years, i.e. as from 1st April this year and then again as from 1st April next year. These two amounts come to a total of R110 million. The hon. the Minister of Finance announced in his Budget speech this year that an amount of R15 million was available for the adjustments which had to be made in pursuance of the recommendations of the M&#x00FC;nnig Commission. That is to say, an amount of R125 million has been appropriated in the course of one year in respect of the improvement of conditions of service, salaries and the necessary adjustments in the Public Service.</p>

<p>I should just like to round off the matter to which the hon. member for Pinetown referred. I think the hon. member is aware that a national co-ordinating advisory committee was appointed as far back as November, 1968, for the purpose of consulting with the private sector. This committee also has to investigate the present state of automation and work out a future pattern for the Public Service. This, then, is what has been done in regard to the matters to which the hon. member referred. However, we have gone much further than that. The committee of the Scientific Advisory Council is at present engaged in an inquiry into the use of electronic computers by professional officers in State Departments and in semi-State organizations. The Government has already made available an amount of R10,000 for the services of an expert consultant, who will make an exhaustive investigation into the matter in respect of the present types of computers and the need for and the possibility of integrating these computers in a central network in order that the most economic utilization of this type of apparatus may be effected. This consultant has already taken up his duties. In other words, what the hon. member suggested, is already in operation and, from the nature of the case, the benefits will accrue later on.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Prime Minister asked that proposals should be made by this side of the House as to how the manpower shortage in the Public Service could be alleviated. The hon. the Prime Minister then quoted figures to show how the salaries of public servants had improved since the &#x2019;thirties. It would seem to me as if the primary reason why we have such a critical manpower shortage in our Public Service is to be found in the figures that were given to us by the hon. the Prime Minister. The hon. the Prime Minister showed that the salaries of clerks had increased by approximately 450 per cent during this period, whereas the salaries of secretaries of departments had only increased by 165 per cent. From the nature of the case this is one of our problems.</p>

<p>I raised this matter in the Budget debate, but there was no reaction from the hon. the Minister. That is why I hope that I may repeat it. Experts in this field say that the salaries in a service such as the Public Service should have a gradient curve of approximately .6. However, we raised the salaries of those people who are at the bottom of the scale but did not raise those of the people at the top of the scale on the same basis. Consequently the gradient of this entire line has changed. I am told that the gradient in the Public Service represents a gradient of .15 at present. The shallower this curve is, the fewer opportunities there are for promotion for the officials in the Service. This, in turn, gives rise to more and more frustration. Throughout the world it has been found that the shallower this curve, the greater the number of vacancies. I think this is one of the major contributory factors to the shortage of manpower in our Public Service. I have told hon. members on a previous occasion that if a person with an M.Sc. degree joined the Public Service and regard is had to his losses in earnings while having received his training, it would take him 15 years before he caught up with the total earnings of a matriculant. Consequently we no longer obtain the services of people of this calibre in the Public Service. I have said previously, and I want to repeat it, that when these new salary scales will have come into operation in 1971, only I per cent of our teachers will be earning R7,000 per annum. I accept that this submission is true, because it has not yet been repudiated from that side of the House. If this is the case, then, surely, it shows that the entire situation is being handled wrongly. Surely our teaching profession means more to us than that only I per cent of the teachers should earn more than R7,000 per annum.</p>

<p>I think that there are other factors in connection with this matter. We touched upon these factors on previous occasions as well. The reaction of the responsible Ministers, and here I am thinking of the Minister of Economic Affairs, was so inadequate and so unsatisfactory that we dare not leave it at that. I am referring here to the fact that there is more and more interference on the part of the Government in the normal economic process in our country. I think that this is one of the concomitant factors which are responsible for the shortage of manpower in the Public Service. I should like to show how this works in practice. To start with, there are more and <span class="col_4465-4466" refersTo="page_0720"/>more control measures; the ordinary industrialist is more and more subject to control measures by the State. If an industrialist here in the Western Cape wants to employ one additional Bantu he has to apply to four different State Departments or agencies to obtain approval for doing so. With all these control measures which are in force it is no wonder that there is a shortage of Public Servants. Our industrialists are labouring to-day under a greater measure of inflexibility than do industrialists in other countries in so far as the application of manpower is concerned. This is holding up the entire economic process. Last year the fixed investment in industry decreased by 19 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am glad that you are also acquainted with the same book, because in that case it would appear to me that we are on the same wavelength as regards this matter. John Stuart Mill said a hundred years ago that all a government had to do in respect of the economic process, was to maintain law and order. In the second place, the government had to create the framework which would enable economic progress to take place; to-day we would refer to the infra-structure. In the third place, the government had to make available the date which would make long-term planning possible. In the fourth place, the government had to act as judge and arbitrator whenever conflict developed between clashing elements. My whole argument is that the Government is deviating completely from this basic approach. The Government goes much further than that; I only raised the question of control measures. Now I should like to show you how this should fit in in practice. I want to refer you to our Public Service. I am told that the number of voters who in South Africa to-day are dependent on a livelihood offered by the Government and on its auxiliary services, already comes to nearly half a million people. Let us assume that each of these people has only one dependent who is entitled to vote, then it means that more than 50 per cent of the electorate of South Africa are working directly for the State. This is my challenge to the hon. the Prime Minister: I ask him to name one single country in the world where more than 50 per cent of the voters are dependent on the State and its auxiliary services for their livelihood. There is no other country in the world where this is the case.</p>

<p>There is a third way in which this matter can be illustrated, and that is the extent to which the Government itself intervenes directly in the industrial process and competes with ordinary industrialists. I am thinking of Iscor and all the other similar organizations. We are told that at present there are more than 20 of them. In 1965 these public utility organizations were responsible for more than 20 per cent of the capital formation in the public sector. There is no other country in the world where a spirit of free enterprise obtains and where such conditions are found. I am asking the hon. the Prime Minister again to name one other country where the government guides such a large part of the national income into its own channels.</p>

<p>No, I am referring to voters, and that is why I elaborated on the argument and said that if each of those employees had one dependant, it would mean that nearly half a million people in South Africa were dependent on the State and all its auxiliary services for their livelihood. If you do not agree with that, you must furnish us with your figures.</p>

<p><span class="col_4467-4468" refersTo="page_0721"/>It would appear to me that in the early forties, when a so-called draft republican constitution was drawn up, that constitution indicated, <i>inter alia,</i> that all economic power should eventually be in the hands of the government and of the state. It would appear to me that this is what the Government is headed for at present. Would the hon. the Prime Minister repudiate that this so-called constitution of the forties is applicable now&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Hillbrow referred to our public servants at the beginning of his speech. I should like to point out to him that there are many opportunities available to the public servants in South Africa, and that these opportunities are created on the basis of their ability. I do not think I can quote to him a better example than that of Major-General Van den Bergh, of whom mention was made here today. Major-General Van den Bergh is a capable man. In the course of the afternoon the hon. member for Yeoville commented on speeches that had been made here. However, I first want to say something further about the thoughts expressed here by the hon. member for Hillbrow as regards the question of promotion. I also heard something about possible promotion for the hon. member for Yeoville. This was not in his constituency nor in mine. I heard that some promotion might be in store for the hon. member. The first is that he might retire from politics and the second is that he may cross over to the National Party. I want to say this to the hon. member for Yeoville. If there is a possibility that he may be promoted, he should think again, because I do not know whether this side of the House will be prepared to accept such promotion.</p>

<p>On an occasion such as this I think it is a good thing if we also consider another matter apart from the question of security. We should also consider our youth, who also fall under this Vote of the hon. the Prime Minister as well. During the past few years we tried to consolidate the messages contained in speeches made by the hon. the Prime Minister and in his actions. I have the messages here, and I just want to say that they outnumber the members on the Opposition side. I found one message of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, a message which reads, &#x201C;Vote for the United Party&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The youth of South Africa does not only seek leaders; they seek messages as well. The messages required by the youth of South Africa are to be found with the hon. the Prime Minister. He is a person who gives us messages; he is a person who gives us guiding principles. The interests of our country go further than only sport and recreation. However, we must realize to-night that the opportunities of our youth as regards sport and recreation suffered a grievous blow at the hands of that side of the House, including the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. We have sufficient confidence in our hon. Prime Minister, however, to know that opportunities will be created for the young people of the Republic to realize themselves not only as sportsmen and sportswomen, but also as young leaders. Much is still going to be demanded from our young people in future. However, I know that the young people on this side of the House are following a good course because they know the course they are following; moreover, it is a fine course. The young people who belong to this side of the House think along sound lines, because they are thinking along the lines of what they have to give our future generations. The young people who belong to this side of this House are planning along sound lines, because they are planning a course which is similar to the one which this side of the House has been following for the past 21 years. On this note I want to ask you, Sir, that the House be adjourned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened to many debates in this House over the years, but never have I listened to such dismal speeches as those made by hon. members opposite on the question of the Civil Service of this country. It seems to me it is taken for granted by all hon. members on that side of the House&#x2014;we hear this cry from all sides&#x2014;that the Civil Service cannot compete with the private sector. It is time the Government realized that they must compete with the private sector, and what is more, they must place themselves in the position where they can compete with new ideas. Other countries have had to face this problem, and they have faced up to it by going out and fighting the private sector for the country&#x2019;s talent. One of the first things the Government should do is to consider how to compete with the private sector. This is not a new lesson. I should like to refer hon. members to the report of the Coalbrook disaster where the great mining and financial companies told the Government quite plainly how they felt. They said to the Government, &#x201C;You employ a Government Mining Engineer at a salary of R8,000 p.a., and he has to compete and argue with men whom we are paying R25,000 p.a. How can you expect to get the high standard of men you must have&#x003F;&#x201D; The state of affairs runs right through the professional side of this recruiting campaign. How can the service expect to get and keep the men the Civil Service should have&#x003F; I wish to point out that there is more to being a civil servant than being a high-salaried man in the private sector. We must make this plain to people.</p>

<p>There are also other ways by which to recruit staff for the Civil Service. We can recruit, like other governments are doing, by placing advertisements which compete with the private sector, by advertisements which attract people to join the service.</p>

<from><span class="col_4469-4470" refersTo="page_0722"/>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>How are you going to attract them&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I am not an advertising agent. We must make every effort to keep our elder men employed, even after they have received their pension. We must let them make use of their knowledge without placing upon them the heavy responsibility of being secretaries or heads of departments or responsibilities of that nature. Men who have great knowledge of the service, responsible people, should be employed, because they can still do a hard day&#x2019;s work. As long as they are capable of doing it, they should be allowed to do it, and indeed encouraged to do it.</p>

<p>Then there is something which I am sure has never been considered in Civil Service recruiting operations. I am talking of the man who, through no fault of his own, is unemployed at 40. This position is becoming worse in this country because of the mergers between commercial and industrial companies, and then there are always senior executives thrown out of work with, perhaps, a year&#x2019;s salary. Well, a year&#x2019;s salary for a man of 40 is not going to carry him very far, not if he has a family and other commitments to meet. These men are excellent men. These men are looking for Work. They are the men who should be recruited into the ranks of the Civil Service, as is done in some cases. There are many professional men and many scientific men, not burnt-out men but scientists capable of doing administrative work and professional men capable of professional work, who can be employed in the Civil Service. I am told that work in the Deeds Offices are many months in arrear. Many of these unemployed men could be used there.</p>
