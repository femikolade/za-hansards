<heading>Employment of Coloured females as clerks in Cape Town bank</heading>

<question by="#suzman" to="#minister_of_labour">

<num>*5.</num>

<from>Mrs. H. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a report that an official of his Department in Cape Town has vetoed the appointment of Coloured girls as clerks in a commercial bank;</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_labour" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF LABOUR:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) An official of a local commercial bank recently telephoned the enquiry section of my Department&#x2019;s office in Cape Town regarding the possibility of employing Coloured female machine operators. He was informed that there was no legislation in force which prohibited such employment but that the bank should submit its enquiry in writing. On the 3rd February, 1969, a letter to this effect was directed to the Department&#x2019;s local office and arrangements were made by the Divisional Inspector of Labour to discuss the matter personally with the Bank&#x2019;s representative. During the interview which took place on 21st February, 1969 it was pointed out by the Divisional Inspector that a large number of European females who were suitable for this type of work were registered in Cape Town as unemployed and that in the light of section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act he could not support the Bank&#x2019;s proposal but would have to submit a report on the matter to the Department&#x2019;s Head Office. In the meantime the Bank had already taken steps to recruit suitable Coloureds through the Department&#x2019;s local non-White employment section but after the above interview the Bank itself decided to advise the Coloureds that they could not be engaged.<br/>I may add that during the interview the Bank&#x2019;s representative admitted that the proposed employment of Coloureds did not originate from a shortage of Whites. He in fact added that the Bank itself had a waiting list of matriculated girls but that employees with such qualifications frequently resigned due to the nature of the work involved.</li>

<heading>Fly shunting in Durban</heading>

<question by="#winchester" to="#minister_of_transport">

<num>*10.</num>

<from>Mr. L. E. D. WINCHESTER</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he has received a report on fly shunting in Durban; if so, from whom;</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#winchester">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) and (2) Following recent press reports concerning alleged irregularities in the shunting of petrol tank wagons at Durban, the matter was investigated by the System Manager, Durban, and it was established that fly shunting as such was at no time permitted or performed. The press reports referred to a local arrangement in Durban which allowed a shunting locomotive to be uncoupled while the trucks were still in motion, but this was done only when sufficient shunters were available to operate the handbrakes and to bring the trucks to a standstill at the appointed place. Because of the very slow movement of the trucks and the fact that sufficient shunters were in attendance to apply the handbrakes, there was, in fact, no danger in this method of working.

<ol>

<li>This method of working was introduced as a local arrangement to expedite shunting operations but, as it depended on the availability of more shunters than would be required for normal working, it has been discontinued. Tests are now being conducted in marshalling yards with radio apparatus (walkie-talkies) to provide communication between drivers and shunters which will expedite the work and make it possible to reduce the number of shunters normally required.</li></ol></li>

<heading>DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL BOTANIC GARDENS</heading>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>I move the motion as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of lending every possible support to the conservation, publicizing and study of our rich botanical heritage by means of increased assistance in developing the National Botanic Gardens of South Africa with headquarters at Kirstenbosch.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, most of us are aware of the great wealth of flora and fauna in our country, but generally speaking, I do not think we have enough knowledge to estimate and appreciate at its true value our exceptional heritage of flora and fauna. With this motion I therefore hope to gain not only the support of the Government but also to focus the attention of <span class="col_3015-3016" refersTo="page_1531"/>the public outside on this particular wealth and how it should be treated and how we can expand our knowledge of it.</p>

<p>The motion refers specifically to the conservation, publicizing and study of our rich botanical heritage. Not only is a request being made for increased financial support, as further indicated in the motion, but the request reads that this must be done in a particular manner, and this is important as far as this motion is concerned. It asks for the development of a particular organization, the National Botanic Gardens with its headquarters at Kirstenbosch, and here I want to state at once that this motion does not concern Kirstenbosch as such. Kirstenbosch is the headquarters of this State-aided institution, and Kirstenbosch is also a place which is known not only in South Africa but throughout the world. That is why it is of particular significance that the name Kirstenbosch should be mentioned here. In addition, what is involved here is not only nature conservation and plant conservation in general; what is involved is how the task has to be carried in order to obtain the best results in the conservation of our flora, and even the fauna. A great deal is being done for nature conservation and in particular for the conservation of our flora, and is in fact being done to such an extent that we may ask whether, in certain fields, it does not verge on the exaggerated a little. That is why it is important that we should put this entire matter in its correct perspective and see what the best way of tackling this major task is.</p>

<p>I therefore deem it necessary to make it very clear here that the National Botanic Gardens of South Africa is performing its task in an exceptional way. This exceptional way in which it is fulfilling its task is summarized very well by the Director, Prof. Rycroft, in an edition of <i>Lantern</i> of September, 1963, in which he writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The objects of the Gardens are, briefly, scientific and educational; to collect, to cultivate, to display, to distribute, to study, to make known and to preserve the indigenous flora of South Africa. The National Botanic Gardens of South Africa is a unique establishment in that it is probably the only botanic garden in the world worthy of the name, that is exclusively concerned with the flora of its own country, and as such deserves the fullest support and consideration of the Government, local authorities and the people of South Africa. It is indeed a national institution in the truest sense.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is why I am referring specifically, in the first place, to this particular organization and the task which it is fulfilling in this direction. Here we have an undertaking which is supported by the State, but which is not only receiving support from the State; it is also being supported by an organization known as the Botanic Association of South Africa, of which there are 5,000 members. In my opinion we therefore have an ideal constitution here. People do not come forward and say that the State must do this, that or the other; people come forward and say: &#x201C;We are doing this and that is what we want to promote, and we would like the assistance of the State and public bodies for this particular task.&#x201D; This is in my opinion a very sound basis on which to approach our problems, namely that we draw as many people as possible into it and arouse their interest.</p>

<p>The Botanic Gardens which have been established and are to be established by the National Botanic Gardens of South Africa envisage the collection of plants from surrounding areas and even areas further afield in order to plant them, not only to protect and conserve them where necessary, but in particular to display them to the public by means of attractive planting and display. In this way knowledge and a greater appreciation of our botanical heritage is cultivated, and this stimulates the conservation thereof. The city dweller, who so often sits hemmed in in a concrete jungle, but also the town dweller and the country dweller become acquainted in this way with our flora in a more personal way, and not in the superficial way which we often find when we only have nature reserves.</p>

<p>One educational aspect of the National Botanic Gardens must be emphasized, namely the inculcation of the importance of the protection of our indigenous flora everywhere, and to assist in the establishment and maintenance of regional gardens, where local inhabitants can become personally acquainted with the plants of their region and where they can also learn how to cultivate them and obtain expert advice in this regard. The concern is exclusively with plants here and not with animals. By means of close liaison with the Botanic Association of South Africa the distribution of seed is undertaken and facilitated and, information and instruction in regard to the cultivation of flowers and plants is supplied, which leads to greater acquaintance with and a cultivation of a love for what is our own. By concentrating the planting of this flora in specific areas the plants in the Gardens are accessible to the public and are a showcase for the tourist, the city dweller and other visitors. There is consequently a very clear distinction between a botanical garden and a nature reserve, and I think it is important that I should point out that difference. It is also important that I point which bodies in this country are concerning themselves with the conservation of our flora and our wild life. If all the bodies and individuals who are to lesser or greater degree active in regard to nature conservation were listed, it would indeed be an impressive list, and if we look at the surface area involved, then it is so impressive that one feels that possibly too much is being done in the direction of nature conservation.</p>

<p>I want to sum up very briefly what is in fact being done for nature conservation in this country. The bodies concerned in this are in <span class="col_3017-3018" refersTo="page_1532"/>the first instance the National Parks Board. The National Parks Board has six parks in the Cape. The largest of these is the Gemsbok National Park with a surface area of 1,119,000 morgen. In the Transvaal there is the well-known Kruger National Park with a surface area of more than two million morgen, where particular attention is given to flora and fauna. In the Orange Free State there is the Golden Gate National Park, but in Natal the parks are not controlled by the National Parks Board. In addition we have the Department of Forestry which concerns itself with this particular task. The Department controls mountain catchment areas with a total surface area of 1.2 million morgen, and the Department exercises control over 63 nature reserves with a surface area of 16,000 morgen. Then, too, we have the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. The National Botanic Gardens falls under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services as a result of an Act which was passed by this Parliament in 1966, and since 1967 the National Botanic Gardens has fallen under the control of this Department. There are 17 other State-aided institutions which fall under other Departments. Under the direct control of this Department there is also the Botanical Research Institute which includes, <i>inter alia,</i> the Pretoria National Botanic Gardens. These National Botanic Gardens in Pretoria, which are controlled by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, differ widely from the National Botanic Gardens of South Africa which is a State-aided institution. In Pretoria the idea is that plant material or plants, which have been collected from all over the country, are cultivated there for research purposes. These National Botanic Gardens are in reality therefore what is called a &#x201C;living herbarium&#x201D;. It is very difficult to undertake research with dry material and with what is available in ordinary herbariums. That is why these gardens have been laid out in Pretoria for our scientists, and there are more than 4,000 different kinds of indigenous plants there, where they are available for research purposes.</p>

<p>The next bodies are the Provincial Administrations. In Natal the Natal Parks, Game and Fish Preservation Board controls 26 parks and reserves. Unfortunately I was unable to obtain information in regard to the surface area but it must be considerable. In South-West Africa there are nine parks, game reserves and reserves, of which the Etosha pan is by far the largest and comprises 4.7 million morgen. In the Transvaal the province, besides what the National Parks Board has there, has 17 nature reserves with a surface area of 60,000 morgen, but there are 387 private nature reserves with a surface area of more than one million morgen. To place the extent of nature conservation in its correct perspective, I just want to mention that one tenth of the Transvaal&#x2019;s surface area of 109,600 square miles, has been set aside for nature conservation. I am mentioning these figures because it is important that we should take cognizance of what has already been done, and it may then be asked why more should be done. That is why I emphasize that more should be done in a particular way, and for this purpose large surface areas are not required.</p>

<p>Apart from the bodies which I have already mentioned, we still have the municipalities with natural gardens or reserves, and in the Cape the Divisional Council has six nature reserves. In addition we have institutes for biology or nature conservation at our universities, and there is a long list of bodies which are concerning themselves with this very important task. However, it is necessary that the entire matter should be seen in its correct perspective, and that the love which the nation is displaying for our natural heritage should be channelized, guided and placed on a sound basis. For this knowledge and a scientific basis is necessary. I make so bold as to say that the National Botanic Gardens of South Africa, as a result of the premises which I have already mentioned, is the most suitable institution and one which deserves the support of the Government, individuals and public bodies. We have a great deal to say about the conservation of our soil, but in my opinion, our greatest ally in the conservation of our soil is our vegetation; that which covers our soil. This is the cardinal point. If we treat our vegetation with loving care, the task of conserving the soil has presented itself automatically. Apart from Kirstenbosch the National Botanic Gardens control other establishments in the Cape, and I should like to bring the extent of their activities to your attention. There is the Karoo Garden at Worcester, and a few other less well-known places, to which I shall return if time allows. What is important however is that the National Botanic Gardens is now spreading its wings and making the rest of the country aware that our vegetation ought to be conserved. The Kirstenbosch gardens have been in existence since 1913, and it is only now that we have gone so far as to establish gardens in other provinces.</p>

<p>One of the first places where efforts are being made to do something constructive in this regard is the Free State. For the Drakensberg there is the Eastern Free State Botanic Gardens at Harrismith which were recently established, and also the Orange Free State Botanic Gardens at Bloemfontein. Perhaps you will now ask why there are two gardens. I want to mention to you that at Harrismith the idea is that vegetation which grows above 5,000 above sea level and is to be found in the Drakensberg area will be collected there so that the public can see it, whereas in Bloemfontein the vegetation which is more peculiar to the Free State will be collected. Then there is also the possibility of the establishment of a garden at Nelspruit in the Eastern Lowveld, and what inspires me to-day in particular is to fulfil the task of pleading for your support. I have a love for the vegetation of the Lowveld. Because I am a person who grew up there and who appreciates it, I would very much like my fellowmen to share in this love <span class="col_3019-3020" refersTo="page_1533"/>and the particular value which these plants have for us. In addition the takeover of the botanic gardens in Pietermaritzburg has been envisaged, in which case the existing controlling organization would transfer it to the central organization in order to try to obtain better results in this way. We therefore have a nicely balanced, although perhaps not perfect distribution. I hope that the assistance which we will receive will be of such a nature that we will at least be able to develop these gardens which exist and those which are being envisaged to such an extent that in the other provinces, apart from the gardens which will still be developed in the Cape, these gardens will serve as a stimulus for the public and will carry their appreciation for our vegetation to even greater heights.</p>

<p>I also want to make particular mention of the assistance which this association of local bodies have received. I want to emphasize that we are not only asking for assistance from the State, but for contributions from other bodies and individuals as well. I went into this matter and I want to mention specifically here that the contributions from Harrismith and Nelspruit were more than 70 cents per inhabitant. In Bloemfontein the contribution was 10 cents per inhabitant. I was, however, very disappointed to discover that Capetonians and the Municipality of Cape Town only contributes 1 cent per inhabitant. I should like to place even further emphasis on this matter, because it is to my mind a deplorable state of affairs that people who are so well provided with natural beauty and a wealth of flowers do so little and simply take it for granted. In one of the publications on Kirstenbosch it is stated that &#x201C;The people of Cape Town are well known for the complacency&#x201D;. I found this particularly striking and I do not want to criticize people unnecessarily, but I feel that great emphasis must be placed on this matter.</p>

<p>I want to go further and express my gratitude to the State for the assistance which has been granted. During the past financial year R184,000 has been spent on Kirstenbosch, of which R119,000 was contributed by the State. This contribution is particularly important, because it was possible by that means to complete a dam at Kirstenbosch holding 11 million gallons of water. Every year during the dry summer months the shortage of water made it very difficult to keep up the appearance of the cultivated area of Kirstenbosch. However, with the assistance of the State it has been possible to build that fine dam there, and this will be of great value in the future. According to estimates, approximately 400,000 people visit Kirstenbosch every year, and it is therefore very important that these people are placed in a position where they can fulfil this task in such a way that visitors will be able to observe with pleasure, joy and satisfaction what is being done there. In this country, in spite of what I have just said, our rich botanical heritage often failed to enjoy the attention it ought to have enjoyed. Long before our cultivators and the general public began to estimate the true value of our flora, botanists from England, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Australia and probably other countries as well undertook the task of improving the plants. South Africa had to import gladioli which were sent overseas from this country and improved there. Flowers such as barberton daisies, geraniums, pelargoniums and nemesias were taken abroad from this country, improved there, and brought back. Many of us were not even aware that they were our own flowers. In America and New Zealand our proteas, pin-cushions and heath are being commercially cultivated. Our heath has in fact been popular with gardeners in England for more than 100 years. I was struck recently to learn that a botanist, on a visit to Moscow, saw fine displays of geraniums along the avenues. The layman would not have known this, but those geraniums had their origin in South Africa. For such a person who had the knowledge it was in fact extraordinary to see the plants from his own country in these particular circumstances. To sum up I want to point out that in South Africa there are probably between 16,000 and 20,000 species of plants. There are probably more in the Cape Peninsula, where, according to estimate, there are 2,600 species of plants, than in the entire British Isles where it is estimated that there are approximately 2,000 species of plants. If we take the heather family for example we see that, according to estimates, there are approximately 800 different species in the entire world, and that 602 species of heather are to be found in the South-Western Cape. The same applies to a certain extent to irises, proteas and lilies. It is therefore a fact that we are dealing with something exceptional here which we are not always aware of. It is very necessary that attention be given to this matter and that we receive the necessary support, not only from the authorities, but also from other bodies.</p>

<p>I just want to mention briefly that Kirstenbosch, which is at the moment and will probably remain the most important gardens, was established in 1913 when Professor Pearson, who also came from abroad, performed this task with great enthusiasm and showed the people what an exceptional opportunity existed here of displaying our flora there. Since then the Karoo Botanic Garden at Worcester, the Harold Porter Botanic Gardens at Betty&#x2019;s Bay, the Drakensberg and Eastern Free State Botanic Gardens at Harrismith, the Orange Free State Botanic Gardens at Bloemfontein and the envisaged gardens at Nelspruit were established. In addition there are other smaller gardens which, owing to lack of money, could not be developed. I want to conclude by giving a short historic survey of Kirstenbosch. Kirstenbosch is also of historic value. There is a wild almond lane which the Company planted there in 1660 to serve as the boundary of their settlement and also to keep the Hottentots, who were stealing their cattle, out. <span class="col_3021-3022" refersTo="page_1534"/>This lane has been declared an historic monument. During the course of years various people stayed at Kirstenbosch, <i>inter alia,</i> a certain Kirsten, an official of the Company after whom the gardens are presumably named. Subsequently a certain Dirk Eksteen purchased the property. In 1895 the property was bought by Cecil John Rhodes as part of his idea to conserve the eastern slopes of Table Mountain and Devil&#x2019;s Peak as a national park for the nation of South Africa. Through the serious efforts of Professor Pearson these beautiful and exceptional gardens were established. In 1922 320 morgen of land from the Department of Forests was added, and at the moment the surface area of Kirstenbosch covers 566 morgen and extends from a height of 300 ft. to 3,500 ft. above sea level to the top of Table Mountain. Of this there are only 30 morgen to-day which are being intensely cultivated where the public can view the planted flora. Here 4,000 species of South African plants have already been planted.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to the envisaged gardens at Nelspruit, and I want to address an invitation to all who visit Nelspruit and the Eastern Lowveld to pay a visit there in the future. When I think of our beautiful trees and of our flowers there which have not yet come to the attention of our public, I should like to refer to the beautiful lesser varieties, i.e. thunder trees, kiaat trees, marula trees, African wattle, the water berry, the sand apple and the Transvaal ebony which can be planted there. In particular I should also like to mention the impala lily. Which hon. members have ever seen an impala lily?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that an appeal such as we have just heard from the hon. member who has just sat down is never likely to fall on deaf ears on this side of the House. With a matter of this kind I think the hon. member and those who think like him can rely upon our support. The hon. member has given an exposition in regard to Kirstenbosch and the approach of that institution and of the institutions of a similar nature which it is instituting in other provinces. He also painted some of the facets of the beauty and the value of our various botanical species we have in this country. I want to say at once that we are supporting the hon. member. I would have liked his motion to have been drawn on a wider scale and not narrowed down so much, because it limits us to a certain extent in what we may discuss here to-day.</p>

<p>I want to take a different line to that which the hon. member has covered fairly adequately in the speech he has just made. I want to come to the value of this institution, Kirstenbosch, and its branch institutions which it is establishing elsewhere and the part those institutions can play from a scientific point of view, not only in regard to agriculture, but also in regard to many other aspects. We must remember that perhaps part of our difficulty and that of the hon. member in going to the Government with a request for further financial assistance for Kirstenbosch arises from the fact of its own title. It is looked upon as a garden and a place where people can go to see beautiful flowers. This can be very misleading and it makes the hon. member&#x2019;s task more difficult, because when he asks for money for a garden, then the real fundamental values which are implicit in the existence of Kirstenbosch are likely to be overlooked. Those values, and it is true some of them are associated with the wonderful flowers that can be produced there in profusion, are nevertheless much more widely based than that in terms of scientific value to South Africa.</p>

<p>I would say in passing that with every year that passes new techniques, new methods, and new instruments which are being used by scientists to evaluate our natural flora in South Africa and all those matters associated with the natural flora, are increasing year by year. New techniques are being evolved in other countries and being picked up very quickly by our scientists in South Africa, and some of the techniques are being evolved in South Africa and then adopted by other countries. The hon. member referred to some of our beautiful flowers which are being domesticated in countries overseas, and unfortunately we have domesticated some of the plants from other countries here in South Africa, much to our dislike. I leave it to my colleagues to deal with that aspect presently. I must admit I was very interested when I heard certain things mentioned in a S.A.B.C. broadcast the other day. Usually I do not listen to the S.A.B.C. with any great pleasure, but on this occasion the visiting Minister of Agriculture of Western Australia was being interviewed on the radio. He dealt with one of our watsonias which has become a pest in his country, and said: &#x201C;I wish you would take it all back to South Africa.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Here is a particular bloom of which we are proud and it appeared from what was said that this species finds its home and its only home in South Africa in a very limited area around Port Elizabeth. It has not spread in its own homeland, but it has gone to Western Australia and it has become a pest there. So not only techniques but also plants travel round the world. Their value is appreciated and developed in one part of the world, but it may not be appreciated and developed elsewhere. We have to thank some of our own development in connection with forestry to this. Some of our forestry development is based upon eucalyptus and what is commonly called a wattle, the acacias, which come from <span class="col_3023-3024" refersTo="page_1535"/>Australian sources. In terms of economic value these developments to-day run into many millions of rands per annum. We must not lose sight of this side of the matter when we talk about the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens, and so forth. The idea of a garden gives us the wrong impression. We are only at the beginning of the appreciation of the scientific value of our own flora and fauna, but certainly flora for the purposes of this discussion. As I said, these new techniques are being extended year by year and, because we do not have the means of evaluating, we have failed to appreciate much of what is available underfoot here in our own country. We see a plant like the Welwitsia Miribilis from South-West Africa.</p>

<p>What is the position in regard to a plant like that? People see it and they say: &#x201C;This is a wonderful plant, how does it manage to exist under these desert conditions?&#x201D; Then someone writes a little article and says it has a very long tap root or it has an underground stem, its roots go down a long way, it draws on sub-terranean sources of water, and that sort of thing. Then they talk about golf or race-horsing or something or other and they forget all about one of the most remarkable plants that we have got in the whole of Southern Africa. As far as I have been able to ascertain we have learnt no lessons from it, but perhaps we are not in a position to evaluate the lessons we can learn from that one plant. A similar position exists in regard to the scores of varieties of plants which we have got. Perhaps we are not able to evaluate them.</p>

<p>Let us look at homo sapiens for a moment as an example of what I am trying to indicate. We have new techniques and new instruments for evaluating some aspects of the daily lives of human beings which until a few years ago were quite unknown because they were never recognized. It has taken all the years right up until a few years ago for somebody to get up and question how it is, for example, that the Patagonians can live in a climate which is bitterly cold with no clothing on them. They do not have warm furs and coats and that sort of thing. How does it come about that they can endure that cold? How is it that there are people up in the Arctic Circle who do use warm clothing but who get most of their food from bitterly ice-cold water? They spend hours and hours on end in that cold water getting shellfish with their bare hands. How do they manage that? Why do they not lose their hands and feet from frostbite? It was never questioned. They were also people, they were part of homo sapiens and nobody worried much about it. It was not given a thought until somebody came along and questioned it. It was found, as you no doubt know, Sir, that up in the north people who were descended from Mongoloids stock have a special blood system in their bodies and that their hands and feet can get 50 per cent more blood pumped to them in any given time than people from Caucasoid stock. Up in the north where you have descendants of Caucasoid stock and of Mongoloid stock, the Mongols can stand that cold water and the Caucasoid stock cannot. Therefore the one group find their food among shellfish and in the water and the other group find it from reindeer and from the land, because of their own physical properties built into them.</p>

<p>Our plants are like that also. We have plants that can withstand drought, we have plants that can stand up to the natural conditions of life here in a certain climate which we have got, the soil conditions, and so forth. But plants do not stand in isolation, separated from the rest of the living world, they stand as communities. A community is not only a plant community but it is a community where there are birds, animals and insects and the whole of the living life which form our set-up here in South Africa. It is the study of the community which can bring so much benefit to South Africa, but we need money and we need trained scientists who will question and evaluate, and we need the money to train them and to keep them here in South Africa when we have trained them. To train our South African people, the first thing to do to evaluate the primary necessities for research in South Africa, is to have South Africans to do it. Let the man born and bred in this country be trained as a scientist. We have got plenty of raw material. The money is needed. I am quite certain in my own mind that the driving force, the compelling force, is there; it is inborn; it is built into our young South Africans, and they will use it if they are given the opportunity. Train them and let them be the scientists and come forward to evaluate what we have got to offer in the way of economic advantage. If, instead of talking about Kirstenbosch as a garden, we could express Kirstenbosch in terms of rands and cents, if we could show the value in terms of rands and cents, then we would have a very much quicker approach to the hon. the Minister of Finance, who sooner or later has to open the purse if we are to get the money for the purpose of scientific research. We want the money. If we can show him a profit for South Africa then our case will be easier than merely to talk about the development of gardens.</p>

<p>In that connection I want to say we have vast areas which are not properly called gardens but which should be brought into the ambit of any development programme used for the training of scientists and so forth. I am sorry the hon. the Minister of Forestry is not here because one of the aspects touched on by the hon. member who moved this motion was the forestry side of it. I am glad the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture is here because from time to time we have a Select Committee dealing with state-owned land and we get reports about areas which were set aside as part of a scheduled or proclaimed forestry area, sometimes on the mountains, sometimes in the valleys. We have <span class="col_3025-3026" refersTo="page_1536"/>various levels of country from 11,000 feet high in the Drakensberg right down to sea level and the swamps at the mouths of some of our rivers up in Zululand. We have this vast change in altitude with a corresponding change in the communities that inhabit the different levels, and I think this fact is of great value to our scientists. In the course of their work the Department of Forestry find that very often a piece of land has been proclaimed a forest under the Act and then they do not want it. They say then it is not suitable for the cultivation of trees and they wash their hands of it. They say it cannot produce whatever it is that they want to grow and so they are not interested. What happens to that land? It gets excised, resolutions of this House are passed, as well as those of the Other Place. It goes to the Department of Lands, that department then decides to lease it for grazing or else they hand it over to some neighbouring farmer who has an uneconomic holding. In this way the land gets back into private ownership. It is a great pity. That land is publicly owned, it is quite unfit for forestry, but covered with its natural vegetation it is worth untold gold to South Africa if we would use it for the purposes of research in its thousands upon thousands of morgen. We do not want to worry about 40 or 50 acres. As I said not so long ago, in America they have gone throughout the whole of the West looking for a piece of undisturbed prairie land and they could not find it. Eventually they found such a piece of land in a graveyard. Because the graveyard had sharp corners and they employed graders and steam ploughs and what have you to plough the whole area, so that they could dig the graves easily, the graders went round and left the corners untouched and in those corners was the only land they could find in the Western states which was untouched prairie land. When they examined that soil and plants, they found plants and organisms which had not been seen since the times of the great buffalo herds in the Western states of America. They found organisms there which were valuable from the point of view of contributing to the fertility of the soil in the production of their wheat crops, and so forth.</p>

<p>We are at the beginning of it and therefore we should learn from other people. We should not hand these lands over to private ownership because they are on an unproductive mountainside. Never mind about the use of those areas in the line of their being utilized for the protection of water supplies&#x2014;&#x201C;water-bronne&#x201D;. Never mind that. Let us look for a moment at the vegetation. As the hon. member said just now, we have got to protect our soil which we live on and by which we live. It is not all just soil; some of it is rock but it has got its vegetation and its specialist types of vegetation. By scientific investigation of our vegetation and the communities that go with that vegetation we can derive immense advantage in rands and cents in the future of our own country. We need the money, the scientists and we must make use of what we have available here to us in the way of land which is not being utilized at the present time adequately for scientific purposes, but which the scientist will make the fullest use of if we have the money to develop the new techniques and the new plant and equipment which they are using for the purpose of evaluating what we have got.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Nelspruit on having found this opportunity to raise this important and interesting matter here. I also want to contratulate him on the way in which he did it. The hon. member occupies an exceptional position because there are not many more of us who have places in their constituencies after which popular plants are named. The hon. member is in the fortunate position of representing areas from which the Barberton Daisy and the Pride of De Kaap, the Bauhinia Galpinii, so popular in gardens, derived their popular names. Therefore it is all the more fitting that the hon. member should be the one to raise this subject here.</p>

<p>As a city dweller it is a pleasure for me to support him. The asphalt and concrete of our cities lead to an estrangement from nature. Now, more than ever, it is necessary for us to give attention to these matters, because at present there is still a generation representing the transitional period from the country to the city, a generation which may also disappear within the next few decades. Therefore the present is the appropriate time to give fresh consideration to publicizing and conserving our natural heritage, while we still have all these plants and are merely seeking more effective methods for their conservation. It is unnecessary to say&#x2014;the hon. member for Nelspruit also did so, though in a different way&#x2014;that the indigenous florae are the garments of a country. Nothing is more intimately a part of the soil on which we live than the flora. In the indigenous flora of our country we see the essential features, the essential nature, of each region. One can judge by the flora whether it is hot or cold, dry or wet, whether the soil is sour or sweet, whether there is a great deal of sunlight or of shadow. One actually knows one&#x2019;s country by its flora, and <i>vice versa,</i> one cannot know one&#x2019;s country if one does not know its flora.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast displayed a very interesting approach to this. His approach was more economically orientated, and I am sure that a great deal can be done in that direction. But if, speaking of these matters, we think in economic terms, it is the succeeding generation which is going to pay the price. We can never think about a matter such as this in purely economic terms, because we are here dealing with values which cannot be measured in economic terms. The hon. member referred here to the Watsonias which have become such a nuisance in Australia. I am sorry that Australia has the nuisance, but <span class="col_3027-3028" refersTo="page_1537"/>you will also know that the sickle-bush of South Africa caused a great deal of difficulty in Cuba a few years ago, although we are not so sorry about that as we are about the Watsonias in Australia. It simply happens to be the position, in this country too, that exotic plants are regarded as being more valuable than indigenous ones. Thereby one runs a risk, as we do here as well. For example, here we sit with the Port Jacksons in the Western Cape, which we obtained from Australia. Australia is saddled with the Watsonia species&#x2014;actually a sort of &#x201C;tit-for-tat&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As I have said, we frequently think that exotic plants are superior to our own. We are frequently impressed by the description given of exotic trees, shrubs and plants. When one thinks of large trees, one&#x2019;s thoughts are so dominated by the Americans&#x2019; description of their Redwoods that one simply takes it for granted that there can be nothing comparable in South Africa. But we have our fine specimens too. Thus, for example, we have the Big Tree near Knysna along the Garden Route and the Wonderboom at Pretoria. I wonder how many of you have read the description of a group of Acacia Galpinii by Eugene Marais. You will find it in a book published last year under the title &#x201C; &#x2019;n Paradys van Weleer&#x201D;. He describes the Acacia Galpinii of the Magalakwien River. On page 118 he states that the lowest branches of the Acacia Galpinii are thicker than the trunk of the largest oak in the streets of Stellenbosch. On page 120 he states that the trunk of the Acacia Galpinii is 78 feet in circumference at a height of three feet from the ground, and that if the accumulated sand deposits of the centuries could be cleared away to the stump, the circumference there would be about 146 feet. The height of the tree from the stump would be about 400 feet. And then it must be remembered that while the Redwood grows straight, the Acacia Galpinii spreads its branches. The area covered by its shadow at noon is 7,200 square yards.</p>

<p>This is therefore something to be considered. We must consider conserving these fine specimens of our indigenous plants for our descendants. Although we are concerned here with such large dimensions as could never be equalled in a garden, there is still always the possibility, for the man who wants to plant such a tree in his garden, of dreaming of the large trees which will one day be standing there&#x2014;even though it is almost like the rooster who stood beside the ostrich egg and said to the hen, &#x201C;It can be done&#x201D;!</p>

<p>In order to stimulate interest in the National Botanic Gardens of South Africa, it is necessary to eliminate the lack of knowledge in respect of our indigenous flora. Let me say immediately that Kirstenbosch and other national botanic gardens have gone a long way towards doing this. But in the efforts to bring this knowledge to the public, shortcomings still exist. In addition, the means for doing so are also meagre. In the past few years we have had a great deal of interest in the cultivation of Proteas, Pincushions, and Heath&#x2014;probably the most spectacular kinds of plants in the whole world. In fact, I do not believe that there are shrubs anywhere else in the world that flower for longer periods than do these three kinds. There are, of course, reasons for the greater interest in these plants. The book by Marie Vogts and the book about our Heath, which appeared recently, have contributed a great deal towards supplementing knowledge and stimulating interest. But these books are expensive. The book about Heath, which appeared last year, cost, I think, about R12 and that price had already been subsidized! However, I am convinced that if we want to rouse the interest of our people, we must be prepared to spend more on the publication of such works, as lasting propaganda for this matter.</p>

<p>This subject can be presented vividly, and it is a fact that as soon as people have some knowledge of the plants, they develop the urge to grow some themselves, and only when one begins to grow a plant, does one develop a love for their conservation wherever one encounters them in the veld. That link is absolutely necessary. There are still so many riches to be brought under cultivation in this connection. The hon. member for Nelspruit has indicated that many of our plants are known in other parts of the world. But it is perhaps not so generally known that in Australia the small shrub which grows about two or three feet high, Adenandra Fragrans, with the leaf which smells like licorice, is regarded as the best small shrub in the entire world. Then there is our own Virgilia Capensis perhaps the tree with the most rapid growth in the world. However, it is very seldom cultivated in our gardens. Then there are our beautiful shade trees&#x2014;our White Stinkwood trees, our Red Natal Mahogany trees. I do not believe that there is a more beautiful shade tree in the whole world than our Natal Mahogany tree. Apparently this tree is not as sensitive to frost as was generally expected at first either, because it is now being cultivated on a somewhat larger scale. Our flowering trees, the Wild Wisteria and the Cape Chestnut, are also believed to be without equal in the world, but how seldom does one see the trees in any garden in South Africa? One seldom if ever does.</p>

<p>Besides the encouragement of literature to stimulate this interest, I think that we must also think of promoting the availability of plants for cultivation in home gardens. As far as this is concerned, the situation is a miserable one. Due to the lack of literature in which there is an adequate description of the plant&#x2014;how large it grows, what its growth rate is and what type of soil it must have, etc., there is still a lot of confusion in some respects about the characteristics of our South African plants. This must be supplemented, but the availability of these plants is an equally great problem. Where does one obtain these plants? At the commercial nurseries, for example, one <span class="col_3029-3030" refersTo="page_1538"/>may search for years to obtain something like the Ochna Pulchra, which grows on the northern slopes of Pretoria, with the white bark and yellow flower in spring, which later change to the red bracts and the dark coloured purplish-brown berry underneath, one of the most vivid trees in the world, especially in the spring when it displays its copper red leaves cannot obtain it in a commercial nursery. The Burkea Africana, the Wild Syringa, which one also finds there on the northern slopes, with its flat crown and grey leaves, one cannot obtain in any commercial nursery, I have referred to the Adenandra Fragrans. The Adenandra Uniflora, one of our best and most beautiful shrubs, one cannot obtain anywhere in a nursery either. Thought will have to be given to extending this work of the botanic gardens to the individual, the family, the community, in order to ensure that, besides the publications, the nurseries who devote themselves to indigenous plants, are assisted in the propagation of those plants, so that they can be made available for people&#x2019;s private properties, even if it must be done by means of further subsidies. I think that if we do this we can give the work and the money spent on these botanical gardens a much greater effectiveness, something we have perhaps previously not managed to do.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like not only to thank the hon. member for Nelspruit but also to congratulate him on this motion. He raised a matter which, as the hon. member for South Coast also said, is not a political matter, but a national matter which we must discuss jointly and exchange information and suggestions on. Because South Africa, owing to its climatic conditions, has great fluctuations, we have many kinds of plants. For example, along the Cape coast the weather and the soil conditions change tremendously, and if one travels a little further inland one finds what are virtually desert conditions. In the same country we have sub-tropical regions where one finds an entirely different type of vegetation. Then one has the Karoo on the other hand which has different characteristics. One has a winter rainfall region as opposed to a summer rainfall region, and one has low rainfall regions as against high rainfall regions, and there are also desert conditions. The result of this is that South Africa to-day has the richest variety of plant species in the world. In South Africa we have plus-minus 18,000 species of flowers, and the sixth largest country in the world is Russia, and this only has 20,000 species. The United States of America is seven times the size of our country and it has only 15,000. This small Cape Peninsula comprises only 180 square miles, and has as many indigenous plants as the British Isles. This is an indication of the treasure we have in this country. That is why I am pleased that it is possible to discuss such a heritage as we have in our hands by means of a motion such as that of the hon. member for Nelspruit. However, I do want to say to the hon. member for South Coast, arising from what the hon. member for Innesdal said about Port Jackson, that he must remember that we also imported the hakea from Australia as an ornamental hedge, and as a result we are finding ourselves in a tight spot to-day. And if he talks to a farmer about foreign plants, there is always the khaki bush which was also brought into this country, and also the satan bush. Those countries gave us many things which have caused us great difficulty. It is also a pleasure to participate in a motion on which, in the first place, the hon. member for Nelspruit spoke, who hails from a sub-tropical area, who was then seconded by an hon. member who has made his living from forestry, in an entirely different climatic region, and then to find that a city dweller such as the hon. member for Innesdal also displaying an interest in the ornamental gardens in the cities. We have stated before in this House that we are discovering that the city dwellers are multiplying. The concrete flat dwellers are increasing in numbers and this is an occasion to say to them: Circumstances are such that you have to live in those buildings, but you can spend your week-ends in a garden so that you do nevertheless have a measure of contact with the soil.</p>

<p>Now I should like to refer very briefly to what has already been done. Because the Government is very sympathetically-disposed towards this matter of the conservation of our plants, there is the Botanical Research Institute, which at present falls under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. This includes the maintenance of the National Herbariums at Pretoria and the Regional Herbarium in Durban, and those at Grahamstown, Stellenbosch and Kimberley. The Department is giving attention to the provision on a national level of plant identification and instruction services regarding indigenous plants, as well as weeds and cultivated seeds, and annually an average of 20,000 plant specimen identifications are made and thousands of other inquiries are replied to by this Botanical Institute. The national herbarium of the Department contains approximately a half-million specimens, whereas the collections of the regional herbariums comprise a further 150,000 specimens. In addition there is a team of trained botanists engaged in a comprehensive revision and classification of 18,000 species of our country&#x2019;s flora. These include plants from South-West Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. We also have in our institute a permanent liaison officer stationed at the world famous herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. At the moment this post is occupied by Mr. Oliver, who is returning in July. These men remain there for three years. In addition the Department undertakes botanical surveys where plants are catalogued and species of flora in South Africa are defined. Botanical surveys include the drawing up of distribution <span class="col_3031-3032" refersTo="page_1539"/>maps of plant species and the study of factors influencing their distribution. We also have the standard work of Acocks on the &#x201C;Veldtipes van Suid-Afrika&#x201D;. This is the most extensive and intensive study of its kind ever undertaken on the Continent of Africa. We also have, if we subdivide it into groups, a study, survey and collection of indigenous plants which are of potential economic importance. We must consider the economic side as well. However, I agree with the hon. member for Innesdal that our children will suffer if we say that we should regard this matter as a profitable industry. That is not the intention at all. But one does have plants which can entail economic benefits for one. I am mentioning for example the edible, medicinal oleaginous and fibrous plants. These have been planted in groups in order to study their potential value. I think hon. members are aware of the fact that we are manufacturing cortisone from the elephant&#x2019;s foot plant as a result of this research. Then I am thinking of the maintenance of botanical gardens at Pretoria, at Brumeria, for indigenous plants for study purposes. These national gardens cover 90 morgen, and are also there to be used by the public who are interested in our flora for recreational purposes; it is of great value to them. The hon. member for Nelspruit emphasized that these matters should be brought to the attention of the public. It is of no use having these gardens if one does not reach the public in order to stimulate its ideas in that direction.</p>

<p>We come now to the publications which were mentioned, which require as much attention in order to publicize the matter among the people whom we want to accommodate. Here I am thinking of the most important publications, which are published with the assistance of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. There is Botalia. Since 1921 ten volumes each volume consisting of four sections, have appeared. There is &#x201C;Blomplante van Afrika&#x201D;. This, series consists of coloured illustrations of plants. Since 1921 38 volumes have appeared, in which more than 1,500 of our plants have been illustrated. There is Flora of Southern Africa. This contains a survey of botanical descriptions of all the flowers of the Republic, as well as South-West Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. There is the Botanical Survey Memoirs; 38 editions of this series have already appeared since 1919. There are various other publications, but I am mentioning one to you here, Flowers of the Transvaal, a book which I agree with the hon. member for Innesdal, unfortunately costs R12.50 at a subsidized price, but it is truly a treasure in any home. It is illustrated. Sir, there you see the lily of the field described in the good book; it neither spins nor weaves. All the beautiful colours are to be found in this book, complete with descriptions. I am mentioning another publication, also compiled with the assistance of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, namely Ericas in Southern Africa. These are the species of heath in our country, and they are also illustrated in colour. It is a beautiful work. These are all treasures of our nation which we are in this way trying to draw attention to. Then I am thinking of our information services, the work which is being done by the Vrouelandbouvereniging, the land service movement and the boy scouts. All these people are in some way or other doing something and they are being assisted in this. Reference was made to the Department of Forestry. I was surprised when I went into these matters, to see what the Department of Forestry is actually doing. It is with pride that I can refer to this book. The Minister of Forestry to-day has the power to declare a state forest in the <i>Gazette</i> in any part of our country which he thinks should be reserved in order to protect the grass, the trees, the flowers, and the ferns. He has the right to do so and, as the hon. member stated, he has already protected 15,930 morgen in this way. In addition to the nature reserves the Department of Forestry at the moment controls 226,800 morgen of indigenous forest. In addition this Department controls 1.2 million morgen of State land as water catchment areas. This brings me to the point which the hon. member for South Coast made. I was not aware of those regions to which he referred, but we in the Department of Land Tenure are subjected to tremendous criticism from farmers who state: There the land is lying; let us utilize it. The Department of Forestry, and also as far as the problem of the silting up of our dams is concerned, the Department of Land Tenure is withdrawing some of this land to let it lie fallow rather than to have it trampled, and so preserve it for posterity. Now one always finds this difficulty. If the State has a piece of land which is lying fallow the farmers always ask why it is lying fallow. You know, Sir, grass is something which a farmer wants to see devoured. But I think we must simply be firm and say that we are going to protect the soil there. I am thinking of the work being done by the Department of Forestry in the Cedarberg Forest reserve in the Western Cape. At present the Department is engaged in projects there in re-establishing the Clanwilliam cedar. This is a cedar which would otherwise have died out. In the same way protea seed orchards have been laid out in the highlands forest reserve in the vicinity of Grabouw, from where protea seed is made available for sale. In its forest reserves the Department makes facilities such as roads, picnic spots, camping spots and footpaths available. The Department is spending R30,000 in one year alone on these few things simply to make it possible for the public to reach, see and admire our natural beauty spots.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to go further and refer to our Provincial authorities and what they are doing to promote nature conservation, etc. In the Cape Province there are seven provincial nature gardens. At Springbok alone <span class="col_3033-3034" refersTo="page_1540"/>there are 6,000 morgen where the veld flowers of Namaqualand, which are probably one of the most sought after sights in the world, after it has rained, are being protected. In conjunction with local authorities 41 natural gardens have been laid out in the Cape Province. This has contributed a great deal towards arousing a pride in their flora among the local communities. The Provincial Administration of the Cape contributes 50 per cent to the expenditure in connection with the nature reserves, and an amount of R132,000 was made available for that purpose during 1969-&#x2019;70. In the Transvaal there are 17 nature reserves covering a surface area of 63,000 morgen, while Natal can boast of 33 reserves consisting of more than a quarter million morgen. I do not know why Natal is being favoured! The Orange Free State, unfortunately, only has one nature reserve consisting of 13,000 morgen.</p>

<p>We come then to our national and provincial parks, to which the hon. member for Nelspruit also referred. Sir, we must not, if we visit the public game reserves, only look at the wild animals. At these reserves one is able to obtain a list of the names of the species of trees in the reserve. These things must be expanded; one should be able to obtain a list of all the grass types and plants growing there. When we go to the game reserve, we look only at the wild life, the lions, the elephants and the predators, but we should also look at the trees, the birds sitting in the trees, not only the big birds but the small ones as well. Other bodies which are making contributions are the Departments of botany at our universities where the indigenous flora of our country is being studied. In addition there are our schools which are making a contribution through the Pathfinders, the Voortrekkers and the Land Service&#x2014;all nature enthusiasts.</p>

<p>I then come to Kirstenbosch and in this regard I want to say that in 1967 the hon. the Minister of National Education appointed a committee of inquiry to investigate the requirements of state-aided institutions. Virtually all the recommendations of this committee were accepted by the Cabinet. One of the recommendations was the establishment of a statutory advisory council. In addition the new basis for State aid will take effect from 1st April of this year. During the present financial year the total income from the National Botanic Gardens was R184,312, and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services added R119,000. I can state unequivocally here that the hon. member for South Coast need not feel concerned that Kirstenbosch, because it is called a garden, will not be dealt with sympathetically. This Department will always be sympathetically disposed towards it. As the hon. member for Nelspruit rightly said, the Department not only looks after the plant, but looks after the plant, the soil and man, because if there is a blanket over the land, if it is covered, then our future generations have a chance of a good life.</p>

<p>In regard to the expansion of regional gardens, this committee to which I referred, realized the need for the national botanic gardens to be able to carry out their functions in a truly national way. These gardens must be expanded to other Provinces. Their reserves must be expanded to other Provinces. Provisional arrangements in regard to the establishment of a Lowveld Botanic gardens at Nelspruit and the Natal Midlands Botanic Gardens at Pietermaritzburg have progressed to a stage where offers of suitable sites and a certain measure of financial assistance have already been made by the various municipalities. We owe these municipalities who made an offer of land for this noble purpose a vote of thanks. Since there are so many bodies which are to-day concerned with the conservation and the protection of our indigenous flora, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has taken the initiative of establishing a co-ordinating advisory committee on flora and fauna in order to provide all interested parties with advice so that unnecessary duplication can be avoided. The wholehearted co-operation of all these bodies in this regard is greatly appreciated. Now I also want to make mention of Nakor, the co-ordinating council for nature conservation, which acts in a co-ordinating capacity on a broad level.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude with this idea, for the information of all who have this matter at heart. The Research Institute for Fruit and Nutritional Technology is a special research section which concerns itself with and concentrates on veld flowers, particularly proteas, while the botanical institute in Pretoria also gives attention to veld flowers. The hon. member for Innesdal stated here that he was unable to obtain certain species of trees, and in this connection he mentioned the wild lilac. My experience of the wild lilac is that where it grows there is leaf poisoning and cattle die if they walk there. But wild lilac in a garden is of course a different matter. At the Roodeplaats research station at Pretoria a whole section has been set aside in order to inform the people of Pretoria as to what specific shrubs they can grow in their gardens. We will give attention to the provision of these plants to nurseries. City councils and local authorities ought to be encouraged to display more initiative themselves in laying out nature reserves and not always asking the State and the Province and Kirstenbosch for assistance. That is why I am pleased that the hon. member for Nelspruit referred to the City Council of Cape Town in a friendly way as far as this matter was concerned. Sir, ours is a country richly endowed with green grazing lands, with grass plains, with bush covered hills, mountains and gullies, and if we tackle this matter in the spirit of the ideas expressed here by hon. members and bring home to the people that if they do <span class="col_3035-3036" refersTo="page_1541"/>something for South Africa&#x2019;s soil, if they are prepared to encourage our youth to take an interest in botany and the conservation of our flora along the channel which has been created, then I believe that it will be supported by this Department and then I see light for us in the future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Nelspruit has moved a very interesting motion, which has received the support of all members who have spoken, and quite rightly so, because I believe that this present generation of which we are members has a very important obligation to the generations of the future and that is to see that all forms of wild life, with which our country is so richly blessed, is properly preserved for the generations to come. I think previous speakers have given us a very clear outline of the tremendous efforts that are being made by the various organizations in the country, and I think that we as South Africans can be very proud of all the steps that have been taken by the various departments and provinces to preserve and to display and to put out publications about our wild life. I think that these efforts are very commendable and I do not think there is any need for me to speak further about these efforts. The Deputy Minister himself has given us a very good outline of what is being done. Sir, it is difficult when one has heard what is already being done to try to come forward with suggestions as to what may still be done. Is there still place for improvement? I think we must recognize that there is always room for improvement. We are glad for what has been done but there are aspects where we can make further efforts, and I want to draw attention to one field in which I think more can be done. We all realize that in the matter of nature conservation, decentralization of effort is a good thing. That was accepted at the time of Union when the various provinces were entrusted with the duty of conserving our nature. Each province plays a very real part in this regard. I think decentralization of effort is the right approach but I do feel that where the Deputy Minister said that a co-ordinating body should be brought into being, he is on the right track, otherwise there is going to be a tremendous amount of overlapping of effort, and I think that this should be avoided where possible. Sir, in the Cape Province we have no fewer than 41 nature reserves which are subsidized by the province. These cover a very extensive portion of the Cape Province, but there are still many areas which, I believe, do not have a nature reserve of any kind. There are 41 nature reserves. Several of them are in one district, whereas other districts have none at all. I believe that this is a matter to which this co-ordinating committee to which the Deputy Minister referred, could well give its attention. In the Karoo, the area from which I come, there are many districts which have very interesting flora and fauna, and with the passage of time much of this vegetation is being destroyed and will not be there for the generations to come unless active steps are taken now to create some kind of reserve where this vegetation and, to a lesser extent, the animals can be preserved. I think of an area like the district from which I come, the Graaff-Reinet district with its nationally known Valley of Desolation, would I believe be an ideal place to establish a nature reserve. In that area there are not only animals of interest but also vegetation of tremendous interest there, especially in the field of the aloe. I believe that a municipality like that of Graaff-Reinet, if it could get more assistance than it has been offered in the past, would be very happy to set aside a portion of its commonage in order to turn this Valley of Desolation area into a nature reserve for the benefit not only of the present generation but also for the benefit of posterity.</p>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;What about tortoises?&#x201D; I am not so sure about that. There are also other areas which deserve our attention. Take a district like Middelburg in the Cape, which has vegetation that is entirely different from that of Graaff-Reinet. There is no nature reserve there of any kind, although, of course, the agricultural college at Grootfontein does take steps to try to preserve the vegetation by means of certain of their field experiments. In the district of Molteno you also have a totally different type of vegetation and the climatic conditions are quite different from those that prevail in the Karoo and at the present time no effort is being made to preserve for posterity the vegetation that grows there. I believe it is important to try to preserve the vegetation that grows in a particular area in the habitat where it belongs. In the Kirstenbosch Botanic Gardens you have assembled all the various types of plants that we have in the country for the public to see, but I believe that to be of real botanical value it must be possible to study these plants in their natural habitat, in the environment to which they belong, and it is for that reason that, in supporting the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, I make a very strong plea that the necessary finance should be made available through the municipalities and the divisional councils to the various districts of the Cape so that we can be quite sure that within a very short space of time a nature reserve will be established in each one of these districts, a nature reserve in which the flora and fauna of that particular area can be preserved and looked after in its natural habitat. But not only must that be done; I believe that these reserves should be developed even further so that those who visit the reserves can better understand their significance. The various plants which grow there should have their names indicated; <span class="col_3037-3038" refersTo="page_1542"/>their particular value as grazing plants should be indicated, and where they are plants of not much value an indication should be given of the harm that they do and of the importance of eradicating them. After all, not every plant is a useful plant.</p>

<p>We should have these reserves covering the whole of the Cape Province. They must be well looked after and easily accessible by road and paths. The vegetation in these reserves have their names, value and significance well indicated by proper notices. These reserves will become an important factor in making our public and also our farmers more conscious of the economic importance of the variety of plants we have and also make them more conscious of preserving what we have for posterity. In this way I think we can promote this question of preserving the cover of our soil to which the mover of this motion referred and which is so important in combating soil erosion. The public must be made more conscious of the value of our vegetation so that they may help too with this question of soil conservation, which is something to which I have often referred in this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, coming from one of the most beautiful areas in South Africa and appreciating the importance of nature conservation and preserving flora in South Africa this motion is naturally to me a very interesting and important one. I am only sorry that the motion does not go further than to stipulate National Botanical Gardens. However, I want to deal very briefly with the financial side of the motion.</p>

<p>I was a member of the Cape Provincial Council for years, and it was in the Provincial Council that I realized and appreciated the importance of preserving flora in South Africa. In the Provincial Council I had to do with nature reserves and subsidies pertaining to nature reserves. The Government subsidizes the National Parks Board and Botanical Gardens; this fact has already been mentioned. I want to point out to this hon. House what the provincial councils are doing in assisting the preservation of flora in South Africa. In the Cape Province alone the Administration in 1967-&#x2019;68 paid out for nature reserves the sum of R45,000 and in the same year for nature conservation in general an amount of R96,850. For this year, according to the provincial council estimates of expenditure, I see they Province has budgeted for an amount of R160,925 for nature reserves and&#x2014;this is important&#x2014;an amount of R288,800 for nature conservation. This is a large sum of money and it will be used to subsidize city councils, town councils, divisional councils and all other bodies in matters pertaining to nature reserves. I am well aware of the fact, and I am satisfied that this province is doing all it possibly can at this stage, with the financial resources at its disposal, to preserve flora in South Africa. I see in the Estimates of Expenditure for the Cape Province the increase is more than three-fold for the next year. One can therefore see how we in the Cape realize the great need and importance of preserving flora. I might mention too that in the Cape Province 50 per cent of expenditure is paid in subsidies. This includes a reserve such as the &#x201C;Table Mountain Reserve&#x201D;, where of course there are hazards such as fire. Fire is one of the greatest hazards we have, not only here in the Cape Province, but all over South Africa. I noticed the other day in doing certain work in the Newcastle constituency, what a beautiful part of the country that is. Even there in one of the finest parts of our country we see some terrible scars being formed, and created by none other than man himself. I noticed that the hon. member for Uitenhage seemed quite interested for a few moments in what I was saying! Last year the State grant to botanical societies in South Africa was a mere R119,000. It is for this reason I find it a pleasure to support the motion.</p>

<p>I do believe the State should be assisting the botanical societies to a greater extent than is the case at the moment. When we see beautiful gardens such as Kirstenbosch, Bloemfontein, Nelspruit, Harrismith, Worcester and Betty&#x2019;s Bay which need financial assistance very badly, I believe it is time the Government seriously considered giving these institutions more financial assistance. More money is needed to preserve flora in South Africa. I do not want to cover ground which has already been covered, all that has been said should not be viewed only in terms of tourist attractions. I view this subject, as far as tourist attractions are concerned only as a sideline. Can one imagine what South Africa will look like by the year 2000 if too little is done to preserve our rich botanical heritage? It is estimated that by the turn of the century there will be no less than 40 million people living in South Africa, and at the rate we are deliberately destroying our beautiful scenery, and our flora, there will be absolutely nothing left by the year 2000. No so long ago when I was a young boy and used to walk in the veld of the Eastern Cape and Border on hot summer days, I could lie down and drink from a crystal clear stream of running water at any time, or any place. One cannot do this now. To-day we find that people have deliberately contaminated the streams which nourish our flora and vegetation from which grows the most beautiful foliage one could ever wish to see. In our streams we find cans, empty tins, bottles, oil drums, and even derelict motor cars. We also find rubbish lying all over the place destroying flora and defacing our scenery. I appeal to the State to consider this matter very seriously, and to assist these bodies with more money. The provincial councils are doing so, as I have already said, but they are strained to the limits financially. I know of people in the Cape Provincial Council who are going out of their way to preserve fauna and flora in South Africa. But I believe the Government can do more in developing our National Botanic Gardens in South Africa.</p>

<from><span class="col_3039-3040" refersTo="page_1543"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this motion moved by the hon. member for Nelspruit has enjoyed the support of both sides of the House and rightly so, because the work being done at Kirstenbosch is work of national importance and is work of a very high standard. If this work is to be brought to the fullest possible fruition then it is necessary that it be carried over the country as a whole. This point was also made by the hon. member for Innesdal. One of the ways in which it can be carried over and by which it can be supplemented is via the other channels of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Here I particularly have in mind the staff of the department who are engaged in botanical survey, namely the botanical survey officers. These people have done very good work, but I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree with me that there are occasions when they find it difficult to keep the complement of botanical survey officers up to strength, I think this has happened in the past. If the hon. the Deputy Minister will grant me his attention for a minute, I would like to say to him that I hope that he will pay attention to this aspect regarding the staff of his department. I think he should keep the botanical survey side of his department completely up to strength as far as it lies in his power to do so. This question of the botanical survey is very intimately connected with the matter the hon. the Deputy Minister himself mentioned here, namely the plant herbariums or plant libraries. One knows the value of these libraries and as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, there is one in the town which is the centre of my constituency, namely Grahamstown, and a very valuable function it performs. It is necessary that this should be a continuing work because our knowledge in the plant field is certainly not complete by any means. This also has economic importance, for example, as regards which plants are poisonous to stock. Here the plant libraries, although they possess a great deal of information, still do not know all the poisonous plants in South Africa. I had a case about five years ago where we were able to identify another poisonous plant, which was not listed by the plant library as being poisonous but that we, with the co-operation of Onderstepoort, were able to identify as being a very poisonous species indeed.</p>

<p>I realize that the hon. the Deputy Minister is aware of the importance of these plant libraries, and I hope this is a section of the department which will not be stinted. Hon. members on both sides have mentioned the part played, not merely by the Central Government, but also by the provincial authorities. I want to say that we are hoping to emulate in a very friendly way in Grahamstown the activities of Kirstenbosch here in the Western Cape. The taking over of the botanical gardens there by the Provincial Administration and their subsequent extension into an overall nature reserve is a factor of very great importance for the Eastern Cape as a whole and for the country as a whole. It is certainly our aim to establish what will be a second Kirstenbosch. These are botanical gardens of very long standing dating certainly from the 1850s and perhaps a little earlier. It is a most suitable place to have a nature reserve of that kind, and there no less than seven ecological areas&#x2014;I will not call them regions&#x2014;with types of vegetation and different climates which meet at that point. You have your winter rainfall area with your Macchia vegetation, you have your coastal summer vegetation, you have sourveld vegetation, Karoo vegetation, semi-Karoo vegetation, sweetveld vegetation, and Fish River bush. For all these reasons this is a most important central point for there to be such a second Kirstenbosch. We are extremely grateful for the very fine efforts of the Cape Provincial Administration in making funds available. As I say, we hope to emulate Kirstenbosch and built this second institution up into one which will be able to take its place alongside Kirstenbosch in a spirit of very friendly rivalry with Kirstenbosch.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to move the following motion standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that in the interests of the health and well-being of the present and future population of South Africa it is necessary to investigate:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) the consumption of alcohol and tobacco with particular reference to their use and methods of promotion;</li>

<li>(2) the increasing tendency to drug depen dency and excess and combating it by&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) formulating a system of effective control; and</li>

<li>(b) the institution of an educational programme; and</li></ol></li>

<li>(3) excessive noise in so far as the urban and built-up areas of the Republic are concerned</li>

</ol>

<p>May I say at the outset that I am not a prohibitionist, that I do enjoy a drink, and for many years I was a smoker. But I do claim to be a realist and I believe the time has come when we must have some investigation into this question and place it in its correct perspective. There is no denying that both <span class="col_3041-3042" refersTo="page_1544"/>alcohol and tobacco can lead to dependancy and they can also lead to sickness and ill-health. I want to emphasize that if there were a drug which had the alleged sedative or tranquillizing effect, which both alcohol and tobacco are claimed to have, this drug would be under strict control, and moreover the advertising of the drug would also be under very strict control. But what is the picture as far as alcohol and tobacco are concerned? We find that every visual, audio, or audio-visual aid is enlisted to promote the sale of these two substances. No one can pick up a newspaper, go to a cinema, or listen to the commercial or regional broadcasting stations without being inundated with propaganda promoting the use and sale of these preparations. What to me is so tragic is that in many respects the advertising is directed mainly at the youth of South Africa, and I believe that as far as alcohol is concerned its appeal to youth can lead many of our youth on the slippery downhill road to eventual alcoholism.</p>

<p>To show what I have in mind I want to quote from some advertisements which appear regularly in the daily Press. They are big advertisements. One of them advertises a certain brand of spirits and it depicts a scene where young people besport themselves in bathing costumes in sight of the surf. I believe the suggestion is that a bottle of that type of spirits should be packed in the picnic hamper when they go to the beach. What is the result of that? Imagine the dangers to which our own lifesavers, many of them acting voluntarily to save the lives of people who get into trouble in the water, expose themselves when patrolling our beaches. What would their attitude be if they knew that they had to risk their lives to save somebody who had consumed too much alcohol on the beach and then gone in for a swim?</p>

<p>There is another aspect and that is the slogans which certain of these advertisers use. Listen to this: &#x201C;Are your drinking habits right up-to-date?&#x201D; I am sure most young people like to think they are &#x201C;with it&#x201D;, that they are up-to-date. They despise the so-called &#x201C;squares&#x201D;, as you and I are sometimes regarded, Mr. Speaker. Everything is directed at these young people. I think these slogans are wrong, I think it is wrong for people to be taught by implication that there can be no enjoyment without liquor. We know that large amounts are expended on the advertising and promotion of alcohol, and always the accent is on pleasure and enjoyment. Never do we see the other side of the coin, the morning after, the road accidents, the broken homes, the threat to health. In none of the advertisements or promotions that I have come across is there a warning issued that there may be harm in it if a person consumes alcohol, particularly to excess. We also have a State-orientated broadcasting system which is used to promote the sales of both these products.</p>

<p>Should this type of promotion continue unrestricted when we know that one out of every 16 individuals who consume alcohol could become an alcoholic? We are facing increasing problems with this question of alcoholism, and it causes concern in both commerce and industry. The question of productivity becomes a major issue, and we know we have a desperate manpower shortage in this country. Industry has expressed its concern through its mouthpiece, the Federated Chamber of Industries, in their organ known as <i>Viewpoint.</i> It is made clear therein that many aspects of alcoholism are causing deep worry. The article which I have here in my hand says that 90 per cent of alcoholics fall within the age limits of 35 and 55 years, which are the years of maximum productivity. Furthermore, surveys show that the average alcoholic loses 20 to 30 working days a year through his drinking habits. Moreover, he is twice as prone to accidents as his sober or non-drinking colleague. When it comes to what alcoholism is costing South African trade and industry a certain figure has been mentioned in more than one reliable publication. It is stated that R100 million a year is the loss suffered by trade and industry because of the overall effects of alcoholism.</p>

<p>Another distressing feature is the fact that much of the promotion to-day is directed at our non-European people. We already have a tragically high incidence of alcoholism among the Coloured people. This is a social problem, I believe and I think from the social welfare aspect we are entitled to ask whether this state of affairs among the Coloureds is not a legacy of the tot system. I think we must seriously ask ourselves whether the time has not come for the tot system to be taken under review. Anyone who wishes to see some of the evils of this system could well read the book called &#x201C;South African Winter&#x201D; by James Morris. He quotes an instance in the Cape Province where six tots of wine, the equivalent of 1&#x00BC; bottles of wine, so he says, are issued daily to farm labourers. He visited a wine farmer and his comments I think are worth repeating. He described the scene where the liquor was handed out to the farm labourers as an &#x201C;eerie spectacle&#x201D;. He said it was perfectly plain to him that those &#x201C;dazed and ravaged Coloured labourers were in a state of perpetual debauchery&#x201D;.</p>

<p>If we examine the findings of a survey team headed by Professor Gillis of the University of Cape Town, we find another depressing picture. This team investigated a Coloured community of 8,000 souls and they found that 22 per cent of the Coloured men could be called excessive drinkers and of these one-third were addicted alcoholics. One only has to refer to the comments of Dr. L. F. Freed, the well-known sociologist, when he addressed the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit. He said that South Africa has the fourth-highest incidence rate of alcoholics of 20 nations examined, Then we read in a certain Press report that wine production has increased by 123 per cent in the last ten years. Time does not permit me <span class="col_3043-3044" refersTo="page_1545"/>to go into detail as far as this particular aspect is concerned, but we cannot fail to consider the role of alcohol and its excessive consumption as far as road accidents are concerned. I believe the official figures which have been released speak for themselves and tell their own sorry tale.</p>

<p>What State action has there been? We know that last year R71,000 was allocated for the rehabilitation of alcoholics, and this amount is 3&#x00BD; times the amount voted in 1963. But if we compare that amount with the estimated R100 million which South Africa is losing, then I believe it is a small amount. One must not disregard the wonderful work that is being done by the various voluntary associations who deal with alcoholics. We have Alcoholics Anonymous. We have socially minded people who devote their energies and their money to combating this problem. Members of the public subscribe to the funds of these organizations. I have personal knowledge of Lulama in Durban. I know of the wonderful work that is being done there, I know what aftercare is given there, I know what efforts are made to help restore broken homes caused by this scourge, as I call it. I hope we will hear more during this debate of what the State is doing and what the State intends to do. I believe the State is dragging its feet in this matter.</p>

<p>In December, 1966, by courtesy of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, members of this hon. House who were interested in social welfare were invited to Pretoria and after a visit to the Department&#x2019;s office they were invited to visit certain rehabilitation centres. I must say what we saw there was an eye-opener to us. I think one and all left there feeling impressed and proud of what had been done and what was being done to rehabilitate these unfortunate people. But what happened after that? Going back by train that evening, I purchased an evening newspaper, and it brought me face to face with reality again! Because in the newspaper this stack of liquor advertisements appeared. I show them to hon. members. There are 12 in all, all of them advertising alcohol. These advertisements pressurize, they urge these poor derelict souls to consume alcohol, but nowhere was there any word of caution, nowhere was there a word of warning.</p>

<p>All I could find in the entire edition was a tiny notice by Alcoholics Anonymous on page 57, in which they drew attention to the work they did and indicated where they could be found. I was so concerned about the whole matter that I wrote to the hon. the Prime Minister sending him all the advertisements which appeared in this one edition. I told him I felt the time had come where we should be realistic about this and that we should at least investigate the matter. In reply he told me that he had referred this matter to the Minister of Justice. This is a matter which, and I am sure the Minister will bear me out, deserves the attention of his Department. As a matter of fact, the Minister and I have on occasion interchanged information on this matter. However, I am not aware of any positive action having been taken so far. In any event, there has been no improvement in the position.</p>

<p>In connection with this matter, I should also like to refer to the report of the commission on undesirable publications, the Cronje Commission of 1957. On page 189 hon. members will find a paragraph headed &#x201C;Liquor advertisements&#x201D;, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Various witnesses submitted to the Commission the opinion that legislation should be introduced in connection with liquor advertisements, and special reference was made to relevant legislation in the state of Oregon, U.S.A. The Commission considered that this is a matter which falls outside its terms of reference, but nevertheless wishes to bring it to notice. It is of the opinion that if certain statutory provisions are deemed necessary in this connection, these should be incorporated in the liquor legislation and not in the proposed Undesirable Publications Act.</block>

<p>Now I ask, respectfully, what consideration has been given to this point in the report? I know South Africa is regarded as a country of free enterprise and that, hence, any interference or excessive controls are resented. That is accepted. But when advertising encourages practises and habits which lead to moral degradation and physical deterioration then, so I believe, the time has come that the State should consider this aspect. As far as promotion is concerned, I do not have the time to deal with the many examples of countries where this aspect has already been given attention. I can only say that in many countries the authorities are aware of what is going on. In certain countries limitations and controls have been imposed. In certain instances liquor advertisement is confined to &#x201C;prestige&#x201D; advertisements. As a matter of fact, there are a number of such prestige advertisements in this newspaper cutting I have been talking of. The name of the product is being listed but without any extravagant claims glamourizing the qualities of alcohol. As I say, this is a question which should be considered. When one sees the stress that is being placed on youth in so many of these advertisements, then we should follow the example of other countries and limit the depicting of drinking scenes especially where youths are present. I believe the general tendency is not to use photographs of young people under the age of 25.</p>

<p>I now want to come to tobacco and its products. I have here an unusual little exhibit. You will not find it on any of the shelves of any trader in South Africa, in any event not in this form. It is an empty cigarette packet with the following words printed on it, &#x201C;Caution! Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health&#x201D;. This packet comes from <span class="col_3045-3046" refersTo="page_1546"/>America. I have never seen anything similar in South Africa, in any event not in that form. I believe in certain states of America this type of thing is compulsory by law. In certain countries there are, in fact, certain stringent requirements. It is not my intention to prove to-day that smoking is the cause of lung cancer. One of my colleagues will deal with this aspect more specifically. All I want to say is that there is certain contradictory evidence on this point. This prevents a specific conclusion being drawn. However, I think we cannot get away from the fact that tobacco has harmful side effects. If tobacco was regarded as a drug&#x2014;the Minister and I had a talk about this in his office one day when he suggested that I should make a speech on it&#x2014;its sale would be rigidly controlled as it would fall under the control of the Drugs Control Council. The requirements to be observed in the advertising of tobacco would then be very strict. I am not suggesting that there should be control at this stage. All I am suggesting is that there should be an investigation to find out exactly what the position is, e.g. whether it is not wise to protect people against themselves. I believe there is ample evidence to justify such an investigation. Reports come from an increasing number of countries witnessing an increasing concern about the ill effects of the use of tobacco. In West Germany, for example, it is reported&#x2014;I quote here from the German <i>Tribune</i> of November last&#x2014;that 20,000 people per year die from nicotine poisoning, and that the figure is increasing by 1,000 every year. It is pointed out that this figure of 20,000 exceeds the number of deaths from road accidents in West Germany. In Britain and America reports have been issued in which it is stated that the mortality rate amongst cigarette smokers is two-thirds higher than amongst non-smokers.</p>

<p>Have you never smoked?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I smoked for years. I like my fun too. As regards the position in South Africa, I have here the Transvaal Education Bulletin of June, 1965. In this attention is drawn to some of the undesirable aspects of smoking. The title of the comments is, &#x201C;The smoking habit of pupils in secondary schools&#x201D;. I should just like to quote a small part of these comments&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Parents are not the only adult models for smoking. Actually the child is softened up by the huge advertising industry from his earliest years. Advertisers link cigarette smoking with beauty, athletic powers, masculinity, intellect, youth, and have access to the whole population through the radio, newspapers and periodicals.</block>

<p>There is yet another aspect about tobacco and its production to which I think it will be only fair to refer. In this connection I should like to quote what the previous Minister of Health, Dr. Hertzog, said in 1963 (Hansard, col. 6575) in reply to a member who raised the question of smoking and its possible harmful effects. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us pause to deal for a moment with the tobacco industry in South Africa. To-day the production of tobacco is 14,600,000 lbs. The number of farmers who make a living out of it is about 10,000. There are 38 factories processing tobacco out of which 5,460 families make a living. The turnover of the industry is R40 million. I am not for a moment saying that if, in fact, smoking causes cancer it should not be stopped. What I am saying is that before one stops it one should at least make sure of the facts. One cannot just act irresponsibly in such a matter.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I make a plea, not for prohibition, but for a responsible approach to this matter, I believe that it is in the interest of our people and particularly in the interest of our young people. If I could feel that as a result of this debate, we adopted the principle that there should be at least a warning sentence on every packet of cigarettes that is sold, I would feel that the time of the hon. House had not been wasted.</p>

<p>Part 2 of my motion refers to the increasing dependency on drugs and to the question as to how it should be dealt with. I believe that during this Session we have had a very full discussion on the question of drugs under the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Amendment Bill. I am very happy to know that control will soon be on the Statute Book which will help the police in dealing with the illegal possession of drugs. I want to pay a very sincere tribute to our Police Force. I know that they are doing magnificent work in the control and illegal use of drugs. I want to make a suggestion that there could be closer liaison between the police and professional organizations such as the medical and pharmaceutical associations which are all situated throughout the country. The police could obtain expert assistance and advice from these bodies who I know would be only too pleased to give it. I think it is very encouraging to realize that there is an increasing public awareness of this problem of drug dependency and that many municipal authorities, mayors and other responsible individuals, are taking a lead in establishing bodies which at least can discuss this matter to see what can be done. I know that organizations such as Lifeline and Alcoholics Anonymous have been established. I suggest that the time could well be right for the establishment of an organization known as Drugs Anonymous to help these poor, stricken people. I hope, too, that as these bodies develop, the Treasury of our Government will be generous and that if these bodies need financial assistance and encouragement, it will be forthcoming with the minimum delay.</p>

<p><span class="col_3047-3048" refersTo="page_1547"/>The question of excessive noise also forms the subject of my motion. My hon. colleague from Orange Grove will deal with this in greater detail. I merely want to, as a chemist and druggist, express my feelings and concern as to the effect that noises have on people. Anyone who lives in a large city to-day and anyone who comes into contact with people as I do in my pharmacy, will appreciate the problem that noise constitutes in the day-to-day living of people in a large city. I am very concerned about the number of ordinary people who come to my pharmacy and ask me to please give them something to help them to sleep at night, because they cannot stand the noise any longer. They complain that they cannot fall asleep and when they eventually do fall asleep they are disturbed by some noise with the result that they wake up the next morning not fit for their daily work. This is a genuine demand by people who are concerned because they cannot have the sleep which nature ordains that they should have. I believe here, too, that the time has come to investigate the effect of noise on the human population and to see whether there are means that can be taken to eliminate noise wherever possible or to soften its effects where it is likely to upset the health of our people. I believe that all these factors merit some form of investigation. I hope that through this discussion we will be told to-day that there is a sympathetic feeling on the part of the hon. the Minister who will be dealing with this motion.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. HEYSTEK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in my speech I find myself in the fortunate position of calmly being able to concur with, and to supplement, remarks made about this matter. In all earnestness the hon. member for Berea pointed out to us the evils and harm which result from the misuse of drugs. One wonders what kind of creature, in this atmosphere, would want to get up here to-day and, as a disturber of the peace, launch an assault on the Government about its miserable policy and neglect in connection with the prevention, instruction and therapy in respect of unfortunate victims who have fallen prey to drugs. In thus looking around me the question arises, what is the resemblance between a Sunday Service and a Friday afternoon debate where a private motion about drugs is being discussed? The reply is that the audience does not turn up because it is afraid of the truth. All the same, I want to say that it appears to me as if there are not many people in the House of Assembly who are afraid. One can always think of the international entertainment programme in the superlative, especially if it is coupled with drugs, and if the entertainment is coupled with adventure, sensuality, illegality, impropriety and the undermining of health, the estimates quickly assume unsurpassable proportions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although we discussed the use of dagga last year in very great detail, you must permit me to say, since the hon. Speaker who preceded me pointed to the expenditure on alcoholic beverages, that dagga costs R32,000 a ton, that is to say R16 a pound. Supply and demand can increase the price to 50 cents for a single dagga cigarette.</p>

<p>The dagga and alcoholism evils do not differ, because the turnover in the dagga trade amounts to R100 million a year. As far as turnover is concerned, the dagga industry is regarded as the seventh largest industry. One wonders whether this is perhaps also attributable to the fact that the participants in this industry and this evil are mostly to be found in the lower stratum of the population. It is a fact that, although South Africa prohibited the smoking of dagga for the first time in 1928, its use was none the less encouraged among Bantu mine workers at an earlier stage. Its use was encouraged among them because &#x2014;just imagine, Mr. Speaker!&#x2014;it would lead to increased productivity. I have come to the conclusion that money can do a great deal of harm, although it is also capable of doing a great deal of good. But I have also come to the conclusion that the lust for money can do no good and knows no good. The lust for money remains plainly and simply a curse. These drugs display a marked similarity to Communism, because both always strike at the degenerate and the desperate. It is a fact that a lack of research leaves room for a difference of opinion about the long-term effects of, for example, the smoking of dagga on the victims. We usually remain dependent upon the much appreciated opinions and experiences of our senior police officers who are engaged in exterminating the dagga plant, while society concerns itself too little with the victims. There is a vague realization of lost man-hours, mental disturbance, physical degeneration, crime, etc., but not enough by far. I want to make the bold statement that the use of drugs, terrorism, student unrest, strikes, truancy and sabotage are all the elder or younger brothers and sisters of the same family. It is a half-truth to say that the basic cause of the use of drugs is boredom, and equally that its only aim is escapism, but you know that a half-truth is doubly wrong. I shall now add the other half of the truth by suggesting that the basic cause is also to be found in obedience to the promptings of Satan and that the aim is to seek unmerited publicity. The evil-complex can be traced back to the great falsehood which made the Fallen Angel the father of all lies. I am referring to the lie of all lies, partake of the fruits of this tree and you shall be equal to God. I make no apology for saying these things. I am saying them in deadly earnest. The world is partaking of forbidden fruit, because it wants to be the bearer of its own authority, its own lawmaker, its own arbiter, its own guide, its own defender, its own apologist, its own judge. In short, it wants to be its own God. No power above it, outside it, <span class="col_3049-3050" refersTo="page_1548"/>under it, all power in it, from it, unto itself. Student unrest. It is tragic that the drug addict knowingly and wilfully breaks down the resistance which his body itself builds up, by taking more and more of it. He breaks through the protective wall of immunity by neutralizing growing resistance with increasing abandonment. He opposes his friend and deliverer and makes common cause with his enemy, thus bringing about his own ruin and spiritual and physical degeneration. Can you believe, Sir, that one can enter into an alliance with the Devil against one&#x2019;s own person? Alcohol. Transgressors have been sentenced for 13 or more different offences in connection with alcohol. I go back to 1951 in order to show you how we arrive at the conclusion. The number of convictions was then 264,336. As far back as 1952 a slavish consumer of alcohol drank 90 bottles a month, and if he merely partakes of the cheap kind it costs him R120. As far back as 1952 the State received R22,844,414 in excise duties on alcohol. Modern psychology gives the following reasons for the abuse of liquor, in ascending order of importance. It is the convention and the habit and it is fear of the inferiority complex, it is craving for excitement, a search for relaxation, a desire to win social esteem, pleasure and escapism. And what are the consequences? They have been mentioned and are all too well known; drunkenness, assault, broken homes, child neglect, cruelty, divorce, poor health, imcompetence, mental derangement, accidents, unemployment, time wasting, squandering of money, wastage of food, the erosion of our police activities since they must use their time to control these people, the erosion of our hospital services which can provide better health services than having to admit these unfortunate victims, but this must take place because we cannot discard them. The law? Therapy by legislation will make little progress, it seems to me. Listen to pronouncements from &#x201C;A South African Study of the Alcohol Question&#x201D; by Dr. Simpson Wells, as far back as 1930. He stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If excessive drinking is to be controlled, it will never be by law.</block>

<p>In 1944 at Worcester Justice Jones already stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We cannot stop these crimes by the sentences we pass.</block>

<p>And in 1952 Professor A. I. Pretorius said before a Select Committee that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The more restrictions you impose, the more drunkenness you will find.</block>

<p>In the British Parliament in the fifties Lord Randolph Churchill had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is true that you cannot make men sober by legislation.</block>

<p>Now we come to control. There is the curtailment of licences. America, for example, relinquished prohibition, but 20 per cent of the population live in areas where local choice prevails in connection with the issuing of licences and the finding is that in heavily licensed areas&#x2014;and this is of great importance&#x2014;there is one case of drunkenness out of every 72 residents. But where licences are thinly scattered, there is one case of drunkenness out of every 1,054 residents in that area.</p>

<p>Fish Hoek in the Cape Peninsula has a unique history. When, in olden times, the land was promised to a certain Andries Bruyns, Lord Charles Somerset provided &#x201C;that no wine shop should ever be established on the property&#x201D;. I do not know what the case is to-day. It is said that peddling is the consequence. And what did police sergeant Van Tonder say in the early fifties to Fish Hoek&#x2019;s town clerk, Mr. A. B. M. Wright? Fish Hoek has the lowest crime figure in the entire Peninsula. Sir, the same also applies to Great Brak River. In the early fifties Dr. Wells also wrote, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Great Brak River industrial village, with 1,500 Europeans and a similar number of non-Europeans established by the Searle family in 1857, has never had a liquor licence. The tot system is unknown. They are content with the thought that what you never have, you never miss.</block>

<p>Then I come to education. I know of no other single act of volition on the part of man whereby so many millions are squandered, bringing misery and grief to so many millions. And if this is so, I ask: Can man be educated against the excessive use of drugs in his later life? And if this is the case, I ask in addition: Is this possible if enticing and challenging opportunities for drinking tempt him from around every corner? Is it possible if smuggling drags him along mercilessly and often causes him to end up in the vortex of the contraband trade where he earns a salary which he would never obtain by working out in the sunlight. Is it possible, Sir, if advertisements costing millions and millions of rands sing out and entice him in every step he takes? Is it possible if social opportunities for drinking, which can become objectionable, are sanctioned under his very eyes by adults? Is it possible if street-front pubs are crawling with boozers whose irritating carousing rends the air into the late hours of the night and no one can sleep? Sir, is it possible if the wives and children of drink-sodden Bacchanalian demons sit at home every night in humiliation and wait for them to turn up? Is it possible if their vile language wafts down the street for the ears of White and non-White <span class="col_3051-3052" refersTo="page_1549"/>children, adolescents and adults? Show me an animal, no show me a monster, with which a brutalized human being can be compared, brutalized as a result of not knowing what he is doing because he has become a poor, unfortunate slave to drugs. Sir, to combat this we have that triangle, i.e. the church, the home and the school. They form a triangular source of strength and education is their task: The home, the church and the school. Mr. Justice Ramsbottom stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One wonders what indulgence in alcoholic liquors costs this country in human life, in human failures, in misery and in money.</block>

<p>Noah, the righteous, was not to die in the flood waters. Who still remembers something of him, except that he sailed in the ark and landed on Arrarat, that shortly afterwards he lay drunk and brought shame upon his house? And to-day? Precisely the same, what I want to call the Noachian drink, drunkenness and shame pattern. We can only fall back upon the old methods in endeavouring to save the situation. Firstly, merciless action against smuggling; secondly, harness the triangular source of strength&#x2014;the home, the church and the school&#x2014;as a preventative measure; thirdly, provide rehabilitation centres; and, fourthly, however hackneyed it may sound, meet these people in their urge to escape and save them.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the question of noise is serious. It has bad effects on health almost to the same extent as the abuse of tobacco and alcohol. It has received less attention from the Government than any of these other abuses. Recently a Bill was passed concerning rehabilitation centres for the alcoholics. This House in the course of the last two weeks also passed a Bill concerned with the trading in drugs. Cigarettes have been left alone for the moment. But the question of noise has never been given the prominence which I think it deserves. We must first try to define &#x201C;noise&#x201D;. It is merely sound produced by movement of air, so that it makes an impact upon the human ear. We are only concerned with the human ear at the moment, which is offended by the noise, or sound, or air movement, which has become prevalent in the country. Now we must ask ourselves why we are concerned about noise. This concern is a comparatively recent phenomenon. We did not hear about it 40 or 50 years ago, whereas if we look back in history we will find that the older European nations were concerned about noise long before that time. As soon as a conglomeration of human beings came about and created large cities, the question of various noises came into prominence. If we look back, we would find that countries like France and Britain have passed legislation concerning the relationships between neighbours. In these countries there was no need to pass laws when the wireless was invented, nor to pass legislation when people had a brass band and gave a dance at their house or residence. All these problems have been quietly solved by the various countries themselves. As neighbours began to live closer together and increased, so one finds that the various civilized countries began to take action. They had to settle the problem of how much notice one is allowed to make before one&#x2019;s neighbour has reasonable grounds for complaint. This is a question of civilization. It has come to the fore here because the cities have become larger. Traffic which formerly consisted of an iron tyred vehicle rattling over the cobbles once in a while, is now a roar in which, in actual fact, one cannot separate any individual noise. It includes the hooting of motor cars and motor cycles. One of the worst people in the world, I should think, for personal discipline would be the average Frenchman.</p>

<p>What about the backbenchers in the kitchen?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Well, they too. A few years ago the Prefect of Police in Paris ordered no hooting at night. Everybody said that they would never do it, but they accepted it and it is an offence in Paris to hoot after dark. The result is that there is little hooting in France to-day, in the cities anyhow. They have become used to it, but one does not find that here. There is no restriction on hooting noise.</p>

<p>I lived in a pleasant home in Durban. It was a house from which one could see neither the road in front nor the road behind. My house was not unique in this respect. The whole of Musgrave Road in Durban was like that. There were few flats. Everybody had large gardens and it was a pleasant area in which to live. My nearest neighbour decided to put his house on the boundary next to me. I was delighted. One could not have a better neighbour. He put the kitchen on that boundary. But he had the misfortune to die. The house which he had built and which was so quiet, was bought and converted into a hotel. The manager of this hotel decided that he would increase his income by giving dances. If anybody here has ever lived near a hotel which gives dances, and had the kitchen on his boundary, they will understand with what one has to cope. First of all, one has to put up with the music, which is reasonable. I do not object to that. But then the dance comes to an end. On Saturday nights they have to end at 12 o&#x2019;clock. On the other nights they may continue. Saturday night is a nightmare. After the dance has ceased, the <span class="col_3053-3054" refersTo="page_1550"/>women go into what is known as a toilet room. There the young girls get together. Their escorts go outside and rev up their motorbikes. They collect at the doors which lead to the toilet room. They start by hooting, perhaps a little gently. Then end by standing on their hooters. They rev their motorbikes occasionally, just to make sure that they are still running. Ultimately, the women come out, chattering and gabbling. The hooting stops and one thinks that all is well. At last, one can turn over and go to sleep. But one is wrong. At this stage, the waiters commence to empty the dining room, to take the empties into the pantry, or wherever they store their supplies. The hon. the Minister would know that licensed hotels have two doors from the dining room into the kitchen. In the case of this particular hotel, neither of them has a latch, but both have springs. So the waiter leaving the dining room pushes a door and slams the door &#x201C;bang&#x201D; behind him. The waiter going in the other direction does the same thing with the door which swings in the opposite direction, but the sound goes in all directions. This goes on for roughly an hour after the dance is over. All the time it goes &#x201C;bang, bang, bang&#x201D;! When they come to the time when there are no more dishes to be moved, one thinks that now is the time for a little sleep. No, one is wrong. The beer and mineral water suppliers will come early the next morning, or, in fact, the same morning to collect the empties. The empties must be put into little boxes. The result is again &#x201C;bang, bang, bang&#x201D;! That goes on for a full hour. One can do nothing about the situation. The amenities at one&#x2019;s house have been destroyed by this habit of one&#x2019;s neighbour. It is a fine residential area, one of the best residential areas in the country. I want the hon. the Minister to bear that in mind. There should be rules laid down by which persons must consider their neighbours. It is made worse by wirelesses and all the noises of modern society. In our law no account is taken of this noise. We must take account of it because, as the hon. member for Berea has said, few people to-day can have a quiet night at home. They can habituate themselves to the roar of traffic, because it is a continuous roar.</p>

<p>At one time, when I was a student, I lived at the terminus of a tramway. This was a curious sort of tramway. Edinburgh is a town with beautiful streets. They do not want to have overhead tram cables, so they have what is known as a &#x201C;trolley system&#x201D;. The ropes that pull the tram are underground. This system is at the moment disappearing in Great Britain, but it still exists in San Francisco. As a student, the noise made by the trams did not wake us up. We were used to this roar. It was a terrible noise, but when it stopped, it woke us up, so we could not get a decent night&#x2019;s rest anyhow. We realize that life should be possible without unnecessary noise. The unnecessary noise to which I particularly refer is that caused by the builder. The builder is a pest, and in particular the builder of a tall building or one in a town, where the water level is about two inches from the surface, like in Durban. They are now erecting these large buildings. They are driving piles night and day. In order to do so they use unsilenced compressors. In an office, or a business, with outside the window an unsilenced compressor and a pile driver one soon learns what noise is. The Concorde is the only thing that will exceed it.</p>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am taking part in this debate this afternoon mainly for two reasons. The first reason is of course that I am particularly interested in this subject, and the second is that it affords me the opportunity to make my maiden speech. I hope that before we take a closer look at this motion, the mover of the motion will permit me to mention a few other matters. In the first place I bring good tidings from Newcastle. During the past few years we in Newcastle have experienced unparalleled development in both the economic and the industrial field. I think this fact places me in a special position this afternoon to make a contribution to this specific motion, because the matters that emerge from this motion may apply in that vicinity as well. The rate of development we have maintained during the past few years is probably unparalleled in the history of South Africa. We have developed at a rate of approximately 14 per cent per annum. Great progress has also been made in the agricultural field, although certain of the small farmers have begun to experience difficulties. The reasons for that are of such a nature that I shall not discuss them here this afternoon.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at this motion now. My concern is more with the abuse of tobacco and alcohol and other things then merely with their use, as stated in the motion. As regards item (3) of this motion I think the point at issue is more the possible detrimental effect of excessive noise. The factors that usually give rise to the abuse of alcohol in particular are normally found in an area where rapid development is taking place or where the normal order of things is disturbed. These are the factors which in the first place promote the abuse of these things. Let us look at this problem for a moment, especially with reference to my town and constituency, Newcastle. As I have said, we have had this unparalleled development there. We have had an unparalleled influx of people there, which has given rise to all kinds of factors. One may ask why this place has made such progress. I want to mention a few reasons before we proceed with this discussion. Of course, we form part of the Tugela Basin, as described in the report of Thorrington-Smith, &#x201C;A Plan for the Development of the Tugela Basin&#x201D;. We have sufficient level land, something which is very rare in Natal. We have water in abundance. We have the Buffalo River there with a potential of <span class="col_3055-3056" refersTo="page_1551"/>185 million gallons per day. We have the Chelmsford Dam there, thanks to the timeous planning of the Government. At this stage the dam still has surplus water. We have, of course, the great coal industry at Newcastle. We have no fewer than six or seven large coal and coke mines. Thanks to the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development we have, with the development of Madadeni and Oxizweni and other Bantu townships and areas, the largest labour potential in this country. The development that has taken place there, with the influx of people there, has given rise to certain social problems.</p>

<p>I now want to quote a few figures in order to indicate what the rate of development there has been. On 28th February the hon. the Minister of Labour quoted certain figures in this House, to which I shall now refer again. In Dundee the building figure for 1958 was R142,000 and in 1968 it was R.572,000. In Newcastle the figure in 1960 was approximately R150,000, while in 1968 it increased to R3,320.000. These places have therefore experienced phenomenal growth. What has been the result of this? The factors I have mentioned have given rise to housing problems. Perhaps the standard of living of the people there has also increased too rapidly. Sir, you know what a man buys who gets rich too quickly. He buys cigarettes and consumes alcohol, and this actually determines his new way of life. These things as it were have to serve as symbols of his new prosperity. The social problems mentioned in this motion have increased to a large extent. I do not suppose it is necessary for me to mention examples of alcoholism and the abuse of drugs and similar preparations. We see examples of this new cult in our streets. But we took note of these problems and we planned in good time. Through the agency of the Department of National Housing extensive housing projects were tackled there. Publicity campaigns were conducted by the various departments of health as well as the local authority. We tackled town planning on a large scale, which necessarily serves to counteract the social problems. We made use of the Slums Act in order to combat these problems. We undertook intensive planning, and provided <i>inter alia</i> the necessary sports facilities for the people. The old saying &#x201C;Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do&#x201D; remains true to this day.</p>

<p>I should now like to make a few observations on the various aspects of this motion. Firstly I want to refer to alcohol. The problem of alcoholism probably is as old as man himself. No subject has been more thoroughly investigated or discussed. Up to the present no real solution to this problem has been found, although certain scientific recommendations have been made. There are, however, a few facts in regard to alcoholism, and it is as well that we take note of them. This matter is not in the first place a moral problem only. It is a moral problem too, but in actual fact it is pre-eminently a psychiatric problem. It is a disease. We must consider it as such in giving it out sympathetic consideration. This phenomenon strongly manifests itself in times of social disorder. This has been proved over and over again by numerous examples. We think of the rapid industrial development. We think of the abuse of alcohol in times of war. We think of the use of alcohol during times of stress. The use of alcohol also increases with an increase in people&#x2019;s standard of living. A great deal of important research has been done on this aspect. We are aware of the detrimental effects of alcohol. We know that it has certain organic and mental effects. The psyche of man is affected. There are also other aspects of alcohol we must take into account, and these are the beneficial qualities of alcohol. We should not lose sight of these qualities completely. Alcohol is a food, because it is a very important source of calories. Alcohol is also an aperitif. In that respect it has many beneficial effects. I think the well-known initial stimulating effect alcohol has contributes much to the quality of some speeches that are made. There is one fact which is as plain as a pikestaff, however, and that is that no restrictive measure has ever brought anybody any closer to a solution to the problem of alcoholism.</p>

<p>The observations I want to make in respect of tobacco are to a large extent the same as those I have made in respect of alcohol. We are thoroughly aware of the detrimental effects of tobacco. We know that it may cause chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and probably lung cancer as well. As a matter of interest I want to mention that the incidence of lung cancer in the case of pipe and cigar smokers is little higher than in the case of non-smokers. The statistics would seem to indicate, however, that it is substantially higher in the case of cigarette smokers. There are still so many unknown factors or carcinogens, however, that one cannot be dogmatic about this matter. This question still has to be investigated very thoroughly. This is the task of the scientists. Therefore we must continue our research. We must wait until there is certainty about this matter before we try to find a solution to the problem, because no statement can be proved scientifically on the basis of statistics alone.</p>

<p>I would not like to discuss the matter of drugs. This matter was discussed very thoroughly in this House in the course of the debates of the past week or two. We also know that this matter is being very carefully controlled and handled by the hon. the Minister of Health, and that it is at present under discussion in the Other Place. I therefore want to say that I am not going to express any opinion on this matter at this stage. In any event, it does not fall in quite the same category as alcohol and tobacco. Let us just consider what the solution to this problem is. Do we find the solution in restrictive measures <span class="col_3057-3058" refersTo="page_1552"/>such as were mentioned here this morning? I just want to say that the best practical example we have in history in respect of restrictive measures is what happened in America at the time of its prohibition on alcohol. It is said that after that prohibition was applied the use of alcohol increased enormously. The mover of this motion said this morning that in certain states of America it is provided by law that there must be a warning on each packet of cigarettes that it was a dangerous substance. I just want to say that this has had no effect whatsoever on the sale of tobacco or cigarettes in that country. In Italy tobacco advertisements are totally prohibited. This prohibition has been in force for several years, without there being any decrease in or any appreciable effect on the sale of tobacco. We must seek the solution in education, in our universities, in our schools and in all the various educational media. We must look for the solution in the upliftment of our people, but I think the real answer is that we should find the solution by the cultivation of self-discipline. The State is already doing a tremendous amount towards the solution of these problems; there are the financial contributions to universities and various institutions, inter-departmental investigations are conducted in this connection, and there are facilities as provided by the Mental Disorders Act, just to mention a few.</p>

<p>Before concluding I also want to make a few remarks in connection with the question of noise. It is a good thing that we are aware of this particular problem, but I think that if we want to discuss this matter profitably we must confine ourselves in the first place to industrial noise. We must confine ourselves to industrial noise, because it definitely presents dangers. City noise does affect one&#x2019;s nerves, but industrial noise definitely presents mental and other dangers, such as impairment of the sense of hearing and so forth. That is why the Government provided that this matter should be properly investigated by means of research by the C.S.I.R. and the South African Bureau of Standards. In 1962 a practical code for the combating of excessive noise was adopted. This code was drawn up by the Bereau of Standards. In 1966 the Minister of Planning appointed an auxiliary committee which investigated the noises made by aircraft at various airports. In 1967 the Johannesburg City Council issued certain instructions in connection with sound research. Recently, in 1969, the Steering Committee on Accoustics and the Combating of Noise held their first meeting. Mr. Speaker, you can see that this Government has for many years been aware of the problems involved in this matter. Thorough research is being conducted, and the matter is being properly investigated.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to try to summarize the matter by saying that in these modern times of so-called freedoms we must look for the answer in the first place in education and in the cultivation of self-discipline, because unrestricted and undisciplined freedom is no freedom. We must lead our people back to their churches; we must lead our people back to the Altar and we must lead them back to our proven Afrikaner principles. In this modern age we need maturity and knowledge, because restrictive control measures alone will never solve this matter. We are grateful to know that this Government is also doing its share in this important matter.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened attentively to the maiden speech of the hon. member for Newcastle and we all will want to congratulate him on having surmounted the first hurdle of his Parliamentary career. He is the son of a distinguished and well-respected ex-member of this House. In his father he had an excellent example, which I am sure he will live up to. In passing I just want to say that he mentioned that he was bringing good news to the House from Newcastle; we thank him for it.</p>

<p>I am really glad that we have this motion before the House to-day. I only wish to deal with the latter part of it, namely noise and noise prevention in South Africa. In the past I have had private motions on this matter on the Order Paper, but unfortunately they could not be discussed and therefore, I am glad to have the opportunity this afternoon of speaking to this motion.</p>

<p>The problem of noise is a serious one. It is one caused by our modern industrial society, by the technological advances during the past decades and by the population explosion. One might almost call it these days a plague of decibels caused by the rising tide of the clatters and the bangs and the whistles and the clangs and the thumps that one hears in our modern society. The symptoms of this industrial disease, as one might almost call it, are serious. The effects of noise are not only of an annoying nature&#x2014;I am not trying to pun&#x2014;but they are indeed of a health nature, and excessive noise is indeed a health hazard. As a matter of fact, it has been estimated that the loss of hearing is five times greater to-day in a heavy industrial area than it is, say, in a country area or a quiet area. In America it has been estimated that if a 10 per cent loss of hearing were to be compensable in the case of people between the ages of 50 and 60 years, it would cost the American people and Government no less than R700 million a year. This gives an indication of how serious a health hazard noise is. Laboratory animals have been subjected to excessive noise, and there have been definite indications of change of brain structure, of liver, blood and enlarged hearts, and even of increasing blood cholesterol. All this was the result of noise.</p>

<p>In South Africa some brilliant work has been done in investigating this problem of noise. I think the S.A. Bureau of Standards <span class="col_3059-3060" refersTo="page_1553"/>has to be congratulated on the excellent work they have done in this respect. It has been estimated by Mr. Meij, the head of the division doing this research, that in no less than half of the 17,000 factories in South Africa the workers are exposed to excessive noise; they are exposed to a health hazard. It is indeed a health hazard throughout South Africa and particularly in our large centres. It is caused by many factors obvious to us. Traffic is a major factor. We have heavy duty vehicles. Scientific tests have shown that if you have a heavy lorry going up a hill with a defective exhaust, it makes a noise equivalent to that caused by 100 ordinary motor-cars. One finds special exhaust devices attached to their vehicles by young people which also cause excessive noise. There are buzz bikes and the needless revving of engines and the needless blowing of hooters. A bus stopping on a hill and starting with a long trail of cars behind it creates excessive noise, above the danger line of 80 decibels.</p>

<p>Then there are industrial noises and the noises associated with construction work. I am sure my hon. friends who represent Johannesburg constituencies will know all about construction work in that area and the noise caused by it. Pneumatic drills and rivetters and other construction tools create a din, day and night, in our cities. You find noise in the newspaper plants, and you find it in the mines where there are explosions and drills. You find it also in railway workshops, and particularly do you find it at airports, where the new jets will be coming soon. This will be one of the great problems of the next decade.</p>

<p>I see the hon. the Minister of Post and Telegraphs is here, and although we have ceased our discussions I might mention in passing an example of excessive noise in Johannesburg to-day. In Hillbrow you have one of the most densely populated areas in the whole of the world and in that area a huge tower is being erected. They are building this tower day and night, and it is causing excessive noise and a vast amount of dissatisfaction amongst the people living around that tower. Indeed, it is an ugly concrete monstrosity roaring and belching sparks day and night which cause a lot of inconvenience. It is one of the noisiest constructions ever undertaken in this country. It is hurling its detritus over all the motor-cars in the vicinity and on buildings. It is one of the biggest nuisances, in fact so big a nuisance that I think the hon. the Minister of Justice might be asked to investigate it. It is a very serious matter.</p>

<p>The future will also bring difficulties. The age of the jumbo jets is upon as and soon we will have the supersonic planes. These planes can cause a supersonic bang which can be heard for over 80 miles. It can have deleterious effect on health. In fact, it has been estimated that the supersonic Concord has the power of all the ships that leave a harbour such as Southampton in a whole week. That indicates the amount of noise that can be generated by such a plane. In South Africa, I am glad to say, investigations have been made on quite a considerable scale into this trouble of noise. We have the department of acoustics of the C.S.I.R. and we have the Mechanical Research Institute working on noise and investigating how it can be countered. We have had an important inter-departmental committee for the abatement of noise at airports under Mr. J. J. van Tonder, which was appointed either by the Minister of Planning or by the Minister of Economic Affairs. The Department of Labour has, I think, classified hearing loss as a compensable industrial affliction and, as I say, the Bureau of Standards has done brilliant work in regard to the matter. We have sent delegates to international conferences in Scandinavia on noise and we attended a conference in Copenhagen some years ago. The Bureau of Standards has done some practical work and it has drawn up an industrial noise code in 1962, a vehicle noise code in 1965 and a disturbance code in 1967. We have, therefore, got the facts on which some real practical steps can be taken to combat this nuisance.</p>

<p>I believe that the remedies have been delayed a bit too long. Certain municipalities have tried to act in regard to excessive noise. The Johannesburg Municipality is one, but they found that to a certain extent, although they have powers under the by-laws, they are hampered by the fact that certain enabling legislation is necessary from the side of the province and also from the side of Parliament itself. That has been the experience of some of the other big cities in our country, too, and this, I think, is where our duty lies, to determine how soon we should introduce legislation to combat this dangerous health hazard. I do not want to say how it should be done. There might be a select committee appointed to investigate the matter or we might have immediate legislation.</p>

<p>Overseas many countries are ahead of us in this respect. In Britain they have a very lengthy report on noise, a huge book, which came out in 1963, and since then they have been acting very actively in respect of this matter. In the U.S.A. many city ordinances and even state laws have been passed in regard to noise. I am personally interested in this matter and I have had a great deal of interesting correspondence with a Congressman from New York. He represents the 17th Congressional District in New York. We have had correspondence in regard to this matter of noise, and he has sent me copies of his speeches and also of a Bill he intends introducing in the U.S. Congress, and he wishes us luck with similar efforts of ours in South Africa. But the most important thing is to have legislative enactments in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>More important even than this are the practical steps that could be taken immediately. I <span class="col_3061-3062" refersTo="page_1554"/>believe that in all our cities the traffic police could do more in regard to stopping traffic noises. I believe that demolition workers should be curbed if their work causes excessive noise. In New York, I have been told, you are not allowed to use an air compressor or a pneumatic drill between the hours of 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. These things can, I believe, be prevented under by-laws. I believe that where cars are regularly tested, as they are for roadworthy certificates, it should not be too difficult to have a decibel counter to judge whether the noise made by such a car is excessive or not. I believe that is being done in West Germany. I also believe that there should be a ban on transistor radios in public, on trains and on buses. I do not wish to ban them altogether. I have no objection to somebody taking a transistor radio with him on to the beach if it has earphones. That would be practicable. A great deal can also be done now in regard to the effective planning of residential areas. Residential areas at the moment are growing like mushrooms near to the large airports and we will create a big problem for ourselves in future if we allow them to grow unplanned as they are growing to-day. In fact, I think in Cape Town it is estimated that in more than half of the new townships planned in the vicinity of the D. F. Malan Airport, the noise problem will become dangerous within the next 10 years, and it has been proved that even now the noise from jets is excessive in those areas. One can well imagine the greater problems we will have at Jan Smuts Airport in Johannesburg and at the airports in Durban and Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>I do not wish to pursue this matter further. I have made a few points which I hope will be noticed by the hon. the Minister and particularly the Minister of Health, who for good reasons is not able to be here this afternoon, to show how serious this matter is and how we believe that steps are urgently necessary. I believe that a lead can and should be given by this Parliament and the Government, and that we dare not delay any longer in dealing with this matter.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I find myself in a rather difficult position this afternoon. I was supposed to take the place of the hon. the Minister of Health in order to listen to the debate and convey the contents to him. But now the debate has taken such a turn that I am obliged to participate in it. I want to tell the hon. member for Berea that I find it a pity that his motion was framed in this way, i.e. so that it does in actual fact affect more than one Minister. I think that the Minister of Agriculture is affected, and so is the Minister of Health, as well as the Minister of Social Welfare, and as a result of the turn the debate took right at the beginning in regard to alcohol, my Department is affected, too. It would have been better to have done the same thing the hon. member did last year when he introduced a motion on dagga, when he isolated it so that we could discuss it properly.</p>

<p>I do not want to express views on the question of drugs, nor do I want to express views on the question of noise, or even on the question of the detrimental uses and effects of tobacco, but I do want to say a few words on the question of the consumption of alcohol, for as the Minister of Justice I am to a certain extent involved in it. This motion asks for an investigation to be made into the consumption of liquor with a view to the detrimental effects it may have on the health and well-being of the present and future population. Recently I also received a request from the welfare organizations, from the temperance society and from various church organizations for an inquiry to be made into the detrimental effects of the consumption of liquor. I gave very, very serious consideration to whether such an inquiry should be made; I think they requested a judicial inquiry, but eventually I arrived at the conclusion that it was not necessary for us to investigate the matter. Everybody knows exactly how detrimental it is and what the effects of excessive drinking are.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, whether people take this to heart is something else again. I want to congratulate the hon. member for Newcastle on having pointed out that the moderate use of liquor could also have beneficial effects. However, the difficulty lies in the abuse of liquor. The Liquor Act, which I administer, provides that I shall exercise control over the distribution of liquor. However, I do not have any control over the production of liquor. That is a matter for the Minister of Agriculture. We must remember that South Africa is a wine producing, a liquor producing country. We have a huge industry which has been built up around it. Of course, the people who produce liquor want to sell their liquor. The same applies to tobacco; the people who produce tobacco, want to sell their tobacco. In exercising control one must try to see to it that one eliminates the detrimental effects of the consumption of liquor. One can, of course, control it in various ways. The first way is to prohibit it entirely. The most desirable form of control would be to prohibit the use of liquor entirely. We all realize fully that it would be of no avail to prohibit the use of liquor. Prohibition in America taught us that it would be of no avail to prohibit the use of liquor, for if that were done people would only drink more; they would go on distilling liquor, even if they eventually had to distil it from a piece of wood. Therefore, there will always be liquor and people I will always drink liquor. What is the next <span class="col_3063-3064" refersTo="page_1555"/>thing one could do? One could try to curtail licences. I see the hon. member for Durban (Berea) nodding his head; he says that is the right thing. But experience has also shown that the number of licences granted makes very little difference when it comes to the quantity of liquor consumed.</p>

<p>All that happens is that fewer people get rich.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, all that happens is that fewer people get rich. People who want to buy liquor will do so. The next thing one could do is to throw the liquor trade wide open, but in the established liquor trade and the industry which has developed out of it there is not a single person who would tell one that the liquor trade should be thrown wide open. Therefore one cannot do this either. One should try to preserve the balance between the producer, the wholesale liquor dealer, the retail liquor dealer, the hotel-owner and the needs of the public. I can tell you, Sir, that it is not so easy to preserve that balance. And then one must, on the other hand, take the churches into account; one must take the temperance society into account; one must take the welfare organizations into account, and I am sure that nobody will envy the Minister of Justice that task which rests on his shoulders. But I want to add this: From my experience I am profoundly convinced that our welfare organizations and our churches and our temperance societies are waging an uneven struggle. The hon. member pointed out that millions were invested in the liquor trade, whereas these people did not have at their disposal the necessary means for combating the evils of excessive drinking. Of course, this evil may to a certain extent be combated by a Christian upbringing at home, where the evil of excessive drinking is pointed out, but I am afraid that the churches and the temperance societies and the welfare organizations are waging an absolutely uneven struggle. When everybody has had his share, these organizations are saddled with the wrecks. I feel that there is something lacking in this respect. What the solution is, is not clear to me at this stage. Where the money is to come from to enable them to wage this struggle properly, is not clear to me either. I am thinking along certain lines, but it is still not quite clear to me what should be done. What is in fact clear to me, is that they should in fact be enabled to wage this uneven struggle which they are waging at the moment, in a more effective manner</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to tell you what is happening in this country, what is happening in the Western Province to our Coloured population and what is happening to families that are being neglected. This is not something new to us; there is no need for me to have it investigated. I think we all know what the position is. One of the methods the hon. member mentioned, was that we should combat advertisements for liquor. That is not always such an easy thing to do. One would like to learn from the experience of other countries, of other people, and I have ordered an investigation to be made so as to ascertain what is being done in other countries.</p>

<p>We have received reports from roughly 16 different countries: New Zealand, Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Brazil, Kenya, Australia, Canada, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland, Italy, France, Sweden and the United States of America. We looked at what they were doing in this regard. They told us what they were doing in their countries, and it appears that out of the 16 there are only four countries where something is really being done about counteracting to a certain extent the publicizing and the attractive display of liquor. These countries are Canada, France, Sweden and the United States of America. At the moment my Department is engaged in studying further the legislation of these countries in this regard, and at this stage I do not wish to elaborate on it any further.</p>

<p>I do not think that I should go into the question of liquor and excessive drinking at this stage. I feel that if I did so, I would be treading on the toes of either our producers, or the distribution trade or our hotel industry, but I repeat that I believe that the welfare organizations and the people who see the other side of the coin, are waging an uneven struggle, and I think it is the task and the duty of the State to do something in this regard. I hope that it will sooner or later be possible for me to introduce a motion which may perhaps facilitate this task for them.</p>

<p>I welcome the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s indication that he is investigating what is going on in other countries in connection with this question.
