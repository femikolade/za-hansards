<p>The parliamentary system offers the Opposition various opportunities of attacking <span class="col_1053-1054" refersTo="page_0548"/>the policy of the Government and at the same time of making their alternative policy known to South Africa. One of those opportunities is a Budget debate. They had such an opportunity during the no-confidence debate. In the past we were used to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, when he introduced a motion of no confidence, coming forward with ten different points of attack with ten subdivisions each, but this time he departed from that procedure; this time he concentrated on one matter. It is the prerogative of the Opposition to choose its own platform of attack. This time they attacked the policy the Government is following in order to ensure the survival of the Whites in South Africa, in order to ensure co operation between the various races and the peaceful coexistence of those races, and they attacked the policy of separate development. Contrary to their usual practice they concentrated their entire attack on this one important facet of the South African political life. In the past they had four days in which to do that; this time they felt that they had a very strong case, and that is why they requested five days for that debate, and during that time they devoted all their attention to doing so. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to go into this any further, but that motion was rejected here by the representatives of the nation by 117 to 40 votes. Shortly after that they had their first opportunity of testing the opinion of the nation outside. They could have nominated a candidate in Graaff-Reinet but they did not see their way clear to nominating a candidate there in order to test the opinion of the nation and that seat was handed over to the National Party unopposed. This entire motion of no confidence was concentrated on race relations in South Africa and what policy we see as the solution to the problem. But shortly after this test, something else happened; the hon. member for Umlazi crossed over from that side to this side of the House.</p>

<p>In a short resume of the reasons for his resignation from the United Party he stated in the first instance that he had been impressed by the frank approach of the Prime Minister to South Africa&#x2019;s greatest problem, i.e. the colour problem, the very problem the debate was all about. While the United Party was attacking and condemning the policy of separate development, the hon. member for Umlazi crossed over and offered his assistance to the National Party Government because he believed that the solution to our problems lay in the application of the policy of separate development. That is indeed support for the standpoint of the hon. the Prime Minister; it amounts to a motion of no confidence in the United Party itself by its own members. Sir, it was their most concentrated attack and what was the result? Their attack did not even impress one of their own people; on the contrary, the result was that a former supporter of theirs crossed over to this side of the House. One can well understand the mixed reaction in the ranks on that side when the hon. member for Umlazi crossed over to the National Party. We can well believe that it was a heavy blow to the United Party. But, Sir, this is not the first time it has happened. Nor is it the first time it has happened as far as Natal is concerned. This is the third member of Parliament for Natal who has crossed over to the National Party.</p>

<p>Hon. members on that side do not want to say much about this matter. There were expectations that they would make use of this debate to say something about it, but the <i>Cape Times</i> says that &#x201C;they decided to play it cool&#x201D;. We can well understand why they do not want to say much about it. The fact remains that this is not the end of it; there are even more people among them who feel dissatisfied and unhappy. We see in the Sunday newspapers that Senator Pilkington-Jordan made a certain statement. He had this to say about the latest United Party crisis (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have lost all confidence in the leadership of Mr. Douglas Mitchell of the United Party of Natal. In my opinion Mr. Harry Lewis, a first class Member of Parliament, can in his crossing over to the National Party be regarded as an extremely grave loss.</block>

<p>We see therefore that even Senator Pilkington-Jordan does not feel very happy about the leadership there. Hon. members may ask: But why quote him? Well, Senator Pilkington-Jordan is in a special position because he is a Senator elected by the electoral college of Natal to have a seat in the Senate. He is unhappy about the leadership in Natal, and we can understand why the United Party, so shortly after the loss of Umlazi, felt unhappy about his criticism. The Senator was then called in to the Leader of the United Party, and a statement was subsequently issued. The newspaper report read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Graaff helped&#x2014;The statement, drafted with the aid of Sir De Villiers Graaff and Senator Oelrich, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on Monday night is as follows &#x2026;</block>

<p>The report then states that the Senator feels that he should perhaps have consulted the leader of Natal first. He should perhaps have considered the matter further before making his statement, and he said: &#x201C;It might have changed my opinion.&#x201D; So he was not at all convinced after that little conversation. I think therefore (hat we are entitled to assume that we have by no means experienced or seen the final disintegration of the United Party. They put me in mind of the story about the <span class="col_1055-1056" refersTo="page_0549"/>Coloured who caught crayfish along the coast and then threw them into a basin of boiling salt water. A passer-by saw the crayfish in the boiling water and asked him whether it was not cruel to act in that way, upon which the Coloured replied, &#x201C;No, my master, we always throw the crayfish in, and by now they have become used to the boiling water&#x201D;. So many leaders of the United Party, so many of their Senators, so many of their M.P.s and so many of their leaders outside have crossed over, that they have probably become used to it. As I say, we can be sure that we have not yet seen the final disintegration of that side.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that this debate affords the Opposition an opportunity of expressing their no confidence in the Government, it also affords them an opportunity of attacking the financial and economic policy of the National Party. Parliament was prorogued eight months ago, and we thought criticism of the general policy of the Government would be forthcoming in this debate. It was not forthcoming in the no-confidence debate, and during this debate the Opposition&#x2019;s attack centred around the drought conditions in South Africa, as well as the position of pensioners, as viewed against the background of the high cost of living. These were the only items they selected, these were their only points of attack, and the fact that they only selected these points is to our minds proof that there are no other matters to which they attach any value. We must deduce from that that they do not see their way clear to attacking the general financial and economic policy of the Government. We know that there is confidence at home today as far as South Africa&#x2019;s economic and financial position is concerned, and we also know that there is confidence abroad. One of the most striking signs of the confidence abroad is without doubt the fact that so much capital is flowing into this country.</p>

<p>During the first three quarters of last year the influx of capital was R325 million, and if we take this back to the amount since the beginning of 1965, we see that the total influx of foreign capital was R901 million. It can be said that this influx of money is attributable to the fact that there is a lack of confidence in certain monetary units overseas. That is partly correct. We will not deny that part of this capital was flight capital, &#x201C;hot money&#x201D;, but at the same time we know that a great deal of the capital which flowed in was in fact investment capital which made a contribution to the economic development and prosperity of this country, capital which we have never discouraged but which the Government has always said was welcome. However, this great flow of capital also gave rise to problems. It caused a large measure of liquidity which did in fact have a disrupting effect. The Minister of Finance took certain steps, such as the latest jubilee issue, a campaign to draw off capital. To a certain extent he relaxed foreign currency exchange, so that investments could be made abroad. But we know that there is still an overabundance of liquidity.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been possible to intensify measures against this influx and disruption; but on the other hand we had another problem as well, i.e. that this capital was having a prejudicial effect on the Stock Exchange. But the fact that this capital flowed into South Africa is also attributable to the fact that the outside world has confidence in the rand, the South African monetary unit. That is another reason for this capital influx. But that was not all. It was not only confidence in the monetary unit which caused the capital influx; it was to an equal extent confidence in the political stability of a government which has caused capital to flow into the country. This Government has during recent times seen to it that there was political stability, an important factor which has fostered confidence in South Africa.</p>

<p>But if we were to think of the problems recently being experienced, then I think one could not help referring to the unstable conditions in the monetary sphere. Here in particular one must think in terms of praise of the contribution which my colleague, the Minister of Finance has made in order to try to stabilize South Africa&#x2019;s position in that unstable world. He has done everything in his power to maintain South Africa&#x2019;s position. He emphasized repeatedly that South Africa believed that a higher gold price was justified. But apart from that, new demands were made on him when attempts were made to demonetize gold, to remove it as the basis of the world&#x2019;s monetary unit. He was not consulted in regard to steps which were taken, but during all that time he played an important role by displaying his own confidence in gold. During that time the outside world, the ordinary citizen and the speculator, also showed that they had confidence in the price of gold. In the same way there were other governments which also had confidence in the stability of gold. It is no wonder that towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year even the most important establishment began to have doubts as to whether this attempt to do away with gold as a monetary basis was justified. As recently as January of this year the First City National Bank wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The manifold efforts over the past few years to safeguard and improve the international monetary structure cannot be brought to a successful conclusion unless the matter of adequacy of new monetary gold supply is dealt with as one of the fundamental factors in international equilibrium.</block>

<p>I think this is the standpoint which is beginning to prevail. Since we are to-day referring under this Vote to the contribution of the Minister of Finance, we can rest assured that the whole of South Africa is behind him in maintaining that important right that our newly mined gold can be sold to the Monetary Fund. We praise him for that contribution and we are convinced that his confidence therein is not only supported here, but is enjoying ever-increasing support in the world.</p>

<p><span class="col_1057-1058" refersTo="page_0550"/>As regards this increased speculation on the Stock Exchange, to which my hon. colleague referred, I do not want to go into details, but there is another aspect to which I must refer. One of the reasons for this excessive speculation on the Stock Exchange is the takeovers which are taking place there. I want to refer here to the causes which led to this speculative purchase of shares during recent times, i.e. the large number of amalgamations of undertakings on the horizontal as well as the vertical plane, I admit that a great many benefits can be derived, not only for the undertakings concerned, but also for the national economy as a whole through the merging of undertakings. However, the amalgamations can also be aimed at giving the groups in question a position of power in the market, or at giving them control over important raw materials. The amalgamation of undertakings for the latter purpose cannot of course be regarded as being in the interests of the country. I therefore want to issue a serious warning to undertakings in the Republic not to proceed to amalgamation with the principle aim of acquiring for themselves a position of power in the market or a control over important natural resources.</p>

<p>The Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act of 1955 contains in its present form powers in terms of which mergers can be investigated and the merged undertakings can even be disbanded, if such an investigation should reveal that the merger would establish a monopolistic condition which was prejudicial to the public interest. If amalgamations take place which in my opinion are prejudicial to the public interest, I will not hesitate to use these powers. I may also add that my Departments are at present giving consideration to the formulation of more extensive statutory powers which would enable the Government to take more effective steps against amalgamations which may be prejudicial to the public interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Sneaker, when we consider the economic position in South Africa, we look back with a measure of pride to the position during the last few years and particularly since 1963. The growth which has taken place is without parallel. According to the economic development programme the target which we have set ourselves is a growth of 5&#x00BD; per cent. Up to the present it has been 6.4 per cent, even higher than that considerable target we set ourselves. The question as to whether we are going to maintain it, has been put by an hon. member on the Opposition side. I may say that the Government has decided to retain that target of 5&#x00BD; per cent for the ensuing six-year period. The figure for the past year, which has still to appear, may be less than 5&#x00BD; per cent. We are expecting this, because Government measures were aimed at effecting a lower rate of growth. We shall consequently welcome it, since our actions were aimed at achieving that. But even if the average development for the ensuing few years is lower than 5 per cent we will still be able to maintain an average of 5&#x00BD; per cent when our actions and growth in recent times is taken into account. South Africa therefore occupies an economically strong position to-day, and the interest of the outside world is focussed on it. It is therefore no wonder that 28 trade missions visited South Africa last year, and that this number will certainly be exceeded this year. However, that growth has brought with it problems as far as inflation and an increasing cost of living is concerned. The Government measures which were aimed at curbing the increasing cost of living have been successful, because in 1967 the rate was only 1.8 per cent. When we compare this with that of the rest of the world, South Africa&#x2019;s position is one of the most favourable. The First National City Bank publishes an annual comparative survey. From that it appears that during the ten-year period 1957 to 1967 the average increase in the rate of inflation in South Africa was only 2.2 per cent. The only appreciable or comparable country where the rate during those ten years was less, was the United States of America. But in other countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, all the European countries, Canada and Australia, the increase was greater. We have therefore succeeded in keeping it low. There has been a greater increase during the past year, and the hon. the Minister of Finance has indicated that the average was 2.7 per cent. There is a rising tendency, but when we make an analysis it becomes apparent that food is a very important factor. Compared with the previous year, for example, the price of vegetables increased by 29 per cent and that of fruit by 8 per cent. The prices of fish and meat have also in creased. There are special conditions, such as drought conditions, which caused this increase. Although there has been an increase in the cost of living, the important question is what happened in regard to wages. One then comes to this important conclusion, i.e. that although there was an increase in the cost of living during the past few years, we find that the wages of Railway workers, factory workers, miners and public officials have increased to a far greater extent during the past ten years than the relative increase in the cost of living. The same applies to pensions. The Government has been attacked here on pensions, and I have made a comparison with the position as it was in 1961. While the cost of living increased over the period 1951 to 1961 by 60 per cent, pensions increased by an average of 140 per cent, and war veterans pensions by as much as 214 per cent. The Government has therefore not been indifferent to this very important sector.</p>

<p>Reference was also made here to the assistance to farmers as a result of devaluation. In this regard as well the Government has not been indifferent. In view of the minute or so which I still have at my disposal, I shall only be able to review the position very briefly. The assistance rendered by the Government as a result of devaluation to various sectors of our economy amounts at this stage to more <span class="col_1059-1060" refersTo="page_0551"/>than R5.3 million. Of that R1.65 million went to the citrus industry; R1.1 million to the canned fruit industry; R780,000 to the pineapple canning industry; while R2 million was paid out in support of the most important deciduous fruit. The latter amount will be transferred to the Deciduous Fruit Board for distribution. In addition, there are certain sectors of the industry which have also been assisted. As hon. members will recall, the Minister of Finance stated on a previous occasion that he expected certain sectors of agriculture to suffer hardships as a result of devaluation, and that the Government would consequently give consideration to lending assistance in deserving cases. Well, we have honoured this undertaking.</p>

<p>When we look back over the past few years therefore then we do so with pride, on account of the economic and financial stability which has been effected and maintained by this Government.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I was amazed to see the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs spending so much of his limited time trying to draw a red herring across our path. I could not see what he hoped to achieve by that and, consequently, it was just as well that he came back to economic affairs. This is not the type of thing we expect of a Minister. It is much more appropriate for hon. gentlemen sitting on the back benches.</p>

<p>But let me say that I agree with the Minister that in South Africa to-day we have a very fine stabilization of our affairs. However, that is not due to the Government, but to the individual, to the entrepreneur. [Interjections] Let me prove this by just one statement. In this strong economic structure the weakest link is those things tackled by the Government. I refer to the border industries specifically. Let me deal with this for one moment. I had an opportunity during the last recess of visiting some of these border areas. Let me tell the House what I found at, for instance. Hammarsdale. Hammarsdale was being held up to us as being a very fine effort on the part of the Government to establish industries which could give employment to the 35,000 Bantu who could be employed there. I went into a very large factory there a factory which is producing cloth. Now, it is very interesting to see how that cloth is being produced. By the way, this cloth is being produced there for sale mainly within South Africa. What did we find? The cloth was manufactured mainly from second-hand clothing brought into the country from Australia and America. The clothes are then sorted and shredded and the wool residue is converted by means of a wonderful process into cloth once more. My colleagues and I looked around to see whether South African wool was being used. This is an important consideration, because the I.D.C. must have spent a lot of money there. Did the I.D.C. spend that money to promote the use of South African material and to give employment to the Bantu of the vicinity? Well, what did we find? I was told there that the only type of material for which South African wool was being used was in the material for army overcoats. I always thought that it is the intention of the Government and of the I.D.C. to build up this type of industry in order to promote the use of our own materials. Or is the material being used there, South African material which went overseas and came back again in the form of second-hand clothing? Here we have these large factories and we must remember that they have been put up to employ 35,000 people. With what result? We found that even in this very large factory only 57 Bantu were employed in three shifts, 19 per shift. These figures may be wrong and I stand to be corrected. But these were the figures I was given there. Most of the work processes were mechanized, with the result that there was very little work left for the Bantu to do. The question one asks oneself is, why were these factories established there? What perks did they get? That is what I would like to know. In the report of the I.D.C. I find that for border area development the I.D.C. has during the year 1967 spent almost R49 million. Mr. Speaker, the time has come when, where such large globular sums are invested by the I.D.C., we in Parliament should at least be given a detailed account of how this money is being expended and with what results. For instance, I should like to know how much of this R49 million has perhaps been lost? In any event, what has happened to this amount of money? Has every cent of it been used up? The Minister should tell us. The Minister of Finance can perhaps in his reply tell us how the I D C. works and whether it is possible for us to get a breakdown of these figures so that we may know exactly what is happening to the money that is being spent here. After all, this is taxpayers&#x2019; money and the taxpayer is entitled to know what the Government spends on ideologies and how it is spent.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the question of mining taxation. I agree with the hon. member for Kensington that the time has come for mining taxation to be reviewed if it is at all possible, especially in regard to the marginal mines and new mines. After all, it is the new mines which will give employment to the mineworker As the old mines go out. the new mines will take over and employ those people working on the old mines. I want to know whether it is possible to arrange taxation in such a way that there will be no fear of a mineworker losing his job because of the rising costs of secondary industry. If the cost goes up we will find that it may be almost impossible to mine the gold we have underground. I think the person who is entitled to be protected from the very start and who is entitled to get any reward when the price of gold goes up is the mineworker, but we cannot afford at this stage, because of taxation&#x2014;there may be other factors also&#x2014;to be left with the fear that some of our mines are in danger of being closed, however, marginal they are. It is virtually impossible to re-open <span class="col_1061-1062" refersTo="page_0552"/>a mine, as the hon. the Minister knows. We want to see these mines working and employing as many of our people as possible.</p>

<p>Now I want to leave that for the moment to go back to the question raised by the hon. member for Constantia, who spoke about the prices in cinemas. This was featured again this morning in most of the newspapers, and I think it is time that the hon. the Minister does something about it. There is an inequality, firstly, in the prices being charged, whether the province has an entertainment tax or not. In the Transvaal there is no entertainment tax and yet the prices there are higher than they are in some of the other places. Not only are the prices different from province to province and for the same type of entertainment&#x2014;I am sure it does not cost more to show a picture in Johannesburg than it does in Cape Town or in Durban&#x2014;but on different days of the week they are entitled to charge different prices and the prices are highest at the week-end. Who goes to the cinema at the week-end? It is the working man. Why should he have to pay more because he chooses to go on a Saturday, than if he had the opportunity of going on a Monday? These things should be levelled out. It is one of the things which are annoying to the ordinary man in the street, and we would like to know whether the Minister intends doing an thing about it. I suppose this is one aspect among hundreds of prices which vary from place to place.</p>

<p>I want to leave this now and deal for a moment with the position of the fixed salaried man, the man in the street who has a fixed salary. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs told us that his salary has increased more than the rise in the cost of living and he gave us percentages. Now percentages do not impress me at all. If a man is earning R1 and he gets 100 per cent increase, he earns R2, but it sounds nice to say that his salary has gone up 100 per cent. But in actual figures we find that the man in the street with a fixed salary has great difficulty in making ends meet, and especially the young married couple. What do we find there? The young married man finds it virtually impossible to buy a house. The cost of land has gone up tremendously. It is strange to me that a piece of vacant land which two years ago cost RX should now cost three times as much, and not only that, but the cost of building has gone up, too. Homes which could have been erected at R5 a square foot two years ago, are to-day costing R8 per square foot. The ordinary salaried man finds it almost impossible to buy himself a house. If he rents a house he finds difficulty in paying the rent, so what happens? His wife has to go out and work as well. The same sort of circumstances now apply to flats because the rentals of flats, except in the case of rent-controlled blocks of flats, have risen beyond the reach of the ordinary wage earner and there again the wife also has to go out and work. What is more distressing to me is that many of these flat owners refuse to have children in the flats. It may be possible for a young married couple to live in comfort in a bed sitting-room with a kitchen and bathroom, but once they bring in a child they are barred from the flat, so they have to rent more expensive accommodation. Where does the money come from? If the wife has to go out and work as well as the husband, they have to employ a servant for the child. The employment of a servant to-day, according to Nationalist ideology, is absolutely taboo; that must not be done. But say, for instance, a servant is not engaged and the child is put into a creche. Sir, it costs money to keep a child in a cr&#x00E8;che. I would like the hon. the Minister to make a study of the position and to see whether it is not possible again to start fixing the rentals of certain flats where the rentals have risen beyond the reach of the ordinary working man; to see whether something cannot be done to force landlords to allow newly married couples, young people who are starting in life, to have children living in the flat. It is becoming almost impossible for people to buy houses or to rent houses, and yet if they want to go into a flat they find that they cannot go into a flat because children are barred. I think we should do something about this.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, a word or two about pensioners. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has touched on this and told us how well off the pensioners are to-day.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>That is what he tried to sell to us. I want to know whether the hon. member for Brakpan agrees that they are not well off? Are they well off or not? What did the hon. the Minister say? He gave the impression to this House that they were well off. The hon. member for Brakpan agrees with me that they are not well off. Sir, as in all other countries our population is increasing very rapidly. Not only is there a population explosion in South Africa which is affecting the Whites and the non-Whites, but because of the advances made in medical science we find that people are living to an older age, so the Minister is now faced with the problem of having to provide pensions for more people for longer periods. That is a problem that we have to face. If these people are going to live longer and there are going to be more of them, now is the time to start making provision for them. What I said about a young married couple also applies to some extent to the pensioner. The pensioner cannot possibly afford to continue living in a house if he happens to have one because rates and taxes have risen out of all proportion to the value of the house. He finds that he has to sell his house in some cases and then look for other accommodation. What happens to the male or female pensioner who is living alone? They cannot live in a house; they have to find other accommodation, and with the sudden rise in the value of ground, people no longer <span class="col_1063-1064" refersTo="page_0553"/>have lodging houses. A number of boarding houses are disappearing from the scene, and what do we find? We find the old people have no place to go to. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) told us yesterday what was happening in his town. We have got to see that provision is made for these people and it has to be made now so that in a couple of years&#x2019; time these people will have a place to go to. For the life of me I do not know what this Government is doing in this respect, it has been dilly-dallying so long in making provision for these people. It is impossible for a pensioner to exist on the pension paid to him by the department. He gets R28 per month plus a little bonus of R4, which means he has R1 per day to live on, if he gets the bonus. Of this money he has to pay about 50 per cent for his rent alone and that means he has a meagre 50 cents with which to live on the rest of the day. How is he going to spend it? He has to make a choice&#x2014;either he has breakfast or he has lunch or else he spends the money on his supper. That is what it is coming to. It is all very well for those old people who can stay with their families, but I am particularly concerned about the pensioner who has no family and who perforce has to live alone.</p>

<p>Another point arises from the shortage of accommodation for the old people in the centre of our towns and cities. Until a few years ago that is where they used to live, but the buildings are all being knocked down now. They now have to live out of town, sometimes far away, and they have to have transport. What do they do? The hon. the Minister tells me the pension increases have kept pace with the rise in the cost of living. Well, last year it cost one five cents to travel by bus from Sea Point to Cape Town, this year it costs seven cents. That is about a 40 per cent rise, and yet the Minister tells me that according to the way he looks at the figures the rise in the cost of living is not outstripping the rises the Minister gives to our old age pensioners. The Minister was telling me how much vegetables were being produced, but can we imagine an old age pensioner buying goods wholesale? Image an old man or an old woman buying a whole box of tomatoes because it works out cheaper per pound, yet the old person does not have a refrigerator to keep them in. All he can do is buy one or two tomatoes for ten cents. That is what the poor old people have to do, they cannot buy in bulk. One cannot buy half-a-pint of milk from a milk shop any longer, one has to buy a pint. Why should that have happened. People with families can buy a pint or even three or four pints. [Interjection.] But the pensioner must have money with which to buy it, and when he has bought it he must have a place in which to keep it because he cannot afford to let the milk go sour and throw it away.</p>

<p>I should like the Minister to go into these matters and find out how many people need help, and, if necessary, make sure that help is coming to them. What do we find in the survey which was done in Johannesburg recently? There we find 40,000 people at the moment who are over 60 years of age, and 1,600 of them have incomes of R50 or less per month whilst 7,000 have no income at all; they do not get a cent other than the social welfare or old age or any of the other pensions. They have no other means of living.</p>

<p>To individuals, not families, because there would be many more people if the figures referred to families. We also find that the average rental that these 40.000 people are paying, comes to R32 per month. That is equivalent to the whole of the pension that this person would receive. I have been lenient with the Minister when I said that a person paid half his pension in rental, but it is much higher than that. How these people manage, is beyond me. It has been admitted here that the cost of living, percentagewise, has risen by 2.7 per cent this year alone. The price of food, <i>per se,</i> has gone up 3.6 per cent. There are a hundred and one other matters in regard to which the pension must see them through. They have to see about the cost of illness. They have to find a place to attend to their illness. A person goes to a hospital, and he may really need admission to a hospital. Because of the shortage of nurses at the moment, he cannot get into the hospital, he cannot get a bed in the hospital. So what happens to this poor individual? He has to go home where there is nobody to look after him. I spoke about this matter last year. I said to the Minister that something had to be done to improve the facilities of the district surgeons, if they are available. But there is a shortage of district surgeons. Where are these people going to get their help from? Those who are ambulatory are still able to go to clinics, but very often it is far from their place of residence. It is very easy to say, &#x201C;If you are ill, go to a clinic. But you must either walk there or pay the bus fare&#x201D;. I leave it with the Minister to solve that problem. But he has to do something about it.</p>

<p>What do you suggest?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. the Minister what I suggest in the minute or two at my disposal.</p>

<p>Firstly, there must be a rise in salary of those people who are going to provide health services, so that people will be attracted to that type of work. At the moment, this type of medical practice is the orphan, the Cinderella of the department. It is the least attractive part of the whole profession. We have to make it much more attractive. We have to see that there are clinics that are accessible in those areas where there is a large number of people who require help. There must be clinics in the <span class="col_1065-1066" refersTo="page_0554"/>poorer localities. Local authorities must be encouraged to establish them. There must be more district surgeons and district nurses. The district nurses must be able to visit the patients. There must be telephonic communications in the areas with those people who are prepared to render the service. Does the hon. member know that to-day, if one wants to obtain the service of a district surgeon, one has to get it through a police station. Do hon. members know what the policy of the Government is in this regard? To close police stations, whenever possible. How many police stations were closed in Johannesburg during the past few years? Where do these people go to obtain permission for a district surgeon to visit them if the police station in the area is being closed? They close the police stations, because it will allow for more personnel to go to another place. But the man who needs the police station, he can stay without it. We are not talking about protection from the Police; we are talking about emergency cases. If I ring up and say I want the district surgeon to come to so and so, and give them the address, I have very little chance of that district surgeon arriving there. He will want to get authority to go.</p>

<p>I want to leave these matters at that. I have tried to be as explicit as I possibly could, and I hope that what I have said, will be taken note of. I hope too that those people who jeered at what I have said, will get up this afternoon and give solutions to the problems that I have put before the House.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member for Rosettenville will forgive me if I do not follow him in his line. He loaded his gun with a lot of small shot. What I do want to do is to say thank you to the hon. member for Kempton Park for the welcome he gave me yesterday. It is typical of the welcome I have had throughout from this party, and I want to express my thanks publicly now. I also want to thank all of those people in South Africa who took the trouble to react to what I had done and I want to say that I am pleased and thrilled with their reaction. The people of South Africa have shown me, and I believe the country as a whole, in no uncertain terms that they want unity between the white groups, they want the white man&#x2019;s future assured and they want an honest solution to our colour problem. Of all the messages I have received whether by telegram, letter, telephone or personal calls only ten people have disapproved of the action I have taken. I want this House to know this, because I think it is important and that it is going to be important in the future. It is also obvious to me that the people who have taken the trouble to contact me and send me their good wishes are also of the same opinion as I, namely that these objectives I have named are only achievable by this party and by this Government.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to deal now with the problems of the United Party, because they are no longer mine, and for that I am rather thankful. There are one or two points which I think should first be answered. The first one is the fact that I have read in the newspapers, and I have also heard, that certain people class me as a liberal. I would like to bring to the notice of the House that as long ago as 1964 I questioned the policy of the United Party regarding its application to the Coloured and Indian people of this country. I would also like to point out that I am here where I am and that I am happy to be here. I think this is perhaps the complete answer to that particular problem.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with a question that has been raised, namely that I have heard that I was not going to get the nomination in 1971 from the United Party for the constituency of Umlazi. I was not going to get it in 1965 either, but I got it. From the reports I have had from senior people in the United Party I see no reason why I should not have got it in 1971 as well.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the question of resigning my seat in Umlazi. This question of resigning has cropped up from time to time whenever anybody has changed allegiance in this House. It is a fact that a person is elected to a seat, but in addition to that I would like the House to know that I have not had one request from a person in my constituency to resign my seat and to fight it again. This is quite significant, in view of the fact that the hon. member for Port Natal is a constituent of mine and even he has not done so. I have had a belated request from the Regional Council of the United Party in Durban, which arrived a week and a day after I crossed the floor of this House. One is inclined to think that perhaps they were not quite so worried about it either.</p>

<p>Sir, the question has been asked: &#x201C;Why am I throwing race federation overboard?&#x201D; I shall tell this House why. I am doing so because I believe it is white &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; in a gift wrapping. It has been said that people do not understand it and that that is why they do not accept it. But, Sir, of course people understand it. I believe that the people of South Africa are far more intelligent than that. They know what people are trying to sell them. The hon. member for Simonstown knows what it means, because he says: &#x201C;We unashamedly stand for white leadership.&#x201D; May I tell him, Sir, that he does not have to apologize for white leadership. This Government has been showing this country white leadership for 21 years now, and very successfully too. They have not had to be ashamed of it, or unashamed of it. They have not had to make any apology whatsoever.</p>

<p>Let us look at this policy of race federation briefly. I do not have much time. Let us see what its aims are. Its aims are basically, I think, to give the various race groups of South Africa control of those things which intimately are theirs. It also suggests that they be brought together in a federal parliament. First of all I <span class="col_1067-1068" refersTo="page_0555"/>want to say that the federal aspect of bringing together the &#x201C;haves&#x201D; and the &#x201C;have-nots&#x201D; is itself a cause for some explosion in the future, and for unhappiness for South Africa. What representation will the various groups have in that parliament? None at all, Sir. The Coloureds can go to Parliament if they can get elected. What has been the past history of the election of Coloured people? They have not been able to succeed in being elected. Therefore the chances of the odd Coloured man ever being present in that federal parliament are almost nil.</p>

<p>What about the Indians, Sir? No provision has obviously been made for them. It is said that we will discuss the matter with them when the Opposition gets into power. What kind of a promise is that to the Indian community of South Africa?</p>

<p>And what about the Bantu, Sir? It would appear that for all time they are going to be represented by Whites. So, what kind of a federal parliament is this, and what kind of representation is this to give people within that federal parliament? That federal parliament is obviously going to be controlled only by the white group of South Africa. Is this an honest and sincere approach to the problems and the aspirations of the various race groups of South Africa? Sir. I say it is not, and this is why I call it &#x201C;white &#x2018;baasskap&#x2019; in a gift wrapping&#x201D;. I do so because I sincerely believe that that is what it is.</p>

<p>I now come to separate development, as I see it. What does it mean? I believe that it means exactly what it says. I believe that it offers advancement to all the racial groups of South Africa without any restrictions, according to their ability to advance. Now, what more can any man ask, Sir? The United Party puts restrictions all along the road in the way of the political advancement of the various race groups. There will be restrictions&#x2014;T have mentioned them&#x2014;upon getting into the federal parliament, which is supposed to be their parliament where they can voice their opinions in matters of national importance. You see, Sir, even in the case of the Cape Coloureds, the hon. the Prime Minister was quite honest. He says that our children will have to solve their problems in the future. I admire him for making that statement, because it shows in him an approach to this problem which is honest and sincere. He is not prepared to tell South Africa: &#x201C;We will manufacture a Colouredstan. We will do this, that and the other thing.&#x201D; He has told us quite sincerely: Let us first make the Coloureds aware of themselves. Let us first bring the Coloureds together as a group of people. They have been used as a political football over the years. First of all these people have to have confidence restored in themselves. They have to be taken away from regarding themselves as the unwanted race of South Africa, because it would appear that they are more unwanted than any other group. These people have then to have their dignity restored. They must then be put on the road to managing their own affairs. I believe that this policy of separate development puts them on that road. We cannot say: &#x201C;There is your Colouredstan, you can have it to-morrow.&#x201D; But I do not believe that alters the position one tiny little bit. The Opposition cannot fight with this, because this still offers the Coloureds far more than their race federation policy offers them. It offers the Coloured people throughout South Africa immediate representation. They can now get their image back again. They can build themselves up as a group. They can have a council in which they can express their opinions. Through this council they can consult with the Government immediately, and not in the distant future, if they can get elected to a parliament. They can have this right now, Sir. I believe that this offers them a promise for the future which is going to make all the difference in the world to the Coloured people.</p>

<p>My time is unfortunately very short. I should therefore in conclusion like to remind this House that it is easy to sit and criticize a government which is implementing the details of its policy in public view. You know, Sir, when one is in opposition it is quite easy to say, as it does: You do not expect me to dot the i&#x2019;s and cross the t&#x2019;s. We, Sir, this Government, have to dot the i&#x2019;s and cross the t&#x2019;s, and thank goodness this Government has the courage to dot those i&#x2019;s and cross those t&#x2019;s. They are doing it to the satisfaction of the people of South Africa. This is in my opinion a wonderful thing, because it is very easy to advance theories of various other race solutions in South Africa, whilst you know that there is a government in power which is strong enough and has a policy which is acceptable, and which it is implementing. But whether those theories become practical from the point of view of a party in power is a different matter altogether. Is it any wonder, then, that this Prime Minister has the support of the people of South Africa, that he is leading South Africa from strength to strength, and that he has been able to maintain peace and order in these times of change and unrest in many other countries of the world? I support him one hundred per cent.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat made reference to an honest and sincere approach to the problems of South Africa. On the 8th of February he expressed, at the end of a lengthy debate, his lack of confidence in the Government. On the 10th February he drafted a motion condemning the Government&#x2019;s neglect of housing. On the 11th of February he thought fit to move where he has moved. I do not propose at this stage to deal with the other matters which he has raised, but I shall just say that I think this situation has been aptly described, when it was reported as follows: &#x201C;It was a short walk. It has caused some talk, but it has solved no problems.&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p><span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0556"/>We are this afternoon taking part in a part appropriation debate, in which we have been regaled by a Minister of Economic Affairs, frittering away time, on snoek stories, or crayfish stories, when there are serious economic problems facing the majority of the people in this country.</p>

<p>I want to deal with some of these problems. The first one is the tax problem which exists in this country and which has been brought before successive Ministers of Finance of this Government; but I will say for the present Minister of Finance that he is the first one who said he would do something about investigating it. Year after year there have been requests to this Government to eliminate the bulge of taxation which is oppressive to certain income groups. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessors have been unresponsive to these requests which have been made, not only from this side of the House but from every commercial and industrial organization throughout South Africa, and although the hon. the Minister was good enough to say last year that there would be some investigation I want to say that the public must realize that for ten or more years they have been burdened by this bulge and this form of taxation because of the neglect of the Nationalist Government to get down to the problem.</p>

<p>But that is not the only problem which has been shelved by this Government. At the present moment this burden has been investigated and I think the country demands of this Minister of Finance that it be adjusted in the Budget of 1969. One finds, for instance, in South Africa at present that at a taxable income basis of R5,500 the taxation paid in South Africa exceeds that paid on a similar income in France, Germany, the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom. One finds that at an income of R6,500 per annum, the burden of taxation, apart from exceeding those in the countries I have mentioned, also exceeds the taxation in Australia and in the Netherlands. And when one reaches a taxable income of R16,000 per annum, there is only one country in the world which has a higher income tax than South Africa, and that is the United Kingdom. Percentagewise the marginal tax rates, including the loan levy on taxable income for those persons who are just on the R6 000 mark per annum, are about 42 per cent. At R10,000 it is 58 per cent and at R18,000 it is 74 per cent. If individuals are denied a substantial part of the fruits of their labour, the economy as a whole will suffer through obviously lower productivity, including the possible aggravation of the brain drain. Those words are no doubt familiar to the hon. the Minister. They are the words of the investigating committee of Assocom in their memorandum in which they have been asking for this adjustment. Over-taxation is and has been inherent under the Nationalist Government because of the State&#x2019;s practice throughout the years, as has been referred to by hon. members on this side, of under estimating revenue and over-estimating expenditure. On one occasion there was a discussion on the duties of a Minister of Finance and it was pointed out that the accepted duties of a Minister of Finance are to estimate the expenditure that is required to run the country and then so to estimate the income that he is to take from the taxpayer as to balance the Budget. The remark was made that that has not happened in South Africa for many years. The surpluses have far exceeded the estimates of the Ministers of Finance. The comment was then made that the Nationalist Ministers of Finance have been approaching their problems as shopkeepers trying to show the highest profit and not as Ministers of Finance trying to balance the budget. The resultant surpluses have been diverted throughout the years from the Revenue Account to Capital Account. It has been done, I realize, at a certain time in the history of this country under the Nationalist Government when it was impossible to obtain foreign capital and loans to finance capital works. There may have been a justification in those days to so over-tax, but there is no justification at the present time to continue to impose taxation at the present incidence. I do not think I have to quote to the hon. the Minister of Finance; he will be aware of what the estimates have been each year and what the results have been at the end of that financial year in the way of surpluses, but that is no cause for the Government complimenting itself that it has been so out in its estimates that those two figures do not correspond. I should imagine that the goal or objective of the Minister of Finance is to try to see whether at the end of the financial year he is able to be somewhere near to what he anticipated the position to be. As I say, there was the excuse before that foreign capital was not available for this procedure to be adopted. Perhaps that is not going to continue. A recent estimate of the position of the taxpayer in South Africa has indicated that .5 per cent of the total population contributes 62 per cent of the total tax collected. This should be linked with the fact that only 5 per cent of the population of South Africa pay direct taxation. This emphasizes. to my way of thinking, the inequalities in the distribution of wealth and earning power in South Africa, and until there is a change in that earning power and the productivity which goes with it for all sections of our population, the burden of taxation will continue to remain resting on the small percentage affected at present.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has mentioned the necessity for controlling the liquidity of this country by siphoning off funds which are excessive in his view to the immediate requirements of the country, and I believe in certain spheres they are excessive. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister has given thought to the effect of the exchange control regulations presently applicable which prevent the foreign heirs of an estate in South Africa, taking more than R20,000 as capital and the income earned from the Republic. I do not know the actual <span class="col_1071-1072" refersTo="page_0557"/>figures of the amount involved in blocked accounts of this nature, but I am sure it must be quite a considerable sum. If there is to be siphoning off, I am sure some relaxation in that respect might have quite an impact on the amount of funds presently blocked and remaining invested in South Africa. I shall be indebted to the hon. the Minister if he will indicate whether there is to be a new approach to this particular aspect of inheritances in this country being permitted to leave the country.</p>

<p>I want to turn to the majority group of our population at the present moment. Those are the people to whom the words buoyant economy, economic expansion, capital growth, take-overs and mergers mean absolutely nothing. They are the people the hon. member for Rosettenville referred to as the fixed income group. Whilst it is true&#x2014;and I accept it&#x2014;that the tempo in the rise of the cost of living has been moderated in recent times, the rise continues and the increases continue. It increases at a rate far in excess of the increase in the earnings of these fixed income groups. Sir, I do not know for the life of me why so far as civil servants are concerned this Government does not, as it could so easily do introduce an automatic adjustment of Civil Service salaries coupled with a rise in the cost of living. It is a simple issue. Instead of waiting until pressure comes from the railway artisans or the post office workers or the Public Servants&#x2019; Association, let one have a contented public service that knows that there will be an automatic increment to meet, percentagewise, to the extent that it can be met, the rise in the cost of living. We have asked for this over and over again. The hon. member for Rosettenville referred to the medical services. Sir, in 1964 the Minister of Health of this Nationalist Government was approached by all four provinces and by the State Health Department to adjust the salaries of the nursing profession in South Africa. What did he do? The Government made an interim adjustment; it appointed a commission and, as far as I know, the commission has not reported to this day. That is how these people are being dealt with in meeting the problem of rising costs and rising expenses. Sir, let me turn to another category. In 1967 there were in this land of prosperity 95,000 white people living on an old-age pension and 20,000 white people living on a war veteran&#x2019;s pension&#x2014;people who must exist and live out their lives as old-age pensioners on R32 per month and as war veterans on R40 per month. One does not have to ask for figures and percentages to realize what can be done with this amount of money. I want to ask hon. members: Where can a person in Cape Town, in Bloemfontein, Kimberley or East London have a roof over his head, provide his clothing and food and meet his other requirements on an amount of little more than R1 per day? Mr. Speaker, a char or a garden boy gets far more than that as wages, and they get their food as well while they are on the job. This is how the senior citizens of South Africa are being treated by the Nationalist Government. Sir, in my constituency&#x2014;and I am sure my constituency is not unique in this &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure that the same position applies in Jeppes. I hope that the Jeppes old-age pensioners will listen to this. In my constituency there are numbers of old-age pensioners whose sole means of surviving and finding a roof over their heads is to get a room in an old house which is about to be demolished, stay there for five, six or eight months until the demolition starts and then move off to find another room of that sort. This is happening to many of them. Their plight is one which I believe this Government should do something about. They should not be left to the charity of their fellow-beings. Their plight is the responsibility of this Government. The same applies to the Civil Service pensioner. It is true that there have been some increments and some additional allowances, but these people who have earned a pension through their sweat and toil throughout their working days are finding themselves forced to accept ever-decreasing standards of living during the last years of their lives. Sir, I might be asked what is to be done about these people. I believe we need a 1969 approach to this problem and not a 1929 approach. In other countries attempts have been made to assist these people who do not want charity and who are able to pay reasonable rentals. For instance, in Holland one has the system of blocks of flats being built by the Government Department, retained and let at a fair, economic rental which can be afforded by these people. An attempt is made there to provide the housing that is so necessary for these people. This is certainly not being done here at the moment. The Government thinks that by handing over a cheque to a welfare organization it is discharging its obligations to the old people of South Africa. Sir, that is passing the buck to the welfare organizations who are conscious of this problem and are attempting, and prepared, to do something about it. Sir, many of these pensioners and retired people face heavy expenditure as well during their declining days&#x2014;medical and nursing expenses. I want to give one instance of a man who was prominent in the business life of South Africa during his younger days, a man who is retired and married. He has a fixed income from his earnings and his savings during his working years. As I say, he held a prominent position in the commercial life of this country. He has a taxable income of R3 500 a year. He has been crippled for a number of years and he is obliged now, because of the age of his wife and his own disability, to employ a permanent nursing assistant in his home. He is not the only one; there are many of them. The doctors&#x2019; bills he pays, the chemists&#x2019; bills he pays; he is no charge on the State. There is a modicum of an allowance <span class="col_1073-1074" refersTo="page_0558"/>so far as tax is concerned, but this man who is paying R720 a year for essential nursing in his home, cannot deduct one cent of this from his taxable income. By staying at home he is saving the cost of being maintained in a provincial or State institution, but because he is doing this and is being independent there is no consideration shown to him.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to deal also with the position of the young people of this country. It is true that the hon. the Minister dealt with the problem in his second-reading speech when he referred to the cost of land and the cost of shares. Sir, the two of them have, I think, contributed to a very serious problem which faces young people in this country. It seems to me that the young man or the young woman of to-day is faced with two alternatives. The young man must either marry and live from day to day with ever-increasing difficulties to make financial ends meet; he has the ever-present fear that there might be some unexpected expenditure which cannot be met out of his income. Sir, this is in the main because of the rentals which have to be paid by these young people. I am talking about the young man who goes into a commercial undertaking, a bank or an insurance company. He does not want to live in an area where he has to travel miles and miles every morning to come to town and go back again. He is entitled to live in a reasonably respectable area in the city in which he dwells. Sir, he either has to do that and live through those difficult days or decide that he is not going to get married until he is well into his thirties when he will be earning an income which will be reasonable and enable him to provide a home. In the meantime he joins the permissive society until he can afford to get married. I believe that this has a serious effect on the young people of this country; it has a most serious effect on them. They either marry young at the normal age and are then faced with this depressing burden of meeting the cost of living or they postpone marriage and join the permissive society until such time as they can afford to marry. Sir, I believe that these are matters which the hon. the Minister can cause to be investigated. Has he, for instance, considered to what extent the housing position of these people might be alleviated if building societies were authorized to develop townships? I believe there is a possibility that this may be beneficial in bringing down housing costs. These young people have fortunately, because of innovations in the private sector, had some relief from the cost of living. The cash and carry principle that has been introduced widely in the cities has brought down the cost of foodstuffs to some extent for these people. The cost of some items has been reduced considerably. At the same time while this is being done in the private sector, we find the Government at the present moment bringing before this House legislation which will certainly affect the cost of other items, in so far that the private man now is to be denied access to wholesale purchases of his beer and his wine from wholesale merchants. Wholesale purchasing is a considerable saving. The hon. the Minister knows just what can be saved by a young couple who want a carton of cans of beer by getting it through a wholesaler instead of through a retailer. It is a considerable amount. While there is the cash and carry system in the private sector being introduced to assist this type of person, the Government says no, we must now introduce a system whereby we curtail the rights of these people to buy their liquor and their beer on a wholesale basis.</p>

<p>I believe that this matter which I have mentioned may be regarded as a small item by people sitting in high office in the Cabinet of this country. But it is one of the many items affecting the lives of the fixed income group in this country. I believe that this Government has for too long shown a complete lack of concern for these people, except when pressurised. The people in the fixed income groups are civil servants on whom we as a country depend for the efficient administration of the affairs of this country. They are people, young people, men and women, and older ones, who contribute to every aspect of our commercial and industrial life. Amongst them are those who are living in the twilight of their days and yet they are faced with these continual financial anxieties. I believe that these are matters which this Government has not given attention to. I believe these are matters which have been brought to its notice year after year, but there have been no practical steps except in the generality. It is for those reasons that I support without any hesitation the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I trust the hon. member for Green Point will forgive me if I do not follow his line of thought. I want to take this opportunity publicly to add my welcome to the hon. member for Umlazi. The hon. member for Umlazi and I have very much in common. We are both English-speaking South Africans of British descent. [Interjections.] We are both here on this side of the House in this party for exactly the same reasons. It was the other day that the hon. member for Umlazi joined us. It was 21 years ago that I as an English-speaking South African also accepted the honesty and sincerity of another National Party Prime Minister, Dr. Malan. I joined the party for the same reasons as the hon. member for Umlazi. i.e. to help a National Party Prime Minister to build up a united white South African nation, a nation with two languages and two cultures, with one undivided and unshakeable love and loyalty to South Africa, and with one South African nationality.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I also joined the National Party as the hon. member for Umlazi did to help the National Party in working out the intricate and difficult problem of race relations in South Africa, and to work for the survival, welfare, happiness and the safety of the white <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0559"/>South African nation, in order to save our children. I am convinced that if many more members opposite were to listen to their South African hearts, they would also have the courage of the hon. member for Umlazi. On the question of race relations, there is a vast difference of approach between us on this side and hon. members opposite. It seems to me from what we have seen lately, and from what we have read and heard, that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. members opposite, whose official name is the United Party, are not really so united. They belong to a party which was originally formed, under Afrikaans leadership incidentally, in 1910&#x2014;the predecessor of the United Party, the South African Party, was formed in 1910 and its aspiration from the beginning was to keep South Africa under a foreign monarchy. That is why they found it necessary to fight South African nationalism for 50 years; that is to say, the nationalism of their own people. Therefore, it seems to me that, having lost that battle against South African nationalism, they are entangled in their old imperial thinking. They think it is possible under their so-called federal blanket to smother the natural nationalism and political aspirations of the non-White people in South Africa. As opposed to that, the National Party takes a realistic view of our problems.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with their federal conception as it would apply to us in South Africa, if they were to come into power, and how it would affect the ordinary man. Firstly, I want to deal with the idea of white leadership as well as with the answer to the dilemma of how the black people. the Bantu, are to have political rights in one state with the Whites. It seems to me whether a state is unitary or federal, the dilemma is not solved. Even under a federal state the black people will have to have their political rights here in the same chamber. The United Party recommends that the 12 million black people of South Africa should be given eight white representatives in this House, while the black man in Malawi, Lesotho. Botswana and Zambia is ruling himself. The Leader of the Opposition hastens to assure us that if there is a natural pressure, as he anticipates, for greater black rights in this House, or for direct black representation, he will refer to the white people, to whom he will give a veto right. In practice it means that every white South African, every housewife and every typist, will be brought into a head-on clash with black South Africa. This would happen if they were to say no to a referendum on the increase of black rights in this House. Then they will be faced with the anger and rage of the primitive black people at every level; where we have to rub shoulders on the streets, where we have to work together in the mines and everywhere we would have that clash. It is quite obvious that black South Africa rejects the idea of federation, and they do not only reject the idea of a federation between White and Black, but also a federation of all the black race groups. We have had an example of a federal government which was handed down by Great Britain to Nigeria, and which has ended in chaos and tragedy. Last year I paid a visit to Malawi. I found a happy country, a country concerned with working out its own salvation; I found a country where black-white relations were completely relaxed and I was tremendously impressed by the leadership and statesmanship of Dr. Banda. I was also impressed by the integrity of his Ministers and their eagerness to work for their country&#x2014;a country which has a tremendous feeling of friendship for South Africa. Is this not the same Malawi which a few years ago was a member of the Central African Federation and which worked for the break-up of that federation? I say black South Africa and black Africa definitely reject the federal idea. The white veto is not a safeguard, it is really a guarantee that white South Africa will clash with black South Africa. Under our policy we have grasped the thorny branch, we have accented the fact that the black man must have his political rights in his own territory. Since the white people representing the Bantu were removed from this House it is an incontestable fact that relations between the Bantu and white South Africa have immeasurably improved. There have been no further Sharpe-villes, there have been no further clashes, the temperature has been reduced and black South Africa is busy working out its salvation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as a man of the Cape I particularly want to speak about the Coloured problem. What does the United Party suggest as far as the Coloureds are concerned? They want six representatives in this House. Well, we know of the tremendous increase in the number of Coloureds and by the year 2000 there will be three Coloured people for every white person in the Peninsula, and soon they will be in the majority in the Cape Province. As we know, in a democracy numbers count. How long will they be satisfied with six representatives here? It is my conviction that if Coloured members enter this House it will be the beginning of the end of white South Africa; it will certainly be the end of the white man in this province, the Cape. I say so because we cannot have Coloured members of Parliament and still maintain social segregation and residential segregation. I want to tell hon. members opposite that white South Africa completely rejects integration with the Coloureds and the Indians. It is said that this is a Northern view, but I was born in the Peninsula and have lived here all my life, and not only do I know what the feelings of my electorate in Maitland are but I know what the feelings are of the white people in the Peninsula. I say they flatly and finally reject integration with the Coloureds.</p>

<p>If we want to know what would happen with Coloured representatives here we only have to look at the Cape <span class="col_1077-1078" refersTo="page_0560"/>Town Municipality where there are Coloured councillors and where Coloureds have the municipal vote. Even though the Municipality knows that the white people want it, they are too afraid to put up beach apartheid notice boards. They are paralysed into inactivity by the presence of the Coloured councillors and by the Coloured voters. They lack the courage to reserve a children&#x2019;s play park for white children in a white area, even though they know the Whites want that done. If we had Coloured M.P.&#x2019;s here the implementation of the wishes of the white people would be paralysed completely.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what is our answer to the Coloured problem? We believe the Coloured people must develop separately. The United Party in their time neglected them and merely used them for their votes. The Coloured man needs a chance to develop, he wants to find his self-respect and to find his political soul. In 1960 Dr. Verwoerd said there was one nation, the white nation, that the Coloured man would develop separately, but he could not see the end of the road. The Coloured man is going to become a nation, and when the hon. the Prime Minister said the other day that the Coloureds will become a nation one day, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) laughed. Well, I wonder why he laughed. Is it because he does not understand concepts like nationality, or is it because he does not take a proper pride in his own white South African nationality? The Prime Minister said we are going to lead the Coloured man in a direction away from the white man, in the direction of self-realization so that he can have the opportunity to improve himself. This generation has solved the problem of black nationalism. It is true that the next generation, that is to say our children, will have to solve the problem, the dilemma of the brown South African nation side by side with the white nation. What we have done is this. We have guaranteed the safety of our children by virtue of the fact that we will hand down to them a white Parliament, a Parliament that will not be paralysed by a Coloured electorate or by the presence of Coloured M.P.&#x2019;s. When our descendants have to solve the Coloured problem, they will be able to do so because their hands will be free and they will have retained the control of their own destiny as white people here, whatever adjustments they may have to make concerning their future.</p>

<p>Let me conclude by saying this. We saw the hon. member for Umlazi crossing the floor to this side of the House. Let me assure hon. members opposite that all they saw was the peak of the iceberg; what is underneath is very interesting. [Interjections.] It does not matter where they are, but I know the hon. member for Umlazi, an English-speaking member, is only the peak of the iceberg, because in my own constituency and throughout the country there is a movement across party lines towards the National Party, a movement by English-speaking people who traditionally supported that side, because they accept the sincerity and the honesty of the Prime Minister, they trust the Prime Minister, they know they are safe with the Prime Minister. They know that in the National Party and its policy of separate development they have the one and only guarantee for the safety of our children.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member for Maitland and from his speech I tried to understand something about Nationalist Party politics. I had great difficulty because he roamed from 1910 onwards, he talked about the safety of the Whites and of the impressions he gained when he visited Malawi, and he also referred to federal states. His party does not believe in federation, it believes in separate nations. We will eventually have the position in this country where we have a number of separate nations. At one time we thought they would total eight, but it may even be more. All these little separate nations will have separate prime ministers and separate parliaments. They will be absolutely separate from the white nation, but they will all be working together in the white country to keep it going. When all these little black nation Prime Ministers meet, and a white Prime Minister is present, I wonder who will be the chairman of that conference. Will the black Prime Ministers elect a white Prime Minister to preside over them, or will there be a black Prime Minister? I could not judge by the speech of the hon. member for Maitland, but if one listens to the speeches made by other hon. members on that side and one reads between the lines of the pamphlets issued, one realizes, as my Leader said in the No-Confidence debate, the absolute failure of the separate development policy. It is falling to bits all around them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland was telling us about the solution to the problem of the Coloureds. Why did he not tell the Prime Minister that? He has no solution to the problem. But the hon. member has one. I thought the hon. member in his caucus would tell the Prime Minister, &#x201C;I live amongst the Coloureds; I have the solution&#x201D;, but his Prime Minister says that we do not have the solution, we must leave it to our children.</p>

<p>As the hon. member continued his speech, he must have thought. &#x201C;I do not know whether this solution of mine is so good as far as the Coloureds are concerned, but at least we will leave a white Parliament; our descendants can solve the problem.&#x201D; The Nationalist Party thinks that they are building a road &#x2026;</p>

<p>Last night, yes. But after he had slept over it and probably had been got at, he rose and started talking politics that one would expect from the back benches. A speech of that type does neither him nor us any good.</p>

<p>There are more serious matters. I noticed that, through all the speeches made by hon. members on that side, the Minister of Finance never even picked up his pen, because they never spoke about the Budget. They never spoke about the country or her welfare, but purely about the ideologies of their party, either to impress somebody or to get a front bench or a seat in the Cabinet. I do not know which.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House were pleased to learn that the hon. the Minister of Finance had been overseas to go into the question of currency requirements. We are told that he went to raise loans; not so much because of the fact that he required money in this country, but to establish our claims. I cannot think of any time that South Africa was refused any loan, especially when the United Party was in power. We were able to lend Britain something like R160 million worth of gold. The mere fact that the hon. the Minister went over there to raise these loans or to establish the claims for those loans, shows one thing, namely that as far as this country is concerned, we have not been able to generate foreign exchange by any other means than gold. Our exports are not what they should be. One wonders what has happened to our export market. We export gold and raw materials. But that is still not sufficient. We do not export enough to establish the foreign currency that we require. It is a matter that this Government should look into. They should do something about it. As a result of the policy of this Government&#x2014;not this country, this Government&#x2014;there is no African market. The big market next to our very door is closed to us. Not because we cannot produce the goods, but as a result of this Government&#x2019;s policy, we have lost this African market.</p>

<p>We live in a world of currency fluctuations, and I think we are fortunate that we do have gold, that we are the largest producers of gold in the world. As I have said before, behind all the speculation on the market and on the currency markets of the world are the living hopes of some sort of revaluation of gold from the 35 dollar limit. It has been sold at a higher price, but the fixed price still remains. Our Minister of Finance has tried to have that altered, but he has not been successful. He still lives in hopes. Under the circumstances we therefore have to live with the fact that that is the price, and we have to keep our house in order. As I have said, we have to encourage our secondary industries and our exports. We have to build up our country financially, accepting the fact that the price of gold is going to remain at 35 dollars. That is the position. We have to have the necessary capital overseas to meet our commitments. Hon. members must not forget that we face great dangers. We have heard members talking about these dangers. We are building up our army, which requires a considerable amount of equipment. Our Airways must be developed. We require general development in this growing country of ours, and this costs money. We have to find the necessary cash to pay for it. We have to try and establish a reserve so that we may be able to pay for the goods we require. On the goldmining side, we have what are called dying mines. I think the hon. the Minister and the Government should look at these mines and try, if possible, to keep them going. The possibilities of an increase in the price of gold may keep a lot of these mines that are on the verge of closing down from doing so.</p>

<p>We have heard about inflation. Despite the fact that this side of the House told the Government years ago, before it even recognized the fact that we had inflation in this country, this inflation bogey is still with us. There has not been the increase per unit in productivity as we had hoped. One cannot help on reading articles by well-known industrialists in any industrial journal to take note of what they say. They tell you that unless this country of ours makes the full economical use of the manpower available we will never overcome our manpower problem. We are not going to cure our position by immigration <span class="col_1081-1082" refersTo="page_0562"/>and we have got to examine the whole situation. I personally and my party reject the whole position of the separate nations. We look at South Africa as one prosperous whole in the economic sense. We feel that if this country used its population to the greatest degree and more efficiently we would go very much further than we are at the present moment. The Government tells us that there is no such thing as economic integration, but we, of course, know that it is there. The white population of this country, as pointed out by the hon. member for Green Point, carry a very heavy burden as far as taxation is concerned. We have to help our Coloureds and our Bantu to become more viable so that they can take their place in the growth of this country. As was said by other hon. members on this side, one notices that hon. members opposite never mentioned the man in the street and the persons who put them in this House. The hon. member for Maitland tells us that he was elected in Maitland, but he never tells us about his voters. He always tells us how pleased he is to be a member of the other side, but he never mentions the welfare of his voters in this House nor does he worry about the welfare of his voters. We on this side of the House are concerned and have been concerned with this aspect over the years. In our amendment we mention the man who is living on a fixed salary. First I want to speak about the civil servants. The civil servant has, over the years, through his associations, had to come to the Government and ask for increases in salary, but invariably when he does get the increase it is completely out of date. This is because it takes the Government two years to wake up to the fact that something should be done and when it is done it is usually completely out of date. When one talks to the civil servants, and especially those in Pretoria, where there are probably more civil servants per square mile than anywhere else in the country, one finds that a very deep dissension exists amongst these people. They have to struggle on on this fixed salary, live up to a certain standard, educate their children&#x2014;education up to matric is free, I know&#x2014;with the different costs it entails, and so on. Nothing upsets them more than when they see this Government, who has been in power far too long, driving around in these magnificent cars and living in the big houses they have purchased at enormous cost. When one talks to them they say that they are Nationalists and that they vote for the Nationalist Government, but that they have been in power for too long and that it is time for a change and time that they went. This is the growing feeling in this country. The Government, with the vast majority they have in this House, have lost touch with the voters. They have been here too long and think they can get away with anything.</p>

<p>I now want to say a few words about pensioners. In my constituency&#x2014;and the hon. member for Maitland has a few too&#x2014;there are pensioners who can eat meat only once or twice a week and have to live on bread and &#x201C;mieliepap&#x201D; in a back room. They just cannot afford anything better.</p>

<p>Over the years we have asked this Government to adopt a stable social security policy. I do not think that the public outside realize that this Government does not have a social security policy. The only thing they have got is the remnants they took over from the United Party. They have done nothing. Mention was made of medical care and hospitalization. The poor man to-day cannot afford to get sick because he cannot afford the time off from work or to pay for his hospitalization. As a result of this Government&#x2019;s policy of not affording some medical benefits to these people they build up debts and are in a very bad way. Then you get the thousands of white collar workers&#x2014;there are thousands of them and the Minister of Labour will know this&#x2014;who are not covered by any pension scheme. When they reach the age of 55, 60 or 65 they retire. And what do they get? They get this miserable old-age pension. This Government seems to think that this old-age pension is a charity and not a right. Of course these people are entitled to it, as they have paid taxes and have been good citizens of this country. The most terrible thing over the years has been that this Government has done absolutely nothing to protect these people. When we have put forward motions in this House for a contributory pension scheme, it has always been rejected. It was said by the Government that they do not want a social welfare state. They are, however, prepared to see these people live just anyhow. We are getting to be a nation of the very poor and the very rich. There are a lot of them sitting over there. The day will come when we will lose the middle class and will only have the poor and the rich. This Government will be to blame. Take the case of the man who is not well enough off to send his son to university. What has this Government done to make that education available to that boy? In what way have they made money available to the family so that they can live? They have done nothing, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>With a sound social security policy the people of the country can enjoy the prosperity of this country. The people are not enjoying the prosperity now, however. Year after year the people are over-taxed by the hon. the Minister of Finance and year after year he comes with a surplus. One year Dr. D&#x04E7;nges <span class="col_1083-1084" refersTo="page_0563"/>said that he was going to give them back R20 million, but that he did not trust them, because they would spend it and push up inflation. He then put the money in a fund and the following year took it away from them again. There are lots of aged people paying savings levies who will be dead and will never be able to enjoy that money. I think it is time to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that the least he can do is to give them back some of the money that has been taken away from them, and not to tax them out of existence. The people require something from this Government and it is time the Government did something about it. At the present moment people are fed up, they would like to see this Government go, and this Government will go sooner than they think.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>In his speech the hon. member for Salt River stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that it was now time for a change in South Africa as far as the Government is concerned, but I want to tell him that every time there is a change it is the National Party which increases in size and not the United Party. In spite of the fact that the Opposition has quite obviously been &#x201C;zipped&#x201D; this afternoon by their Whips as far as discussing the Lewis case is concerned. I want to return to that topic. I do not want the Opposition to wash their dirty washing here in Parliament. Nor do I want the hon. member for Yeoville for example to tell us whether the members of the Opposition have all paid their debts to the United Party. All I want to ask them is that they furnish the country with a reply to these two very important charges which the hon. member for Umlazi made against the United Party when he handed in his resignation, two charges relating to matters which have formed the keystone of the political struggle in South Africa all these years, i.e. how to obtain national unity here and how to solve our burning colour question. And they can try as much as they want to ignore the Lewis case, but the country and the voters outside will not ignore it, and they (the United Party) will be called to account for it. It s for that reason that I want to return to this case.</p>

<p>In addition I also want to say that to my mind it is very characteristic of the party on the opposite side, which always has such a great deal to say about national unity, that when English-speaking persons join the National Party and find themselves here in this House, they ignore them when they speak, or otherwise denigrate them. We found that this was the case with the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation, and we also experienced it in regard to Senator Trollip, and we found the same thing here this afternoon when the hon. member for Maitland spoke. I can tell you that that era is past; the English-speaking South Africans have found them out, and they will no longer get away with it.</p>

<p>This action of the hon. member for Umlazi in crossing the floor of this House will, as I have said, have repercussions throughout the length and breadth of the country, and it will not avail the United Party to ignore it. This afternoon I briefly want to go into those two charges which he made, and which he dealt with at some considerable length. They are that South Africa&#x2019;s hope for greater national development and national unity stands a much better chance of succeeding under the National Party, under the dynamic leadership of our present Prime Minister, than under the United Party. That the Opposition cannot ignore or form a conspiracy of silence about. I am sorry the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not present. I know he is not a man who is afraid, and I wanted to ask him this afternoon not to come and wash their dirty washing here, but that he must rise to speak. Covert references are being made to backbenchers, but he need not take any notice of me. But here one of our front-benchers, who crossed over to us, rose and levelled these castigating charges against the United Party and, by implication, against its leadership, but he remained seated there, having been &#x201C;zipped&#x201D;, and has no reply. This is what the country wants to know. Why does the United Party not furnish the country with a reply to those charges? These two matters run like an unmistakable thread through our political struggle over all these years. Why does the United Party, in spite of all the disasters which have overtaken them during the past 20 years and even before that, still survive? Why are they still staggering around in the political ring like a punch-drunk boxer? Why have they not thrown in the towel yet? After everything which has happened to the United Party over the past 20 years they should have disintegrated a long time ago, but I shall tell you. Sir, why it has not happened. It is because they have during this time been engaged in pulling the biggest political swindle, a political confidence trick, which South Africa has ever witnessed on their Afrikaans-sneaking and English-speaking followers. They deceived their followers by telling them that it was only the principles of the United Party which would ensure national unity in this country. Because they got away with this poltical sleight-of-hand for a time, they succeeded in deceiving their Afrikaans-speaking followers. Because those Afrikaans-sneaking followers had previously shown great political loyalty towards people such as Generals Botha and Smuts, they succeeded, for sentimental reasons, in keeping them with them. Because they blew hot and cold when they discussed the colour question of the country, one story in the platteland and another story in the cities, they also succeeded in keening their Afrikaans-speaking members with them; and because they have always regarded it as a kind of consolation prize that a person with an Afrikaans surname should be their leader, while Afrikaans did not in fact come into its own within their ranks, they succeeded in keeping their followers with them but outside the intimate inner sanctum of the party. Even now there is talk to the effect that they want to change their leadership, that they want to get rid of their <span class="col_1085-1086" refersTo="page_0564"/>present leader and that they are once again looking for a man with an Afrikaans surname, and I hear that they are mentioning the name of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I remember the days when I sat in the Press gallery during the war years and after, when there were no fewer than three or four English-speaking Ministers sitting on that side of the House, when they were in power, who could not understand a single word of Afrikaans when a National Party member was making a speech in Afrikaans in this House. Each one of them had to get an interpreter to interpret those speeches for them. But the Afrikaners in that party gradually found out about this kind of political swindle. That is why men like Mr. Wolmarans, Senator Brink, Mr. Pieterse, Mr. Blaar Coetzee, Abraham Jonker and Bailey Bekker, quite eminent leaders of the United Party during that time, had bade them farewell a long time ago.</p>

<p>But I now want to come to the English-speaking people, and how the Opposition has, in that case as well, until recently succeeded in deceiving them for a long time in a shameful way and has inculcated racial hatred by the English-speaking people of the Afrikaners, so that the English-speaking people were not prepared to come over to the National Party and grasp the hand of the Afrikaner Nationalist and co-operate with him. Sir, I am speaking from experience. I once had occasion to write a column in an English-language newspaper aimed at conveying information about the Afrikaner and his point of view to the English-speaking people. But as soon as I had done good work, that newspaper published reports in its other columns and destroyed all that good work. It was a hopeless task, for the simple reason that we did not get any support from the United Party, nor from certain sections of the English-language Press, in order to convey a true image of the Afrikaner to the English-speaking people. There have always been cries of &#x201C;wolf, wolf!&#x201D; in this country when the National Party and the Afrikaners in the National Party had to do important constitutional construction work. I would just like to remind you of what happened when we introduced our own national anthem and one flag in this country. What antipathy and race hatred were not subtly stirred up against those matters at that time! How did the United Party not try to frighten the English-speaking people in this country when our own South African Citizenship Act was introduced here! Day in and day out it was insinuated that the language and cultural rights of the English-speaking people would not be safe with the National Party. It was of course very easy for that party to make propaganda out of the important constitutional construction work which the National Party had to do and to present our actions as being one-sided and wrong to the English-speaking people; for you know that at that time things had to be done in order to replace the foreign symbolism of the country with a distinctive native South African symbolism. Because it so happened that owing to our historical background many of these symbols had a British-English association, it was the easiest thing for the propagandists on that side of the House to brand these things as anti-English deeds among the unthinking English-speaking South Africans. These were above all our English-speaking friends who could at that time not yet read the English-language national newspapers; thank goodness there are already increasing numbers of them who are to-day able to do so, and I attribute it to that that a man like the hon. member for Umlazi could see his way clear to coming over to the National Party, i.e. because he read the Afrikaans newspapers and could ascertain the true facts about the National Party there. I want to state that this &#x201C;wolf, wolf!&#x201D; cry of the Opposition has now caught up with them. I want to remind them of the old Churchillian saying that &#x201C;you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time&#x201D;. The English-speaking people no longer have to listen to this monotonous yapping of the United Party in regard to the National Party and its Afrikaans leaders. That is the reason why we are to-day experiencing an increasing influx of English-speaking people into our party. That is why first the Trollips and the Warings and the Blyth Thompsons and the Odells and the Lewisses and even the Durrants came over, and now in Natal as well an eminent man like Mr. Jackie McGlew. And as a representative of an overwhelmingly English-speaking constituency I can tell you, Sir, that that influx is increasing by the day. First of all the United Party lost almost all their Afrikaans leaders of note, as I indicated, and now they are losing their English-speaking leaders one by one. As Dr. Verwoerd predicted to us when we became a Republic, this fact that we have become a Republic is having an effect on South Africa. It is because the Opposition are not aware of the fact that great changes are taking place in this country as a result of our having become a Republic that they cannot understand why a man like the hon. member for Umlazi could go over to the National Party.</p>

<p>I worked out a little addition sum this morning, and do you know, Sir, how many United Party Parliamentarians have left the United Party since 1948? It is no less than 25. What an unhappy reflection on that party and its leadership, which parades under the fine name of the so-called United Party! It is these facts which I have mentioned briefly here this afternoon which the Opposition must reply to in respect of the Lewis case. It is of no avail their sitting there sulking, or trying to pretend, by maintaining a fa&#x04AB;ade, that they are not listening or that they are unaware of these questions which are being addressed to them. The nation is listening, and it will not pay them to sit there like sphinxes. The fact that the hon. member for Umlazi has crossed the floor has very great significance in this country in this sense that he touched upon the two fundamental matters when he did so, i.e. the promotion of national unity and the solution to our <span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0565"/>colour problem. The attitude of that party puts me very much in mind of President Reitz&#x2019; tortoise &#x201C;in his shell, if you touch him, he pulls his head in&#x201D;. Why do all these Afrikaans- and English-speaking South African who have crossed over to the National Party during the past 21 years all prefer the road which the National Party is following in respect of national unity, and reject that of the United Party? It is for the simple reason that the National Party does not, as the United Party does, simply lump Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans together into one party and then hope for the best. The National Party puts into effect, to summarize it briefly, the inspired words of Dr. Malan: &#x201C;Bring together what belongs together by inner conviction&#x201D;. That is the secret of the success of the National Party, in contrast to the United Party, which tries to accommodate people of so many divergent standpoints in their party that growing national unity is out of the question. Mr. Speaker, there is no unifying inspiration in that party. It is at most a party which consists of divergent elements, which for political purposes are trying to get rid of the National Party. That is all one can say about them. That is why liberalists and conservatives and opportunists are stable-mates in their party. In the National Party however, according to its principles, Afrikaner and English-speaking South Africans work together because they know that their national identity, their language and their cultural identity will at all times be safe within the National Party, and that is why the hon. member for Umlazi was able here this afternoon to present this great testimonial for the National Party, i.e. that he feels extremely happy amongst us. Mr. Speaker, I can go even further to discuss the other matter, i.e. the solution to the colour problem, as well, but I just want to say the following: It is very clear to me that the country is also, as far as this is concerned, rejecting the United Party, in spite of the fact that they are now trying to be more conservative than the National Party. That is why the United Party finds itself in the quandary it is in. The public knows that under the United Party a solution will never be found to our colour problem, a solution which will be equally just and equally satisfactory to all sections of our heterogeneous population. Mr. Speaker, I want to support what I am saying here this afternoon with the words of someone else. In America I also watched television, and I did not only watch Wild West and Cowboy films there, I also had the privilege of seeing the hon. member for Yeoville on television there. I am sorry the hon. member has left the House. He did outstanding work for us in America.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>But unfortunately the hon. member for Yeoville did not do such outstanding work for his own Party there, and I shall now indicate to you the reason for this. He appeared on a television programme called &#x201C;Firing Line&#x201D; on 22nd December, 1968, in New York, or rather it was a broadcast in New York which I saw, where he appeared with William F. Buckley, the editor of the <i>National Review</i> and also with that great left-wing liberalist, George Houser, the chairman of the American Committee on Africa. The hon. member for Yeoville was asked what the difference between the United Party and the Progressive Party was. Unfortunately I could not get hold of a verbatim transcript of that broadcast, but I made notes, and I have the notes here with me. The hon. member for Yeoville is entitled to try to deny the veracity of my notes if he wants to. I have notes here which I made on the notepaper of a New York hotel. I want to quote what the hon. member said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is not such a great difference between the United Party and the Progressive Party. Where the real difference comes in, is with the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party believes in &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, but like the United Party, the Progressive Party believes that &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; in South Africa, introduced immediately, would be disastrous.</block>

<p>In other words, must one deduce from this that a gradual movement to &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; in South Africa would not be so disastrous? But I want to proceed with this revealing train of thought of the hon. member for Yeoville, and I am again quoting what he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The difference between the Progressive Party and the United Party is not so great as people think. The Progressive Party consists wholly of former United Party members. I (the hon. member for Yeoville) for example, worked very hard to get Mrs. Suzman into Parliament, and I think I did South Africa a good turn.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the hon. member for Houghton is not here this afternoon so that she can hear about the new admirer she has acquired. Mr. Speaker, from the mouth of the crown pretender of the United Party we hear this evidence this afternoon as to why people like the hon. member for Umlazi no longer feel at home in the United Party with its integration policy. Sir, this is the type of question the country is asking, and hon. members on that side can ignore these questions as much as they like, but we as National Party and as Government will see to it that these things are held up to the scrutiny of the country, and I am certain that the electorate will give their reply. I want to make the prediction that they will not only give their reply in subsequent elections, but that they will already begin doing so next Wednesday in the by-election at Newcastle.</p>

<p>The hon. member made some reference to English-speaking people in his party. I would like to quote to him the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to reaffirm what I said in Bloemfontein last week. Those who say that all South Africans will unite to form one nation in the future are wishful thinkers &#x2026;</block>

<p>He also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Afrikaners would never retain their traditional heritage and religious beliefs once they united with the other language group.</block>

<p>Sir, this was said by Professor Thom, and then you have the sort of language that we have just had from the hon. member for Turffontein.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein also raised the position of the hon. member for Umlazi. If he thinks that I am going to run away from that I want to disillusion him very quickly indeed. I understand that while I was out of the House the hon. member for Umlazi made the statement that I as a constituent of his had not called upon him to resign his seat. Sir, I want to make the position quite clear. I never thought that it was necessary to call upon the hon. member for Umlazi to resign his seat. After all, he signed a declaration that he would do so. But if the hon. member for Umlazi wants me as a constituent formally to ask him to resign his seat, then I do so now.</p>

<p>Sir, we have had members on that side using language which just does not mean a thing. They remind me of two Arabs who were talking. The one said to the other: &#x201C;I can speak English very well. When I say to a man &#x2018;come here&#x2019;, he comes.&#x201D; His friend then said to him: &#x201C;But what happens when you want him to go there?&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;That is easy, I go there and I say &#x2018;come here&#x2019;.&#x201D; This is the language of hon. members on the other side.</p>

<p>Yesterday we also had the hon. member for Sunnyside saying that we cannot afford to waste a single day. Sir, how true! We certainly cannot afford to waste a single day. We have waited 21 years already. Sir, let us all agree that we must take an objective look at South Africa. Every argument advanced by hon. members on the other side is utterly unreal, it does not apply to South Africa. They are talking of a land which just does not exist. Even my old friend here, the hon. member for Pietersburg, said that in South Africa there was no such thing as economic integration. I have a great deal of regard for the hon. member for Pietersburg. I know he is sincere, but I want to say to him that I hope he is a little more sincere than the Pietersburg Town Council who decided to make their town white by night. They made their town white by night, but half the members on the Government side have brought down Bantu servants to the Cape. All you have to do is to go to Acacia Park to see them.</p>

<p>Sir, this is a Government that rules by legislation without consultation; it is a Government that rules by intimidation. Sir, they talk of homelands. Let us examine the position for a moment just to see how unreal the concept of homelands is. The Bantu are to be separated into eight separate ethnic groups. The Coloureds, when the Government finds a homeland for them, are going to be separated as well, but there is more than one ethnic group among the Coloureds, so one assumes that there may be three Coloured homelands; one may also assume from that that there must be at least two Indian homelands as well, because there are two separate Indian groups. Sir, let us take this to its logical conclusion. I submit that a Zulu and a Xhosa have more in common than an Afrikaner and an English-speaking South African. To put it another way, they have as much in common or as little in common, and if it is logical to say that there must be a separate Bantustan for the Zulus and separate ones for the other seven ethnic groups, then I believe it is just as logical to say that there should be a separate homeland for the English-speaking South African and one for the Afrikaner. [Laughter.] Sir, hon. members opposite laugh, but they do not laugh at the proposition that we should have eight separate independent black states and a Colouredstan and an Indianstan; that is no laughing matter, but it is just as illogical as having a separate homeland for the English-speaking South Africans and a separate one for the Afrikaners.</p>

<p>Let us take this even further. Let us say that we are going to have a separate one for the English-speaking South Africans and a separate one for the Afrikaners. Are we then going to have separate homelands on religious principles as well? That is the logic of the Nationalist Party. They are prepared so to split South Africa that it makes no sense whatsoever, yet these ethnic groups have as much in common with each other as we have with our Afrikaans-speaking fellow South Africans.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Pietersburg talked about economic separation in South Africa. I have extracted some figures which I am not going to quote at length, but I would like to remind him that in the last year 47,000 more Whites became economically active. In the last four years the total was 110,000. While we look at this figure it may be as well to remember that the number of apprentices in the building trade in 1960 was 725 and in 1968 534, nearly 200 fewer despite the increase in the population. Somebody is doing that work but obviously the hon. member for Pietersburg does not seem to know by whom it is being done. While the white economically active group increased by 47,000 last year, the number of non-Whites who are economically active increased by 190,000. In the last four years they have increased by no fewer than 439,000. Of course, it is very interesting to know too that the State employed no fewer than 100,000 more non-Whites, and yet the hon. member for Pietersburg says that there is no such thing as economic integration in South Africa. I think that we are quite entitled on this side of the House to ask hon. members opposite to cease thinking as members of the Nationalist Party and to start thinking for a change as South Africans, and to start thinking about what is good for South Africa. They must start thinking of what is good for South Africa because in the last 20 years they have moved no less than 1,082,000 people all over South Africa.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Maitland were to speak only about the things he understands, he would not open his mouth for the next 50 years. Before I turn to certain other matters I should like to say to those hon. members who have used the word Limehill every now and then as though it is some kind of joke that I think it is a joke in very poor taste indeed. If hon. members opposite are proud of what happened at Limehill there is not much point in trying to drum any sense into their heads.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with a few other matters. The first is the railway disaster in Johannesburg. No one attaches any blame for this railway disaster to anybody. I want, however, to ask whether it is necessary for the dependants of those who died and those who are injured to be sustained by charitable donations from the public. I know that in due course these people will receive compensation from the State but the wheels of the State turn very slowly. As we have had these disasters before I wonder whether the time has not arrived for the State to be in the position to grant immediate alleviation of some of these hurts that people have suffered in disasters such as these. I do not believe that it is the function of private people to donate money to a charity of this kind though I am very pleased that they do. I think that this is a function that the State may well take over.</p>

<p>While we are considering that railway disaster I should like to raise another point. A report appeared in one of our newspapers to the effect that the Johannesburg City Council would not endorse out of Johannesburg the widows of those people killed in the accident. I think that this is a wonderful gesture. Perhaps South Africans should pat themselves on the back for it. But I should like to know why we here in South Africa should have to make such a statement at all. I think that the fact that this idea should have to occur to anybody is a disgrace to all of us. The hon. member for Karoo mentioned yesterday that Native pensioners receive R51 a year which he pointed out came to, I think, 14 cents a day. Most of us spend a good deal more than 14 cents a day on our dogs and cats. I should like to join with the hon. member for Karoo in his plea to the hon. the Minister. This is a matter which should receive very serious consideration, particularly in view of the fact that over 70 per cent of our non-Whites live below the poverty datum line.</p>

<p>I should also like to draw the question of municipal rates payable on property owned by the Government to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Since its inception the Department of Community Development has grown continually.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#carr">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. CARR</person>:</from>

<p>Unlike the United Party.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one can ignore such inane remarks from such an inane member. The property owned by the Department of Community Development in the three major cities of South Africa is now <span class="col_1093-1094" refersTo="page_0568"/>worth almost R14 million. In Johannesburg the Department pays rates amounting to R232,000. In Cape Town it pays R80,000 in rates and in Durban R144,000. I shall take the example of Durban only. The property owned in Durban by the Department amounts to no less than R3,900,000. Is it therefore any wonder that the people of Durban are at their wit&#x2019;s end in trying to meet the high rates that are now imposed upon them? They are forced to pay municipal rates because the Department is able to escape paying rates on property valued at almost R4 million. I believe that the time has come for serious consideration to be given to this matter. What of course happens is that the rates of the property owners themselves are increased. In many areas in Durban property rates have increased by five times over the last 10 years. It is held that this is to a large extent due to the fact that the Government owns such vast blocks of property on which it has to pay no rates at all.</p>

<p>I should also like to raise the question of our civil servants. I raised this matter last year and I will raise it next year and continue to raise it until it sinks into hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>372,000 White State employees, that is one in four of our economically active White population, are affected by the rise in the cost of living, but have fixed incomes. Occasionally the Government pays out increases to them particularly if an election is drawing near. The Government has continued to use our State employees as mere tools at election time. I believe that the time has come that they should get their full reward for the amount of work they do. The Minister of Transport has told us that some of them work an average of 12 to 16 hours overtime per week. I believe that this aspect of the matter must be examined very carefully because if you were to look at the number of working wives in South Africa, I think that you would find that every one out of two is the wife of a civil servant or a State employee. I think that when the Government can ignore a section of our population to this extent and use them only at election times to its own advantage, the time must come when the civil servants of South Africa will wake up to the fact that they have been exploited by this Government for so long that it is about time that they did something about it. How many civil servants allow their children to follow in their footsteps and join the Civil Service? Those days have gone and they will never return.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to make a plea for those people who are over the age of 40. They have difficulty in finding employment. We have this problem all over the country. They are not easy to place in jobs. I do think that the Government which is the biggest employer in the State could consider this matter from a new angle. I believe that positions could be created for these people without jeopardizing the positions of those who have had long service.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to remind hon. members that we have been told that the late Dr. Verwoerd was wrong by 40 per cent in his calculations of the population figures for South Africa. He was wrong by 40 per cent in his estimate of the population figures for South Africa. I should like to suggest that the Nationalist Party is wrong by 100 per cent with its apartheid policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Port Natal reminded me of a tractor with a very small and light harrow attached, swinging to and fro over the farmlands but unable to get the harrow to dig in. The hon. member for Umlazi, followed up by the hon. member for Turffontein, put very pertinent questions to the members of the United Party. The hon. member for Port Natal wanted to deflect the lightning stoke with references to public servants and the cost of living in general and wanted to get away from these fundamental questions. Let us now pause for a moment and see what things are like in the ranks of that party, apart from the Umlazi instance. I should like to quote from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 22.7.1968. The caption states: &#x201C;United Party Needs Transplant.&#x201D; Let us hear what the hon. member for Walmer in Port Elizabeth had to say. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party, said Mr. Kingwill, had survived in opposition for 20 years &#x2026;</block>

<p>instead of 21 years in which the National Party has been in power&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was like an architect drawing plans for 20 years only to see them not carried out &#x201C;but we cannot survive another 20 years in opposition&#x201D;&#x2026;. The Party, said Mr. King-will, had to be efficient. There was no room for &#x201C;dead wood&#x201D; in the United Party. Politics, he said, was a young man&#x2019;s job&#x2026;. The Party also needed a new image and a slogan. It had to get away from the image of being &#x201C;an English Party&#x201D;&#x2026;. He likened <span class="col_1095-1096" refersTo="page_0569"/>the 39 United Party members of Parliament to 39 launching pads from where to launch &#x201C;our missiles&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Well, his first has already been &#x201C;launched&#x201D; here. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;But sometimes, our rockets are out of fashion and we have to correct this,&#x201D; Mr. Kingwill said.</block>

<p>Times must indeed be difficult for a Party if one of its back-benchers makes such statements about party leadership, because not only is it a reflection on the leadership of that Party, it is also a reflection upon its older members. The hon. member spoke about &#x201C;no room for dead wood&#x201D; and I do not think that the hon. member thereby meant any reflection upon the hon. member for Berea. Up to now I have not read in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> that the hon. member denies the use of those words or that he has been repudiated by the chief leaders of his party. In this &#x201C;heart transplant&#x201D; speech of the hon. member for Walmer there lies for me the implication of a clear admission of that party&#x2019;s inefficiency as an Opposition. Well, we on this side agree wholeheartedly, and we need not make any further comment. He said that there was no place for dead wood in that party. I repeat: we do not believe that it is a reflection on the hon. member for Berea, but indeed a reflection upon all his colleagues, which does not surprise me either. The hon. member spoke of &#x201C;a young man&#x2019;s job&#x201D;. What does Uncle Flippie say&#x2014;the hon. member for Kensington&#x2014;about that, or what is the opinion of the hon. member for East London (City)? I want to ask the hon. member to take a good look at the backbenchers of this side if he wants to see young men at work. Let the hon. member for Walmer take a good look at the Cabinet benches, at the Deputy Ministers, and then also there next to him at the National Party&#x2019;s youthful back-benchers. What he will see are inspired young men, in contrast to the upholsterers of the hon. Opposition benches. They are inspired young men who support an inspired Cabinet and an inspired Prime Minister. In the National Party it is not necessary to push the more elderly men with mature experience aside with so much disdain. The hon. member also said: &#x201C;The Party also needed a new image and a new slogan.&#x201D; He therefore says that the party&#x2019;s image is weak and the slogans antiquated&#x2014;what an admission!</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer is a wool farmer and he knows how many miles upon miles of jackal-proof fencing must be put up to keep the jackals out. The hon. member and all of us here surely know of the old adage that &#x201C;a leopard cannot change its spots&#x201D;. Even if one were to put a sheep&#x2019;s face-mask onto a jackal, the greyhounds would still smell it out and the sheep would still remain wary of it. We know the hon. member for Walmer as someone of good integrity, as someone who has the courage of his convictions when he begins to speak about the dead wood in his party&#x2019;s ranks. He displayed the courage to indicate the bad spots, and we on this side can only congratulate him because he has the courage of his convictions. We have here the image of a splintered party, and this image is supported by argument and not by stray accusations and assertions such as the hon. member for Port Natal has just come to light with.</p>

<p>I now come to a report which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of the 26th January of this year which deals with an interview which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout granted to that newspaper, and this report formed the precedent for the crossing-over of the hon. member for Umlazi. The hon. member was, <i>inter alia,</i> asked this question, after he said that according to their policy there would be different nations in South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other words, whatever it is called, it will in fact reflect political federation in varying degrees?</block>

<p>To this he answered&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes. We must recognize that this concept of federation is the key one. Its merit is that it will break the whole colour issue down into manageable units or nations.</block>

<p>According to the hon. member for Turffontein he also heard and saw this opinion depicted on television in New York. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">State interference in race relations can be reduced to a minimum once the very real fear among the Whites of &#x201C;swamping&#x201D; can be assuaged.</block>

<p>Earlier in the report one reads that &#x201C;Mr. Basson detects a shift in political thinking&#x201D;. That was in January of this year. The report continues, &#x201C;&#x2026; but he warns that if the United Party is to use this opportunity it must state its own policy with greater clarity and emphasis&#x201D;. What a beautiful precedent for what happened here this month! We could not have desired such a prediction in clearer terms. This is all a beautiful example of a bankrupt Opposition which is still regressing, and this same Opposition wants to lay down the law to the Government side about all kinds of matters such as rising living costs, old age pensions, and so on, while they do not want to face up to the actual bottle-necks.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal spoke about Pretoria and its public servants who are ostensibly treated so badly. I now want to ask the hon. member this: What happened in connection with the public servants in the latest election in Pretoria in 1966? I will tell him: a clean sweep was made of the United Party and there is no longer a single United Party member here from that city&#x2019;s constituencies; there is not a single one left. Since the hon. <span class="col_1097-1098" refersTo="page_0570"/>member has spoken about living costs, I want to read from a few newspaper reports. We read that &#x201C;The sale of tractors is heading for a new record &#x2026; Motor cars are selling like hot cakes &#x2026; More motor cars in Pretoria &#x2026; More motor cars, more problems, says Mr. Dorfman, the chief traffic inspector of Johannesburg &#x2026; Motor vehicle market in 1970 estimated at 230.000.&#x201D; Are these, then, people living under the breadline? I want to refer to the January 1969 issue of <i>New Day,</i> the official newspaper of the &#x201C;Shop and Office Employees&#x2019; Association&#x201D;. It is an association which made representations to the Department of Commerce. One report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In conclusion I wish to point out that an analysis of the statistics relating to the distribution of the gross domestic product, according to types of income, reveals that the share of the salary and wage earners remained fairly constant at about 55 per cent of total income since 1950. During the past few years the wage earner&#x2019;s share has even shown a slight gain compared with that of other types of income.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask the hon. member where he came by the nonsense that he spoke. I want to go further and quote to him from <i>Georganiseerde Landbou</i> of August, 1968, the mouthpiece of the South African Agricultural Union, where the director refutes the allegation the hon. member made against the public servants and the farmers. Mr. Cilliers, director of the South African Agricultural Union, writes that, in spite of this oppressive drought under which the country is periodically bowed and the problems that the farmers are struggling with, 68,000 farmers farmed at a profit during 1964, while only 12,000 suffered a loss. That is the position, in spite of the black picture which hon. members on that side are always trying to sketch with a view to catching a few votes in that way. The report continues:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Chris Cilliers of the South African Agricultural Union indicated that the top strata of the South African farming population were among the richest and most efficient farmers in the world. The position of the middle strata is reasonable, while the lower income group position is precarious.</block>

<p>With which I agree heartily&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The picture in respect of the burden of debt in agriculture is, however, not as dark if cognizance is taken of the fact that the average of the total debt is equal to the average annual income of the farmer,</block>

<p>Hon. members of the Opposition suppress these arguments when they attack the Government. As I said at the beginning, it is like a harrow behind a large farm tractor that it only touches the ground here and there and shoots up a few clods. The report goes further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If a portion of the total debts which farmers incurred at high interest rates from certain bodies &#x2026;</block>

<p>the certain bodies do not include the State&#x2014;they are profit-making bodies&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is carried over to the State, it is, however, possible to reduce the total debt to a large extent, and consequently the burden of interest.</block>

<p>I mention these examples on the part of the public servants and the farmers to indicate why this side of the House is still sending more and more members to this House while the United Party sends less and less.</p>

<p>While agriculture is under discussion, I should like to point out a few aspects for the hon. the Minister of Finance. In this grave time of drought, where we can already observe how the margins of the blueprint, already drawn up in 1965, are coming to the fore in respect of veld reclamation, agricultural financing and greater stability in agriculture, and where our farmers are ever-more prepared to ward off drought onslaughts, I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, through the Minister of Finance, to listen carefully. I want to make a request in respect of the category (2) farmer. It is that farmer who is not so worthy of credit that he can be assisted by the commercial banks. But he is also not so unworthy of credit that he cannot be helped by the Department of Agricultural Credit or by the Land Bank. Can we not devise some or other method or formula to help this specific group of farmers? We cannot afford to lose them to agriculture. They account for part of the 12,000 which I quoted just now. These are good farmers, meritorious farmers, and we must retain them in agriculture. I am thinking in this connection whether the State could not perhaps consider the possibility of providing the initial capital for a Co-operative Agricultural Bank. The South African Agricultural Union also made this plea and the idea has already been approved by prominent agricultural economists. The money must be placed in the farmers&#x2019; own hands to undertake the financing of the agricultural sector in the same way as he administers his corporations. The request is therefore whether the State cannot merely supply the nest-egg for that purpose.</p>

<p>Then there is a second problem, namely the exceptional position which develops where the wife of a person who works in the city and has a profession attends to the farming. In the present circumstances that farmer&#x2019;s wife, who is actually farming, cannot find help anywhere, especially if they are newly-married and her husband cannot yet supply her with the necessary funds. There are several such women farmers and we must also look after their interests. Our legislation and our aid facilities do not make provision for that yet.</p>

<p>Lastly I should like to make a request to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture in <span class="col_1099-1100" refersTo="page_0571"/>respect of these category (2) farmers in respect of problems they experience as a result of the fact that we are still having growing pains in bridging our agricultural financing problems. Those farmers are not yet completely free of agricultural credit aid, and there are ever-fewer farmers who are completely independent of state aid. Those category (2) farmers are not eligible for election to agricultural credit committees and there is a real need, since some of the best farmers are found among them, for us also to make use of their insight in these agricultural credit committees. We can perhaps consider an amendment, for example to the effect that, when such a farmer has paid off 50 per cent of his debt to the State, he is qualified to serve on an agricultural credit committee. I want to content myself with these few thoughts in respect of agriculture because I should like to ask that the hon. member for Port Natal, or his party associates, try to prove the accusations which he drew out of thin air.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pretoria (District) has said that if one really wants to seek inspiration, one should look at that side of the House, and particularly at their back-benchers. But if that hon. member is an example of the activity and the inspiration which one should seek in the back-benchers of the National Party, I am afraid that we will not get very far. That hon. member is so inspired by his fellow-members on that side that he cannot hear very well what they have to say from time to time. In order to hear better what they are saying, he has to take it down on a tape-recorder. They are so inspired by one another and share such solidarity that they actually take down one another&#x2019;s conversations on a tape-recorder and play them back to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>I am going to make many more like it. When the hon. member tells us how well things are going on that side of the House, and that all is unity from top to bottom, I find it just a bit strange that the difficulties they are experiencing in Pretoria should occur in that very hon. member&#x2019;s constituency, and in that of the hon. member for Wonderboom and that of the hon. member for Innesdal. If there is so much satisfaction in South Africa with the National party, why is it that there should be difficulty in the constituencies of those particular three members? I think that if there is an hon. member who is not in the least inspired by this Cabinet, it is that very hon. member. If he was satisfied, he would not have caused all this trouble. Then he would not carry a tape-recorder around with him when he drinks a cup of tea or coffee with one of his colleagues. The hon. member had a little something to say to us about agriculture. He asked why this side of the House was never prepared to say that of the many farmers in South Africa there are only 12,000 who show a loss on their undertakings.</p>

<p>Precisely. But one can now buy tape-recorders which are so small that you can carry them around with you. I want to recommend that the hon. member carries one in his pocket. In the <i>Farmers&#x2019; Weekly</i> of 3rd July, 1968, Mr. Chris Cilliers said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Revenue statistics show that only 2-7 per cent of farmers earn more than R10,000, while 75 per cent had a taxable income of less than R3,000 and 50 per cent less than R1,600 per annum.</block>

<p>The hon. member then quoted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About 12,000 farmers out of 80,000 showed losses on their undertakings.</block>

<p>The first part he ignored completely. I want to mention another example of information which the hon. member used in order to show us how well things were going with the farmers in South Africa. Mr. Chris Cilliers stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On an average investment of R70,000, the South African farmer earned R5,500. If he had invested this at 7 per cent he would have earned R4,200 without doing any work at all and his return on his labour and enterprise therefore amounted to only R1,300, or less than the wage of a junior typist.</block>

<p>Judging by the way in which the hon. member handled his case here, that is apparently true, Mr. Speaker. I should like to return later to the question of agriculture, but first I have a little something to say to the hon. member for Kempton Park. What the hon. member for Kempton Park said also has a bearing on what the hon. member for Maitland and the new National Party member for Umlazi said. Yesterday the hon. member for Kempton Park told us here <span class="col_1101-1102" refersTo="page_0572"/>in this debate, and I want to quote his exact words so that there cannot be any mistake&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A nation is a people with a state of their own, and because a nation consists of a people with a state of their own, that is why the Coloured people in South Africa, the Coloureds as well as the Bantu, who are not part of the people, are not part of the nation either. Let us have a good understanding of this now.</block>

<p>From the hon. member for Kempton Park&#x2019;s Hansard speech of yesterday. I find it strange that the hon. member for Umlazi, as well as the hon. member for Maitland, could get up in the House and tell us that they have confidence in the colour policy of the Government, because what did the hon. the Prime Minister tell us? On 7th February the hon. the Prime Minister spoke about a White nation, and then stated very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes. On the one hand you will have the White nation, consisting of Afrikaans and English-speaking persons, and on the other hand you will have the Coloured nation.</block>

<p>The Prime Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In one country. That is the dilemma and the problem of South Africa for the future &#x2026; In this country it will eventually come about&#x2014;and none of us can escape this or argue it away&#x2014;that one will be dealing with a White nation on the one hand and a Coloured nation on the other. As far as that is concerned our children after us will have to find a solution. We must now lay the foundation for that. There are people who in that process thought&#x2014;and there is nothing wrong in thinking about this matter&#x2014;of a homeland for the Coloureds, something which I do not regard as being practical politics.</block>

<p>That is the reply furnished to us by the hon. the Prime Minister. That is the policy which impressed the hon. member for Maitland and the new hon. National member for Umlazi so much. The hon. member for Kempton Park came along and told us in so many words that they were still engaged in creating this state for the Coloureds. We on this side of the House want to ask again: How can such a political party instill confidence in South Africa? One moment they are saying that people can think about Colouredstan, but that it is not practical politics. The next moment they are saying that our children will have to think about it, and that our children will in future have to find the solution. Then the hon. member for Kempton Park comes along and states: No (apart from what the hon. the Prime Minister said) we are working on this plan. Do you know what it puts me in mind of? The very thing it puts me in mind of is what we had here a year or two ago, i.e. when there were hon. members and Ministers who alleged that in spite of the attitude of the former Prime Minister, which was that Coloured representation in Parliament should be maintained, there was always the thought at the back of his mind that those people would in due course be eliminated. We want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister whether these gentlemen were speaking on behalf of the National Party, or whether they were speaking out of turn. For there is also the Minister of Coloured Affairs, Mr. Marais Viljoen, who stated in this House last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Pleas for a Coloured homeland are inopportune and confusing. Pleas to the effect that the Coloureds should have a homeland of their own do not come from the Coloured leaders or from the Cape. No, they are being heard in the other provinces.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Kempton Park does not exactly hail from the Cape&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What strikes me is that it is not the Coloured leaders who are asking for a homeland. In fact, those who have made any comment on the matter are opposed to it. Nor is it the leading National Party figures in the Cape who advocated this. No, this plea was heard from the other provinces.</block>

<p>I think it is high time hon. members opposite took the people of South Africa quite explicitly into their confidence in this matter. Are they or are they not creating a Coloured state in South Africa? I feel that it is time someone gave a reply. But if they do not give a reply they have absolutely no policy.</p>

<p>I should like to return to the other subject, agriculture. It is not inappropriate that we should once again bring the subject of the serious state of affairs in agriculture to the <span class="col_1103-1104" refersTo="page_0573"/>attention of the Ministers in this debate. Last week we had a discussion here, but we were unable to get any satisfactory replies. I am particularly glad that the hon. the Minister of Finance is here to-day. I want to address the pleas, which are repeatedly being made by farmers&#x2019; organizations and by individuals outside to the effect that the interest rates are altogether too high for the average farmer, to him in particular. The hon. the Minister has heard the figures I have quoted, and he has listened to the pleas which have been made for the past two to three years. I can quote to him what one respected member of the Wool Board said as recently as September 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The wool industry cannot support the high rates of interest. In the Cape in particular the situation is heading for disaster.</block>

<p>This was said by none other than the new member for Graaff-Reinet, who is a member of the Wool Board. Last week we addressed this plea to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, and I am certain that they have addressed this plea to the hon. the Minister of Finance as well, i.e. that the high rates of interest are breaking more than one farmer in South Africa. We know that the high rates of interest were introduced to combat inflation, and that they have to a certain extent succeeded in doing so. But the big businessman or the industrialist who wants to undertake expansion at a high rate of interest obtains that money just as easily if he wants it, and what is more, he earns the money to pay for that high rate of interest just as easily. But the farmer is simply not in a position to do so, and we want to address the plea to the Minister to-day that if they do not see their way clear, as we have said before, to subsidizing rates of interest&#x2014;another proposal which has been made by various agricultural organizations&#x2014;then those rates of interest should at least be decreased, for the simple reason that the state of affairs prevailing in agriculture makes it simply impossible for the farmers to pay them. That is the tragedy of the fight against inflation. There are some people who are making a tremendous amount of money out of this combating of inflation, because they can invest their money at tremendously high rates of interest, whereas there are others again who have to pay these high rates of interest. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to the effect that we should hear more about this when the Budget is introduced, and that that rebate will be granted, that the rates of interest for the average farmer will be reduced. We cannot argue away the fact that the depopulation of the platteland is to-day one of the gravest problems facing South Africa. Nor is there any doubt that the fact that this is what is happening in agriculture is the principle factor giving rise to that. Hon. members need not listen to us; they can ignore us, but here I once more have an article which appeared in <i>Die Byvoegsel</i> of <i>Die Burger,</i> written by a Mr. Hannes Malan, a son of the late Dr. Malan, on the depopulation of the platteland. He quotes Mr. Theo Gerdiner, as well as Mr. Frans Conradie, M.E.C. of the Cape, and he also quotes Dr. Hupkes. He says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An economist who was consulted is Dr. G. J. Hupkes, who is not exactly enthusiastic about agriculture as an attractive profession. He compared the farming industry in the Boland briefly with that of the Karoo. For the farmer who wants to build up something, who wants to be dynamic, in other words, who wants to become a rich farmer, even the Boland offers few possibilities. In the Karoo the position is quite different, but even the very rich are no longer doing as well. Ten years ago the wool price was higher. It is now reasonably constant, but the farmer&#x2019;s expenses are steadily increasing The fact remains that in the Karoo people are farming with shrinking profits, and with this profit margin the weaker farmers or the farmers with less available capital will always fall by the wayside, particularly in view of the high rates of interest.</block>

<p>It is in the hands of the hon. the Minister of Finance to change this situation. He can offer these people a future. He can give them more confidence in the future of agriculture; he can give them a little hope for the future, in spite of the fact that it is so tremendously dry, but then it must be done now; and unless he does so now, I am afraid that the difficulties will continue to increase. I am also convinced that South Africa cannot afford to lose these people from the platteland in increasing numbers. Hon. members must not tell me that absolutely nothing can be done and that it is a world-wide phenomenon. Mr. Frans Conradie, M.E.C. of the Cape, said as recently as last year that something must be done about it, and that we can reverse the situation. But it cannot be reversed unless the basic industry being practised in the platteland, agriculture, can afford those people a means of subsistence.</p>

<p>We said these things to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture last week, but he ignored them completely. He did not even reply to the hon. member for Colesberg, whom I honestly believe was speaking on behalf of the farmers of South Africa. The only matter to which the Minister of Agriculture gave attention last week, was the veld reclamation scheme in regard to which he said that he was going to expand it on a broader scale and that he was going to include more districts. That is precisely what the United Party has been saying for three years already. But now I want to say to the hon. the Minister and to his Deputy that that scheme will not work either unless it is made more profitable for the farmer to participate in it. Remember my words, because in two years&#x2019; time you will come forward again and state that you <span class="col_1105-1106" refersTo="page_0574"/>offered this to the farmers of the country, but they had withdrawn. Sir, I do not blame them for withdrawing, because as it is being applied at present, it is simply not profitable for the most farmers to participate in it. The Minister of Agriculture told us last week that he could not guarantee the price of agricultural products on a basis of production costs plus, because as soon as one gave that guarantee a farmer could simply produce anything and the State would be responsible for seeing to it that the farmer received a decent price. What member on this side of the House made such a ridiculous statement? Surely the hon. members know that there are only certain products which fall under the Marketing Act, and hon. members ought to know that there are only certain products which are known as staple foods. Any farmer who tries to cultivate a new product does so at his own risk. But we were not pleading here for those farmers who were still going to produce a new product; we were only pleading for those people who were busy producing at the moment. I want to repeat that statement: Unless we are able to do this, we can forget about it, because there is no reason to think that this Government is doing something to reduce production costs. But, the hon. the Minister adds, we are going to help the people who are in difficulties. That is precisely what the United Party said. We did not ask him to help anyone. Have we not previously pleaded to the effect that if there are certain sectors who are in difficulties, he must support them? Have we not previously told him that if it is necessary to apply food subsidies to more products in order to bolster those prices, he should do so? And in his speech the Minister said just that. But why are the hon. members on the opposite side disregarding the situation which is developing as a result of the increasing production costs and decreasing prices? They do not say a single word about it, but the Deputy Minister attended the Transvaal congress of the S.A. Agricultural Union last year, and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The farmers will have to specialize. I cannot sleep at nights for thinking about next year&#x2019;s mealie prices.</block>

<p>So concerned was he about the situation. And then he said the following were the problems being experienced by farmers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The farmers of South Africa have to contend with (1) the high rates of interest.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister right now what they have done about it up to the present. There is nothing tangible. He said that one of the problems was the high rates of interest, and the next was the high land prices and also the high production costs. What have they done about them? He also mentioned the low prices for their products, but what have they done about it? But if the United Party mentions the same problems, as we have been doing for the past four or five years and more, it is said that we are asking for manna from heaven. But when the Deputy stands up at a congress, and he knows that he must at least be straightforward and honest with the farmers, then he is prepared to say to them what their problems are. Last Friday in this debate, when we mentioned the increasing production costs, there was a feeling of disregard for that problem on the part of those hon. members. The hon. the Minister came forward with non-essentials, yes, such as asking us whether we were prepared to compel the farmers to apply soil conservation. He asked whether the Opposition would support him when they compel the farmers to do so. But the Minister wants to make it compulsory in a time when he is aware that the soil is not deteriorating as a result of poor farming methods. It has in fact deteriorated, but as a result of poor climatic conditions and low producer&#x2019;s prices. Our attitude on this side is that when farmers receive a reasonable price for their produce, they will not deliberately allow the soil to deteriorate. We realize that first things must come first. Secondly, we realize on this side of the House that the backlog as far as erosion prevention is concerned, is so great that the individual farmer is not financially able to make up that backlog. Only when the State is prepared to make larger contributions, and help the farmer by means of decreased production costs or better prices, will the farmer be able to apply better conservation methods, and then only can he be compelled to do so. We do not want the soil to deteriorate any further. As soon as the soil has been rehabilitated once and for all, then sound soil conservation principles can be applied. There is undoubtedly great advantage attached to the application of the correct soil conservation methods, but it also costs a great deal of money, particularly where the veld has been trampled and where washaways have taken place, in order to rehabilitate it. The State must realize this, and if the legislation which the Government has in mind takes into account the practical conditions outside and the duty of the State, then we can support that legislation. But we shall wait until that legislation appears, and then we will ourselves decide what attitude we ought to adopt. Sir, I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance, and particularly his Deputy, to support me in the plea which I am making here this afternoon for the reduction of rates of interest and, what is even better, for the granting of a subsidy of at least 2 per cent on their mortgage liabilities, with retrospective effect from the beginning of 1966. If the hon. the Deputy Minister supports me in this matter, then I think we will be able to get somewhere because we will then not only be doing what is correct but I feel that we will also be doing something which would be appreciated by the farmers of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I just <span class="col_1107-1108" refersTo="page_0575"/>want to straighten out one point that was mentioned by the hon. member for Newton Park in regard to the congress last year. At the congress I said that there were several factors which were responsible for the farmers&#x2019; margin of profit becoming smaller, i.e. rates of interest that had become higher&#x2014;this is no secret; everybody knows it&#x2014;and production costs which had increased. On that occasion I mentioned what the Government was doing in order to keep production costs low in certain departments. For instance, I can mention a subsidy of R15 million on fertilizer, fence posts, corrugated iron, cement, building material, etc.; there is price control over the things farmers use, but the rising cost of labour is beyond the control of the Government. The solution I suggested, was this (and these are the words I used): Where a farmer was satisfied with 15 bags per morgen, he should now aim at 20 bags per morgen. Mr. Speaker, let us admit that the position of our agriculturists to-day is such that they are fighting with their backs to the wall. They are finding themselves in financial difficulties, not because the Government is to blame. Hon. members should kindly refrain from trying to make political capital out of this disaster which has hit our country. Owing to weather conditions our agriculturists have been forced to their knees, and hon. members must not try to derive personal gain from this situation. The farmers are no longer falling for this type of thing.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the hon. member for Newton Park is sincere. It was disappointing to me to see that five days were devoted to a discussion on Bantu affairs in a no-confidence debate, and that up to now this debate has not really got under way. An amendment was introduced here yesterday and it was only after sunset that agriculture was dragged into this debate, but look at what has happened? We are dealing here with a grave matter, but an hon. member on that side is making jokes about tape-recorders and is making all sorts of negative proposals while our farmers are finding themselves in difficulties as a result of the drought. Do hon. members on that side not understand what is happening in our country? Why are they making jokes about these things? It is unnecessary to make references here to something that happened three to four months ago in connection with the hon. members for Kempton Park and Pretoria (District). This was done by the hon. member for Newton Park, who is the chairman of the United Party&#x2019;s agriculture group, a person to whom I should like to have said: Let us tackle this problem. This is not a political matter; we are dealing here with the bread and butter of the person who has to make his living out of agriculture. But the hon. member would chip in with such nonsense. I do not want to make any further reference to it. Surely, I am not unreasonable in saying that we have a large number of agriculturists here who are yearning for the opportunity to state their views as far as agriculture is concerned. They are not getting that opportunity in this House. For five days on end Bantu affairs are discussed here, time and again and year after year. The nation has decided that it wants separate development, and why should our time be wasted on that? When his motion was being discussed here last week, the hon. member for Newton Park said that he believed that demand and supply had nothing to do with each other. In other words, we might as well produce to our heart&#x2019;s content; it is the Government&#x2019;s responsibility to sell the surplusses. Today he said &#x201C;certain products&#x201D;. Let us take products in regard to which we are in difficulties at present. Take butter. Butter comes under the Dairy Board. We are saddled with a surplus of two million pounds of butter. What must we do with it? That butter is in cold storage; the world does not want to buy it; every country has enough for itself. New Zealand can sell butter at a much lower price than our producers are getting for it. What are we to do? Must we tell the farmers: &#x201C;Go on producing; we shall see to it that you get a market for your butter?&#x201D; When I addressed that congress, we were experiencing a surplus. That was in August. Every farmer always hopes that things will be better in the next year, just as the diamond-digger believes that he will pick up a large diamond next year. At that stage I believed that our country would be blessed with good rains this year and that we would produce more than 100 million bags of mealies, and it was in that spirit that I sounded a warning and said: &#x201C;Do not expect us to be able to do what the hon. member for Newton Park said, i.e. that we need not relate demand and supply to each other.&#x201D; The past year&#x2019;s mealie crop was subsidized out of the taxpayers&#x2019; pocket to an amount of R32 million. The hon. member says that he assumes that I was honest when I addressed the congress. It pleases me to think that at some stage or other of my life I have been honest! At that moment I felt that we should not deceive the farmers; that we should tell them that we could not allow them to produce freely. Sir, our techniques have changed. The hon. member says that we are doing nothing. The Vote of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services alone was R31 million. This is not State aid; this is technical aid for the purpose of providing farmers with the best methods; to teach them how to use fertilizer, how to plant, how to plough and how to combat reeds. All these things must be done in accordance with the most modern methods. Sir, year before last we had a mealie crop of 109 million bags. What can we expect in the future? I must be optimistic since I am a farmer, and I am telling you, Sir, that the day will come when this country will quite easily produce 200 million bags of mealies.</p>

<p>We can argue as much as we please, but if it does not rain one will achieve nothing, no matter what methods one employs. But I am asking the hon. member whether he has a practical solution for the problems he mentioned here? He says that we are doing too little, that we are virtually doing nothing. I shall touch upon a few other points presently, but before I come to them, I wish to put this question to the hon. member: In view of the fact that these unpleasant conditions prevail in the agricultural industry in view of the fact that he knows that the agricultural industry is struggling&#x2014;what is more, it is not pleasant to-day to be Deputy Minister of Agriculture when it does not rain, for then it is always an uphill struggle&#x2014;is it necessary to rub salt into the wounds once again and in addition to chase away the young man who is prepared to make agriculture his career? The agricultural industry offers wonderful opportunities. Within the next 32 years we shall have to feed 40 million people in this country, and by that time the hon. member and I will still be alive, I hope. We cannot afford to chase away from the farms those persons whose ideal it is to till the soil. After all, hon. members should also give a little thought, every now and then, to the achievements of our farmers. In 1960 we were the seventh greatest producer of mealies; in 1967 we were the third greatest producer in the world. As regards sheep, we were the fifth greatest producer in 1966, and we were the fifth greatest producer of wool, and so I could continue to tell you, Sir, what position we occupy in other spheres. We occupy a prominent position amongst the foremost nations of the world. I want to read out to you, Sir, what the Americans have to say about us in the American Commodity Year Book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Allowing for South Africa&#x2019;s climatic and geographical difficulties, relatively small population and very small white managerial farming class, it has a record of which farmers may justifiably feel proud.</block>

<p>This is what the Americans are saying about our agriculturists. The United Party should at least begin to admit at some time or other that we have a fine group of farmers in this country. In spite of all these problems they still succeed in doing well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since the United Party&#x2019;s amendment states that we are doing nothing for agriculture, I should like to make a statement on behalf of the hon. the Minister who, unfortunately, cannot be here to-day. Owing to the drought he has to appear somewhere else to-day. The statement reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Special credit facilities to agricultural cooperative societies in drought-stricken areas: Several bodies and persons have made urgent representations to the Government for special assistance to agricultural cooperative societies which, owing to the continuous drought conditions and the stress of circumstances, are suffering from a serious lack of liquid funds since their own means are tied up in members&#x2019; debts which, as a result of the oppressive drought, cannot be recovered from members at the moment. Fodder purchases which in many cases were purchased on credit out of their own funds for distribution to members, cannot be continued in this time of crisis as the co-operative societies&#x2019; own funds have been exhausted and their members are not in a position to meet their obligations fully under present circumstances. This has had the effect that co-operative societies cannot render further assistance to their members in this respect, unless they themselves receive financial assistance for that purpose. Also as regards the provision of production credit to members, the same pattern applies to a greater or lesser extent to many co-operative societies, and in this regard representations have been made to the Government that relief be granted as regards the terms of repayment of existing production loans. The Government has therefore decided to make available to the Land Bank the necessary means in order that cash credit loans may be made available to agricultural co-operative societies in drought-stricken areas for the purchase of fodder on behalf of their members on a broader basis than the period of one year for which these loans are normally granted by the Bank. The terms of repayment of existing production loans, which, owing to the oppressive drought, cannot be recovered by a co-operative society from its members within the prescribed time, will also be extended by the Land Bank. Co-operative societies will still try to recover their members&#x2019; debts for these purposes every year, as circumstances may require, and will not necessarily delay the recovery of the debt until after the expiration of the term of payment. Cooperative societies must submit their applications directly to the Land Bank which will consider each case according to the merits of its circumstances.</block>

<p>It is a pleasure to me to be able to read such a statement and also to be able to thank the hon. the Minister of Finance. However, if I had to thank the hon. the Minister of Finance for everything he has done, it would take me a very long time, and besides, I am not in the habit of praising a person in his presence. However, I want to mention to you a few instances in regard to which I take off my hat to his Department. Firstly, I am thinking of the assistance farmers were granted in regard to exports under devaluation conditions. Sir, you have probably read about the extensive <span class="col_1111-1112" refersTo="page_0577"/>assistance and financial aid those farmers are receiving. I agree with the hon. member for Newton Park that a person who has to pay a commercial bank rate of interest is paying a very high rate of interest. However, these are things the hon. the Minister will deal with. You should not forget, however, that the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure charges 5 per cent interest. Where does it come from? It is a subsidized rate of interest. How much money has been paid over to that Department over the past 16 months? An amount of R14.1 million has been paid over to the Department for the purchase of land&#x2014;remember that this is at 5 per cent interest. You will now say that very few farmers are being assisted. 1,300 applications were refused, but 693 persons were granted assistance. Many of the applications submitted to the Department, are cases of farmers who are creditworthy at the Land Bank or the commercial bank, but who go for the 5 per cent rate of interest.</p>

<p>An amount of R1 million has been allocated in respect of soil conservation works. 550 farmers were assisted, whereas 30 were not assisted.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not even five. It is less than that. In regard to water works 403 farmers received assistance to the value of R1.4 million, whereas 107 were not assisted. That was at 5 per cent interest. In respect of the purchase of implements, farmers were assisted to an amount of R291,000. In respect of stock the assistance amounted to R276,000, and in respect of the payment of debts&#x2014;I want the hon. member for Newton Park to listen attentively&#x2014;farmers received assistance to the value of R8.6 million at 5 per cent interest.</p>

<p>I should like to return to the question of producing without having regard to the marketing aspect. The hon. member for Newton Park says that the demand and the supply have nothing to do with each other. [Interjections.] Surely, you did say so in your private motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, certain Opposition members have referred to a quota system before. On 4th February, the hottest day in Johannesburg, Pretoria and the Witwatersrand for the past 50 years, a surplus of 24,000 gallons of milk was produced in Johannesburg alone, in the midst of the heat-wave and the terrible drought. But no Opposition member has come forward with a suggestion as to what would constitute a good scheme. They merely criticize and then resume their seats. What does this lead to? With higher production costs&#x2014;and I admit that the production cost is rising&#x2014;we have more products that have to be sold. Do you want a quota system? If you could give us an affirmative or negative reply to that, we could discuss this question. For the time being I just want to say that there are many commodities in respect of which we cannot introduce a quota system. Must we tell the farmer that, because his production has on an average been 5,000 bags per year over the past five years, his quota must now be 5,000 bags? Should it be the case that his total crop during a year of drought amounted to 500 bags, he would only be left with one way of rehabilitating himself, and that would be to have a crop of 10,000 bags the next year. He must pay his own debts, but now he has a quota system.</p>

<p>Are you forgetting about world prices, or are you taking them into account? Take our citrus crop as an example. Sixteen million boxes must be exported. However, we are experiencing stiff competition from America, Israel and all other countries that are exporters of citrus fruit. Must we say that the citrus farmers are going bankrupt because they exported citrus this year at a price which almost amounted to a loss? One cannot forget about demand and supply. It is extremely important.</p>

<p>I admit that R80,000 is only sufficient to enable a farmer to start his farming operations to-day. It is not even possible for him to acquire all the aids he needs. Land prices have increased, but has any Opposition member ever suggested that land prices should be pegged, or ever asked himself what could be done about it? Should a farmer now be told that he may not sell his farm at more than R100 per morgen? Are members of the Opposition prepared to do that? Surely, this is free economy? If a farmer can obtain such a good price for his land, let us not begrudge him that. However, it is useless to rise here and to say that land prices are very high and then to sit down again. Hon. members of the Opposition must come forward with proposals. We are always giving thought to these problems, but in spite of that there is not one Opposition member who is assisting us in trying to find a solution.</p>

<p>Nor is there anybody on the other side who is of any assistance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we do not criticize. Many farmers are staying on their farms to-day because the value of the land has increased and so has their creditworthiness. This is the case all over the world. If we have regard to land prices, R80,000 is little to start with. That is why an attempt is being made, with the aid of agricultural credit and generous assistance on the part of the Land Bank, to establish people in the agricultural industry and, as far as possible, to keep in that industry those who are already established. However, it is impossible to keep everybody in the agricultural <span class="col_1113-1114" refersTo="page_0578"/>industry. This is in conflict with world economy. The other day the hon. member for Newton Park said in his motion that we should kindly refrain from referring to efficiency. If we had to forget about efficiency and tell a farmer that he could produce as much as he pleased, the one neighbour would buy out the other, for one farmer farms more efficiently than the other. Our aim is to produce food, but we should also like to keep on the land the person who is making a success of agriculture.</p>

<p>Since you referred last week, and may perhaps do so once again in the course of this Session, to soil conservation and what we were doing about it, I want you to listen to what the <i>Soil and Water Conservation Journal</i> of America has to say about their own conditions. Then we must analyse our own conditions. The person in question wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More than 200 million people now live in the United States. By the year 2010 there will be close to 400 million people. This means that in the next 40 years we will have to construct a duplicate of everything we have built in this country since the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Harbour.</block>

<p>The same applies to us. We are also going to have a duplication.</p>

<block name="quote">We do not want to continue to do as we have done. We are disillusioned with this gaudy cheap trash heap of a country we have made out of our inheritance. How do we turn away to new paths before it is too late?</block>

<p>This person illustrated his point further by saying that they were applying wasteful exploitation. He has a different approach and asks where they are heading. What connection does this have with our own conditions in view of the fact that we have regions, particularly in the Karoo, where over the past five or six years they have had no rains at all or perhaps an inch or three? Now the Government is introducing assistance schemes for specific areas. The other day the hon. the Minister mentioned to you, Sir, that the withdrawal of stock in certain areas would be subsidized by a third. This is going to cost the State millions of rands. We cannot allow the Orange River with its silt to silt up the new dam project we have there. All these things are being done. Despite this you say that the Government is doing very little as regards the maintenance and the conservation of our soil. If you read through those reports you have received, you will have to rise at some stage or other during this Session and say that a great deal is being done towards protecting our soil.</p>

<p>But we are farming to-day with the idea that we must have the optimum. Where a morgen can support so many head of cattle, we keep the full number there. When we are farming we are not mindful of a possible drought; we simply want to take out the maximum. I grant those who live in the rural areas the same privileges as I do those who live in cities. If a person in Newton Park can switch on a light or an electric broom or an electric kettle, then I want the person in the rural areas to be able to do so as well. Uniformity must be brought about in this regard. Now it is being said that we should not have regard to efficiency.</p>

<p>Well, then I suppose I did misunderstand you, and I am glad to hear it. Afford those who live in the rural areas the opportunity to live like that as well. I am now referring to ordinary farming business. Let us do a few calculations to see whether we can effect uniformity. I am not referring to drought conditions now. There are parts of our country where for the past 30 years there has never been less than half a crop, always more, and in those parts, with which I am conversant, some farmers have not even been able to recover their fertilizer costs this year. This is not the time, i.e. when farmers find themselves in financial difficulties, to discuss these things, but when conditions are normal once again, we must view these matters in this light, then we must take this into account. But when hon. members opposite jump up and say that the Government is doing nothing, I feel that it is my duty to say that we are doing all these things I mentioned here, but in addition to that there are certain things which the farmers themselves must do. Soil conservation is not the duty of the State alone, and more and more farmers are beginning to realize this, people who are saying, &#x201C;I shall roll up my sleeves and undertake my own conservation works, for I want my child to farm on this farm just as I have done.&#x201D; This attitude is becoming more and more prevalent. We must not merely look to the State; all of us must co-operate in order to attain these things.</p>

<p>We are all prepared to view these matters in this light. Hon. members must bear in mind that it is the policy of the National Government to bring about prosperity and calm in the agricultural industry, to grant the person who is prepared to work hard a living. At present the industrial sector, the share market, I can almost say the rest of the country, is making money and money is flowing freely, but the agriculturist is not making money. This Government is thoroughly aware of that. This is one sector of our population which, owing to drought conditions and other circumstances beyond our control, does not participate in that prosperity.</p>

<p>A moment ago the hon. member for Newton Park referred here to the depopulation of the rural areas. That is the case. But on the other hand I can refer to speeches made by those hon. members about consolidation, the enlarging of small units. Well, if we do enlarge small units, somebody has to make way.</p>

<p>The depopulation of our rural areas is one of the phenomena which I personally find tremendously alarming, and I have said so in this hon. House before. As a nation or a people&#x2014;call it what you please&#x2014;we have close ties with the soil. We want to keep our feet on the ground, and that is where all this subdivision of land and plots had its origin. People do not want to bring up their children on the sixth or seventh floor of a block of flats; they want to have close ties with the soil, and that is why we feel so alarmed about this matter. But if we analyse everything we see and we accept that this is the way our nation wants to be. But circumstances are different; economic laws are different. The Government itself will do as much as it possibly can in order to keep that person on his land if he can make a success of his undertaking&#x2014;sometimes under difficult circumstances, as is the case now, i.e. in 1969. Our policy is to effect stability, the orderly marketing of products, and also to give to the person who practises agriculture in a year when it rains and everything goes well, a share in the prosperity of our country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have not had an opportunity of publicly congratulating the new hon. the Deputy Minister on his meteoric rise to this position of Deputy Minister after having sat in this House for such a short time. I want to do so now because we on this side believe the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s heart is in the right place. If he is sincere, and I believe he is, when he says his aim is the stability of the country&#x2019;s agriculture then I want to tell him he is going to have a very hard job indeed, because if there is one thing the farmers of this country have not had under this Nationalist Government, which has been in power for 21 years, it is stability in agriculture. Nonetheless, one detects a certain note of hope in what the Deputy Minister has said because at least we did not have the parrot cry from him this afternoon that we have had from other hon. members opposite for so many years, and that is: &#x201C;Dit gaan goed met die landbou.&#x201D; At least the Deputy Minister has admitted this afternoon that agriculture is in a very sorry plight indeed. Unfortunately I am disappointed in him from this point of view&#x2014;he has not sought the true reasons but instead has fallen back on this old excuse of the drought.</p>

<p>I am going to deal this afternoon first with a particular subject and a particular section of agriculture which the Deputy Minister knows very well indeed. The present difficulties of that sector of agriculture are not due to drought and the Deputy Minister will know as well as I do that they are not due to drought. I am referring to the pineapple industry. I want to deal with it particularly because the Deputy Minister has cited here this afternoon that one of the things the Government has done for the farmers has been the assistance given to them under devaluation. I am sorry the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is not here &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I am very glad the Minister is here. This question of assistance to the pineapple industry falls under two heads. Firstly, that of assistance to the industry to compensate for losses suffered because of British devaluation, a matter which falls under the control of the Minister of Economic Affairs, and secondly, general assistance to the industry, apart from the devaluation losses, which falls under the Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<p>Ever since the British devaluation towards the end of 1967, we have had a series of assurances from Ministers, we have had a series of soothing statements made by various Ministers that assistance will be given to exporters hit by devaluation. Among those has been the hon. the Minister of Finance himself, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, and even the previous Deputy Minister of Agriculture who now has been shunted sideways and made Deputy Minister of Transport.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to quote all that those various Ministers have said in this connection, I need make only one quotation and that is what the hon. the Minister of Agriculture said here on 20th May last year, as reported in Hansard (Vol. 24), Col. 5665&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked once again what the position is in regard to compensation for our exporters of produce, particularly canned fruit, which is being sold on overseas markets, particularly the British market. But statements in regard to this matter have been made on previous occasions. When the hon. the Minister of Finance announced some time ago that we were not going to devalue, he stated that those industries which could be prejudiced by devaluation would be assisted by the Government. This was subsequently repeated by the Minister of Economic Affairs, and I said the same thing.</p>

<p>That was the Minister of Agriculture. A little bit further on in the next column he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has given the exporters in question the assurance that if they can produce evidence to show that they have suffered losses as a result of devaluation, the necessary assistance will be granted to them.</block>

<p>On 11th February, just a week or so ago, I put a question in this House to the Minister of Economic Affairs and I asked him if the producers of fresh pineapples for export were going to receive compensation for losses they had suffered as a result of devaluation, and I got the following reply&#x2014;</p>

<p>I wonder if the hon. the Minister realizes what a callous reply he has given to that question? He said in effect to the producers of fresh pineapples for export: &#x201C;You are too insignificant to worry about and therefore compensation for you is not justified.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I will give the percentages later on, as well as the tonnage last year and how much it brought in in foreign exchange. It comes down to this. If one belongs to a big, powerful organization then under these rules one gets compensation. This is what it amounts to. We have the canners highly organized under their Canners Council who have got compensation, quite fairly and quite rightly; they should have got it. There is a body like the Deciduous Fruit Board, which is a large and powerful organization, and they too have received compensation.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>This Minister was a Minister of Information and he now says they paid it over to their farmers. Well, I believe he has not kept up with the times because this matter is still under discussion. If the hon. gentleman wants to interject here then he should not expose his ignorance in such a way. As I say, the big organizations got compensation, but these people simply because their production is small, are told by the Minister of Economic Affairs that they are not going to get anything.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister asked me about the percentage. Well, I am not interested in percentages. I am interested in human beings who are producing goods for export and they were promised by the Government that they would be paid compensation for devaluation losses. I do not care whether it is 0.5 per cent. They are still primary producers who were led to believe that they were going to get compensation, and yet this hon. gentleman tells this House that they are not going to get compensation. But their production is not so small either. Last year the export of fresh pineapples amounted to something like 4,000 cases which is about R400,000 for the grower, and if you have a R100,000 cost paid in South African currency&#x2014;I am not talking about what is paid in sterling&#x2014;then it is round about R&#x00BD; million foreign exchange earned from that export. I say this is a direct violation of all the assurances given by the various Ministers in the past. I say further this is a shocking situation.</p>

<p>I hope very sincerely the Minister is going to pay heed to what I have had to say on this matter and that he will compensate these people. I hope the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, who knows the pineapple industry very well indeed, is going to use his influence and put right an injustice which will be done if these people do not receive compensation.</p>

<p>I think this is indicative of something else, it is indicative of how the outlook and the attitude of the party opposite have changed over the past 21 years since they first came into power. In 1948 this Government was put into power by the farmers, the little businessman and the workers of the country. In other words, they were the party of the small man. But to-day this is a big businessman&#x2019;s Government. This is the Government of the rich man.</p>

<p>Yes, that hon. member has just said: &#x201C;Harry Oppenheimer is nou by ons&#x201D;. That hon. member is quite right. We therefore have here a glaring example of a rich man&#x2019;s government helping the big organizations while refusing to help the small ones. When I started my speech I said that there were two aspects to this problem of assistance to the pineapple producers. The second aspect of this problem concerns the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. The responsibility for compensation for devaluation losses in this regard falls under the Minister of Economic Affairs but other assistance to pinepapple growers, if there is to be any, falls directly under the jurisdiction of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said a little while ago by way of an interjection that the canners were being very well compensated for devaluation losses and that the producers were going to reap the benefit of this. At this stage I just want to recapitulate to refresh hon. members&#x2019; memories about what has happened so far. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has said that he is not going to pay compensation for devaluation losses. In replying to a question put by me he said that he was also not going to pay compensation to producers of pineapples intended for canning. I want to quote from his reply to my question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die betaling van vergoeding aan produsente van inmaakpynappels ten opsigte van die valuasieverliese kan dus nie geregverdig word nie.</block>

<p>I shall come to the question of whether the canners pay the higher price shortly. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has said that he is not going to compensate the producers of pineapples intended for canning. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture has said that it was not his function to compensate the producers of pineapples destined for the cannery. Now the canners are saying that they are not going to pass on the benefits of the compensation for devaluation received by them directly to the producers.</p>

The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs will not pay these people compensation while the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has said that it is not his function to do so. At the same time the canners are saying that they are not going to pass on to the producer any compensation they have received for devaluation.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is correct.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is listening. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture has said that I am right when I say that the canners are refusing to pass on some of the compensation they received to the pineapple producers. Now where do the pineapple growers come into the picture? In February of last year the newly-formed Pineapple Growers Association sent a deputation to Cape Town to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. I know of this because they invited me to attend their inaugural meeting in Peddie. They asked for three things. I know of this because I know that they were sent down to do this in the first place. They asked for compensation for the growers of fresh pineapples who were going to suffer devaluation losses. In the second place they asked for compensation to be paid to the grower of pineapples intended for canning in those cases where the devaluation losses were not absorbed by the canners. But over and above this, and this is the question I want to discuss with the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture this afternoon, they asked for general assistance to the growers, retrospective for approximately a year, because the growers were making no profits or were in fact making losses. As far as I am aware the growers have had no assistance whatever in terms of any of these three requests they put to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has been making interjections about prices. My information is that two of the biggest canners are going to Day R20 per ton for grade I pineapples for the coming season&#x2014;that is, delivered at the factory. Let us compare this figure of R20 per ton in relation to the growers&#x2019; cost. In September, 1968, the estimated cost of production in the pineapple lands was estimated at between R16 and R17 per ton by the growers themselves. Added to this were other items which would not fall under cost of production estimates of perhaps all growers. They might have had managers on their farms; there might have been building repairs and so on which would not have fallen under the cost estimates. This must be added to the price of R16 to R17 per ton in the field. At just about the same time the marketing council made a survey of the whole of the Eastern Cape pineapple production. It is interesting to see that they arrived at a figure which was remarkably similar to that arrived at by the growers themselves, namely a figure of R16.17 per ton in the field. So there we have a figure of between R16 and R17 but at this stage we must still add on the other costs involved before it gets to the factory. First of all, we must add R2 per ton for transport, which has to be met by the farmer. In the case of one factory, I do not want to name the company, a levy is <span class="col_1121-1122" refersTo="page_0582"/>imposed which is, it is true, recoverable, but only over a period of years. If you add all this, the figure of the production cost comes very close indeed to the figures which the canners are offering the growers, namely R20 per ton.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That applies to first grade pineapples.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, for first grade, as the hon. member for East London (City) has just said. Now I am coming to this aspect. Then the factory can also start docking hard. There might be bruising and they might dock for size if there is drought, and here is one instance where the drought might be affecting them. The factory might dock for diseases like black spots. They might dock for sunburn and if the grower is lucky part of it may be graded down to grade II where R2 to R3 less per ton is paid than for grade I. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that these growers are either making no money at all or are losing money. The result of this has been exactly the same as the growers warned the Government it would be, namely that the local production is going to decrease. It is decreasing due to this uncertainty which has arisen because of the long delay of the Government&#x2019;s announcement of their plans for assistance to offset the devaluation losses of the industry.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>What about export markets in other countries?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with our own country. I am dealing with our own country and with the fact that the Government promised to help the growers out of their difficulties. A very large number of growers have not planted this spring and now it is too late for them to plant. The result of this is that, because of the fact that plants only begin to come into full bearing in about three years, these canneries will not be able to operate at full capacity due probably to a shortage of fruit. In this connection it is interesting to see&#x2014;I understand, although I am not sure, with the exception of one cannery for certain reasons which I cannot mention at the moment&#x2014;that most of them have border industry benefits because they are situated in the East London area. Here you have an example where the Government on the one hand encourages industries by means of border industry benefits, but on the other hand there is a lack of assistance to the industries which supply the factories. Thereby they are going to hamstring these factories because their output is going to be lower. Therefore their cost is going to be higher and they will be less able to compete on the overseas market. I may also mention, as we have had a long debate on Bantu Affairs last week, the Bantu employment factor in this industry. If you take the employees in the canning industry and the employees in the growing industry, and you add their dependants&#x2014;the hon. gentlemen on that side are, after all, very keen on adding dependants when it comes to the working out of benefits of their Bantustan policy&#x2014;then we arrive at a number of 50,000 Bantu who are dependent for their living on this industry. It goes even further than just the shortage due to the growers not planting pineapples, because these people are not fertilizing properly either. I can remember that the hon. the Deputy Minister said in a speech in this House last year that they could achieve magnificent results by proper fertilization practices. I agree with the hon. the Minister, but the farmers are not fertilizing properly because their financial position is such that they simply cannot afford to buy the fertilizer, not even at the present controlled prices. I want to illustrate by saying that there is one very large fertilizer firm, one of the big firms in the country, which reports that the sales of fertilizers have dropped by some R24,000 in the past 12 months. Hon. members opposite must not tell me that they can get loans for fertilizers; of course they can get it, but what these people need is medium term credit over a three-year period&#x2014;that is, the period it takes for the new pineapple plants to come into production. This is one of the things which I understand their local agricultural union had asked for when they gave evidence before the Marais Commission. Over and above all this, when it comes to marketing, the pineapple industry has to compete with imports coming in from Swaziland, which particularly affect the Zululand zone. I say this is a very sorry state of affairs indeed in an industry which can be put back onto its feet&#x2014;particularly taking into account the indications that the production in Hawaii, which is one of the main competitors of this country, may tail off some stage in the future. I hope the hon. Minister of Agriculture is going to take the first opportunity to give this industry assistance on its own merits, as is done to many other sectors of the agriculture. Before I leave the question of pineapples, I want to appeal once again to the hon. the Minister for Economic Affairs to review his refusal to offset the losses due to devaluation, which were suffered by the producers of fresh fruit.</p>

<p>I just want to draw the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention to the extremely serious position of the whole of the Eastern Cape, from a drought point of view. I welcome the statement he has made this afternoon. Although I sit on this side of the House, I want to say to him that that will be of great value in assisting the co-operatives to be able to finance the purchase of feed by their members. It is necessary that this should be done, because speculation is taking place in this country in the buying up of feed which could be used in a time of drought. I want to bring to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention that we welcome the extension of the veld reclamation scheme in the Karoo. Heaven knows, those people who were caught by rising production costs and low wool prices <span class="col_1123-1124" refersTo="page_0583"/>have had enough troubles. The whole of the Eastern Cape is caught by drought. If it rains now, the people in the sweet veld areas and the people in the Karoo at least have some hope for the winter. If it rains now in the high-lying areas of the Eastern Cape&#x2014;there are many of these mountainous areas where the altitude differs from 5,000 feet to 7,000 feet&#x2014;these people are only going to get water, which they need desperately, for their stock. At this stage of the year it is not going to bring them grazing to see them through the winter. The growing season is short. It is a season of about four months duration, namely from October to January. There will be a little bit of growth now, but this is the sixth year that those high-lying areas of the Eastern Cape have not had their normal spring rains, which are necessary for a growth flush. I want to make a special appeal to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture through the hon. the Deputy Minister to give very serious attention to the plight of these people. For their breeding stock, their ewes and lambs, their cows and calves and their other breeding stock, they rely normally on winter feeding to see them through. This year, in cases where they have been able to plough, they have not been able to sow any winter feeding at all. I am not exaggerating. The hon. the Deputy Minister can go and get reports from his officials in Queenstown, for example the head of the Region and he will see that that is the position. They deserve very special treatment indeed from the Government.</p>

<p>There is just one further point I want to raise in connection with this veld reclamation scheme and in connection with subsidies. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister why it is that no provision is made for the goat farmers of the country when it comes to subsidies and loans. The mohair industry in this country brings in considerable amounts of foreign exchange. You know too, Sir, that in recent years the Boer goats have gained standing in this country. It seems to me a complete anomaly that goats should be excluded and that these various provisions for loans and subsidies should only be applicable in the case of sheep and cattle. This is another thing which I think deserves the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one other matter in relation to the drought in the Eastern Cape that I want to touch on. I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that there is considerable confusion in this regard. I have a letter here which I am quite prepared to show him. There is considerable confusion as regards the application of the loan and subsidy schemes. There is confusion amongst the local committees. As a result, Sir, there are people who will not be able to get any further loans until the latter part of 1969 or 1970. I hope that this too is a matter to which the hon. the Deputy Minister will give his personal attention. I am quite prepared to make this letter available to him. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by congratulating the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture on the performance he put up when he spoke this afternoon. It is a long time ago in my parliamentary career that I last heard a speech that testified to so much honesty and dedication as radiated from the speech made by the Deputy Minister. I think that the farmers will find him an agricultural leader of stature as he develops in this Department. I find it a pity, however, that I cannot say the same of the shadow Minister of Agriculture. I am afraid that the hon. member for Newton Park tried to make too much political capital out of a difficult situation, as the hon. the Deputy Minister rightly pointed out. He made too few positive suggestions. The central idea expressed by both members on that side of the House who spoke about agriculture, namely the hon. member for Newton Park and the hon. member for Albany, was that agriculture was experiencing difficulties because we have a bad government in charge of agriculture at present. Let us assume that both statements are true, namely that agriculture is experiencing difficulties and that we have a bad government in charge of agriculture. If that is the case then I want to say that the whole of the Western world is going to rack and ruin, because then every modern country in the world has a rotten government. I want to quote to you what S. J. du Plessis said in <i>Agrekon</i> of October, 1968. Among others he quoted the writer Sundquist, who said that in 1964 there were 40 per cent fewer farms in the United States than there had been in 1949. Du Plessis also quotes a certain R. G. Lewis, who had the following to say in regard to the United States:</p>

<block name="quote">In 1960 there were 2,800,000 rural nonfarm families living in poverty with family incomes below 3,000 dollars per year, compared to 1,600,000 farm families living in poverty.</block>

<p>Du Plessis further quotes a Canadian report, which states in regard to that country:</p>

<block name="quote">The real income of the lower half of Canadian farmers has dropped to the point where about 175,000, out of the 470.000 total, live in conditions of poverty, near-poverty or general insecurity, with gross farm sales of less than 2,500 dollars a year.</block>

<p>In the same article Du Plessis quotes similar alarming figures in regard to Great Britain, Holland and France. I want to suggest that if we accept that there is a rotten government in every Western country in which agriculture is experiencing difficulties at present, then there is not one good Government in the whole of the Western world. That makes the supposition of hon. members on that side look very ridiculous.</p>

<p>I want to go further. The hon. member for Newton Park said that we were living in times <span class="col_1125-1126" refersTo="page_0584"/>of increasing production costs and decreasing prices. But this Government is not doing badly at all as far as this matter is concerned. If we take the basic figure for the years 1947-&#x2019;48 and 1949-&#x2019;50 as 100, the figure for all agricultural products for 1958-&#x2019;59 is 142, and the figure increased to 174 in 1967-&#x2019;68. The figure for all agricultural requirements over the same period was excellent. In 1958-&#x2019;59 the figure was 148, and in 1967-&#x2019;68 it was 172. The increase was therefore a smaller one than the increase in agricultural products.</p>
