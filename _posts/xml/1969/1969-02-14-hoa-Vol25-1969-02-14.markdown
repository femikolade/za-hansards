<question by="#bronkhorst" to="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<num>*1.</num>

<from>Brig. H. J. BRONKHORST (for Mrs. C. D. Taylor)</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Coloured Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any Coloured pensioners had their pension payments withdrawn by the Department during 1968; if so, how many;</li>

<li>(2) whether any such payments were subsequently renewed; if so, in how many<br/>cases;</li>

<li>(3) whether any applications for pensions were refused; if so, how many;</li>

<li>(4) (a) what are the main grounds for the withdrawal or withholding of pension payments and (b) by whom is the final decision made.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs" to="#bronkhorst">

<from>The MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1), (2) and (3) Yes. A statistical record of the desired particulars is, however, not maintained. Cases are dealt with on the individual files as they come up for attention. To extract the desired information from approximately 63,000 files which are kept at three different places, viz. Bellville, Wynberg and Cape Town, will take a considerable time which can hardly be justified in view of the present staff shortage.</li>

<li>(4) (a) The most common reasons for the withdrawal or withholding of social pensions are:

<ol>

<li><span class="col_0709-0710" refersTo="page_0374"/>(i) change of income or means;</li>

<li>(ii) change in the composition of the family unit;</li>

<li>(iii) change to an address which cannot be traced;</li>

<li>(iv) where beneficiaries are certified fit for work on the open labour market;</li>

<li>(v) abuse of pension moneys;</li>

<li>(vi) absence from the Republic for a period in excess of six months;</li>

<li>(vii) refusal to undergo medical treatment of a non-risk nature;</li>

<li>(viii) refusal of applicants/benificiaries to furnish the required information/documentary evidence;</li>

<li>(ix) where the income/assets of an applicant excludes him from the allocation of a pension.</li></ol></li>

<num>*4.</num>

<from>Mr. L. E. D. WINCHESTER</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) How many black spot removals are scheduled for 1969, (b) how many persons are affected, (c) from which areas will they be removed and (d) to which areas will they be moved.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education" to="#winchester">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION:</from>

<ol>

<li>(a) Removals of this nature require a large volume of preliminary work, particularly because efforts are always made to obtain the co-operation of the people concerned. Suitable compensatory land has to be obtained and the time for removals is influenced by local circumstances such as conditions of drought, the time of the year, etc. As prolonged negotiations are conducted in these matters it is for obvious reasons undesirable to make statements in this regard too far in advance, and it is therefore regretted that the particulars asked for cannot be furnished.</li>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="# bronkhorst">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE (for the Minister of Health):</from>

<ol>

<li>(a)

<ol>

<li>(i) 784 applications were received for drugs falling under the anti-bacterial group and which had already been on sale in the Republic before 5th January, 1969. This group is the first that was promulgated for registration. After an application has been received the applicant can continue with the sale of the drugs until the Council has finalised the application for registration.<br/>A further 71 applications were received for the registration of new drugs, which had not been available for sale before the 5th July, 1968, and which include practically all groups. These drugs must be registered before they can be sold.<br/>The total number of applications therefore amounts to 855.</li>

<li>(ii) Drugs which had already been for sale before the 5th January, 1969: 1.<br/>New drugs which have since the 5th July, 1968 become available for sale: 7.</li>

<heading>Navigational error on S.A.A. flight 474 from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg</heading>

<question by="#malan" to="#minister_of_transport">

<num>*9.</num>

<from>Mr. E. G. MALAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any cases of navigational errors due to negligence or oversight have occurred in connection with passenger flights of South African Airways since 1st January, 1968; if so, (a) on what dates and (b) what were the particulars posts did they occupy;</li>

<li>(2) whether the identity of the persons responsible was established; if so, what posts did they occupy?</li>

<li>(3) whether disciplinary steps have been taken; if so, what steps; if not, why not;</li>

<li>(4) whether steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence; if so, what steps; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes; one.

<ol>

<li>(a) 20th October, 1968.</li>

<li>(b) In preparing for the East London-Kimberley sector of Flight S.A. 474 from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg via East London and Kimberley, the First Officer on the Viscount aircraft which was used on the flight, inadvertently set up a compass heading of 084 degrees magnetic, which was in fact the course reflected on a pre-computed flight plan for the third sector of the flight, viz. from Kimberley to Johannesburg. The correct heading for the sector East London-Kimberley is 349 degrees magnetic. Neither the Captain nor the First Officer noticed the error until 1 hour 15 minutes had elapsed, but conditions at the time&#x2014;overcast skies with rain and darkness&#x2014;no doubt contributed to the fact that the error was not detected sooner.<br/>The course thus set took the aircraft out to sea to a position east south-east of Durban, at which point course was altered to land at Durban for refuelling. The flight then continued to Kimberley and Johannesburg.</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) Yes; those of Captain and First Officer.</li>

<li>(3) Yes; both officers were immediately grounded and, after an inquiry, the Captain was prematurely retired on pension and the First Officer was given the option of resigning, which he did.</li>

<li>(4) It is considered that the most practical and effective way to guard against a recurrence of such an incident is to continue to impress upon pilots the essential principles of instrument flying, among which compass headings are of fundamental importance. S.A.A. training procedures, therefore, strongly emphasise the different aspects of heading selection.<br/>The stern action taken against the officers concerned will, no doubt, serve as a deterrent to others.</li>

It should be mentioned, however, that the conditions of carriage under which this newsprint was transported stipulate that conveyance is entirely at the owner&#x2019;s risk, and the Administration does not, therefore, accept responsibility for losses which may be suffered.</li>

<from>The MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>In view of the fact that compulsory education for Indian children has not as yet been introduced, no statistics are available as to the potential school population of the Indian community.

In addition, 39 pupils attended the school for the blind, and 360 were enrolled in religious schools. At the M. L. Sultan Technical College 1,021 pupils were enrolled in secondary classes during 1968.</p>

<p>The total admission figures for all Indian Schools in Natal and the Transvaal for 1969 are not yet available as the initial returns by school principals for the current year are still being awaited.</p>

<li>(1) Whether the delay experienced by telephone users in making calls from Cape Town to Bloubergstrand and Melkbosstrand has been brought to his notice;</li>

<li>(2) when is it expected that direct dialling between Cape Town and (a) Bloubergstrand and (b) Melkbosstrand will be introduced.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs" to="#timoney">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. The delay occurred as a result of staff difficulties and heavy traffic, but has already been reduced and will be further reduced as newly appointed operating staff gain more experience and proficiency.</li>

<li>(2) (a) and (b) Direct trunk dialling facilities cannot be provided to manual exchanges that do not provide continuous service and as the exchanges concerned fall within this category, it will not be possible to extend this facility to them in the foreseeable future. In the meantime steps will be taken to ensure that calls to and from these centres are switched through with the least possible delay.</li>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_0749-0750" refersTo="page_0394"/>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This is a short Bill which, as hon. members can see, does not contain far-reaching amendments. The amendments contained in the first two clauses merely give effect to the letter and spirit of the provisions of section 20 (3) of the Prisons Act, 1959, which provides that any reference in any law to a &#x201C;gaol&#x201D; or to a &#x201C;prison or gaol&#x201D; or to a &#x201C;prison and gaol&#x201D; must be read as referring to a &#x201C;prison&#x201D;.</p>

<p>At first sight it would appear as though clause 3 of the Bill introduces something new as far as the territorial jurisdiction of magistrates&#x2019; courts in summary trials is concerned. On the one hand this is the case, but on the other hand the amendment is necessary purely for the purpose of eliminating an existing anomaly between the provisions of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act and those of the Criminal Procedure Act.</p>

<p>Section 58 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955 (which provides in what magisterial district a preliminary examination is to be held when an offence is committed on the boundary or boundaries of districts or on any journey) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where an offence is committed in or upon any vehicle employed on any journey or on board any vessel employed on any voyage within the territorial waters of the Republic, or on a journey upon any river within or forming the boundary of any part of the Republic, the preparatory examination may be held in any magisterial district through the territorial water adjoining which, or through any part thereof or on or within the distance of two miles beyond the boundary whereof such vehicle or vessel has passed in the course of the journey or voyage during which the offence was committed.</block>

<p>From this it appears, <i>inter alia,</i> that a magistrate&#x2019;s court is competent to hold a preliminary examination in respect of an offence committed in the territorial waters of the Republic. However, if we have regard to the provisions of section 90 of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act, 1944 (which defines the territorial jurisdiction of the court of a district or regional division), we find that in summary trials the territorial jurisdiction of a magistrate&#x2019;s court is more restrictive than it is in the case of preliminary examinations. By virtue of the provisions of section 90 (2) of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act (as quoted in full in clause 3 of the Bill), it appears that a magistrate&#x2019;s court does not have jurisdiction in summary trials relating to offences committed in that part of the territorial waters of the Republic which is more than two miles away from the coastline, unless the particular vessel on board which the imputed offence was committed, was performing a journey within the distance of two miles of that district or of that regional division. If the vessel concerned did not perform that journey within the distance of two miles of the district, the magistrate&#x2019;s court does not have summary jurisdiction to try offences. Accordingly the amendments proposed in clause 3 are aimed at extending the summary jurisdiction of magistrates, as far as the territorial waters are concerned, in order that those courts may, just as it is in the case of preliminary examinations, have jurisdiction relating to offences committed in the territorial waters at a distance of more than two miles away from the coastline.</p>

<p>The amendment proposed in clause 4 does in fact not introduce something new as regards the kind of sentences which are imposed by a magistrate&#x2019;s court and are subject to review by a court of appeal or one of the Judges thereof. The Judge President of the Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court pointed out that section 96 of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act did possibly not give effect to the actual intention of the legislator. Section 344 <i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that whipping may only be imposed by an inferior court in the case of a conviction for robbery or rape, culpable homicide, breaking or entering any premises, a statutory offence for which a whipping may be imposed, and so forth. Such punishment may also be inflicted on a minor in addition to, or in substitution for, any other punishment. In terms of section 345 of that Act the court which convicts a minor way, in lieu of any other punishment and, as well in the case of a first conviction as of any subsequent conviction, sentence such a minor to receive a moderate correction of whipping.</p>

<p>Before 1959 section 344 <i>bis</i> formed part of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act as section 92 (3). Whipping imposed in terms of the latter section was reviewable by virtue of the provisions of section 96 of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act. The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1959, whereby various amendments relating to Criminal Law were effected, subsequently enacted section 92 (3) of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act as section 344 <i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act. By virtue of the provisions of section 96 of the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act sentences of whippings imposed in terms of section 344 <i>bis</i> on minors were, strictly speaking, no longer reviewable, as section 96 still exempted from review all forms of corporal punishment relating to minors, imposed in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act. This appears to have been an oversight. It was ascertained that in practice magistrates still continued to refer any sentence of corporal punishment imposed on a minor, other than corporal punishment in terms of section 345 of the Criminal Procedure Act, to the court of appeal for review. The amendment proposed in clause 4 now restores the legal position in regard to the review-ability of sentences of corporal punishment as far as minors are concerned, to what it was before 1959 and as it is still being applied in practice, by providing explicitly that only corporal punishment imposed on a minor in terms of section 345 of the Criminal Procedure Act, is not subject to review.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members will recall that when the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Bill&#x2014;now the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act, 1967 (Act No. 78 of 1967), whereby nearly 700 laws that no longer served a useful purpose were repealed&#x2014;was introduced year before last, I informed this House at the Second Reading of that Bill that the Government had decided that the Pre-Union laws had to be revised and that those statutory provisions which had in the meantime lost their usefulness had to be repealed. At the time I also said that those statutory provisions which still served a useful purpose and could suitably be incorporated with existing legislation, had to be so incorporated and that the rest had to be adapted to present needs and re-enacted. The measure before the House at the moment is merely a result of that decision. In point of fact, several pre-Union statutory provisions, in addition to the nearly 700 repealed by the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act alone, have already been repealed or incorporated with existing laws or adapted to present needs and reenacted. One merely has to page through the statutes of the past few years to appreciate what has already been done in this regard. I do not wish to tire you, Sir, with a long list of details, but in passing mention can be made in this regard of the Civil Proceedings Evidence Act, the Arbitration Act, the Admission of Advocates Act, and so forth. Hardly a single session passes without some pre-Union law or other being deleted from the old Statute Books. Only last year there were, as far as could be ascertained, eight pre-Union laws that were repealed, one of which was a proclamation issued by Sir John Cradock and dating back to the year 1813. If hon. members would look at the schedule to this Bill, they would see that in each of the four provinces there is a pre-Union law in regard to disguises. However, those provisions are of a divergent nature and it is necessary, particularly since we are dealing with offences here, to have uniformity in this regard. In the Cape Province, for instance, it is an offence if&#x2014;to quote the words used in the section in question&#x2014;&#x201C;any person [is] found by night, having his face blackened or wearing felt or other slippers, or being dressed or otherwise disguised with a criminal intent&#x201D;. The Free State provision agrees with this word for word. In Natal it is explicitly provided that it is an offence for a male to be dressed as a female and to be found in circumstances suggesting a probable intention to commit an offence, irrespective of whether the intended offence is known. In the Transvaal the wearing of masks, false beards or other means whereby a disguise is effected in public roads or public places is forbidden. However, disguises at stage productions, a masked ball or similar places to which the public has access, are excluded from these provisions. In that province it is also an offence to disguise one&#x2019;s face or person with the intention of breaking into any premises or dwelling in order to commit an offence there. The punishments prescribed in terms of these laws also vary considerably.</p>

<p>It will be noticed, therefore, that in the Cape and in the Free State it is an offence if the disguise is effected at night by any person, i.e. male as well as female; in the Transvaal it is prohibited for any person to wear masks, false beards and other means whereby disguises may be effected, with specific exceptions, whereas in Natal it is an offence for a man to dress up as a woman for the purpose of committing an offence. It stands to reason that such divergent differences in regard to one and the same subject are not desirable, and in this Bill uniformity is now being effected.</p>

<p>In terms of the existing provisions the onus rests on the State to prove that the disguise was used with criminal intent, where this is set as a requirement. It will have to be conceded that this is a very difficult&#x2014;if not an impossible one in most cases&#x2014;onus of proof which rests on the State. This may also be the reason why there have only been, as far as could be ascertained, very few reported cases in regard to these provisions. That is why the onus of proof is, in terms of clause 1 of this Bill, being placed on the accused, after the State has proved that such person was found in circumstances from which it may reasonably be inferred that he probably had the intention of committing some offence or other, to prove that when he was so found he had no such intention. This is not an unreasonable onus of proof and the accused, who knows better than anybody else why he has effected some disguise or other, ought to find it easy, if his intentions were in fact innocent, to acquit himself of the onus of proof. By virtue of our judicial system he will only be able to acquit himself of the onus of proof on a preponderance of probabilities. In the case of the objective contemplated in this legislation, it is not unreasonable to place on the accused the onus of proof in regard to an evil intention. Nobody would dream of taking steps where on the face of it the intention with the disguise is an innocent one, such as when a group of young men play a few pranks on Guy Fawkes Day or in the course of a concert or a theatrical production. Only disguises under suspicious circumstances can provoke steps.</p>

<p><span class="col_0753-0754" refersTo="page_0396"/>For the information of our Natal friends we may mention that, although in this respect Natal is different from the other provinces in that it does apparently not have prohibitions relating to females disguising themselves with some criminal intent or other, the Natal provision mentioned in the schedule to the Bill was nevertheless used as an example in that certain principles contained therein are reflected in clause 1 of the Bill. Section 6 (2) (e) of Act No. 10 of 1910 of Natal provides that it is an offence &#x201C;(In the case of a male person) [to be] found dressed as a woman in circumstances indicating a probable intention of availing himself of such disguise in order to commit a crime, whether such intended crime be known or not&#x201D;. This is the Natal provision. Hon. members will therefore see that the principle in clause 1 (1) of the present Bill, i.e. that any person found disguised in circumstances from which it may reasonably be inferred that such person probably has the intention of committing some offence or other, has been borrowed from the Natal provision. But the provision &#x201C;whether such intended crime be known or not&#x201D; is also being reflected in the Bill, i.e. in clause 1 (2). It will have to be conceded that this provision is essential, otherwise it will be impossible for the State if it has to prove that the accused had the intention of committing a particular offence. By clause 1 (2) the State is therefore being exempted from having to allege or to prove that the accused had such an intention.</p>

<p>The rest of the Bill is self-evident.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has indicated that the real intention of the Bill is to bring about uniformity in the laws relating to the question of disguising oneself in certain circumstances, and of course the Bill does achieve that. I would not say that it is a Bill which consolidates the position in any way, because what is provided for in this Bill is very different and much wider than any of the laws contained in the pre-Union legislation which is here repealed.</p>

<p>Sir, those who made the laws in the last century had a certain wisdom when they made their legislation. One finds, for example, that in the Natal law which the hon. the Minister quoted, it was made very clear what the offence was. It says there that, that in the case of a male person being found dressed as a woman in circumstances indicating a probable intention of availing himself of such disguise in order to commit an offence, it is considered an offence. In other words, the exact position was stated. Now that has been repealed. In the Cape law on this matter it is also quite clear what they were getting at. It was directed against people who might be intent upon housebreaking. Therefore the law stated: &#x201C;Any person found by night having his face blackened or wearing felt or other slippers or being dressed or otherwise disguised with a criminal intent&#x201D; was guilty of an offence. One finds also in the case of the Transvaal law that the position was made very clear. It stated: &#x201C;The wearing or use of masks, false beards or other means whereby disguise is effected in public roads or other public places is forbidden&#x201D;. In terms of that law, it is clear what may not be done. It goes on, however, to provide that disguises at theatrical performances or other diversions and the holding of masked balls at places accessible to the public, shall not fall under the law. I do not go to that many balls, Sir, but I do not think that we have masked balls any more. At any rate, masked balls were specifically provided for. One knew just where one stood. [Interjection.] No, one did not know where one stood at the masked ball, but at least one knew that one had not committed an offence by attending a masked ball. Then it was provided that one could go disguised into a public street, as part of a procession, for example when one took part in what the Americans would call a parade.</p>

<p>The language of the Bill leaves a lot to be desired. In Gilbert and Sullivan&#x2019;s &#x201C;Trial by Jury&#x201D; there is a wonderful little ditty. It goes something like this:</p>

<block name="quote">I am the Parliamentary draftsman, I make the country&#x2019;s laws, and of half the litigation I am undoubtedly the cause.</block>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, in my other capacity as a lawyer, I can only say that I am delighted with this Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, I wonder whether this Bill was shown to either representatives of the Bar or representatives of the Side Bar before it was brought here. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can indicate whether it was or not. I think it is very important that a Bill such as this should in fact go to such bodies who have experience of the difficulties attaching to provisions like this, and who have experience of the difficulties in relation to the language which is used here, when it comes to determining in court whether someone is guilty or not guilty of the offence which is mentioned here. The question as to whether it may reasonably be inferred that a person probably had an intention, is a difficult question for a <span class="col_0755-0756" refersTo="page_0397"/>court to decide. If it is merely that it may reasonably be inferred that he had an intention of committing an offence, then this is an objective test which the court will apply. The court will decide the case using the usual standards, in the same way as one determines anything merely by inference. Of necessity, the intention must be inferred from the facts that there are. When a court looks at a matter, it looks at that matter in accordance with certain rules. It weighs the evidence and says: Is this intention consistent with all the proved facts, or is it not inconsistent with all the proved facts? Sir, what does a policeman do? He does not do this at all, obviously. He looks at something and says: I think it might reasonably be inferred that a person will probably commit an offence. That is one thing, but to say that he will commit an offence, is another thing. However, to say that it may reasonably be inferred that such a person is probably going to commit an offence is going to cause a lot of difficulty. I really think so. I wonder whether this Bill is not going to cause the taxpayer to have to cough up quite a lot of money because of wrongful arrests. This sort of language invites all sorts of speculative action on the part of those who have the authority to arrest.</p>

<p>I notice from clause 3 that this measure is to be applied in other parts. If this is a real problem in those areas, and the hon. the Minister is frank with us, we shall have no difficulty in giving him our support in that regard.</p>

<p>What does &#x201C;disguise&#x201D; mean? This is another difficulty with regard to this Bill. There is no definition of a disguise. What one does when one wants to know what the meaning of a word is, of course, is to look it up in the Oxford English dictionary. The definition of the transitive verb &#x201C;disguise&#x201D; reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Conceal identity of (oneself, person or thing, as someone or something else &#x2026;</block>

<p>This happens all the time.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; by doing, with false beard etc., in costume etc.) &#x2026;</block>

<p>One wonders how many people are, in fact, disguised in this world in terms of this Bill, although not necessarily exhibiting to someone watching an intention of committing an offence.</p>

I do not know whether they do in fact wear hoods. As I have said, the language is very, very wide.

It stipulates furthermore &#x201C;use of changed dress or appearance for concealment&#x2019;s sake&#x201D;. One can, in fact, do any of these things for a purpose, to conceal the real position. I appreciate that no policeman under normal circumstances would consider that this might be so, because he would not be looking in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> and wondering about the extent of this provision.

<p>The position before was that this is what most of the legislation got at, namely people who blacken their faces by night. Is that not much easier to understand, if that is what we are after? I do not know what the hon. the Minister has in mind in this regard at all. I do not know what sort of offences the hon. the Minister is wanting to get at. It is quite clear that the old legislation, which is hereby being repealed, aimed at housebreakers, people wandering around in felt slippers by night, blackening their faces, and so on. This provision is set out so vaguely that one does not really understand what the hon. the Minister is after. If he could tell us, I am sure that we might possibly find a better wording, so as to make it clear what the intention is. I do not like the use of the word &#x201C;probable&#x201D; with the words &#x201C;may reasonably be inferred that such person had the intention of committing an offence&#x201D;. &#x201C;That such person probably has the intention&#x201D; is a very difficult matter to decide. The objective test of whether he had the intention is one thing. The test as to whether he &#x201C;probably&#x201D; had the intention, is however going to be a very difficult matter for any court to decide, because it introduces a subjective element. In other words, it is not now an objective test, something the court can determine from those circumstances that it is reasonable to infer that he had the intention of committing an offence. It is now a case of whether it is reasonable to say, under those circumstances, that he probably had that intention. If one is, in fact, arrested wrongly&#x2014;I think it is very feasible that this might happen under these circumstances&#x2014;by some zealous person, anxious to see that this law is carried out, and he then brings an action against the hon. the Minister for wrongful arrest, what is going to happen? I do not think that the wording of this clause is going to help the taxpayer very much in a civil action, because it seems to me that he might have to pay up. The question is: What is probable, and what is not probable, and who determines whether it is probable? Is it an objective test or a subjective one?</p>

<p>I appreciate that, when it comes to arrests of this sort, a man can act according to his powers. If he thinks it might reasonably be inferred that it is probable, he is entitled to act. But so often the position is that those same circumstances do not give rise to the same opinion in the mind of a Judge as they do in the mind of a police constable. I think here lies another source, another area, for difficulty or wrongful arrest and for civil actions against the Minister, and therefore against the taxpayer for wrongful arrest. But this is something with which we can deal further in the Committee Stage. I am sure that all those who may want to know whether they may disguise themselves will be pleased to know that they can at least now find what they may and may not do embodied in a law of Parliament. However, I doubt whether they will find much comfort from this law when they look at it but they will, as I have said, at least know where they stand.</p>

<p>At this stage we do not offer any objection to the principle of the Bill. We have suggestions to offer for its improvement but those we shall bring forward during the Committee Stage. I hope all hon. members attached to the legal profession will apply their minds to the ways in which this Bill may be improved. This is not an easy matter. Therefore we wish the hon. the Minister luck with this Bill although we foresee that under the present wording he is going to be faced with more difficulties than success.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) wants to know whether the legal profession was consulted in regard to this Bill. My reply to that is that this Bill was neither submitted to the Association of Law Societies, nor to the Bar Council. It is not an absolute practice for all legislation to be submitted to the legal profession. As regards South-West, I want to say that South-West was in fact consulted and raised no objections. They gave no indication of their having some specific difficulty or other.</p>

<p>As far as the rest of the hon. member for Durban (North&#x2019;s) argumentation is concerned, I may just say that the position is as I explained it. An attempt is being made at either consolidating and adapting or repealing all pre-Union legislation. This is one of those cases where we did not simply want to regard legislation which is connected with it as no longer serving any useful purpose and consequently to repeal it. Hence this attempt at substituting something for it. What was done subsequently, was to take the best features from the pre-<span class="col_0759-0760" refersTo="page_0399"/>Union legislation. The Department arrived at the conclusion, and I am in agreement with it, that the pre-Union legislation was entirely ineffective, except for that of Natal from which we derived the greatest benefit.</p>

<p>It is, of course, very interesting to speculate on when a person is in fact in disguise and when there is the intention, or the probability of an intention, to undertake something. But, after all, these things do work out differently in practice. A policeman is, as a rule, a reasonable person, and if he were to catch someone at night in the vicinity of a ladies&#x2019; hostel&#x2014;a person who is disguised in some way or other, be it effectively or ineffectively, and moving about stealthily in the shadows&#x2014;a reasonable person would after all be able to infer that that person probably has the intention up his sleeve of doing something of a criminal nature. Under these circumstances a policeman will, in terms of the Bill, be able to arrest such a person, to charge him and to summon him to appear before the court. It therefore remains for the court to decide how the land lies. In my introductory speech I pointed out that the onus of proof resting on such an arrested person, is not a difficult one. After all is said and done, it is merely a preponderance of possibilities or of probabilities. If such an arrested person did in actual fact have no ulterior motives, it ought to be very easy for him to prove to the court why he had been at that particular place, at that particular moment and under those particular circumstances. He may, for instance, have been on his way home from a masked ball and, as the light was too bright for his eyes, he moved along in the shadows. It is then up to the court to believe him or not. In any event, this is an honest attempt at obtaining legislation in regard to a matter which is worth trying to combat. But if the hon. member could suggest something better to us during the Committee Stage, we shall welcome it. However, I am satisfied with the Bill as it reads at present.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill provides for the establishment of a joint pension fund for teachers, officials and other employees of various categories in the permanent employ of the provincial administrations and the Administration of South-West Africa. After negotiations between the Administrations and the Government and in consequence of an instruction from the Cabinet and in consultation with the Administrations, a joint pension scheme for the above-mentioned staff was devised which will replace the 11 existing pension funds and which (a) falls under the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions and is to be administered centrally by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, and (b) corresponds as far as possible with the Government Service Pension Fund in respect of membership contributions, conditions and pension benefits.</p>

<p>Although the new fund will be controlled by the Government, provision is made under clause 7 (1) and (3) for the Administrations to be consulted in regard to contribution rates, conditions and benefits. However, the Bill makes no specific provision for consultation of representative staff organizations, and in terms of clause 11 statutory bodies at present serving this purpose are disbanded. Contact with such organizations is nevertheless considered desirable for the success of a pension scheme and will, according to the practice of the Department be promoted where necessary on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and without proceeding through statutory channels. As soon as the proposed pension fund is established, the existing funds will stop functioning and the new fund which will carry on their business will take over all their assets and liabilities. In this connection I refer hon. members to the provisions of clauses 2, 3 and 12. Some of the existing funds are actuarially sound on the basis of their present contributions and benefits, while others show actuarial deficits. These deficits will be taken over by the new fund.</p>

<p>Apart from this, the adjustment of the new scheme to the pattern of the Government Service Pension Fund will cause the present contribution rates of virtually all members to be lowered, while at the same time the benefits will be improved as compared with those offered by the existing funds. This points to the likelihood of a further actuarial deficit. Provision is therefore being made in clause 7 (2) (e) and (h) of the Bill and in the draft regulations for negotiations in regard to making good these deficits in order to place the new fund on a sound footing.</p>

<p>Under clause 4 (1) and (2) all staff in permanent employ who were members of an existing fund on the day before the coming into operation of this measure, or such staff as are appointed after that date, will become members of the new fund without any option. To the member who thinks that the introduction of the new conditions and benefits is not in his interest, however, clause 6 offers an opportunity to elect, within a specified period, to return to the benefits, conditions and contribution rate of his previous pension scheme while remaining a member of the new fund&#x2014;in other words, his benefits will be paid out of the new fund, but calculated on the old basis. This amendment, in my opinion, is a great improvement on the situation we so often find in connection with pension funds. Where members are given a choice of either the old or the new fund it happens time and again <span class="col_0761-0762" refersTo="page_0400"/>that some of those members subsequently approach the Select Committee to ask that their original choice be changed. The position under this legislation will be that everyone will go over to the new fund. Those who object to doing so, must, within a certain period, apply for readmission to the old fund. Now, as I have said, I think that this is an improvement on the existing situation.</p>

<p>All pensionable service under an existing fund will be recognized as pensionable service under the new arrangement. In terms of clause 5 the pensionable age for all male and female members is put at 60 years, but the retirement age may be prescribed within the limits of 55 and 65 years by the employer concerned.</p>

<p>As in the case of the Government Service Pension Fund male as well as female members will contribute at the rate of 4 per cent of their pensionable income.</p>

<p>As I said at the commencement, the new fund had to be designed in such a way as to correspond as closely as possible with the Government Service Pension Fund, and as far as the benefits offered by the new fund are concerned, I therefore want to say no more than that they are virtually identical to those of the Government Service Pension Fund.</p>

<p>The moneys of the Pension Fund will be deposited with the Treasury and will be invested in Government stock by the Public Debt Commissioners.</p>

<p>In conclusion I may mention that the scheme will be embodied in regulations which will be promulgated in terms of clause 7 of the Bill, and these regulations will before being promulgated, be referred to the quarters concerned for comment.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of details in connection with this Bill which we can, in my opinion, deal with more effectively in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House intend to give our support to the Second Reading of this Bill. However, before making certain comments on the Bill I would like to express our congratulations to the hon. the Minister. I believe this is the first occasion on which he has had to introduce legislation in this House as a Minister. We realize that his task is not an easy one and that he has a tremendous responsibility towards a large group of persons, including the civil pensioners, and therefore I think it is fitting that the first Bill introduced by this new Minister should be a constructive Bill which is designed to improve the conditions of a section of the pensioners of South Africa. We wish him well in the task that lies before him.</p>

<p>We realize that the Bill before us is undoubtedly an improvement as far as the administration of pension funds is concerned. We know that the provinces have experienced difficulties from time to time, but we realize that the Government Service Pension Fund is regarded as the basis for civil pensions. When we look at the preamble to this Bill, we see that the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions will be responsible for the establishment, control and administration of this central fund. Here I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is satisfied that the staff position in his Department is such that they will be able to cope with the necessary additional administrative work which will be involved in controlling and administering this fund. We know that there is a Government Pension Fund Division within his Department which administers the four main funds which are administered by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. It is obvious that with the passing of this measure a good deal of administrative work will have to be undertaken by his Department. The Department will have the benefit of the computer and other modern means of administration but you still require personnel to undertake the necessary programme of work.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister has referred to the 11 funds&#x2014;mainly teachers&#x2019; funds and the hospital funds of the various provinces which are defined in the first clause of the Bill. Clause 2, which deals with the establishment of the Fund, provides that the assets of all the pension funds mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (h) of clause 1, shall be transferred to the Fund. As far as the 11 funds under the definition of &#x201C;Provincial or the Territory Pension Fund&#x201D; are concerned, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister why the last three, the Hospital Officials&#x2019; Pension Fund of the Orange Free State, the Administration Employees&#x2019; Pension Fund of the Territory of South-West Africa, and the South-West Africa Teachers&#x2019; Pension Fund are not included in subclause (2) of clause 2 in terms of which the assets of certain pension funds are to be transferred to the Fund.</p>

<p>The question of transferability from various departments is, of course, a matter which has been before the Select Committee on Pensions from time to time where people have petitioned Parliament for the condonation of breaks in their service. It is noted that provision will be made under the regulations for the transfer of funds as far as members are concerned. I believe that an important principle is involved here. We have had occasion in the past to study various reports concerning the transferability of pension funds, and we realize that there are unfortunately large numbers of people who do not regard a pension fund as a fund for their retirement, but merely as a sort of savings fund and often resign in order to obtain immediate benefits.</p>

<p>Sir, there are certain other aspects of this Bill on which we hope to obtain greater clarity in the Committee Stage. The question of pensionable age is another matter which exercises the minds of many people. Under present-day conditions, with the advancement of medical science, a pensionable age of 60 is regarded as very low indeed. Although provision is made that the pensionable age may vary between <span class="col_0763-0764" refersTo="page_0401"/>55 and 65, &#x201C;pensionable age&#x201D; is defined in the Bill as 60 years. I would like to stress that under present-day conditions a pensionable age of 60 does appear to be low, and I would ask the hon. the Minister to give his attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, in introducing the Bill, referred to clause 7, which deals with regulations. Provision is made here that the Minister may, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and after consultation with the Administrators of the provinces and the Administrator of the Territory, make regulations. Obviously the provinces are vitally interested in the pension funds of their employees. Although the word &#x201C;Administrator&#x201D; is not defined in the Bill, I assume that the hon. the Minister means the &#x201C;Administrator-in-Executive&#x201D;. Obviously the executive committees of the provinces concerned must also have an opportunity to consider these regulations, since these funds will be administered mainly by regulations. The regulations cover a wide field; they cover all aspects of the administration of the Fund. I mention this point because in subclause (3) of clause 7 provision is made for the big stick to be used if there should be any difficulty as far as the provinces are concerned. Subclause (3) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister and the Administrator of any province or of the Territory have, after consultation in terms of subsection (1), failed to agree on any matter referred to in subsection (1) or (2), the decision of the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance in regard to such matter shall be final.</block>

<p>It is hoped that the provision to the effect that the regulations will be promulgated after consultation with the Administrator, means that there will be consultation with the Administrator-in-Executive, so that the Executive in each province will have an opportunity carefully to study and peruse the regulations under which the Fund will be administered. The establishment of the fund in principle we believe will facilitate smoother administration in regard to the provincial employees who belong to the other funds. We believe it is in the interests of good administration that this fund should be closely aligned to the administration of the Government Service Pension Fund, and we assume that it will fall under the supervision of the Minister so that this certain degree of uniformity will exist between provincial employees and those who are also provincial employees but fall under the Government Service Pension Fund and will be dealt with on more or less the same basis. We have pleasure in supporting the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>We are glad that this measure has the support of the Opposition.

We also believe that there is no danger of anyone being adversely affected by the new measures now being proposed here.</p>

<p>As regards the regulations, we also believe that the provision being made for consultation with the Administrations and the other bodies ensures that matters may be expedited and that the matter will not have to be referred back to this House every time for new legislation to be passed, but that the Minister will be able to eliminate hitches immediately by means of regulations.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the introductory remarks of the hon. member for Umbilo in congratulating the hon. the Minister on the introduction of his first Bill in this House. He has taken over a very important portfolio. It is important because it is a portfolio that gives him an opportunity for creative legislation. There are portfolios where Ministers carry on as they have carried on for years and years, but this one, in these modern times, gives an opportunity for creative legislation. This is, I am bound to say, a Bill that we can support, because it introduces a measure of rationalization. Instead of having a number of funds in the country for civil servants in various departments, the hon. the Minister comes along and says we will now have one fund; we will rationalize it, and civil servants in all the provinces will be treated in the same way.</p>

<p>When I say it is a good Bill, I mean it is good because in the past these various funds had, as the hon. the Minister said in his introductory speech, varying fortunes. There are some that are stable and others which in the past have been almost bankrupt. I remember once discussing funds in this House when one fund had a deficiency of R3.6 million and another had a deficiency of almost R8 million. It is almost incredible, but there you are. If you establish a pension fund, it is a financial fund. Of course there is the other side of the fund which was dealt with by my colleague and that is the interests of the men concerned. Hon. members know what my views are in a previous debate. We are now speaking about the establishment of a new fund, and I want to give some suggestions to the hon. the Minister on how he should proceed in the future, not only with this fund but with any pension fund he has to establish. We are establishing one fund to take over funds, and the question I wish to put is this: Why should we have funds at all? A fund is a survival of colonial government. When men went from one colonial government to another, they were not satisfied that the colony would survive as their own country would survive, and therefore funds were established so that their future <span class="col_0765-0766" refersTo="page_0402"/>would be assured and their pensions would be assured. But where you have an organization and especially a government which is so powerful that there is no possibility that in the future it will not survive, this form of pension fund is out-dated. The correct form of pension fund is a non-contributory pension fund. I am now speaking of modern countries, where there is no such thing as a contributory pension fund.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned 4 per cent. Why should we have 4 per cent or any other percentage? When I introduced the debate concerned some years ago we discussed this question of a non-contributory pension fund for the State, and it was pointed out that the employees might not like this fund. Well, well! Three years later the employees, at the most recent Public Servants&#x2019; Conference that I know of, discussed this among other things. They said they would agree with the Government; they did not wish to have increases in salary, but they wished to have certain fringe benefits. They mentioned subsidies on housing, that the vacation bonus should be increased and that the medical fund contributions should be reduced, etc. But the most important was in regard to the pension fund. They said that the Government should take over at least 50 per cent of their contributions to the fund. In other words, they had come more than halfway to meet my point of view. Now, whether the hon. the Minister can refer this Bill to his experts to see whether it is possible at this stage in the establishment of a fund (because that is what we are debating) to go for the noncontributory form of fund, I do not know. But we shall have to do it some day. The big banks are doing it to-day, other big organizations are doing it, and the biggest organization in South Africa, the Government, is hesitant.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I went into it when I introduced the motion. I referred to banks in South Africa. The British Civil Service have a non-contributory pension fund. What are we doing in a contributory fund? We take 4 per cent or 5 per cent from the civil servant and the Government adds another 5 per cent, making 10 per cent, and they put it into a fund. You need a staff to do all these things; and then they keep records of how much each man has contributed. That is all unnecessary. With a non-contributory fund you keep a record of the man&#x2019;s service. When I was a child we used to have naval pensioners. You said to a man in the Navy: If you serve for 20 years or 25 years you will get a pension. Fancy saying to a South African to-day, who is doing duty up on the border: Here is your pay, but we have taken off 5 per cent to put into a fund and we are adding 5 per cent. We should not do that. We should say to a soldier that if he serves for a certain number of years he will get a pension. And the British Civil Service get a very liberal pension [Interjection.]</p>

<p>Now I should like to say a word about the Bill before us. There are three clauses I wish to refer to, clause 2, clause 3 and clause 7. The Minister has mentioned the important clauses. In terms of clause 2, the new Fund will take over the assets of the funds existing to-day. When I heard that I wondered whether there were just assets in these funds to-day, but in terms of clause 3 we will also take over the liabilities of these funds. All that is being taken over. It is a big take-over bid and that is the modern thing in business to-day. If you look at the Stock Exchange lists you see many take-over bids. Now we are taking them over, and I say to the hon. the Minister: Let us have some rationalization. There are 11 existing funds and here we are establishing one fund to take them all over. Why not appoint a commission now and ask the civil servants, the employees, to co-operate and investigate the possibility of introducing now for all these people who are coming in, a non-contributory fund? The ideal time to have done it, and I suggest it to the Minister of the day, was when they were contemplating increased salaries. When they did increase salaries, it would have been quite easy to say that part of the increase in salary would be the abolition of contributions to pension funds. Bookkeeping would be reduced, because it is purely accounting. My hon. colleague will deal with all the other aspects of pension funds: How old men should be treated; how they live in their old age, what provision should be made for women; especially when they are married; what dowry they are given when they leave the service. All that must be considered, but that is the personal side. I am speaking purely of the financial side.</p>

<p>I congratulate the Minister and I hope that now that we have got on to the right wavelength, we shall be able to do something in the future. The old fund system is colonial; I want a good South African non-contributory scheme.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place, I want to express my sincere thanks to the two Opposition members who congratulated me on my appointment to this post. I want to assure them at once that I adopt a serious attitude in regard to this matter and the Department entrusted to me and that I shall devote my best energies to dealing successfully with these particular matters as far as it is within my power to do so. I am grateful for the kind expression of good wishes and for the assistance I have received from those hon. members.</p>

<p>In reply to the debate, I just want to repeat what I said in my Second Reading speech, namely that the majority of these matters can be dealt with more easily in the Committee Stage, when I should like to reconsider the various clauses.</p>

<p>As regard the position of staff, negotiations are being entered into and agreement is being <span class="col_0767-0768" refersTo="page_0403"/>reached with the Administrations to ensure that in respect of staff transfers it will be possible to obtain the necessary staff for my Department to deal with this matter. I expect that manpower will be saved in that way and that we shall be able to deal with this matter by reaching an agreement in regard thereto.</p>

<p>The reason why the three funds mentioned here by the hon. member, namely the Hospital Officials&#x2019; Pension Fund of the Free State, the Administration Employees&#x2019; Pension Fund in South-West Africa and the South-West Africa Teachers&#x2019; Pension Fund, are not mentioned in clause 2 among the funds mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (b) of clause 1 (xiv), is simply that in this clause the assets to be taken over from funds are mentioned. Those three funds have no assets, and for that reason they have been omitted.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo put a few questions in connection with the retirement age. As has been announced, it is the aim that these funds should be placed on the same basis as the Government Service Pension Fund as far as possible. As regards the latter, the present position is that the retirement age is 60 years, with a margin of 55 to 65. This affords the employer the choice of keeping an employee in service up to the age of 65 years or not. This principle has always been accepted, and at this stage I have not felt it necessary to change it. For that reason the age limit applicable to the other pension funds is brought into line with this. The whole matter may perhaps be considered at a later stage and everybody will then have to be treated on the same basis. However, I do not think I should introduce a radical change in respect of these funds at this stage. I first have to combine the two funds as they should be.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to consultation with the Administrator. This automatically means the Administrator-in-Executive Committee. It is accepted like that. In other words, the legal provision does exist. However, the hon. member will grant me this, that when a difference of opinion arises and a deadlock is reached in regard to some matter or other, somebody must have the power to decide and to accept the responsibility. That is why this clause has to be inserted in terms of which the responsibility is placed on the Minister to make the final decision in this connection in consultation with the Minister of Finance, who has to deal with the financial implications. I want to say at once that one does not exercise that power gladly or without sound reason. One also has to bear in mind the interests of the various officials, but the fact remains that we should have the opportunity in this case of having a final decision taken by some person, who will then in the last resort be responsible for it.</p>

<p>I should like to thank the hon. member for Westdene for giving this matter his support. One is always grateful when a person such as he, who has special knowledge of this matter, participates in the debate and that we can make use of his special knowledge.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Kensington, I just want to say that I find it very pleasant to cross swords with him in this particular field, because we had to face each other so often in the past on educational matters when we acted as the chairmen of our respective groups Where both of us are now finding ourselves in a different field, I want to tell the hon. member that, as regards the idea of a non-contributory pension scheme, he is quite right in that such schemes do exist in certain countries. I also want to say at once that I am, personally, not completely opposed to the idea. It is still felt at present&#x2014;and I think it is right&#x2014;that a person should, while he is still doing his work, make the necessary contributions and save, in order to ensure that he will be in the position to look after himself when he retires. Even in Britain the Civil Service took steps in this direction during the past few years although it has not yet switched over to a full-fledged contributory scheme. That means that even in Britain itself no such scheme exists in respect of the Civil Service. Of course, both the State and the provinces have the power to stipulate that they will contribute a larger proportion of the pension contributions while the official himself will contribute a small proportion. This has already been done in the case of both the teachers in the Transvaal and the civil servants. In other words, this is a concession which the officials actually received in the form of hard cash. I shall go into the whole matter, but at this stage I think it is too much to ask for a complete change to be introduced. I want to tell the hon. member that we shall go into the matter in course of time, but I am not prepared to do so at this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I think I have replied to the questions which necessitate a reply at the moment. We shall go into the matter further during the Committee Stage.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Dairy Industry Act of 1961 contains a number of provisions in terms of which restrictions are imposed on the uncontrolled expansion of the local margarine industry. In the first place, the manufacture of margarine is restricted to a number of factories which are registered under the Act as margarine factories and, in the second place, provision has been made to lay down, by way of Ministerial decision, the maximum quantity of margarine <span class="col_0769-0770" refersTo="page_0404"/>which may be manufactured in each such factory.</p>

<p>The objects of these provisions are to prevent the production of margarine from assuming such proportions that the development of the dairy industry might be impeded by it. For the purposes of the Act it is not of much consequence who or what person is the owner of a margarine factory, as long as such owner (whoever he may be) of course acts within the limits of the provisions of the Act. As far as the Act is concerned, the aforesaid restrictions therefore do not attach to the person of the owner.</p>

<p>In this regard I may point out that the Act does not require such factory to be registered in the name of the owner; furthermore, the person of the owner is not material to the purposes of the promulgation of the quantity restriction in terms of section 14 (a) of the Act either. As the Act reads at present, any person may manufacture margarine, as long as it is done in a registered margarine factory and provided he does not manufacture more margarine than the maximum quantity laid down for that factory.</p>

<p>Owing to the restrictions on the quantity of margarine that may be manufactured and the fact that the manufacturing of margarine is a fairly expensive undertaking, only a small number of industrialists have so far entered this branch of industry. However, these persons consider the interests they have since built up in the profession to be of a vested nature. An example of this is that the quantity restriction which is from time to time imposed on every factory in terms of section 14 (a), is considered to be a &#x201C;right&#x201D; in practice. For the person to whom such a restriction relates, the quantity mentioned in the restriction has become his &#x201C;quota&#x201D;, in other words, his share of the total quantity of margarine that may be manufactured in the Republic during the particular year. He regards that &#x201C;quota&#x201D; as a right which he can transfer to some other person at will. In reality one can of course not transfer a prohibition which has been imposed upon you to another person.</p>

<p>Recently the problem of transferment of the quota cropped up specifically after two firms which had previously manufactured margarine as a joint undertaking, decided to establish a new company to handle the manufacturing function on behalf of the first-mentioned two firms. When we wanted to impose the prohibition on the new company, the two firms objected on the ground that their respective &#x201C;quotas&#x201D; were being given to a third person, in other words, their traditional rights were now being alienated without their consent.</p>

<p>Because it was not the intention of the Act to place obstacles of this nature in the way of manufacturers, it occurred to us rather to adapt the relative provisions of the Act to the position existing in practice. It is accordingly proposed that the existing prohibition system as set out in section 14 be replaced by a new system in terms of which a complete prohibition is placed on the manufacture of margarine, except under the authority of a permit, which may be issued by the Minister after consultation with the Dairy Board. Such permits, which will lapse on 30th June and be renewed with effect from 1st July every year, will be issued subject to appropriate conditions, the most important of which will be a restriction of the quantity of margarine which may be manufactured in terms of such a permit.</p>

<p>The effect of the proposed new system will be that those persons who have already acquired vested interests in the margarine industry will annually receive their respective quotas, which may then be dealt with at will. It will for example be possible for the permit holder to make arrangements with someone else for the actual manufacture of the margarine. The present system of restrictive registration in respect of margarine factories is, however, being left unchanged.</p>

<p>The Bill also provides for a few incidental matters, such as granting the Minister the power to cancel the registration of a margarine factory if more margarine is manufactured in that factory than is specified in the permit. Similarly, provision is made for the imposition of a penalty if any person contravenes or fails to comply with the provisions of the new permit system. The latter proposed powers already exist in the Act, though in a different form, and consequently contain no new principles.</p>

<p>The Bill also provides for an inspector to be authorized to seize any books and documents which may be used as evidence in the case of a charge of a contravention of the Act and the regulations. It has recently come to light that some creameries have been committing certain irregularities, for example in connection with the testing of cream, and in order to prevent repetitions of this, it may be necessary to prosecute the offenders. The problem is, however, that at present the Act makes no provision for an inspector, when he discovers such a contravention, to seize the necessary evidence, and accordingly it is now being proposed that this power be inserted into the Act. Similar powers appear in parallel legislation, such as the Marketing Act, and this therefore contains no new principle.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I trust you will permit me these few words. This is the first time that the hon. the new Deputy Minister of Agriculture introduces legislation, and on behalf of this side of the House I want to congratulate him on his appointment and to wish him the best. The Deputy Minister has always done well in this House and his rapid rise in the National Party is dramatic, as he had only been a member of this House for two years prior to his appointment. We want to congratulate him on that. We also know that he is a progressive farmer and has made a great success of his own undertakings. Therefore we want to express the confidence that the success he has achieved there, and the <span class="col_0771-0772" refersTo="page_0405"/>sound principles he has applied there, will be carried over into his Department, and that the progress in the field of agriculture will be just as dramatic as his progress in the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>As regards this legislation, I want to say that this side of the House has no objection to it. The Deputy Minister gave us a perfectly clear explanation of why these powers are being called for. However, there is one little point which in my opinion can be cleared up at this stage already, and that is in connection with clause 2, which empowers the Minister in his discretion to cancel a permit if it is found that a margarine factory produces more than is allowed in its permit under the proposed new section 14. I want to ask the Minister that when this clause is applied the factory concerned should at least be given a reasonable chance. It should not just be applied summarily. If a factory continually produces more than the fixed quota, it is a matter of pure obstinacy and then it is clear that the factory is not prepared to co-operate. I nevertheless think the Minister should give those people the assurance that the powers he is now going to receive will not be applied in such a way that people will suffer losses, but that notice will be given so that the people concerned will know that the Minister and his Department are going to take action.</p>

<p>This side of the House would like to have the assurance that this clause will be applied in such a way that it will not cause hardship to a margarine manufacturer that will be affected by this clause. We wholeheartedly approve of clauses 3 and 4, and therefore there is no further objection to this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to thank the hon. member for Newton Park for his congratulations. He said he hoped everything would now run smoothly in the agricultural field. In this regard I differ with him a little, because I think that after Minister Uys has handled this Department for ten years it is a very efficient one!</p>

<p>As regards clause 2, I can assure him that nothing unreasonable will be done. The Dairy Board will make the recommendation that the permit be cancelled. I think the hon. member is also aware that the whole idea behind this piece of legislation is to afford protection to the dairy industry and therefore I am grateful that the Opposition supports this measure. I can give him the definite assurance that no unreasonable action will be taken against a manufacturer, because they also make use of agricultural products, and we also want to afford them an opportunity to make a living.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is concerned about the conditions prevailing in so many sectors of the agricultural industry and feels compelled to issue a warning to the Government that, unless it is prepared, <i>inter alia,</i> to undertake planning in regard to the industry in a realistic and purposeful manner, to take effective interim measures in order to save seriously distressed farmers from ruin, and to tackle soil and water conservation in an imaginative way, this national asset will become a permanent and unbearable burden for future generations.</block>

<p>I want to say at once that when a motion of this nature is moved, it affords the most wonderful opportunity, of course, for making propaganda on a large scale out of the predicament in which a large section of our population finds itself to-day. I want to assure hon. members, however, that this is not the motive behind this motion. Our motive in moving this motion is that we should like to have an exhaustive discussion on conditions existing in our agricultural industry, and consequently hon. members opposite will find that we, as in the past, shall be realistic, fair and constructive. However, our attitude should not be interpreted as one which is lacking in earnestness and warmth as far as the problems of our farmers are concerned, and even less should it be interpreted as one devoid of points of attack and pressure. We want to give the Government a sound thrashing <i>(goed op sy herrie speel</i>)&#x2014;or should I say &#x201C;Harry&#x201D;&#x2014;because of its lack of action.</p>

<p>At this stage the situation in the industry is too serious to start a fight which serves no purpose. Furthermore, we hope that the discussion which we shall have to-day will contain the basis of the discussion on agricultural affairs which we hope we shall have in the course of this session. In addition to this I want to say at once that I cannot refrain from making the following statement. The hon. Ministers in charge of agricultural affairs, and the Government in general, had adequate warning over the years of what would come. We know that they looked for various excuses and that they even accused the farmers of a lack of efficiency, of living beyond their means, of paying too much for land and of failing to display any managerial ability. Some of these accusations may be true of some farmers, but they are not true of the majority of South African farmers. The majority of our farmers are conscientious, progressive, and have a deep realization of their duty towards South Africa. There are ominous signs for our industry which the attentive observer cannot help but see. There are large shortcomings in the industry and these are becoming more prominent every day. Now one has to ask at once why the debts of the farmers have increased so tremendously. Why <span class="col_0773-0774" refersTo="page_0406"/>does this amount come to much more than R1,200 million at present? Is this all due to the purchase of more land? Or is it, as the former Deputy Minister said, merely a sign of prosperity in South Africa? Why are more and more farmers advising their children not to enter the agricultural industry? This is a feeling which is springing up all over and which is gaining in momentum in South Africa. Why is there less confidence in the industry at present than ever before in the history of South Africa? Straightaway one has to ask the question why the dividend on a farming enterprise is so low to-day. Why can any other sector of our economy pay 9 or 10 per cent on borrowed capital, and be prepared to do so, whereas the farmers cannot do likewise? Why are we not making any progress with the conservation of our soil, progress which will help us to see the light in this struggle? I want to remind hon. members that Dr. Ross said 20 years ago that we were losing 200 million tons of our best topsoil per annum. This loss is now increasing to 300 million tons per annum.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks how we know this. We do after all have scientists, people who are informed about these matters and who are experts in this field, who are able make these estimates. Hon. members opposite will have to produce evidence that these people are wrong. A further ominous sign is that farmers are feeling that their margins of profit are decreasing in spite of increased production. Why do farmers feel that they constantly need larger units to make a profit which will ensure them a better standard of living? Why are so many farmers leaving or selling their farms to find a new livelihood? I have here with me a letter from a leading farmer in the district of Uitenhage. He wrote to me that 40 per cent of the farmers in his area had left that area during the past two or three years to find a livelihood in the urban areas. Many of them had left their land unattended, had leased their land to others or had given their land to others to look after it for them, and they were at present working in the cities.</p>

<p>To-day the hon. the Minister, and I hope his Deputy too, must give us straight answers to the question whether they are of the opinion that these conditions will continue to exist in South Africa and whether they want these things to be arrested or at least slowed down. I want to ask the hon. the Minister and hon. members opposite whether they are aware of the fact that the poor farmers are not the only ones who are disappearing&#x2014;and about this we have never had any argument with the Government&#x2014;but that we are also losing the good farmers whom we can least afford to lose. Do hon. members realize what our annual consumption of food will amount to by the year 2000, when our population will number more than 40 million? Let me give you a few examples, Sir: Mealies, 100 million bags; wheat, 24 million bags; slaughter cattle, 4 million; sheep, 11 million; milk, 1,200 million gallons.</p>

<p>I have here with me a few extracts from speeches. By reading them I want to remind hon. members of the population explosion problem with which the world, and also South Africa, will have to contend during the next 15 to 20 years and even longer. These speeches were made by people concerned in the agricultural industry. In <i>Die Burger</i> of Tuesday, 6th December, 1966, Mr. P. T. G. Nash, managing director of a large company manufacturing fertilizers, said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the year 1980 millions of people in the world will die of starvation. To remain alive, the people will have to be fed. This is the challenge to-day to the agricultural industry of the world. Mr. Nash said that the millions of people who would die of starvation in 14 years&#x2019; time, would not necessarily die because of a direct lack of food. They could die as a result of many years of malnutrition. Diseases and epidemics would break out amongst them. This also affected South Africa, Mr. Nash said. Famine was threatening world peace and a violation of world peace could threaten the continued existence of South Africa. At present South Africa was not producing as much as was required by the country let alone what would be required in the next few years. Wheat and beef were two examples of this. If food had to be imported at this stage, what would the situation be in future if agricultural production were not increased?</block>

<p>Mr. Nash, who is a leading industrialist, is not the only one who says these things. There is also Dr. Du Plessis, Chief Director of Agricultural Policy of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. If my memory is not playing me false, he is occupying a prominent position in the Department to-day. The following is what he said in April, 1968 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Famine will become one of the major problems in the world and will be the underlying cause of unrest and conflict in many countries, unless solutions to the problem can be found in the foreseeable future.</block>

<p>For South Africa, therefore, the situation in the future is serious. The situation for the world as a whole is also serious. I feel that we should be prepared to cope with that situation when it does come. Not only shall we have to feed this growing population of ours in South Africa, but we shall also have to increase our daily calorie consumption <i>per capita</i> considerably, and this can still be increased considerably. Our present calorie consumption <i>per capita</i> per day is only approximately 2,879 calories, whereas it is 3,050 calories per day in Western Europe. Consequently we on this side are asking whether we will be equipped to cope with this situation when it does come. I have <span class="col_0775-0776" refersTo="page_0407"/>quoted to hon. members what was said by learned people. They maintain that millions of people will die of starvation by the year 2000, unless plans are made now. Such a disaster will not pass South Africa by. We know that our tillable agricultural land is little. Now the country is standing by helplessly and witnessing how thousands of farmers are leaving the land. To suggest that higher production merely results in surplusses, is not going to achieve anything, especially when we have regard to the fact that the consumption of many of our foods can still be increased to a large extent. It is claimed, for example, that if every member of the public would consume only an additional one-third of a pint of milk every day, we would no longer have any surplus of milk. I have to point out that in spite of the increased production in South Africa, the fact that prices have not kept up with the increase in production costs, is one of those alarming signs in our agricultural industry which I have already mentioned. I want to refer the hon. the Minister to page 5 of the latest report of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. In the first place, let us examine the position in respect of field products. The prices of field products decreased by approximately 4 per cent during the financial year 1967-&#x2019;68. I read what the report has to say in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The prices of most of the other field products, including sugar-cane, hay and dried beans, were also lower than in 1966-&#x2019;67.</block>

<p>Winter grain was the only field product of which the price showed an increase. Summer grain prices, which play a dominant role in the price index of field products, decreased by 5 per cent owing to the high production in 1967 and relatively poor realizations on exports. The prices of horticultural products were 8 per cent lower than during the previous year. The prices of deciduous fruit, more than half of which is exported, decreased by 10 per cent during the year under review. The sharpest decrease occurred in the case of apples, and the 1968 prices were approximately 25 per cent lower than in 1967. There was also a fairly sharp decline in pear prices. It is estimated that the producer prices for canning fruit dropped by 10 per cent.</p>

<p>During the year under review there was a general decrease of about 10 per cent in vegetable prices. There was an increase in the price of slaughter stock, but wool prices also decreased. In the case of dairy products there was a slight decrease, whereas prices of poultry and eggs dropped by approximately 2 per cent for the second year in succession.</p>

<p>I am not trying to make any propaganda out of this. After all, these are facts. Let us examine the other side of the matter, namely farming requisites. Farming requisites amounted to a record sum of R434 million and exceeded the expenditure of the previous year by R31 million. Let us examine the short-term requisites of farmers. In the year under review the amount for machinery and implements stood at R296 million. This exceeds expenditure during the previous year by R18 million. In the case of fertilizer, there was an increase of R7 million. Fuel sales to farmers amounted to R49 million. This amount exceeds that of the previous year by R4 million. Total expenditure on machinery and implements for the year under review is estimated at R95 million, which exceeds the figure for the previous year by R12 million. I can mention the prices of other farming requisites which show the same tendency. This compels me to say that this is the dilemma of the South Africa farmer. Although his volume production shows an increase, there is an unavoidable decrease in producer prices with a simultaneous increase in production costs. No one can deny that the increased rates of interest in South Africa have been costing the farmers approximately R20 million per annum extra since 1966. To have to pay from 8&#x00BD; to 10 per cent interest on a mortgage loan, as many farmers have to do to-day, makes any farming enterprise an uneconomic one. The control which the farmer has over his production costs is becoming less and less and he is being left at the mercy of the supplier of farming requisites. Industry in South Africa is being compelled to increase the prices of its products, and this in turn is passed on to the farmers who need those essential things for production. The difference is, however, that the farmers cannot add increased production costs to the prices of their products arbitrarily. A cynic once described this in the following terms: The farmer buys wholesale and he sells retail. But what is worse, is that a decrease in produce prices can result in a smaller turnover in spite of increased production. As soon as this happens, and I know of many farmers who have had this experience, there is one solution only, namely to retire from farming. I want to address the following appeal to the Government. Unless the diligent farmer has the assurance that he will be able to cover his production costs and receive a reasonable compensation for his capital investments with due regard to the risk factor, there will be no economic progress for him.</p>

<p>The hon. member should not anticipate me. I shall come to the drought shortly. To suggest that demand and supply will determine the price of the farmer&#x2019;s product, is totally unrealistic. It drives farmers from production and wrecks price stability. The profitability of farming will never improve before the Government can offer the farmers a stable price so that they need not fear a decrease in price in good times. <span class="col_0777-0778" refersTo="page_0408"/>I also want to say that if consumer subsidies have to be extended, over and above the products to which they apply at present, it simply must be done and the money will have to come from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Only in this way will it be possible to keep consumer prices low while at the same time offering the producer a reasonable price. Up to now only producers have been penalized whereas consumers have not been receiving the benefit of a lower price either, and if there are certain sectors which find themselves in temporary difficulties, the State must help them. At present we are subsidizing border industries to a large extent and this money comes from the pocket of the taxpayer. Why can a crippled sector of our agricultural industry, such as the wool industry, not receive similar treatment? By properly rehabilitating those people now, the State will recover that money in future as those people will then be in a better position to pay tax. Consequently I feel obliged, particularly in view of the conditions which are at present prevailing in so many of our stock-farming districts, to give attention now to the drought condition in South Africa.</p>

<p>Evidently there are more than 70 districts in the country which have already been declared drought-stricken areas. The situation is alarming. It is assuming the proportions of a tragedy, if it has not done so already. It is estimated that the country has already suffered a loss of approximately R150 million in the Transvaal and the Free State as a result of the drought. Farmers have spent thousands of rand on fodder, and the Government still continues to render assistance on the basis it has been doing so over the past four or five years, unless the hon. the Minister is going to announce new methods to-day of assisting them. Subsidies are granted on the transport of stock as well as loans and subsidies on fodder for a certain number of stock. I want to ask the hon. the Minister in all seriousness: &#x201C;Is this assistance adequate when we have regard to the fact that many farmers have been feeding their stock continuously since 1962?&#x201D; Sir, this drought did not hit South Africa overnight. In some districts the drought has been lasting for many years. I know of a farmer who has spent approximately R28,000 to keep 4,000 sheep alive over the past 14 months. Recently I read in the Press of one farmer who had spent as much as R90,000 to keep his stock alive. Hon. members in this House who are in contact with the people outside, know that the examples I have just mentioned here are not the worst ones. The condition of the veld in South Africa is deteriorating rapidly at present. However, a great deal of fodder, in one form or the other, is still available in this country.</p>

<p>Has the time not arrived for this Government to organize the purchase of this fodder and to convey it to strategic places in drought-stricken districts from which farmers can buy it at reasonable prices? I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that the people simply are not in a financial position to do these things themselves. It is now becoming the duty of the State, the duty of his Department to organize this type of thing and, if it is necessary, the Government ought to give consideration to using the Army for this purpose, as they did in the past, before the situation deteriorates even more. A few years ago the Army was used to convey water and stock. I know that grazing is not to be found anywhere and that consequently it is not necessary to transport stock. But what the Government can in fact do, is to buy the large quantities of surplus fodder which are still available in South Africa at present so that this may be made available to the people at cheaper prices.</p>

<p>Sir, I am afraid that the Government will have to go even further than taking the steps I have just mentioned if they want to save the situation. We shall also have to try to save more animals than the 1,000 sheep or 400 head of cattle per farmer in respect of which the Government is prepared to give loans or subsidies. Sir, I want to repeat what we said here before, i.e. that the Government will have to give consideration to some or all of the following interim measures: The rates of interest on mortgage loans are hopelessly too high and are breaking farmers in South Africa as never before in our history, and the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister know this because they receive reports on this condition every day. Wherever a group of farmers meet they complain about the unbearable interest burden.</p>

<p>Sir, has it never been recommended and has it never before happened in South Africa that rates of interest were subsidized? We should like the hon. the Minister to reconsider the proposal we made last year, i.e. that mortgage loans should be subsidized at a maximum of 2 per cent per annum with retrospective effect from the beginning of January, 1966. The hon. the Minister will have to reconsider the desirability of giving farmers more time to repay their loans. He will have to reconsider <span class="col_0779-0780" refersTo="page_0409"/>applying the veld reclamation scheme on a larger scale in South Africa so that we may reclaim our land and our veld, but then he will have to make it more advantageous for the farmers to participate in this. To-day I want to advance a plea especially for those farmers who have never before made use of any assistance and who have tried to fend for themselves on the strength of their own credit-worthiness. We shall now have to give those people considerable assistance. The Government will have to give consideration to whether the State should not grant an allowance on wool, up to a maximum of 3c per lb.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, an emergency condition such as we have in South Africa, demands emergency measures. We realize that our agricultural industry can be saved, but then we must be prepared to take these steps I have mentioned and to spend large sums of money on the industry. I am addressing this appeal to the hon. the Minister: See to it that our children will not ask us one day, &#x201C;What were you doing in the sixties when the agricultural industry in South Africa was being neglected to such an extent?&#x201D;; see to it that our children will not ask us one day, &#x201C;Why did you not save the agricultural industry when it was possible for you to do so&#x201D;?</p>

<p>I do not want to disappoint my old friend, the hon. member for Newton Park, by not moving an amendment, nor do I want to embarrass him by putting this amendment to the vote. The hon. member said that he did not want to make political capital out of this matter, and I am convinced that after the hon. the Minister has replied to this debate, the Leader of the Opposition will lose another member. I should like to move the following amendment, of which I have already given my hon. friend a copy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House is conscious of the Government&#x2019;s concern over the crippling drought which threatens our country and express its appreciation to the Government for&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) its long-term planning in order to keep the agricultural industry on a sound basis, demonstrated by the exhaustive investigations which have and are still being conducted from time to time and the implementation of positive recommendations;</li>

<li>(b) the effective assistance rendered to farmers in the distressed areas; and</li>

<li>(c) the manner in which soil and water conservation is being encouraged in order to achieve the greatest possible permanent stability in agriculture&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>The hon. member said he did not want to make a political issue of this serious situation. This drought has indeed landed our farmers in an emergency such as there has rarely been before. The people who have been suffering, are, in the first place, the sheep farmers, particularly in the Karoo areas and in the Eastern Cape, where conditions are very serious. The summer grain areas promised to yield one of the finest crops there has ever been, but within the last 14 days this has been reduced to a minimal crop by the tremendous heat and drought. Immediate assistance is required. Sir, we have been sitting in this House for 14 days. One week was spent on the motion of no-confidence. After our arrival in Cape Town I inquired from the Minister concerned and his Department whether one of the hon. members opposite was ever going to ask what immediate assistance the Minister was going to offer. The hon. member for Newton Park said that he did not want to make a political issue of this matter, but <i>The Cape Argus</i> and other English-language newspapers wrote a long time ago: &#x201C;M.P.S are to tell Parliament of their plight.&#x201D; This has to be done in Parliament. Why do they put a matter of such an immediate, urgent nature to Parliament if they do not want to make propaganda out of it? The emergency exists, and now this warning comes from the hon. member to the Government, but the Government has never been approached to discuss this matter. No, they come to Parliament to warn the Government through Parliament. If this is not political propaganda, I do not know what political propaganda is.</p>

<p>If the hon. member can make any political capital out of this in these circumstances, I give that to him as a present. We on this side of the House took immediate action here in the Cape and asked the Minister what possible assistance he was able to give and we asked him to expedite that. In these circumstances we are sorely disappointed in the Opposition because of the action it has taken by raising this emergency here in this House without its having made any other attempt. But now the hon. member &#x201C;warns&#x201D; the Government through Parliament. Well one realizes that the Opposition has been in the desert for 20 years, and to use the jargon of the usual weather predictions, we hear of isolated thunderstorms and scattered thunderstorms, and now the Opposition has been looking to see, after all the thunderstorms they have experienced whether an isolated thunderstorm would not break over Newcastle, but before that could happen, the tremendously destructive hailstorm of Umlazi occurred in this House. What a blow that was to them under the present political circumstances! [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, this Government has been in power for 20 years, but what did we inherit from the United Party? In what position did the country find itself when the National Party came into power in 1948? There was a Minister of Agriculture who had absolutely no feeling for the agricultural industry, nor any experience of the industry. He was the United Party Minister of Agriculture, Advocate Strauss. The result was that the only things we inherited <span class="col_0781-0782" refersTo="page_0410"/>from them were a few Acts which had not been implemented properly. There were the Marketing Act and only eight boards, but the commodity boards which existed at that time, were used for the specific purpose of forcing down current prices during a time of rising prices. They used those commodity boards as a lever to force down prices. Then there was the Soil Conservation Act. These are the two most important Acts we inherited from the United Party, i.e. the Marketing Act and the Soil Conservation Act, but no soil conservation had been done and no machinery had been created for implementing soil conservation. We inherited only the Acts, which we have had to amend time and again.</p>

<p>The land was scorched by drought, the veld had been destroyed through injudicious grazing and there were stock diseases and mortality on a tremendous scale. Stock as well as grain was infested with diseases and pests without any plans or attempts having been made to combat those diseases. Now they are the people who want to push this important matter to the forefront, but during the years when they could have done something, they simply neglected everything. This is the inheritance we received from them and we had to try to restore the scorched and eroded and destroyed soil.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Now the farmers are being blamed for the fact that these tremendous problems still exist, but they never received any State aid worth mentioning. The only State aid there was at that time came from the Land Bank and the maximum loan granted by the Land Bank to a farmer was R10,000. Its funds were very limited. It could only give limited assistance, but now that it grants bigger loans, the hon. member for Newton Park uses that as an argument to prove how debts have increased. But at that time those loans were granted by private institutions and banks, etc., and to-day they have been taken over by the State in consequence of an amendment to the Land Bank Act. The total sum given out on loan by the Land Bank from the time of its establishment in 1912 up to 1947 amounted to R602 million. At that time the Land Bank was the only institution which loaned money to the farmers, except when the State gave advances for a limited period in 1933. The total sum paid out by the Land Bank from 1947 to 31st December, 1968, amounted to R5,858 million, which is an enormous figure. This is a reflection of the measures which have been created in this country to assist farmers. I am not saying that adequate measures have been taken, because as the country develops and progresses, new measures will have to be taken. There is absolutely no comparison between the ways and means which are being employed at present to promote the agricultural industry and those employed by the Party of hon. members opposite when they were in power. Personally I am satisfied with the development which there is at present. The first warning addressed by the hon. member to the Government concerned the lack of purposeful planning.</p>

<p>I shall come back to this point later. The hon. member also complained about the lack of interim assistance to the farmers. This is not something the Opposition can talk about. They have to change their policy completely and break away from the past. The hon. member also spoke of soil and water conservation. Certainly it is not for me to announce on this occasion all the measures which are in operation at present and all the figures and amounts in this regard. I expect the hon. the Minister to make an announcement in this connection in due course. It is not for me to do so, and I leave that to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about planning in so far as it concerns farmers. The National Party has set a goal for itself, and this still is its target, which can be classified under five headings. Its first objective is to afford farmers the highest degree of protection under the circumstances. The second essential point is that the individual freedom of the farmer is to be maintained. I think hon. members will agree with me that this should not be affected. The third objective is to ensure the increasing efficiency of farmers, and the fourth is to assist the farmers in adapting themselves to changed circumstances. The fifth objective of the National Party is to ensure a safe livelihood for the farmers. However, before this task can be commenced, the resources at our disposal have to be exploited to the full. What are the resources we have at our disposal under the present circumstances? The first basic resources are our soil and our water.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have already told the hon. member what we inherited from his Party. Those hon. members know nothing about soil and water conservation, and the United Party did not do a single thing about them. They simply allowed things to take their own course. This Government was the first to apply soil and water conservation in this country, and at this stage it is doing everything within its power to extend this service even more so as to adapt it to conditions prevailing at present. Another of these basic resources is capital. At present the question of capital is an extremely urgent matter amongst our farmers. For this reason the Government completely reviewed the position of the Land Bank in 1959, so as to enable it to make a larger contribution to alleviating <span class="col_0783-0784" refersTo="page_0411"/>the needs of the farmers. At that time the funds of the Land Bank were not as limited as they were in the past when only Government funds were made available every year.</p>

<p>Another matter I should like to refer to is the manpower problems of the farmers. I attended many congresses at which the then Minister of Native Affairs acted as speaker. When the farmers used to complain at those congresses that they did not have servants and workers, the Minister always made a joke of that. The hon. member for Newton Park spoke of the rural areas becoming more black without his first having viewed the matter in its right perspective. I am also concerned about this phenomenon, but one should be very careful not to do any damage to this major source of manpower, particularly not if one has regard to the present circumstances of the agricultural industry. It is an easy matter to quote figures and to speak of the increase in the black population of the rural areas. There is another aspect I want to discuss, and that is the economic services which are available under the present circumstances. In the first place we should note the distress relief aids for farmers. We are living in a country in which droughts are not unknown. At the present moment the country is experiencing yet another drought and we cannot expect this to be the last. Under the present circumstances we must take the necessary precautionary measures to the best of our ability. I am not saying that a fodder bank is the right solution. At present we have two commissions to determine what the circumstances of the farmers are to-day. The Marais Commission is investigating the agricultural conditions and the Viljoen Commission the water conditions. The hon. member applauded the appointment of these commissions and said that these were their commissions. But now the hon. member attacks the Government about the circumstances in which the farmers find themselves. I also want to discuss the economic services and drought relief services which are now being rendered to farmers during this emergency. I agree that the Government should go to extremes to assist farmers who are in distress on account of the drought. When a disaster hits Roodepoort or Johannesburg or any other place in our country, as it so often does, contributions come from all over the country to assist those who have been hit. The only institution which can assist the farmers in this emergency, and in that way ensure the food supplies of the nation, is the State.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was suspended I was giving an exposition of the most important objectives of the National Party and its policy of planning. I was also discussing the economic services, after having dealt with the resources at our disposal. The following auxiliary services exist: Emergency relief, drought relief and subsidies. In addition there are loans made available by the Land Bank and the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. A 5 per cent rate of interest was laid down by legislation. In addition there are agricultural co-operative societies. The following auxiliary services are being rendered by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, for example, publications, agricultural education and extension services. In addition there are protection services, such as price stabilization. When we came into power there were only a few boards which I have already mentioned. An additional ten commodity boards were immediately established in 1948. At present there are 19 boards, which administer the production of the main agricultural products, and this has the effect that in reality the farmers are in control of fixing prices through the agency of their own organizations. The farmers themselves serve on the various organizations. At the head we have the two Ministers, who are practical farmers, with an advisory committee constituted by the agricultural organizations and the various boards, and these parties deal with the fixing of prices. Producers represent the majority on these boards. This really is an organization with a policy of planning which is novel in South Africa. Then there are mechanical control, field pests control and control of the quality of produce. The most cordial co-operation is required from the Ministers of Agriculture and of Water Affairs and the Deputy Minister of Agriculture in consultation with their Departments and the farmers in South Africa to achieve this end. We are aware of the fact that South Africa has often experienced these drought conditions. The available land is constantly decreasing. In the light of the present climatic conditions it is a challenge to the farmers to supply South Africa with the necessary foodstuffs in future. There is a constant withdrawal of the best agricultural land for other purposes. I say this is a challenge in the light of which we want to give the farmers every credit for always having fulfilled their duty towards South Africa under difficult circumstances. I am convinced that through the co-operation of the various groups the farmers in South Africa will still be able to meet this challenge for a long time to come in that they will be able to supply the food requirements and the necessary raw materials for industrial development. To this I want to add that the National Party will, in spite of the 21 years it has been in power, remain in power for a long time to come because it was and still is the only Government that knows the farmers, that knows their needs, and that is able to render assistance under these emergency conditions and to lend a helping hand in meeting the challenge South Africa is presenting to the farmers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member for Christiana commenced <span class="col_0785-0786" refersTo="page_0412"/>his speech prior to the suspension of business for lunch by outlining the critical conditions in the agricultural industry, I was under the impression that he was going to make some very sound suggestions about what had to be done as far as the agricultural industry was concerned. He even upbraided this side of the House for having brought this matter to Parliament and for not having made direct representations to the Minister, as though he would know what had been done. He went on to say that that side of this House had made so many representations. I thought he was going to announce some of those wonderful representations here in this House so that we might learn what the Government ought to do in these times of crisis. But what did he do then? He let loose and tried to fire a blast of bird-shot at this side. We heard of scattered thunder-showers in Newcastle, and who knows what else. At the end of his speech I was still waiting for his suggestions, [Interjections.] There were no suggestions! I still want to know what the leader of the agricultural group on the Government side has to recommend. He moved an amendment as long as a newspaper in which he referred to the long-term planning of the Government for which we should express our gratitude. Do hon. members know how long this long-term planning is? Twenty-one years! They have been building for 21 years on the foundations laid by this side of the House. [Interjections.] The Marketing Act and the Soil Conservation Act were placed on the Statute Book by this party. How have they been building on those foundations? They have been building in such a way that the farmers are more bankrupt at present than they were in 1948. There is no doubt about this. Let there be no arguments about this. In 1932, when that side of this House was in power, there was a depression &#x2026;</p>

<p>At that time those of us in the agricultural industry who needed assistance, pleaded for the crumbs from the rich man&#x2019;s table. How meagre that assistance was in 1932! When one considers the position to which this Government has brought the farmers over a period of 21 years of reasonable prosperity, I wonder what would become of the farming community if the agricultural industry were to experience another depression similar to that of 1932.</p>

<p>The hon. member quoted astronomical figures with regard to Government expenditure for the benefit of the farmers. But is the fact that the farming community finds itself in the situation of being unable to help itself merely attributable to a cycle of years of drought? I am afraid to speak in this House &#x2026; [Laughter.] Yes, I am afraid to speak in this House about the seriousness of the crisis. Those hon. members may laugh and if they want to they may ridicule this. The hon. member said a short while ago that we were living in a time of crisis, but as far as I know that hon. member has never travelled along the east coast from beyond Umtata through the Cape Province to De Dooms and he has not seen the present condition of the Cape Province. It is not only a question of it being black because of the drought; it is white, because the shrub-veld is dead. Hon. members may go to the Transkei and the Ciskei to look at the cattle that is still left. It is enough to break one&#x2019;s heart that animals should be in such a condition. Hon. members may go through the Karoo in an attempt to find one farm where the farmer is not feeding his stock if he is still in a position to do so and can obtain the necessary loans.</p>

<p>This is what one finds from one side to the other. I shall now speak of who is to blame, and I am going to be harsh.</p>

<p>I have just been asked, &#x201C;Whose fault is that?&#x201D; I have said, &#x201C;Let us not pretend that the drought alone is to be blamed&#x201D;. Year after year this side of the House has been advancing repeated pleas for precautionary measures to be taken against the droughts which come year after year. What has been the reaction of that side of this House, and more specifically of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture? At that time the hon. the Deputy Minister was not around. [Laughter.] Yes, it almost is a laughing matter: he still is fairly young. This Minister of Agriculture ignored us all the time when we were advancing pleas for fodder banks on a national or decentralized basis which would allow of all available supplies being stored to be used when required for feeding animals in times of emergency. When I speak of all available supplies, I am speaking not only of lucerne-hay, oat-hay and oat-hay which has not been threshed, but also of groundnut-hay and every other kind of hay and roughage which can be used. I spoke about this in this House before. [Laughter.] I notice that that side of this House is of the opinion that this discussion on agriculture is a joke. [Interjections.] The distress of the farmers is something funny to them. It is something to ridicule. The noise coming from the lower end of this House is terrible. I almost cannot hear myself talking. When from 70 to 80 per cent of the farming community at this stage finds itself in financial difficulties to such an extent that that Minister, the Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet no longer know what recommendations to make for assisting them, that is something to ridicule. Actually they have never known what to recommend. But when this side of the House makes suggestions which can be useful, they ridicule them. The hon. the Deputy Minister will know what. I am talking about, because where he comes from in the Transvaal and here in the Western Cape supplies which are available can be found everywhere, and these <span class="col_0787-0788" refersTo="page_0413"/>supplies, which can be used and mixed with concentrated feeds in the right proportions for keeping starving animals alive, often go to waste. This can be stored at decentralized places throughout the country to be made available to farmers who find themselves in these circumstances. The hon. member for Colesberg referred to chaff this morning and said that chaff was not a fodder. Do you know, Sir, chaff mixed with molasses and some concentrated feed is a wonderful fodder when an animal is staggering on his legs. It is not possible to feed it concentrated feeds only, it is not possible to feed it mealie-meal only, even if we do have it available. But when we have roughage to feed to the animals along with that, we can make do and at least improve the condition of the animals.</p>

<p>When I read this amendment and see the reference to long-term planning and gratitude to the Minister, I think of certain reports we read over the last few days and I imagine to myself how strange that must sound to the consumer. In the annual report of the Department we read that during the year 1967-&#x2019;68 such a large quantity of cheese was produced that some had to be exported, but 5 million lbs. of dried milk, mainly skimmed milk were imported. Then we also read a few days ago that more than 2 million gallons of milk were destroyed here in Cape Town. Surely this must sound very strange to a consumer. It must be strange for him to read that a country has to import 5 million lbs. of dried milk while more than 2 million gallons of milk are destroyed here in Cape Town over a period of a few months. I then ask myself the question, and I am now also asking the hon." the Minister, what kind of planning and what kind of co-ordination exists between the Dairy Board and the Department which cannot prevent such a large quantity of milk being destroyed in one centre only. Our country is spending foreign exchange on the importation of large quantities of powdered milk, and foreign exchange is what we sorely need. I am mentioning this one matter in order to illustrate the lack of planning and especially long-term planning to which the hon. member refers in his amendment.</p>

<p>I now want to make a few suggestions in respect of assistance which can be given during this dreadful crisis we are experiencing at present. I do not want to waste any more time on discussing the amendment, I do not want to try to shoot it down. The amendment refers to long-term assistance, but contains no suggestions in this connection. I now want to suggest certain ways and means which were suggested in this House before with regard to animals in the drought-stricken areas. I want to confine myself more specifically to animal husbandry, because I know more about this subject. If losses are suffered by a farmer who goes in for crop farming those losses apply to one year only, because when he plants a crop the following year and has a harvest, he can make up his losses to some extent and even rehabilitate himself to some extent. Losses suffered by a stock farmer, however, when he loses a season&#x2019;s calves or lambs or other animals, are not of such a short-term nature. It takes him a long time to make up the losses and to rehabilitate himself. We are aware of the existing systems of paying subsidies in respect of fodder schemes for areas which have been declared areas to be subsidized. We know that for a certain period a farmer can receive a subsidy on fodder for his breeding sheep and breeding cattle, and that the farmer is assisted to the extent of one-half of the costs and also as far as railage of a limited number of stock is concerned. We are grateful for this assistance, because a person who is in distress probably is grateful for any kind of assistance. However, on previous occasions in this house we spoke of the suffering animals. At present there are hundreds of thousands of head of cattle in the Eastern Cape that are suffering on account of the drought. In this figure I include the cattle in the Bantu areas, because it does not get us anywhere to close our eyes and to pretend that that is not part of this country&#x2019;s stockpile. Nothing is being done to assist them in this connection. Surely those people and animals must be considered to be inside the Republic of South Africa until such time as the Government has granted those areas complete independence. When we look at this and consider the large numbers of animals that are perishing at present, that are perishing today, because there are no means of keeping them alive so that they may serve as food which we need for our country, one wonders how it can be possible that nothing positive has ever been done to help solve this problem. I dealt with this question before. Something positive is being done in other countries, it is being done in one of our neighbouring states, i.e. Rhodesia.</p>

<p>When any area in Rhodesia is declared a drought-stricken area, the officials of the department visit that area, make a study of the position and tell the farmers concerned, &#x201C;We think you should get rid of 25 or 50 or 60 per cent of your animals. This is the month of March, and even if it were to rain, you would not have sufficient grazing. We shall assist you in getting rid of those animals. We shall pay you so much per weight and grade through the cold storage agent of the Government for everything you sell to us&#x201D;. I know of very few farmers who are not prepared to co-operate in a scheme like this. All of them co-operate. They sell their redundant stock to the State through its cold storage chambers. This applies to all stock, not only breeding stock. They sell year-old calves, weaned calves and all animals they think they will not be able to feed. They sell these animals to the Government at a fixed price on a weight basis. The Government or its agents inquire from those people who still have veld, grazing, fences and water, whether they want to purchase any of this stock, and they undertake to finance them for this purpose. They tell those people, &#x201C;You <span class="col_0789-0790" refersTo="page_0414"/>can buy the stock at the same price as that which we paid for the stock, plus 15 per cent for administrative expenses. You can owe us the money until you market the stock, and in the meantime interest at 6 per cent is added to your debt&#x201D;. A farmer then takes the stock and farms with them. If it is young stock, he keeps them for three years, and the older stock he keeps for two years or one year.</p>

<p>Now hon. members opposite should not talk to me about the independence and the individuality of the farmer as such. There is no longer any farmer in this country who has the necessary grazing but no money for buying stock who will not be prepared to brand the stock he will be able to buy if the Government advances him the money to do so and to say that that stock is the Government&#x2019;s security. The kind of pride which would not be prepared to accept something of this nature, is something of the past, because the distress of the farmers is too serious. This system is being applied in the countries to which I have referred. The farmers who are being assisted are told, &#x201C;Return the stock when they are ready for the market, and in the meantime you are not paying anything but you owe the money to the Government&#x201D;. The original price, plus interest at 6 per cent, is deducted when that stock is sold, and the balance goes to that farmer.</p>

<p>They go even further than this. The farmer who sold the stock, wants to rehabilitate himself. He wants to buy stock again. After that farmer has had rain and has grazing for animals the Government tells him, &#x201C;Now we are going to assist you to buy stock again. We shall advance money to you so that you may purchase stock. You can also buy according to grade and weight and you will also pay 6 per cent interest. But in view of the fact that you had to sell at a time when prices were low and your stock was lean, and in view of the fact that you now have to buy while prices are higher, we are going to place &#x00A3;5 per head of cattle at your disposal free of charge.&#x201D; The sum of &#x00A3;5 is not a loan or a subsidy, it is a free grant. This system has been in operation for many years in those countries to which I have referred. They go further than that and tell the farmer. &#x201C;If you want to look after your farm and if you have had a severe drought and are not able to buy the number of stock you had to sell at that time, we will assist you even more. We owe you &#x00A3;5 per head of cattle for the number of cattle we took over from you at that time. For every head of cattle you want to buy we shall give you &#x00A3;5, and for the difference between the number of cattle you sold at that time and the smaller number you now wish to purchase because you want to save your grazing, we shall make &#x00A3;5 available to you per head of cattle and you may spend that on soil conservation or fencing or on anything you like, provided you produce a certificate to us that our officials are satisfied that you are spending the money on improving your farm. In that case we shall make the money available to you&#x201D;. Is this not a way of combating the effects of the drought and retaining the stockpile? Is this not a system we could have applied in South Africa a long time ago? Is it impossible to employ an agency to buy animals in the poor parts of the country and to take them to those parts where there still is fodder for them? There still are large areas in the Transvaal and Natal which have grass. Do the people have the financial means to buy animals and to let them graze there, or are they also experiencing financial difficulties. If they do not have the necessary money, why does the State not assist them? Will it cost the State anything? No, not a single cent. The animal is the State&#x2019;s security, and it is on good grazing. It is not on poor grazing where it may die in which case the farmer concerned will have to repay the money to the State but will be unable to do so because he has lost his stockpile. The animal is on good grazing and when it is sold, the farmer who provided it with grazing will make something out of the transaction and the State will recover its money plus interest. That money can then be loaned to somebody else.</p>

<p>I have been farming in Rhodesia for many years, and I have often made use of this system. Two years ago when Matabeleland suffered a severe drought, the Government bought more than a quarter million head of cattle in that area. This stock, except that which was ready for the market, was removed to the north and placed in areas where there was grazing. All of them are still there; the breeding stock, the young animals, the animals that had to be saved.</p>

<p>Sir, my plea concerns every animal, every human being, everybody&#x2019;s future food provisions which we are neglecting, but it concerns in particular the young breeding stock, the calves and the lambs that are perishing over the length and the breadth of 500 miles of Karooland. Heaven alone knows how we are going to rehabilitate our stockpile one day. I do not know. We have now reached the stage where we no longer even know what to recommend to the Minister for the positive rehabilitation of the people on a long-term basis to such an extent that they can once again become the proud farmers they used to be 20 years ago.</p>

<p>I have read in the newspapers and have heard over the radio that the Minister was going to receive a deputation of the S.A.A.U., possibly accompanied by a deputation of the Wool Growers Association, who wants to see him about agricultural matters during these times of crisis. But when? Only on the 12th of March. The condition is so serious that it will not keep to the 20th of this month. As things are now, every day which passes is costing the country one million rand and more. Sir, I expected the Minister to have informed the South African Agricultural Union that he would see them on Monday, if not on Sunday or even this afternoon.</p>

<p>The point at issue is not the R20 million which it will cost, but the means the Minister has to employ during this critical period to save the people. But what means is he employing? What is he doing to assist the people during this critical drought? Neither proclaimed districts nor subsidies on fodder for breeding stock have been obtained. The farming community will not be saved in such a way. Some of the matters I mentioned are long-term projects. Now there is no point in talking about the establishment of a national fodder bank. This cannot be done now. Through development this can be done over a few years. At present the supplies are not available. Representations have already been made to the Minister of Transport because farmers are struggling to get hay from one point to another; now it is a shortage of tarpaulins, then a shortage of trucks and then again delays. And the people are struggling until they are at their wits end to obtain fodder for their animals that are perishing by the day. But this situation is so urgent and critical that this Government should not waste one day more before making a dynamic attempt to save the farmers, not only on a short-term basis but also on a long-term basis. But this first has to be done on the short-term basis because the people are in a predicament from which they cannot save themselves. They are going bankrupt by the day.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude. I tried my best to suggest ways and means which the Government may employ to save the stockpile of this country. This is a method which can be set in operation to-morrow. The animals have to be removed from the Great Karoo. Next week at the Woolgrowers&#x2019; congress we shall discuss the Karoo and its rehabilitation, but how the Karoo is to be rehabilitated. I simply do not know. [Interjections.] An attempt at rehabilitation can be made by trying to withdraw some of the stock from the Karoo. If this Government were as good and as efficient at removing starving animals from areas in which there is no fodder to areas where there is, as it is at removing people who have food to areas where there is none, it would have progressed a very long way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I find it a great pity that we have now lowered the standard of this debate somewhat. The mover of the motion started off the debate on a fairly high level. He did not try to make political propaganda out of this debate. The hon. member for East London (City) now got up and delivered himself of a lot of statements. Among other things, he suggested something which is totally impracticable. I only want to mention a few points, because I do not have much time. The hon. member said that the State should buy the surplus sheep from the farmers and hang them up in cold-storage chambers, but goodness knows for how long. Now I want to ask the hon. member for East London (City) &#x2026; [Interjection.] Just give me a chance. I only have a few minutes. Where is the hon. member going to get sheep to place in cold storage that one can eat? [Interjection.] Wait a moment, just give me a chance. [Interjection.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>A good friend of mine, from Krom River, whom the hon. member also knows very well, tried to put more than 4,000 sheep on the stubble-fields in Touws River. I saw with my own eyes that they were so thin that they were doubled up. If the Minister had to buy such sheep, slaughter them and put them in cold storage, who would eat them? He can skin them. That is all he can do with them. One should be a little more practical in one&#x2019;s thinking on these matters. It is now suggested that the Government should provide a fodder bank. That would be a good thing, but there are other ways in which the Government provides facilities to the farmers so that they can build up their own fodder banks. But one cannot build up a fodder bank if every dam in the Karoo is empty. It simply cannot be done under these circumstances. Not one of the rivers there is running any longer. The pumps they have on the banks of the rivers and water-courses cannot provide any water to irrigate the lucerne, etc. Throughout the Karoo as well as in the Eastern Cape there is not a single farmer to-day who, if it does not rain to-morrow or the day after, can plant a single pip of fresh fodder. Why not? They have no water. I fully agree that the farmers are in a precarious position. We cannot make light of it. Certain members did laugh when the hon. member made a comment, but I do not think they had any bad intentions. We must remember that the State has done a great deal as far as soil and water conservation are concerned. While travelling by aeroplane to Johannesburg the year before last, I was surprised at the number of dams that had some water in them. Such dams are not to be seen to-day. There is simply no water.</p>

<p>There are other ways in which the farmers can be helped. Something has been worrying me a long time now and I should like to mention it to the Minister for his consideration. A heavy burden resting upon the farmers today, is the fact that they are completely tied to the banks. They cannot obtain any money today to carry on their farming operations. We know of course that one can get advances from one&#x2019;s brokers. But in large areas the wool clip is so small that the farmer has to send his wool away. He then, as it were, gets no return on that clip. In the meantime he has an overdraft at the bank and his debt increases every month as a result of compound interest being charged.</p>

<p>I now want to address a very polite request to the Minister. The farmers will not be able <span class="col_0793-0794" refersTo="page_0416"/>to recover unless two things happen. In the first place we hope that we will soon have some rain. This would help to boost the farmers&#x2019; morale. Their morale is as low today as it has never been in the Republic of South Africa before. It has reached an absolute low. The second requirement to rehabilitate the farmers is that the rates of interest will have to drop. These are the two requirements I want to assure the Minister to-day that, in spite of what we have heard from that side and from this side of the House, the farmers will get on their feet again if we have good rains generally and if the rates of interest can be reduced. If that happens, we shall again attain the level we had before.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity of supporting the hon. member for Newton Park in the motion he has moved in this House to-day. I think it is very important that we should take every opportunity to highlight in this House the plight of the agricultural sector in the Republic to-day. Therefore I feel obliged to say to the hon. member for Christiana that he is not &#x201C;with it&#x201D; at all when he condemns the hon. member for Newton Park for raising the subject, and when he says that we should approach the Ministers independently. This is the highest forum in the land and the people outside want to know what we are thinking about agriculture and its problems and what the Government is thinking. It is for that specific purpose that this motion was moved. It was introduced so that the farmers outside could know what was going on. I would say that if the farmers could hear what hon. members opposite had to say to-day about the agricultural position, they would be sorely disappointed, and quite rightly so, too. Nothing really constructive has come from that side. They say they will leave the matter to the hon. the Minister. Sir, there are hon. members representing many constituencies in South Africa which are purely farming constituencies. I think that the people in those constituencies will be disappointed when they hear the negative approach which was adopted by those hon. members.</p>

<p>Sir, I also want to take the opportunity of highlighting the inability of this Government to deal with the problems that have arisen in agriculture in recent years. They cannot come and say that they inherited a bad estate from the United Party. They have been in power for 21 years. We did not make any mistakes but if we did, they have had plenty of time to rectify those mistakes; so, that story holds no water whatsoever. I am very pleased, Sir, that the hon. member for Colesberg has come with a sensible suggestion. I think it is clear to everybody that one of the fundamental problems that the farmer faces to-day is this question of having to pay a rate of interest which the industry simply cannot bear. But, of course, this is not a new suggestion. This is a suggestion that we have made time and time again in this House; we have high-lighted it on many occasions, and since the hon. member for Colesberg has at last seen the light, I do hope that the hon. the Minister is going to react to the hon. member&#x2019;s sensible proposals.</p>

<p>Sir, in the time at my disposal, I want to focus attention on that aspect of Government policy which I believe has been subject to the greatest neglect; it is a very important subject, a subject on which the whole agricultural structure is based&#x2014;our soil and the conservation thereof. We have recently had had handed to us the annual report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services for the period 1967-&#x2019;68, and, as in all previous reports, there is again no evidence whatsoever in this report that the Government has made any progress at all in this problem of soil conservation. In fact, each succeeding report emphasizes the fact that the problem is getting worse and they do not say in this report in which manner the Government is going to solve the problems that face the country. Sir, I do not want to quote at length but I do want to quote just a paragraph or two from this report. On page 15 it says</p>

<block name="quote">The disproportion between the numbers of approved and completed works since 1966 has become steadily greater.</block>

<p>In other words, when a work is approved, its urgency is accepted. Therefore urgent works are not being completed, and while this process goes on, more and more of our soil is going to continue to wash away. It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since 1966 the difference has become steadily greater; has indeed become a source of great anxiety in view of the grave erosion position and the limited manpower available to combat it and justifies a searching investigation into the causes.</block>

<p>Sir, if at this stage we still have to start investigating the causes, then when in heaven&#x2019;s name will a solution ever be found? The time for investigation has passed. The time has now arrived for dynamic action, to do those things which are apparent to any practical man. That is the trouble with this Government; they are continually investigating and they do not take action. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The loan scheme for the construction of soil conservation works is tending to fall into disuse.</block>

<p>Sir, I will repeat this for the benefit of the hon. the Deputy Minister because while I was reading this he was joking. Hon. members on the other side think agriculture is a joke. That is why they are in trouble.</p>

<p>Sir, I think that is a very stupid interjection. Let me quote this again to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The loan scheme for the construction of soil conservation works is tending to fall into disuse.</block>

<p>I would say that that is an alarming position. A scheme which is absolutely essential is falling into disuse. In other words, the works which should be done, which are essential to the country, are not being done simply because the Government is not making available the necessary loan capital to those enthusiastic and dedicated agriculturists who want to get on with the job. Sir, that is the report that we have from the Government and its own people. We have this problem: Year after year we come along here and make constructive speeches and the Government does not listen to us. We now produce evidence from their own advisers; perhaps they will take note of what their own advisers have to say. I think it is wise that we should quote to the Government the reports of some of their own advisers. Perhaps then they will take note and realize that what we in the Opposition say is really the truth. I am going to quote from a report made by Dr. S. W. Pienaar, chief of the Division of Catchment Area Protection. This report appeared in the <i><i>Daily News</i></i> of the 18th September, 1968. This is what Dr. Pienaar has to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Parts of the upper Orange River catchment area, vital to the success of the entire R600 million Orange River project, faced a total collapse as a result of soil erosion. Dr. Pienaar painted an alarming picture of mass erosion in the feeding area of the Orange River dam and of the valuable top soil which will soon be carried into the dam as silt.</block>

<p>Sir, the position that he is painting here applies not only to the catchment area of the Orange River scheme, it applies to every catchment area in the whole of the Republic of South Africa, and that is the position after 20 years of this Government&#x2019;s feeble attempts to try to get the upper hand over soil erosion in South Africa. They are obviously not succeeding. This is one of their own advisers speaking. I quote him because when I said these things last year and the year before, not much notice was taken of me. Let me go on quoting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said that in the fight against erosion in the area, soil conservation extension officers faced a tough task because only 23 out of the 41 posts in the area had been filled.</block>

<p>That position applies not only in the Orange River catchment area; it applies generally to the whole of the Republic. The whole of the extension service is understaffed. The Government is unable to get the personnel to do the job. Every year, Sir, we raise this question of a personnel shortage, but I am going to submit to the Government to-day that this question of personnel shortage can be solved if the Government makes use of the manpower which is becoming available to it because of the exodus from the land of many of our farming folk. I do not want to get involved in a debate here on the question whether a depopulation of the platteland is necessary or not, or whether it is a sign of progress or not, but the fact remains that there is a depopulation of the platteland going on; much of it, I believe, is unnecessary, but my plea here to-day is that these people who find that they are no longer able to make a living on the land be given an opportunity to strengthen the personnel of the extension service department. There are many useful people whose services can be used, and I am quite sure that a rational use of the services of these folk who belong on the land, could solve this problem of a shortage of personnel. It is very important that we try to keep as many of our farming folk on the land as possible because there is no doubt that in this country our farming folk have been a stabilizing factor in our population over all the years, and surely the Government should make efforts to keep as many people on the land as they possibly can. That is why I suggest this, and I believe that the system which they have introduced, which was recommended from this side of the House, i.e. that they get part-time assistants, a system which they are using to a limited extent, has proved a great success, and I can see no reason why that system of training farmers to assist as assistant technical officers in the Department cannot be exploited to the full. Dr. Pienaar goes on to say in this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More than 47 per cent of farmers in the area have never had contact with soil conservation officers.</block>

<p>Sir, I think this is a very serious accusation, that 47 per cent of the farmers farming in the Orange River project catchment area have never been visited by an extension officer. If that is the position then I feel that effective use should be made of these people who can no longer make a living as farmers, by employing them in the extension service where they can make a useful contribution. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The entire catchment area for the Orange River project had once been covered by natural grasses but to-day the area was unstable and extremely vulnerable. Only 22 per cent could be described as grass veld; the rest either as mixed, bush grass or bushveld. In the south only .3 per cent was covered with grass. Mr. Pienaar quoted another authority in saying that this conversion of grass in the eroded Karoo, can only be regarded as a national disaster.</block>

<p><span class="col_0797-0798" refersTo="page_0418"/>Sir, that is the position and unless hon. members opposite accept that the position is serious, that it demands drastic action, we are never going to conquer this problem of soil erosion which threatens to undermine the whole of our agricultural industry. The Government cannot say that this problem was unknown to them. Here are their own officials pointing out the very fact and they are doing far too little about it. The report goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Pienaar said that reliable surveys had shown that R55 million must be spent on soil conservation in this area alone, R35 million of it by the farmers at a cost of R9 per morgen. This would be more per year than is spent now on soil conservation in the entire Republic.</block>

<p>Sir, here is an important adviser of the Government saying that R55 million should be spent in one area of the Republic, but what is this Government spending on soil conservation? A sum of R4 million was appropriated on last year&#x2019;s Estimates for the whole of the Republic and here it is stated that R55 million should be spent in one single area. I think this is an indication of the Government&#x2019;s ineffective approach to this subject. What worries one more, Sir, is that they must know about this, and that they are either reluctant to tackle the job or they must feel that they are not competent to tackle it, and if they are not competent then the day must surely come when we on this side of the House should be given the opportunity to take over and restore agriculture in South Africa to its rightful place. I hope that that day will come soon in the interests of South Africa&#x2019;s farmers. Anyway, I think we have made the point most effectively that we are facing a national disaster, acknowledged by one of the Government&#x2019;s own advisers, and so we are interested to hear what the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has to tell us about what he intends to do in the face of this position. I am purposely quoting from official Government sources so that they cannot deny these things that I am quoting. Here is a statement released to the Press by Dr. Carel de Wet, the Minister of Planning, concerning the establishment of two controlled areas, one in the Orange Free State and one in the Cape Province, in terms of the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Act, 1967. This is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has come to the conclusion that developments in many fields in various regions of the Republic may result in the injudicious subdivision of agricultural land into uneconomic farming units. Thorough investigation has brought to light that serious deterioration of the veld and soil is taking place over practically the whole of the catchment area of the Orange River, and that silt deposited by waters in the Upper Orange catchment area will constitute a serious threat to the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam.</block>

<p>And this report goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The greatest deterioration of veld and soil in the catchment area can for the greater part be attributed to the fact that a large percentage of the farming units in the area can be regarded as uneconomic.</block>

<p>This thorough investigation has revealed how serious the position is there, but what has prodded the Government into taking action? Not to save the farmer and agriculturalists, but because the Orange River Scheme is threatened. That is what prodded them into action. The silt position has been there for many years, but now that their big project is threatened with silting up they are taking action.</p>

<p>Hon. members are laughing; I am watching them, because to them this is not a matter of serious consequence. They realize they can make no politics out of it, so they are laughing about this matter. I think I have said enough to show how serious the position is and I now want to pose another question to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<p>I have read from this document issued by the hon. the Minister of Planning where he says that there are too many farms which are uneconomic units and that measures have to be taken to ensure that there is no further subdivision. Well, if this arrangement is carried out, obviously there is going to be further depopulation of the platteland. We must accept, therefore, that the white farming areas of South Africa under this Government&#x2019;s policy can no longer maintain their present population of agriculturalists. Some of them will have to get off the land and go to the industrial areas. I am not going to argue the merits or demerits of that policy, but what I do want to know is this. If that is the policy of the Government in respect of white South Africa, how do they anticipate carrying out a rational agricultural policy in the Native Reserves where the avowed policy is to get more people back into those Reserves? Those Reserves are already over-stocked and over-populated, but now the policy of this Government is to force more and more people into those areas. I would be glad if the Minister would explain to us what is going to be the position of agriculture in the Bantu homelands. If the white areas cannot support their present population, how can it be done in the Bantu Reserves? I want to know from the Minister of Agriculture how he will manage it. Therefore I think I have every justification for supporting the hon. member for Newton Park in his motion to warn this Government that unless they take more effective measures to deal with some of the problems we have raised here to-day, unless they are prepared to spend more money on soil conservation, all other efforts will be of no avail whatsoever. We expect to hear at the very <span class="col_0799-0800" refersTo="page_0419"/>earliest opportunity of <i>a</i> dynamic policy by this Government to deal with soil conservation in a well-planned, systematic way, which will get rid of all the red tape which is strangling our staff to-day and which does not allow the best utilization of our available manpower, and a method which makes adequate provision for using purposefully those members of the agricultural community who can no longer make a living on the land.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not even think it is necessary for me to express my sympathy towards the farmers in the extremely difficult drought conditions they are suffering at the moment in most parts of our country. I think I can say that they are aware and that they know from experience, that this Government does in fact have a great deal of sympathy for them in these extremely difficult conditions. I also think that since the hon. member for East London (City) referred to the fact that the S.A. Agricultural Union will come to see me on 14th March, and since he has asked me not to put it off until that date but to see them to-morrow, I just want to point out that I did not ask to see the S.A. Agricultural Union only on 14th March; the S.A. Agricultural Union asked me to see them on 14th March. And do you know what the reason for that is, Sir? They said that they first wanted to consult their people, and the hon. member pointed out that he was one person they still wanted to consult. The hon. member is now taking it amiss of me, and is saying that 14th of March is too late; I must tell the S.A. Agricultural Union to come earlier. I will see them to-morrow if they want to come and submit their plans to me.</p>

<p>We have been listening this afternoon to a whole lot of theoretical statements which were made in regard to the drought, and it is very easy for any hon. member opposite to theorise&#x2014;as they in fact did. We listened here to accusations to the effect that on the one hand not enough was being done for soil conservation and the preservation of our soil, and on the other hand to a plea from the same hon. members opposite asking that we should enable the farmers to keep the same number of stock on that same land in the present drought conditions, and that we make fodder available. [Interjection.] But you know you said it. Do not pretend not to understand now. We must make fodder available in order to keep the same number of stock on the same land, which has become trampled over the years under better conditions, and more in fact, as the hon. member for East London (City) put it, so that the land can be trampled to an even greater extent. I am simply mentioning this to show how easy it is to theorize here and to make the accusation on the one hand that the soil has been trampled owing to the excessive numbers of stock on it, and to make the accusation on the other hand that it is the fault of the Government that there are fewer numbers now and that the same land no longer has the same carrying capacity; and then to add the request that fodder should be made available in such quantities, by fodder banks, etc., so as to increase those numbers of stock even further, which would result in further soil erosion. That is what hon. members are advocating, and I am merely mentioning this to show how they theorise on this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) went further. He mentioned examples of what other countries were doing, countries such as our neighbouring states, to transfer stock from parts where fodder was not available, and were making it possible for farmers to purchase stock in parts where conditions were poor and to take these to parts where conditions were better. But there is nothing in South Africa which prohibits this. On the contrary, this Government is helping to make this possible. It is lending assistance by means of the Land Bank and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board. The year before last a special scheme was introduced by means of which we financed one of the co-operative societies to enable it to carry out that scheme to which the hon. member referred. But the hon. member maintains that the Government is doing nothing in that respect. He simply makes a statement and does not believe it himself, but he wants the public to believe it. That is why I say the hon. member is theorising, but now I want to ask him very specifically: Where in South Africa to-day are there conditions where people can buy up large numbers of stock in the drought-stricken areas and take them to places in other parts of the country where fodder is available? We must look at the facts, and the fact of the matter is that in most parts of our country&#x2014;this applies to 90 per cent of our country&#x2014;there are simply no places where farmers are able to remove stock from poorer grazing to better grazing and fatten the animals there for marketing purposes. That position does not exist. Now it is easy to accuse the Government of doing nothing in this respect. I am merely mentioning this to show how easy it is to talk about these things. Hon. members spoke for a whole year on agriculture and asked that a commission of inquiry into agriculture be appointed. That commission was appointed and it brought out an interim report which dealt specifically with this matter, i.e. the drought in South Africa. I thought that on an occasion such as this hon. members opposite would tell us what their standpoint is in regard to the report of the commission.</p>

<p>No, hon. members did not say anything last year, because they are still making propaganda here to-day about things which are in direct conflict with the recommendations of that commission. They now maintain that they support the recommendations of the commission. Is that what they are saying? Does the Opposition support the recommendations of the commission in regard to the drought? I am asking a simple question. <span class="col_0801-0802" refersTo="page_0420"/>Does the Opposition support the interim report on the drought by the commission of inquiry into agriculture? Do you see, Sir, they do not want to say whether they support it, and I know why, it is because that commission recommended to some extent what the hon. member for Walmer asked for a moment ago. He recommended that any assistance rendered by the State to farmers in South Africa during the drought should only be rendered to farmers who could prove that they had applied soil conservation measures in their farming practice. Do you agree with that?</p>

<p>That is not the question, i.e. whether it is correct in theory.

I agree with the hon. member that it is correct in theory. I also agree that one cannot implement that recommendation in a time of emergency, because conditions are such that one is simply unable to implement it.</p>

<p>But now I want to return to the hon. member for Walmer. He levelled the accusation that nothing was being done for soil conservation; that the Government had allowed the soil to wash away and be blown away, and that soil erosion was taking place. Now I want to ask him this question: Is he in favour&#x2014;and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, or anybody on that side, can also reply&#x2014;of the Government taking steps to compel farmers to apply soil conservation on their land? [Interjection.] I am asking whether hon. members opposite are in favour of the Government making it compulsory in the Soil Conservation Act that farmers should apply soil conservation measures in order to prevent the catchment area of the Orange River, to which he referred, from deteriorating to the extent to which it is in fact taking place?</p>

Is the Leader of the Opposition prepared to say to the country that he will maintain the price of mutton, which is being sold on the controlled market at a floor price, in such a way that he will enable the farmer to do all these things which hon. members are asking him to do, regardless of whether this is done during a drought or during good conditions. [Interjections.] I know the hon. the Leader will not say yes, because he cannot.

<p>And it fails.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Where has it failed? With the supply of this demand one can take steps to regulate it so that all the produce does not reach the market at the same time, and so that a better price can be obtained. This is being done by means of the Marketing Act. If there is an industry where special problems exist, one cannot with the marketing of that product, subsidize the price so as to enable the farmer to obtain an income. That was done to a great extent in the past. But no government, and I least of all, will say that a farmer can produce any product and that as far as that product is concerned he will receive the assurance from the State, which amounts indirectly to an assurance from the taxpayer, that he will under all circumstances obtain his production costs plus a profit for that produce. I am not prepared to say that, the hon. member cannot say it either, nor will the Leader of the Opposition be prepared to say it. It is the most impossible promise any Minister or any government could make. Within the context of production it will be the duty of any government such as this one to try and obtain, with the marketing of that product, the best price on that market by means of control measures. Arising out of the statement which the hon. member made in respect of the assurance of production costs, I now want to ask the hon. member a simple question. As far as I am aware the prickly pear is the plant which grows best in the Karoo, and it sometimes serves a useful purpose. Now will any government, because this is the best produce to grow there, guarantee the farmer his production costs plus a profit when he wants to sell prickly pears? This statement I am now making is a ridiculous one, but it applies to any product if there is no market where one can sell it. In regard to the question of prices the hon. member for Newton Park quoted certain figures. With those the hon. member tried to prove that the drought conditions and the position in which agriculture finds itself at the moment is not in fact owing to the drought conditions, but is the result of the price policy being followed by the Government. He quoted certain of last year&#x2019;s figures to demonstrate that the unit price of certain products had been lower last year than in the previous year. With the figures the hon. member tried to prove that curbs are being imposed on the farmers by this Government and that they are worse off.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I pointed out the dilemma of the farmer. The decreasing producer&#x2019;s price and the increasing production costs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member cannot calculate the farmer&#x2019;s income solely on the basis of a producer&#x2019;s price. During the same year to which the hon. member referred, when the producer&#x2019;s price was lower than the previous year, the overall income of the farmer in one industry only, i.e. the mealie industry, was R175 million more than in the previous year. The same number of morgen of land had then been planted. It is not correct therefore to hold up a unit price in agriculture as the price basis which should be the barometer indicating whether the farmers are having a hard time or whether things are going well. That is not the barometer. The farmers&#x2019; income is determined to a greater extent by crop circumstances and the production per morgen, and that is why in agriculture things are quite different than in industry, say. In industry unit production can be determined according to the demand, but in agriculture where the unit production varies from year to year, this cannot be done.</p>

<p>This is in fact a problem which we are now experiencing during the drought, It is not because our prices are not good enough, it is for the very reason that our unit production has decreased owing to the drought, also because of the costs incurred in combating it. The total production has decreased and even if the unit price had increased, it would have done nothing to remedy the matter. If the hon. member had received two or three cents per pound more for his wool, but had been unable to produce any wool, it would not have made any difference to him. I am merely mentioning this to indicate that hon. members, when they offer solutions of this kind, are to a large extent theorizing. With their theorizing they are accusing the Government of doing nothing about this matter. I shall still come to that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) stated that the subsidies and loans for fodder were landing the farmers in even greater difficulties. Nobody denies this. Nobody denies that if it never rains in South Africa again and these people have to pay these loans, they would be worse off than they would have been if they had not incurred these loans. This assistance and these loans are not granted on the assumption that we will not have rains during the next few years. Nobody could have predicted that the present drought would prevail for such a long time. We must remember that we are not dealing here with a situation which always remains static, but with fluctuating situations. During this prolonged drought we have been experiencing there were occasional good years. I just want to mention a few figures as an example. We introduced the veld reclamation and withdrawal scheme in those very parts where the veld had deteriorated, and did so in spite of the accusation levelled by the hon. member to the ffect that we were doing nothing about this.</p>

<p>I want you to introduce it in the Karoo as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall furnish the hon. member with the figures. This scheme was introduced on 1st September, 1966, on 32 million morgen of land in the Transvaal, the Northern Cape and the North West Cape. Now hon. members must remember these figures. The compensation for that was R8 per large stock unit per year. In reality it amounted to R16 per year, because after two years the farmer could make full use of the veld which had been rehabilitated. In the Transvaal 911 participated in this scheme; in the Free State 142 and in the Karoo 120. It was possible to withdraw a third of this 32 million morgen, i.e. more than 10 million morgen. A total of 1.15 per cent of this 32 million morgen could be reutilized, that is to say less than 10 per cent of that land which had been withdrawn from the scheme. In the Transvaal there were 911 applications in 1966 to join this scheme, but in the first year after it had rained, the total number of applications decreased to 700. While the total number of applications in the Karoo had been 180, this number increased to 333, since the drought there persisted. These figures indicate that we are not only dealing with schemes and measures which have to be applied, but also with individuals. We are dealing with people who themselves decide whether they want to participate in such schemes. These are people who are also influenced by conditions in agriculture. We are now going to expand this scheme. We are going to extend this scheme to cover the entire Karoo, as big as it is, because with the drought conditions there have now become worse. Apart from the areas to which I have just referred, we are also going to extend the scheme to Graaff Reinet, Aberdeen, Pearston, Somerset East, Cradock the Tarka Conservation Area, Jansenville, Murraysburg, Steytlerville, Victoria West and the remaining sections of Carnarvon, Fraserburg, Beaufort West and Prince Albert which were not previously included.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that we should include Walmer as well, but I do not know whether the hon. member for Walmer would agree with that. I want to say again that I am convinced that our people will now want to avail themselves of this scheme as a result of the exceptional drought conditions. I am equally convinced that if we have good rains next year, most of them will not make further use of the scheme.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the decrease in the number of people in our platteland. Hon. members will remember that we received the report from the commission. We tried to incorporate a means of encouraging people to look after their soil and to conserve it in the auxiliary measures to which I referred. The hon. member also referred to the auxiliary measures we included in the Soil Conservation Act. Now he is accusing us of having made no progress with these, but the hon. member himself mentioned the figures for the approved works which have not been carried out. The reason for the approved works not being carried out, was not that they were not approved, but because for various reasons the farmers omitted to do so. One of the reasons which is at the moment perhaps the most obvious one, is the drought we are experiencing. Perhaps the farmer was not economically in a position to do so. If someone wants to accuse the Government of not doing these things, he must also agree that we must compel the farmer to take certain steps. Provision for subsidies exists, and they can get a subsidy for fencing and stock watering-places.</p>

<p>But soil conservation does not merely consist of the construction of fences and the building of contours. These are in reality the last steps one takes in respect of soil conservation. The basic step is the biological conservation of the soil. The drought has shown us that stock-keeping in most parts of our country is of such a nature that it is adjusted to optimum conditions. When we do not have those optimum conditions we are faced with the problem that the stock-keeping is too high and that the veld deteriorates. We must take steps to combat those conditions, and we are in fact going to do so in terms of our Soil Conservation Act.</p>

<p>We are also going to take steps in terms of the Soil Conservation Act to enforce certain measures upon the farmers, where these were previously of a voluntary nature. Legislation in this connection will subsequently be introduced. And consequently I want hon. members to be consistent in their attitude to-day. They must then support the Government in its positive attempts to make soil conservation in South Africa compulsory as far as those people are concerned who are not prepared to adopt these measures. I see the hon. member for Newton Park is already sitting looking at me, because he is thinking of the fine propaganda he is going to make of what I have now said. He is going to tell the farmers in his area that they are going to be compelled to take soil conservation steps and he is going to tell them how this Government is now becoming a dictatorial government which wants to compel people to do things. Mr. Speaker, I can even see on his face how much he is already enjoying himself. That hon. member is going to enjoy himself very much when he sees the farmers and tells them that the Government is going to tell them how they must farm. I can see how delighted he already is.</p>

<p><span class="col_0807-0808" refersTo="page_0423"/>I now want to come to the drought as such. As a result of the prolonged drought which we are at present experiencing there is not one person in South Africa who will deny that our farmers to-day are in an unenviable position. Everybody is aware of the tremendous problems we have to deal with in order to keep stock alive, and the allied problem of the deterioration of our soil. All of us are aware of the problems we have with the provision of water for our animals in the platteland. All of us are aware of the problems facing our co-operative societies situated in the production areas. In addition there is still the problem co-operative societies and other bodies are having with financing. At the same time our farmers have problems with their own financing. These are no new problems. All of us are aware of them. As these conditions present themselves, steps are taken to deal with them. I do not want to burden the House with figures in this regard. I can mention thousands of figures in respect of what has already been done in the form of subsidies for fodder, loans, rebates on railages, food supplies to farmers, fencing and camps and the establishment of fodder banks. The hon. member referred to how it was made possible for the S.A. Agricultural Union last year to accumulate fodder so that it could be supplied to the farmers with the Government&#x2019;s guarantee in this regard. Then the hon. member states that nothing is being done. All these things are being done. But in spite of all these auxiliary measures, the drought has assumed these proportions. I do not think the hon. members could have predicted the extent of the drought last year or the year before last. All of us hoped that conditions would change. Because agriculture is such an important industry, and because it is one of our basic industries, and has to accomplish all the things hon. members referred to, particularly the provision of food to our country, it is obvious that the Government will from time to time have to add special measures to those which already exist. I shall not at this juncture mention all the existing measures which are aimed at keeping farmers in the platteland and enabling them to continue producing. This is obviously the case because it is such a fundamental industry, quite apart from the human material we have to deal with. The steps which are taken, however, cannot be summed up in one word. One cannot say that the Government should simply do this, that or the other. The simplest or most economical method of keeping our people on the platteland to-day would perhaps be to give every farmer a few thousand rand per year so that he can live on that. But then he must withdraw his stock completely from the land. That, of course, is totally unpractical. It would be as theoretic as many of the things the hon. member for Newton Park suggested. Whatever one does, the link between the farmer and his soil must be retained. The link between the farmer and his financial institutions must also be retained as far as possible. We do not want to make the farmer a slave or a tenant farmer of the State. The requests the hon. member addressed here were not even necessary. It is obvious that if the State has introduced auxiliary measures by means of loans in order to enable people to purchase fodder for their animals, the Government will not call in those loans immediately. The Government will not say to the farmer that if the loan is granted for a year it must be paid back at the end of that year if conditions are such that the Government knows that the farmer is unable to do so. Why did the Government lend that assistance in the first place? I do not even think it is necessary for me as Minister to give the farmers outside the assurance that if, owing to circumstances they cannot pay back the loans, the Government will not force them to pay back those loans. Why was the original assistance offered them? Methods will then be applied to enable them to pay their debts one day when they are able to do so. All the auxiliary schemes we introduced, those in the wool industry, in our co-operatives for providing their members with production credits, the scheme of agricultural credit, have one basis, i.e. that the debt can be paid over a longer term, and if circumstances change, we can extend the term. That is the whole basis of all our auxiliary schemes. It is not even necessary for me to give an assurance in this regard.</p>

<p>What about the rates of interest?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>All the loans are made available by the State at 5 per cent interest. It is a very difficult situation, and the hon. member opposite is fully aware that a general subsidy on the rate of interest is not such an easy thing. It is not only the farmer in difficult circumstances, the man experiencing drought conditions who receives the subsidy, but also the farmer who has loans at much higher land prices and under much better conditions. It is therefore not so easy to say that we are going to subsidize the farmers&#x2019; rates of interest on their mortgage liabilities or anything else for that matter. Last year the Government decreased the rate of interest by a half per cent and it can happen that it will be done again in future.</p>

<p>I think the farmers of South Africa have had sufficient experience of this Government&#x2019;s actions precisely at a time when they were experiencing these particularly difficult conditions. Hon. members opposite referred to the Government&#x2019;s actions and the policy which is being followed, and they then selected the past few years during which we have been experiencing droughts, and stated that these were the conditions which had arisen because this Government had no long-term policy in <span class="col_0809-0810" refersTo="page_0424"/>respect of prices, etc. They then uttered grave warnings about future production of foodstuffs and stated that owing to the Government&#x2019;s short-sightedness there would not be enough farmers to produce the necessary food. Over the past 20 years, during which this side has been in power, our grain and our fruit production in all their ramifications have always increased in spite of the droughts and other unfavourable conditions. Notwithstanding the droughts the amount of meat being offered at our markets has always increased. The total production of the agricultural sector has increased tremendously. Now I want to ask the hon. member this question: If we had had good rains this year, at what level would our production have stood? We can consider maize, meat, whatever we want to. Even in the dry years there was for a long time an overabundant supply of mutton on the market.</p>

<p>There is something else I want to refer to, which is this. On each occasion it is alleged by that side that our soil is deteriorating and that soil conservation measures are not being applied. Although the Government is not the owner of the land, the Government is accused of not doing enough in respect of soil conservation. But this reproach is also being levelled at a great many of our farmers, i.e. by implying that a large part of our country is being washed away. I want to concede that there is room for very great improvement as far as soil conservation is concerned but, added to that I want to say that a very large number of our farmers, have, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which they found themselves, shown us during the past few years that with the aid of the correct farming methods&#x2014;and this is after all the basis of soil conservation&#x2014;we have been able to increase our agricultural production tremendously, and for that I want to take my hat off to our farmers. I think it is time somebody expressed appreciation of our farmers, because they are people who have, to a very large extent, and often under difficult circumstances brought large tracts of our country which were previously unproductive under production to-day. We need not go very far in order to see what I mean. We can merely look at areas here in the Western Province, in the South Western Districts. We can go and take a look at large parts of the Free State. Unfortunately the Karoo is experiencing very difficult drought conditions. But hon. members can drive around and see the well-conserved farms we have in many parts of the country. Nevertheless it is being said that we have done nothing; that we are degenerating. Let us view these things in the correct perspective as well.</p>

<p>I say again that I am not going to burden hon. members this afternoon with details of the various schemes introduced by the Government; I am not going to burden hon. members with the details of the millions of rand which have been spent in this regard. I do not want to mention the precise figures because I am afraid that if the people know what is really being spent on the agricultural sector in South Africa, a feeling of antipathy towards agriculture could arise. At this stage we have a great deal of sympathy for the agricultural sector because it is dry, but it will not always be dry. If the people were to know what is actually being spent on agriculture, I wonder whether we would not be strongly criticized for doing too much for our agricultural industry.</p>

<p>I would just like to return for a moment to the hon. member for East London (City). On different occasions now he has asked for a fodder bank to be established in South Africa in order to supply fodder in times of drought. A while back the hon. member mentioned all kinds of things, but I want to tell him that during the past few years lucerne has not been exported from South Africa. No ground-nut meal or hay was destroyed. The people producing that stuff utilize it fully themselves. At this stage we are very fortunate in that there is not as yet a <span class="col_0811-0812" refersTo="page_0425"/>shortage of mealies&#x2014;I do not know what crop is going to be produced. Surely the hon. member himself knows that if a fodder bank is established it will have to be established in a time of reasonable prosperity, I am talking now about a time of good rains. After all, I know what that fodder is going to cost when the farmers need it, and no farmer is going to take it if he does not need it. It will make the industry even more uneconomic if we have to store cheap hay for three, four, five or six years so that it can be available when we experience this kind of drought disaster, perhaps once in 30 years, or less. That is why a fodder bank in South Africa, in the sense in which the hon. member referred to it, is a totally uneconomic proposition.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that circumstances determine this matter. They also determine the price. A few years ago we also experienced droughts, have, oats and chaff were sold in the Western Province at 36, 37 and 40 cents per bale. The people stored the stuff, and then it rained and a week later they could not sell it for 10 cents. They were then left with great heaps of chaff and hay which they had accumulated. Economy determines this type of thing. It is not the Government&#x2019;s task to purchase these products when there is a plentiful supply and store it in order to supply the country and the administration at tremendous expense in times of drought. I maintain that it is an impossible task.</p>

<heading>JOINT MATRICULATION BOARD</heading>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of investigating the function of the Joint Matriculation Board, specifically in respect of formulating the qualifications for admission to universities, in order to provide for needs arising from changed circumstances.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Joint Matriculation Board was established by section 16 of Act No. 12 of 1916, in which the two most important functions of the Joint Matriculation Board were laid down, i.e. that it would, in the first place, conduct the matriculation examinations of various universities and that it would, in the second place, determine the conditions of exemption from the matriculation examination. During the course of years this Act has been amended on a number of occasions, but it was amended for the most part in respect of the constitution of the Joint Matriculation Board, <i>inter alia,</i> because more universities were included and obtained representation on the Joint Matriculation Board. These amendments were, <i>inter alia,</i> introduced by means of Act No. 30 of 1920, Act 29 of 1934, Act 21 of 1939, Act 3 of 1942, Act 61 of 1955 and Act 9 of 1960. However, the most important function, i.e. that of prescribing the conditions of exemption from the matriculation examination, subject to the approval of the Minister of National Education, remained in force. The requirements for admission to a university, with which the matriculant has to comply, have been observed since December, 1918, when the first examination was conducted in terms of the provisions of the Act of 1916. Subsequently the pass requirements for university admission were raised at a meeting of the Joint Matriculation Board in January, 1958 in Cape Town, despite opposition from various provincial educational heads. On that occasion I had a seat in the Joint Matriculation Board, and that is why I remember it. At the end of 1960 the provision to the effect that the average percentage which candidates had to attain for university admission should be raised from 40 per cent to 44.4 per cent came into effect. In general, the public speak of 45 per cent. It was only possible to effect this increase because the representatives of the universities had a majority vote on the Joint Matriculation Board. In fact, it is laid down in this way by Act 61 of 1955, section 15 (4), which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The number of representatives appointed under each paragraph of subsection (3), their period of office and the manner of their appointment shall be prescribed by joint statute: Provided that so many representatives [of the universities] shall be appointed as will exceed the total number of all other representatives appointed by five.</block>

<p>At that time it was believed in certain circles that the raising of the pass requirement for university admission, which came into operation towards the end of 1960, was intended to draw academically stronger candidates to the universities in order&#x2014;as was said&#x2014;to reduce the number of first-year failures at the universities. Well, at that time a great deal of discussion took place in regard to the large number of first-year failures at universities. I <span class="col_0813-0814" refersTo="page_0426"/>do not want to elaborate on the question of whether any success was achieved in this specific aim&#x2014;if it was a specific aim. Even to-day there is still a great deal of discussion on the matter of first-year failures; in fact, the hon. the Minister of National Education appointed a commission of inquiry towards the end of last year with specific instructions to go into this matter as well. Before I elaborate further on my argument I want to emphasize that it is not my intention to advocate a lowering&#x2014;with that I mean a horizontal lowering&#x2014;of the pass requirement in regard to special subjects for university admission, which is controlled by the Joint Matriculation Board. I should like to ask that the hon. the Minister listen to my incidental plea in this regard.</p>

<p>Not long ago sporadic voices were raised and pleas were made to the effect that the pass requirement of the matriculation examination for admission to the university should be raised even further, to 50 per cent for example. On this occasion I want to ask the hon. the Minister to refrain from complying with that plea. My reason for doing so is principally that many pupils who find it difficult to comply with the present pass requirements for admission to the university because they are perhaps not so well equipped intellectually, nevertheless do well at university; and not only at university, but in later life as well. They do well precisely because they are bolstered by important personality traits such as perseverance, the ability to work hard, devotion to duty, purposefulness and ambition. When a raising of the matriculation standard&#x2014;as controlled by the Joint Matriculation Board&#x2014;is prescribed, it must be borne in mind that admission will as a result of that be refused to a certain grout? of students who can in fact be successful at universities. The spotlight and the criticism of public interest has, particularly in the past decade or two, shifted to a marked degree to the level of tertiary, that is to say, university education. In the past a university was a kind of isolated and unapproachable academic sanctum, and the general public were too modest to express an opinion on it, and very few people did in fact have the courage to express criticism. As far as this is concerned, this state of affairs has changed a great deal during the past few years. An increasing number of students have been admitted to our universities, and they have become more and more representative of our general public. In addition an increasing amount of interest in the efficiency of our tertiary education has arisen. Where universities a few decades ago were supported, maintained and controlled by a certain sector of society only, a significant change has now taken place. The community has by means of taxation acquired a say in the matter, because it is they who make the subsidies on the part of the State to the universities possible. In 1968 between 66 and 84 per cent, depending upon the size of the university, of the revenue of the university derived from the State, and in addition there was a favourable capital provision. Professor C. H. Rautenbach, rector of the University of Pretoria, and also chairman of the Advisory Education Council has termed this phenomenon of communal interest a democratisational process. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The result of this process of democratisation has been that university training is no longer allotted to the so-called intellectual elite only, but a much broader layer of the community are now able to attend university.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the demands of the time are such that effective provision has to be made by means of university education for the present-day requirements, which are becoming increasingly heterogenous. Consequently it is necessary that a much larger percentage of the population should be given university training. I emphasize that the community is taking a greater interest because the community is, through its children, being represented at university to an ever-increasing extent. That is consequently why the public is displaying more interest than ever before in an aspect such as the admission requirements for a university.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this motion which I am dealing with was also in part stimulated by public interest, which can in some cases be of a personal nature because it could involve a parent which had a young son or daughter who had been prejudiced by the restrictive admission requirements. An eminent, well-known person in educational circles, recently told me that as far as he was concerned the Joint Matriculation Board was an anachronism. But I do not agree with this, because the Joint Matriculation Board has nevertheless moved in the direction of making provision for changing requirements, and I want to mention a few examples here. As long ago as the mid-forties permission was granted to commercial schools to offer economy as an exemption subject instead of nature study and chemistry, which is a science subject and a requirement, and recently the Joint Matriculation Board also resolved to grant exemption under certain conditions to candidates in the Transvaal who had passed the normal matriculation examination, i.e. the present well-known B-stream. In addition the Board also decided to recognize, under specified conditions, the South African Technical Certificate for exemption purposes.</p>

<p>While to my mind the Joint Matriculation Board is moving in a positive and realistic direction, the progress it is making is nevertheless too slow. In respect of university admission in my opinion, the Joint Matriculation Board is clinging too desperately to the idea of the superiority of subjects such as science, mathematics and a third language, as against subjects like history, geography, book-keeping and commerce, to mention only a few. I know <span class="col_0815-0816" refersTo="page_0427"/>that in the past very long arguments were conducted in regard to the formative value of mathematics, Latin and science, for example, subjects which I myself took for my matric. But which subjects do in effect have more formative value than others? To my mind the formative value of subjects lies as much in the methods by means of which that subject is taught as in the subject itself. To my mind it is merely hypothetical to state that a science can have greater formative value than history, and even economy.</p>

<p>The present admission requirements to the university for a matriculant, as laid down by the Joint Matriculation Board, are the official languages, mathematics, or a third language, and a science subject. I think that these requirements were those which were laid down as long ago as the year 1918, and they still remain unchanged to-day. Sir, except for minor concessions, such as those which I have just mentioned, these basic requirements have remained. My question now is this: While individual differences between pupils are recognized and accepted&#x2014;and this is educationally as well as psychologically correct and it is also regarded as a sound distinction&#x2014;do the admission requirements make adequate provision for these individual differences? Where an individual does well in the so-called formative subjects which do in fact comply with the admission requirements, does he do well in them because he has a higher intelligence than that of another candidate, or does he do well in those subjects because he has an aptitude for or a particular interest in that subject of subjects? It is obvious that an individual will make much better progress in the subjects for which he has an aptitude and in which he displays an interest. If he is now compelled by restrictive requirement in respect of university admission as far as his choice of subjects is concerned, to choose subjects for which he has no aptitude and in which he may have no interest, then he is like the proverbial fish on dry land.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the universities are offering an increasing number of subjects and courses to comply with the demands of the community. Last year for example the University of Pretoria, in its 11 faculties, offered so many directions of study that approximately 120 different degrees could be obtained. To-day even more courses of study and subjects have been added. I do not want to advocate that the university should throw open its doors, nor do I want to plead that the requirements for admission to a subject should be lowered horizontally, but since the universities are offering an increasing number of subjects and courses it is really essential that the entrance or the approach to the universities should be made somewhat wider, in other words, that the requirements should be expanded vertically to some extent. I do not think that this will in fact entail that a greater number of unqualified candidates will find themselves at university, but it will entail that candidates who have a particular potential for a specific direction or directions will be admitted to the universities, and that they will be granted the opportunity of developing to the full the potential they have at their disposal, so that they may subsequently serve our society. In this connection I should like to read a quotation from the report of an interview which was recently conducted with Professor Rautenbach, to whom I have just referred. On this occasion he had the following, <i>inter alia,</i> to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As yet there is by no means an over-abundant supply of university trained graduates in the Republic, and a broad stream of intellectually developed people is still necessary in order to meet the requirements of the country. Only 10 per cent of the school population of the country reach university level.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should now like to mention a few practical examples. To my mind it seems unnecessary that the student who selects B.Com. or B.A. (Economics) or even B.A. (Drama) as a course should in fact have a science subject in order to be admitted to university. In my opinion it is not necessary either that a person who wants to take B.A. (Languages) should have a science or mathematics in order to obtain admission. It also appears unnecessary to me that a pupil in an agricultural high school, for example in the Transvaal, who has already taken two official languages and who is studying an additional science subject, who in fact wants to study agricultural subjects such as agronomy and stock breeding, should in fact have a third language or even mathematics. Sir, a subject such as bookkeeping, and even perhaps some other subject, will possibly be of equally great practical value if such a person would perhaps like to take a B.A. degree in agriculture at the university.</p>

<p>Sir, the needs of our community in the technical, technological industrial and commercial directions have expanded tremendously during the last decade, and this requires tertiary training for people who in due course will have to take the lead in the various fields. I am asking again: Have the requirements of the Joint Matriculation Board for university admission kept pace with this?</p>

<p>In most overseas countries there is in fact a duplicating body which issues instructions in respect of requirements for admission to the university, but there are in fact countries such as Canada, for example, where there is no national body regulating university admission, and in this case the individual universities stipulate their admission requirements. Sir, I am not really supporting this course. The Joint Matriculation Board, as an umbrella body, does nevertheless fulfil an important task, particularly in that it guarantees a measure of uniformity in respect of control and admission to university. But as far as I <span class="col_0817-0818" refersTo="page_0428"/>could ascertain, with the little study that I was able to make of the subject, there are no other countries where the admission requirements are so strict as they are in our case. I would like to suggest that an investigation be instituted, if it is not already being done or has not already been done, into the possibilities of making university admission requirements more streamlined, so as to adjust them to the changing and more differentiated requirements of our society. In the first place this can possibly be done by making the present requirements less restrictive. Where we for example have mathematics or a third language and a science subject as requirement to-day, apart from the two official languages, I want to express the idea that only one of that third and fourth group of subjects should be necessary, i.e. only one subject out of the group mathematics or a third language and a science subject. Otherwise there is of course the possibility of basing admission on the directions of study of the various courses. What I mean here for example is a scientific direction; I am talking about a social science direction, an agricultural or perhaps a commercial direction. The university then lays down specific admission requirements for the specific direction of study, and the Joint Matriculation Board can continue to fulfil a function by preventing the admission requirements for the same direction of study at the various universities from becoming too divergent.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, arising out of my motion on the Order Paper, I want to recommend that differentiated requirements for admission to specific directions of study at universities should be investigated as a principle, and that the subject requirements for admission to the university should then be adjusted according to that principle.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Koedoespoort has presented his case remarkably well. Whether one accepts his proposal or not is another matter, but I think the manner in which he has put forward his case deserves the thanks of this House. I do not think he could have expressed it in a better manner. We know what his difficulty is. It is the requirement of mathematics or the third language. He feels that that is too difficult, or unsuitable for some people.</p>

<p>Now, when we speak about matriculation, what do we mean? Matriculation means the entry of a student&#x2019;s name on a list for admission to a university. It is as simple as that. In South Africa we have given another meaning to matriculation in ordinary conversation. We have sometimes confused it with an ordinary school certificate, the final examination in a secondary school. But matriculation itself means admission to a university. Therefore I think it is elementary to say that whatever we discuss and whatever we propose, the final say in deciding who is to be admitted to a university must lie in the hands of the university people themselves; They are the people to say who should be there. We on both sides of this House speak of university autonomy and We also speak of academic freedom. They have a great deal in common, and there are usually three Or four elements. One is that the university should decide who shall teach; secondly, what they shall teach; and, thirdly, whom they shall teach, who is to be admitted to that university for instruction. Whatever method we discuss and whatever we decide, it is clearly understood, I think, that the university must eventually have the final say. And the hon. the Minister in his legislation agrees with that, because on his Matriculation Board the universities have the majority vote; and should there be division of opinion amongst the universities then it is possible that new ideas could be accepted and considered. Now, besides the universities deciding on admission to their institutions, there are the institutions who supply the students, namely the schools. Therefore the secondary schools, the schoolmasters, should have representation on this board which decides on admission; and the hon. the Minister in his legislation makes provision for that representation. They are the second partner.</p>

<p>Then there is a third partner. In addition to the schools there is the representation of the various education authorities. The directors of education of the four provinces nominate men to represent them. But there is another partner, and that is the professional bodies: there are more than one of these professional bodies. You have, for example, the medical profession. The medical profession says that although you may be admitted to a university, if you are going to take a course in medicine, in addition to the course you take for matriculation, they will insist on certain subjects being taken in the medical course. And our legal men say that in the training of a lawyer you can take the two languages and you can take mathematics and a third language, but you must take Latin. We have heard debates in this House by lawyers who say that Latin is not really necessary. But the point is this, that if the man says he is matriculated and he now wishes to train as a lawyer, then, in addition to satisfying the requirements of the university, he has to satisfy the requirements of the legal profession. Take accountancy. We may say that a third language or mathematics is not necessary, but the accountants will say that for their profession you must have mathematics. So, these are the various bodies which are concerned with deciding who will be admitted to a university. I have some sympathy with the views of the hon. member for Koedoespoort. We have all gone through that experience of the admission of primary school students to secondary schools, and hon. members who are members of the teaching profession will remember that several years ago we had promotion at what they called overseas &#x201C;11 plus&#x201D;. In our country it was &#x201C;12 plus&#x201D;. That is to say, in the child&#x2019;s <span class="col_0819-0820" refersTo="page_0429"/>thirteenth year we decided whether he should go to high school or to a vocational school or to some other school, but there has been a reaction against that. There has been a reaction overseas. They find there is a type of student who is called a &#x201C;late developer&#x201D;, a lad who at the age of 13 was not an outstanding student. In fact, some of the great scientists of the world are in that category. [Interjections.] There are men, you will find, in that category who in the primary school stage do not show the promise they may show four or five years later. I have actually had such cases in my experience and I am sure the members of my profession have also had such cases. Therefore we have to be careful in regard to this question of admission and there is that to be said for the suggestion of the hon. member for Koedoespoort. But the tendency overseas in regard to university education is in the opposite direction to what he advocates. Instead of the ordinary matriculation examination to-day, they have introduced in England&#x2014;I do not say in Britain, because we must always be clear in our minds that the English system of education is not the Scottish system; they are two quite different systems. The Scottish system is one of the oldest and best in the world. The two great systems of education, I am speaking now of 150 years ago, were those of Prussia and Scotland. But I am speaking now of the English system. Overseas they have introduced these examinations. They say, first of all, there is to be a school certificate at what they call the O level, the ordinary level&#x2014;O for ordinary. Going into the matter when I was over there, I came to the conclusion that it was something corresponding to our Std. 9. After that O level, they have an A level, and before a student can be admitted to a university he has to have at least two A levels, two subjects he has taken on the higher level. There is nothing new in that. When I took matriculation there were subjects one could take which they called &#x201C;higher alternative papers&#x201D;, after one matriculated, if one matriculated young. We also had that system in South Africa, in the Transvaal. In the Transvaal one could take mathematics and one could take higher mathematics. In other words, we anticipated this movement overseas, of the A level student. If the student is going to be a science student, you would expect him to take two subjects, mathematics and physical science, on the A level, and if he is going to be a classics scholar he is expected to take English or Latin and perhaps a modern language or Greek on the A level. They have obtained that type of student through introducing this system. I suppose the Minister&#x2019;s staff have gone into that and I am sure they have all that information.</p>

<p>Now we come to this motion. What shall we say about the terms of the motion moved by the hon. member for Koedoespoort? Let us look at it. It says that this House &#x201C;requests the Government to consider the advisability of investigating the function of the Joint Matriculation Board&#x201D;. Well, I assume the hon. the Minister is always investigating it. He has an education staff and he always has the examination under review. Then the motion continues &#x201C;specifically in respect of formulating the qualification for admission to universities, in order to provide for needs arising from changed circumstances&#x201D;. Now, what does the hon. the Minister do if he has to carry out his system? He says: &#x201C;I have a matriculation board.&#x201D; And that matriculation board is appointed in the manner which he prescribes. Now, why does the hon. member come along at this early stage of the Session to ask the Minister to do something about this when last year we had a Bill before us which became law? There were four clauses in that Bill. Of the four clauses we of the United Party accepted three immediately. One clause dealt with the Matriculation Board. About the fourth clause we were a little hesitant, but the hon. member for Houghton was not prepared to accept clause 4. However, we accepted it because the Minister gave us certain assurances. But that did not arise in this context that we are discussing to-day. What does arise is that the first clause in the Bill of last year dealt with the constitution of the Matriculation Board. We expressed our appreciation of what the Minister had done, but there was not a sound from the other side. That was their opportunity. Why did you not climb in then? Why did you not say to the Minister that you did not like his clause? There was the opportunity. We could have discussed this matter then.</p>

<p>But there was the opportunity. We could have discussed this then. We could then have said that this constitution of the Matriculation Board is not the constitution we would like. How are we going to change the constitution of the board now? I think the Minister has done what is necessary. He says: I am going to have a board constituted in this manner. As an intelligent and wise Minister he does not say that this man, or that one, must go on the board, except for one or two members of his own Department. He says to the universities: Give me the men. He says to the schools: Give me your men, and when you have these men you can advise me and tell me what to do. But I do not expect the Minister to appoint a commission to go into the work of the Matriculation Board. If he were to do that, naturally it would be a university inquiry. That brings me back to my first point.</p>

<p>The meaning of matriculation is admission to the university. I have some sympathy with a boy who cannot do mathematics. I do not say such people are mentally deficient or anything <span class="col_0821-0822" refersTo="page_0430"/>of that kind. There are some very brilliant people who cannot do mathematics. A lecturer said the other day he could not understand music, and his sisters could not understand mathematics. There are people who, however intelligent they are, do not understand some things. But surely the elementary mathematics they have to pass is not too high. They are not asking for higher mathematics. I would say that if they are going to take science at university they should have higher mathematics. But there is another thing about this mathematics. In the world to-day students are not taking mathematics and science, especially physical science. Why not? They are looking for easier options. They are looking for easier subjects. I do not want to mention all those subjects, such as politics, philosophy, psychology and sociology. But the professions say to-day they do not want these subjects. The hard-headed accountant says he wants a fellow who knows mathematics, and the medical profession says they want mathematics and physics for the modern tendency in medical research. When you come to the legal profession we find they cannot make up their minds whether they want Latin or not.</p>

<p>After much discussion they decided to go to a higher court and discuss it there. The Chief-Justice of the Republic said: &#x201C;You must have Latin.&#x201D; I feel that this discussion has achieved its purpose, because the hon. member for Koedoespoort has brought to the attention of the Minister the fact that there are people who are not at ease about the present requirements of the Matriculation Board. I am sure he will keep that in mind and communicate it to the members of this board. I am not in favour of a university prescribing its own entrance examinations. I prefer the board, as the hon. member for Koedoespoort does. But there are universities overseas who have their own entrance examination. They say: &#x201C;Perhaps you passed that matriculation entrance exam, but that is not good enough for us.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I cannot move an amendment to the motion. I think this discussion has achieved what we desire. I cannot move an amendment to say that I have confidence in the Minister, because I have not! [Laughter.] But should there not be an amendment to the effect that while there seems to be a lack of confidence on the part of the Minister&#x2019;s own supporters in the House, perhaps something could be done about it?</p>

<p>I think we have said enough about this matter. I do not think we need a great deal of discussion. As far as I am concerned, the old section 15 of the 1955 Act, was restated by the Minister as recently as last year. I do not think I can make any suggestion to change it at this early stage, but should the hon. the Minister wish to have an investigation, of course he will ask his own staff about it. He can do that. He has a very big staff, much too big I think. We have complained about it, but still he has some brilliant men there. These men can assist him. It is our view on this side of the House that a special inquiry at this stage is not necessary.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we know the hon. member for Kensington as a respected member of this House who is not afraid to state his case. The hon. member said that he did not actually have confidence in the Minister, but he nevertheless does nothing about it. I now wonder whether he was not simply joking, because there was some degree of laughter accompanying his remark, or else the hon. member should rather have said what they really think of the motion of the hon. member for Koedoespoort.</p>

<p>I shall not speak for long. Neither shall I now specifically react to certain other points which the hon. member for Kensington made. My view will be apparent from a few ideas which I also want to add in connection with this matter. I am convinced that the question of admission to universities and the requirements imposed upon prospective students, do not centre around those requirements of the two languages, a science, mathematics and/or a third language. There are many other factors which go hand in hand with this matter. In individual studies, in conferences which were held, this also appeared to be the case. Let me simply refer you here to the discussion which was held in Bloemfontein in 1967 about an aspect of this problem, namely the high failure rate at our universities. A conference was held by the Committee of University Principals. Last year when a Select Committee was appointed in connection with the Bill on teacher training, there was a great deal of talk, and a great deal was written, about this matter. The hon. member for Koedoespoort spoke about certain matters which Prof. Rautenbach, Rector of the University of Pretoria, raised recently. I also have a clipping about that. It indicates that these matters need and deserve constant attention. But we must not expect that when we have finished discussing the matter today, we can in that way remove it from our agenda. The question of admission to universities is a part of the dynamic education process. Even if we were to find a solution this year or next year, we would later have to discuss the matter again, because we would continually have to make adjustments as circumstances and the changing times require it of us.</p>

<p>The mover of the motion indicated the manner in which the Joint Matriculation Board is composed and how this body functions. I think that one may, to put it simply and in basic terms, base the procedures and methods of this body on two principles, when it comes to admission to universities: the first is that for the selection of students who want to be admitted to a university, a high school examination is set which we know as the matriculation examination. That is then the criterion which must determine whether a <span class="col_0823-0824" refersTo="page_0431"/>student has the ability and can; do well enough to make progress at a university. The second criterion is that a pattern of subject choices will determine whether that student will make good progress and make his mark at the university. It briefly boils down to this: choose certain subjects and write the prescribed examination; then the road will be open for you to enroll at the university as a student. But now one may ask, how reliable are these criteria, such as an examination and a pattern of subject choices which are applied? Will they prove completely successful in practice? In respect of the first criterion a study was made which indicates that 50 per cent of our first year students gained first class matriculation examination passes, but that 90 per cent of them, a mere nine months after this achievement, claimed that as far as they were concerned that examination was no proper introduction to or prediction of university training. As far as the second criterion is concerned, research has also indicated that there is little or no correlation and little or no relationship between the pattern of subjects which are chosen and the success which students achieve at university. We are now not talking about the value of mathematics for a specific field such as engineering. I am stating the case in general terms. It therefore appears as if these instruments of measurement which we are using are inefficient, as if they are ineffective for the times in which we are living. But I think that we must apply another criterion; then we shall perhaps come nearer to an answer. We must simply ask ourselves: are we satisfied that the students who are selected for admission to universities according to the existing methods, procedures and criteria, are achieving the measure of success which is expected of them, and are potentially good students not possibly being excluded? When we now come to the answering of this question, counter-questions also arise. We then come to the problem of the failure rate. How many of these students, selected along these lines, pass at university? How many of them eventually simply throw in the towel? To put it simply, if mathematics or a third language is the requirement, from how many of the students is a university career not perhaps withheld? I believe that everyone who has the capability should have the opportunity of thoroughly putting those capabilities to the test.</p>

<p>If we now come to this question; if we ask whether it does in fact produce the results we should like to have, then we see that this problem has wide ramifications. I am now going to mention a few matters to hon. members. On close examination the following matters are immediately implicated in the question of admission to universities: the universities complain about the standard of the high school pupils which are sent on to them. The universities state that they are often emotionally and socially not quite mature enough. I am not going to go into the matter any further; I am merely mentioning it. In the second place, are the examinations which are at present being conducted, these essay-type tests which are still encountered in certain subjects, really the best criterion by which to test whether a man has a knowledge of a subject or not, and apart from the knowledge, whether a man is properly prepared for a specific field of study? In the third place, I want to emphasize the large gap between the high school and the university. This struggle is not a problem unique to this day and age alone. Even prior to 338 B.C. the University of Athens&#x2014;I say this in parentheses because one cannot actually call it a university&#x2014;set itself the task, strangely enough, of trying to reduce the gap between the ordinary school, if one may call it that, and the university of that time. This is something which has already been discussed for many centuries.</p>

<p>The question of an additional school year, which must be introduced between the termination of the high school career and the commencement of the university career, now crops up. There are reasons why I do not support this procedure. Research has also indicated that the failure rate for first-year students does not really decrease as a result of the introduction of an additional school year. Specific subject choices are prescribed and these &#x201C;disciplines&#x201D;, as I should like to call them, are laid down. I may perhaps be using a poor example now, but I obtained my university degree and also did further postgraduate study although I had neither mathematics nor a third language in matric. I was fortunate enough to obtain provisional exemption from the matriculation examination with the other subjects which I took at school. As I have said, it is perhaps not a good example, but it nevertheless does prove that a person&#x2019;s success at university does not depend on a specific choice of subjects, because I even obtained distinctions in subjects at university, and I do not want to boast when I say so. I also know another person who obtained provisional admission to the university with a conditional certificate of exemption to read for the degree of B.Econ. at the University of Pretoria. He passed his first-year subjects and again a conditional certificate of exemption was given to him. In this manner he passed the second and third-year subjects, but the degree could not be conferred upon him before he could prove a satisfactory matriculation standard for mathematics for German. He then enrolled at a correspondence college, sat for the mathematics examination, and in the following year the degree of B.Econ. was conferred upon him. That is again a proof that that man&#x2019;s choice of subjects had nothing to do with his progress at university.</p>

<p><span class="col_0825-0826" refersTo="page_0432"/>Another very important matter is the scant attention given especially to personality characteristics in the evaluation of a future university student. Personality characteristics are often the specific guarantee of the success one is going to achieve in the field one chooses.</p>

<p>I then also want to mention another additional factor. And that is the reasonably strong discipline to which high school pupils are subjected. When the student subsequently comes to university he obtains a great measure of freedom and he can act reasonably independently. In this way I could continue, but I mention all these things to indicate to you that the question of admission to universities is linked to another large group of factors. I also do not believe that as far as the admission to universities is concerned, South Africa is quite keeping pace with the rest of the world. I think that our criteria will have to be revised. I have mentioned these things to indicate as well that admission to universities is in the long run concerned with the whole educational progress, which begins in the primary school, carries on through the high school years to where the university&#x2019;s doors are opened for students. This is perhaps the point where I differ from the two gentlemen who spoke before me. In saying this I am not trying to criticize what the Joint Matriculation Board has done. On the contrary, I greatly appreciate the work which the people have done. My honest opinion is, however, that if the admission to universities is aligned with the whole educational process, the body which eventually deals with the admission to universities and which lays down the requirements, is too distant from organized education as a whole. I feel that this body should cement closer ties with those who deal with the educational process up to the university level, whence it should be continued with. I therefore feel that the body which must lay down the requirements for university admission, should come under the body which the hon. the Minister established in 1962, i.e. the National Advisory Education Council. Are they not preferably the people who should eventually determine what requirements must be laid down for admission to universities?</p>

<p>Then, in closing, I want to mention my second idea. And that is that the subjects for admission must depend upon the specific field of study. One must not lay down general requirements, regardless of whether the student wants to become a doctor, teacher, lawyer or whatever. One must let the field of study be the decisive factor and in some cases one must leave it to the specific faculty to determine what is required from those who want to study in that specific field or faculty. Hence just these two thoughts. The persons who must eventually lay down the requirements for university admission are those persons connected with the National Advisory Education Council, and subsequently it must be left to the field of study and the faculties concerned at our universities. If we allow the process of education to remain linked in this way, we still always remain with the basic principle of the education of the individual as a whole, which must begin in the sub-standards and continue until, as a mature person, he comes to the university.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation that although only three speeches were made on this very important subject, their content was such that they did justice to the topic. I am also glad that we have been afforded the opportunity of stating our views on this very important matter. To begin with, I want to say that I believe, as you all do, that a cry should be raised in this country at the present time, to an even greater extent than in the past, that any student who has the ability should be afforded an opportunity of receiving a university education. If a student has the aptitude, ability and talent, he should not be precluded from receiving a university education because of technical reasons. In saying this I do not want to suggest that one should intervene from outside. I also want to endorse what the hon. member for Kensington said. There is a large measure of autonomy at the universities. There are the various professions which can lay down their requirements and I can find no fault with it if the medical, legal or whatever profession lays down its requirements for a knowledge of certain subjects in the case of students seeking admission to university. It is for those various professions to put the matter right in case a wrong choice of subjects is forced upon them. What is involved here, is therefore not interference in the affairs of universities and faculties, but a general principle. To link up with what hon. members have already said, I shall give a few examples presently of where I think this rigid, inflexible requirement of either mathematics or a third language has really become obsolete.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort also said that he had heard that it was the idea that the requirements for admission to universities should be raised even higher. I do not know what fertile brain has produced this idea. But I do want to say that I do not think it is an egg which will ever get beyond the laying stage. I cannot imagine that a chicken will ever hatch from it. We have nothing to do with the standard of the universities. I am satisfied that the universities of the Republic of South Africa maintain a very high standard and that we can unhesitatingly compare the standards attained at our universities with any other standards in the rest of the world. I have no doubt about that. I do not think that higher requirements and stricter rules should be laid <span class="col_0827-0828" refersTo="page_0433"/>down. I will oppose it with all the power at my disposal.</p>

<p>Many persons are to-day denied the right to enter a university campus as a result of restrictions imposed by the Joint Matriculation Board. I contend that since 1918, when the Board sat for the first time, until to-day exemptions and adjustments have often been made and note has been taken of the position as it has developed. I would not say that it has always been done very progressively, nor that it has always happened of its own accord, because at times strong pressure had to be exerted in order to achieve it. These are all accomplished facts. But the latest step which the Matriculation Board is taking and which is perhaps not so generally known, is as recent as last month of this year, i.e. January, 1969. I think it is a very great victory which has been achieved, especially when it is seen from the point of view of those people who so relentlessly opposed this so-called system of B stream children at the Transvaal secondary schools. It is well known there. At the moment I cannot disclose what concession has been made in this regard, because it is actually still in the incubation stage. I have no hesitation in declaring to-day that during the next few months something is even going to happen in the case of this group B stream children for whom the doors of the universities are closed. It is a very great privilege for me to announce here in this way that the Committee of Educational Heads, that is to say, all the Directors of Education, were in conference on this matter only yesterday, i.e. the 12th February, and that they still are. Yesterday the National Education Council and the Committee of Educational Heads sat in conference on this matter. The hon. member for Germiston pleaded here that the National Advisory Education Council should concern itself with this matter. This is, in fact, an instruction I gave to them so that they could investigate the entire matter purely from en educational point of view. This contact body, namely the executive committee of the Education Council, yesterday deliberated with the Educational Heads. I do not know what the nature of the deliberations was, but I expect to be notified in this connection within the foreseeable future. I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Koedoespoort and the other two speakers who supported this motion in expressing the hope that something good will come of these discussions. I shall give a few reasons presently why I think that something should happen.</p>

<p>I also want to hazard a prophecy now by saying what possibilities I think exist as far as opening the door wider is concerned. But I also want to make it clear that I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not want the doors to be thrown open so that standards are lowered. I do not want to see yet another machine created for turning out people who can write degrees behind their names, because in that case it might have been better if those people could not write those degrees behind their names. I do not want to do that. What I want is that the door should be opened a little wider so that the inflexibility of the strict requirement of mathematics or a third language may perhaps be eliminated. This should not be the beginning and the end as far as admission to a university is concerned. That should not be the position. I shall mention a few examples in this connection in a moment.</p>

<p>I first want to give the Joint Matriculation Board the credit it deserves. Only last year we progressed to such an extent that the Board recognized a large number of technical subjects for the purposes of admission to a university. We are very grateful for that. For example, they laid down the requirement that these should be on a par with the national technical school examination, i.e. the so called N.T.S. V. The Joint Matriculation Board placed a higher value on it. In this technical and technological age in which we are living one takes note of this with gratitude. But it has not gone far enough yet. The hon. member for Koedoespoort and the hon. member for Germiston indicated very clearly that the natural aptitude of a student has been disregarded up to now. In the secondary schools we have accepted as an educational principle no longer to let the accent fall on those old stereotyped subjects which older people were obliged to take in order to obtain a matriculation certificate. There were only six subjects and no choice. The hon. member for Kensington went all the way and made the grade, but he does not know how many fell by the wayside and how small the number of matriculants were who succeeded in battling through those six subjects. Whether one was able to grasp mathematics or an old language such as Latin was beside the point; one just had to go through with it, come what may. Most of them did not make it and fell by the wayside. Now we have accepted the more modern concept of differentiation in our educational system. We are not all the same. Hon. members only have to think of the large number of subjects which are being taught in our secondary schools to-day. The child&#x2019;s aptitude is properly tested, but when he reaches standard 10 he is cut off. He comes up against a wall. He can only get over that wall by studying mathematics or a third language and a natural science. If he fails to do so, he is branded for the rest of his life as a person who did not qualify for admission to a university. Is this not a shocking injustice that is being done to those students? Is it not schocking to think that natural aptitude, in regard to which one has so little choice is being ignored? These are gifts which we receive from the Creator, but these gifts are disregarded. Because you do not have the same gifts which others have, you must hang around in the back rooms <span class="col_0829-0830" refersTo="page_0434"/>and the kitchens. I cannot express myself strongly enough about this. That is why I say the time is ripe for the Joint Matriculation Board to help unlock the door. With the hon. member for Kensington I admit that the universities should have the majority, we all admit that, because, after all, they are the ones who have to unlock the doors. When I am talking in this way I am actually pleading that they should help to unlock those doors. And that is not so impossible either. All that we are saying is that these compulsory combinations of subjects in order to gain university admission should be revised. That is putting it in very general terms. If the position is revised, it will be realized that this is really something which should receive attention.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Koedoespoort will agree with me that, since these matters are now being thoroughly investigated by our educational bodies and educational individuals, it is not necessary to ask the Government for a further investigation, especially not when the investigation has already progressed to far. However, I have a few proposals to make now and there may be many more. I only want to mention two now. One is&#x2014;and the universities can give very serious consideration to this&#x2014;that when a person&#x2019;s aptitude lies in a certain direction, whether it be the humanities or the natural sciences, it should be a requirement that say three subjects should be taken on a higher level, subjects in which the student proposes to continue his studies at university, while the other subjects for which he has no special aptitude may be taken at a lower level. We should not have Afrikaans A and B and English A and B only; we should have these different grades in other subjects as well. In other words, more recognition should be given for certain subjects. If a person has an aptitude for the humanities he need only take the two languages and say history or some other subject relating to the humanities on a higher level and a B level course in mathematics or one of the natural sciences. That is one idea which I have in this connection. Then it will be possible to disperse with that strict requirement of a certain standard for certain subjects.</p>

<p>A second example has already been mentioned here, and this relates to our commercial high schools. The commercial high schools to-day teach the following subjects, for example, economics, commerce, accounting, commecial law, and the two official languages. These are all matriculation subjects. Now I ask this question: Are the people who take these subjects not better equipped to take a B.Comm. or a B.Econ. course at university than those students who took geography or biology or German and all those subjects for matric? But this group from the commercial high schools cannot gain admission to a university with these subjects. These are only a few ideas that I have.</p>

<p>Now I just want to add that it was with gratitude that I noted that there are individual universities that do apply this differentiation internally, and not through the Joint Matriculation Board. The hon. member for Germiston is one of the fortunate persons who went to a university that did not lay down these hard and fast rules. I may mention the example of my eldest son. If he went to a university to-day with this B level, then he would not be granted admission, and he is a professor at a university to-day. Can one realize the utter folly of this? For this internal differentiation I want to express my gratitude to the universities which are so far-sighted that they do not blindly follow a rule that has been laid down.</p>

<p>I think it is unnecessary to discuss this any further&#x2014;we are so completely at one. However I should just like to say the following by way of summing up. Education is a living science. Education is the mother of all in a country. Without education and training of the citizens, both men and women, the entire national machinery will come to a standstill. There is, however, a very urgent and compelling requirement to be set to education and which it is the right of all of us to set to it, as parents and interested persons and citizens of the country. That is that it should continually take notes of changes occurring in life and in the world, locally and all over the world, and should adapt itself to these. If it does not do that, then it becomes stagnant, and then it no longer serves the purpose which it should. I want to repeat my general statement. I say every White child in this country of ours who has the ability should be afforded the opportunity of receiving tertiary training, in other words, of going to a university. But it requires careful planning to determine how it should be done, it requires thorough investigation, and where the investigation will have to be carried out continually&#x2014;because we shall not be able to say, &#x201C;We now know everything about the matter and this concludes it&#x201D;&#x2014;there are the educational institutions established by this Parliament. There is the Education Council, a statutory committee of the educational heads has been established, there are sub-committees constantly working on this matter, and it will mean that these bodies in collaboration with the Joint Matriculation Board can always show us the way ahead. I repeat, I expect a great change in this field in the coming months.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as hon. members know, it is customary to request this House for an advance in order to meet essential Government expenditure during the first few months of the new financial year, while we are waiting for the usual Appropriation Bill to be passed.</p>

<p>As hon. members are aware, the Appropriation Act is usually one of the last measures to be adopted, and in order to prevent the Treasury from being embarrassed should there be any delay in passing the Appropriation Act, the House is being requested to authorize a sum which will meet expenditure for roughly 31/2 months, i.e. up to approximately the middle of July.</p>

<p>The sum requested amounts to R590 million, of which R440 million is chargeable to the Revenue Account, R122 million to the Loan Account, R12 million to the Bantu Education Account and R16 million to the South-West Africa Account.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the House will not expect me to anticipate my Budget speech by furnishing at this juncture a full survey of the economic position. Nevertheless, I consider it my duty to furnish a brief resume of the most important economic trends in South Africa and in the world since this House last had the opportunity of discussing financial affairs, and in particular to refer to the marketing of gold.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, the economic position in South Africa. Full statistics in respect of public accounts, etc., are only available up to the third quarter of 1968, and it will only be possible for me to sketch in my Budget speech the picture for the whole year. However, the indications are that the economy is still in a very strong position and that inflationary pressure has been curbed effectively. Since the deceleration during the second half of 1967 the gross domestic product has shown a moderate revival, and in the third quarter of 1968 it even accelerated at a slightly faster rate than it did in the second quarter. Private consumption (particularly in respect of durable goods) and current Government expenditure have been the main factors in this revival, whereas there has been little change in gross fixed investment; in fact, private fixed investment has shown a decrease. Supplies have also decreased, and this decrease has for the most part, but not exclusively, been attributable to a decrease in agricultural supplies.</p>

<p>The decrease in private investment indicates that the authorities have succeeded in cooling off the over-heated inflationary climate, which has afforded our economy a welcome respite. We must, of course, take care lest this trend goes too far, and I shall come back to this point later on.</p>

<p>During the first three-quarters of 1968 imports and exports did not show much change, but in the fourth quarter there was apparently an increase in imports with the result that in that quarter our balance of payments on current account reflected a moderate deficit for the first time in more than a year. However, the continuous inflow of foreign capital more than wiped out this deficit so that over the year 1968 our total gold and foreign exchange reserves increased by the huge amount of approximately R500 million.</p>

<p>This increase in our reserves, although it was clear proof of our economic strength, was, of course, a mixed blessing since it caused the amount of money and near-money in circulation to soar to new heights. This excess liquidity in our economy creates the danger of renewed inflationary over-spending. Up to now this excess liquidity has mainly been reflected in the financial sector, i.e. in the purchase of shares and fixed property, rather than that of goods and services. Whereas the prices of shares (particularly industrial and commercial shares) and of fixed property have therefore risen considerably and new issues of shares have reached new heights, the effect of the excess liquidity on the general price level was not a considerable one. Over the year 1968 the consumer price index showed an increase of 2.7 per cent, which was for the most part attributable to an increase of 3.6 per cent in food prices. Wholesale prices only showed an increase of 2.1 per cent over that year.</p>

<p>The danger is, of course, that the excess liquidity in our economy may in fact affect the non-financial sector later on, i.e. as regards the purchase of goods and services, which may give rise to renewed inflationary pressure on the general price level. That is why it would be dangerous to relax our measures against inflation too rapidly at this stage.</p>

<p><span class="col_0833-0834" refersTo="page_0436"/>The Reserve Bank nevertheless found it possible on 27th August to reduce its discount rate by &#x00BD; per cent to 5&#x00BD; per cent. In addition the credit ceiling for monetary banks was raised to the level of March, 1965, i.e. the decrease of per cent which had been applicable before, was lifted, although most of the existing concessions to the banks in excess of the old ceiling were taken into account in the new restriction. As a further concession the banks were allowed to give credit to small business concerns up to an additional amount of 1 per cent of their new ceiling. I think that these concessions have eliminated certain points of friction in our credit restrictions without jeopardizing the economy.</p>

<p>At the end of December the banks were well within their credit ceiling, but over the current quarter a rise in bank credit is possible owing to seasonal factors, namely tax payments to the State.</p>

<p>Hon. members may quite rightly ask whether the danger of inflation cannot be diminished by draining the excess liquidity in various ways. The authorities are in fact trying to do so. The first method is to draw money away from the private sector and to sterilize it. During the first half of the current financial year the Exchequer did this on a large scale and was able to reduce its net debt to the monetary banking sector by no less than R223 million. Owing to seasonal and other factors the Exchequer finances probably did not have any, or such a strong, anti-inflationary effect during the last quarter of 1968, but as regards the current quarter it is anticipated that the Exchequer will once again make a considerable contribution towards absorbing the excess liquidity. This is partly attributable to the usual high tax payments during the first quarter of the year, but also to the new domestic Government loans which were issued last month and which have already drawn a considerable amount of money away from the private sector, as well as to the new savings campaign which I launched on 21st January to celebrate the golden jubilee of the thrift movement. Thrift remains a pre-requisite for the prosperity of our country, and I hope that this slogan of the new campaign will go down with every family, namely:</p>

<block name="quote">Save for your own future,</block>

<block name="quote">Save for the future of your family,</block>

<block name="quote">Save for the future of your country.</block>

<p>The second method of reducing liquidity is to cause it to flow out of the country by relaxing import and foreign exchange control. Import control has been relaxed considerably for quite some time, and towards the end of July. 1968, I decided also to relax foreign exchange control in a selective manner. Accordingly it was announced that applications for foreign exchange for the following purposes would be considered more sympathetically: the redemption before due date of foreign loans; approved direct investments in countries abroad, and the purchace by South Africans of shares in South African enterprises controlled by foreigners. An additional relaxation that we considered, was to lift the control over the repatriation of foreign capital investments in the Republic, but we decided against it since it was probable that such a step would only give rise to a greater inflow of capital. Besides, a foreigner can usually realize his investment in the Republic without losses, i.e. by selling it to another foreigner.</p>

<p>The relaxation I mentioned has only had a limited effect on our balance of payments and, consequently, on our liquidity. I would have liked to have done more towards draining away the excess liquidity in our country, but the uncertainty in regard to the marketing of our gold, to which I shall refer later on, has made it advisable to be more careful with our foreign exchange than we would otherwise have been.</p>

<p>What are the immediate prospects for our economy? In spite of the potential inflationary danger owing to excess liquidity, our economy has remained relatively stable and private fixed investment&#x2014;the main source of future economic growth&#x2014;has even shown a slightly downward trend. However, I am of the opinion that, whereas consumption is steadily increasing, whereas the level of supplies has already shown a decrease, and whereas the necessary funds for expansion are readily available, a revival of fixed investments may be expected without any special stimulation on the part of the authorities. Should this not take place shortly, we shall have to consider relaxing some of our measures against inflation. Should this in fact take place, the resultant higher level of imports will help to drain the excess liquidity and therefore counteract any inflationary effect to a certain extent. The shortage of skilled labour, which&#x2014;despite everything the Government has done in respect of technical training and immigration&#x2014;is still a bottle-neck in our economy, could, however, give rise to renewed inflation. My conclusion, therefore, is that our measures against inflation should still be maintained, although we must watch the position carefully so that we may make adjustments where necessary.</p>

<p>Before concluding this part of my speech, I should just like to sound a word of warning in regard to the current prices of shares and fixed property. I am an optimist in respect of the future growth of our economy, but the prices of shares and land presuppose in some cases a growth rate which is out of all proportion. Another alarming factor is the fact that many transactions in shares and land are being financed by means of credit. This may give rise to a dangerous situation, and those who borrow money in order to conclude such transactions, as well as those who advance the money, must be careful and act judiciously.</p>

<p>I should now like to say a few words about international monetary conditions over the past few months. Since the devaluation of sterling in November, 1967, the exchange markets <span class="col_0835-0836" refersTo="page_0437"/>have virtually never settled down. There was the so-called gold crisis of March, 1968 (which, as the President of the Bank of England said, never was a gold crisis but an exchange crisis), there were several serious fluctuations in the subsequent months and eventually there was the crisis of November, 1968, when France, contrary to all expectations, did not devalue but when Germany had to introduce abnormal measures so as to avoid a revaluation of the mark and when Britain had to take drastic steps so as to safeguard sterling. Speculators are at the moment the culprits who are being blamed for all these crises, and special measures are being devised in order to frustrate their efforts. However, the speculator is merely a person who is trying to anticipate the future; he will not speculate against a strong currency, although he can weaken a weak currency even further. To my mind, however, the basic causes must be sought further afield. It would be an over-simplification to select one or two factors as the causes of all the crises of 1968. However, there are in fact two basic considerations which apply. The first is that the various degrees of inflation in the various countries have seriously affected the competitive ability of those countries where inflation was worst. In the modern world such countries cannot correct their position by bringing about deflation; a &#x201C;fundamental imbalance&#x201D; (as it is called in the Articles of the I.M.F.) therefore results, something which can only be corrected through devaluation (unless the countries where inflation was less severe, can be persuaded to revalue their money, upwards, as Germany is considered to have done in a disguised and partial form).</p>

<p>However, the fact that international monetary crises have in recent times been more severe and occurred more often, is to my mind attributable to another factor, i.e. the growing relative shortage of international reserves and especially gold. In 1960 the gold and foreign exchange reserves of the non-communist world amounted to approximately 47 per cent of the total imports of these countries; by 1967 this figure had fallen to 34 per cent. If gold alone is taken into account, the change is an even more severe one, and this is important since gold inspires much more confidence than is the case with other reserve assets. The lack of international liquidity even makes it difficult for countries to withstand ordinary balance of payments fluctuations, for in most cases the safety margin in their international reserves is too small. A balance of payments deficit which, with adequate reserves, could have been borne quite easily, now causes an exchange crisis which speculators can in fact aggravate. The obvious remedy is, of course, to reinforce international reserves, and particularly gold, by increasing the gold price. The founders of the I.M.F. foresaw this situation and made special provision for such a contingency in the Articles of the Fund. It would take me too long to explain why the leading countries of the world are so reluctant to take this step, but I think that economic conditions are steadily developing in a direction which will make an eventual increase in the gold price inevitable. It has always been and still is our hope that this increase will be effected in an orderly manner and not as a result of an international financial collapse.</p>

<p>In the meantime international financial conditions will remain tense and further crises may be expected. It is indeed possible that, in view of new measures for counteracting speculation and perhaps supplementing international liquidity in other ways, the situation may remain relatively calm for the time being, but I do not view this as a permanent calm resting on firm foundations.</p>

<p>Now I come to the marketing of our gold. Hon. members will recall that leading financial countries have for several years joined forces in keeping the gold price on the London market&#x2014;the most important gold market at the time&#x2014;within certain limits. During the first months of 1968 the demand for gold was so high that these countries had to sell tremendous quantities of gold on the market so as to prevent the price from rising above the fixed level. In March the position became untenable, and the countries concerned decided to withdraw their support from the gold market so that the gold price might fluctuate in accordance with normal demand and supply. This was actually a return to the system that obtained in the fifties, where the official gold price (i.e. for transactions between monetary authorities) remained constant, but the price on the free market fluctuated. However, in due course it became obvious that the American Administration contemplated a more extensive change, namely the permanent isolation of the supply of gold in the possession of central banks and other monetary authorities. This so-called monetary gold would in future not be sold on the free market, but would not be supplemented by further additions of newly-mined gold either.</p>

<p>This attitude gave rise to a degree of uncertainty in the gold market. Regard being had to the large quantities of gold bought by speculators up to March, 1968, it was clear that the market was very sensitive and that any reports of major South African gold sales could have an adverse effect on the market. Fortunately our balance of payments was so strong that it was unnecessary for us to sell excessive quantities of gold on the free market, although we did sell a considerable quantity in June and July, 1968, without forcing the market price down. In the meantime we ascertained that the Articles of the I.M.F. granted us the right to sell gold to the Fund in return for foreign exchange. Consequently we made such an offer to the Fund in June, 1968, but owing to the opposition of the then American Administration no decision was taken in regard to this offer. The Managing Director of the Fund intimated that in his opinion and in that of his staff the Fund was legally obliged to accept our offer, and I know that this view is also being shared by many of <span class="col_0837-0838" refersTo="page_0438"/>the executive directors of the Fund, but up to the present we have been unable to take this matter any further. After it had become clear that we could not expect an early reply from the Fund, we drew our so-called super gold tranche at the Fund at the end of June. It was a credit balance of $62 million (R44 million) accumulated as a result of drawings of South African rand by other member countries.</p>

<p>We also sold a considerable quantity of gold to monetary authorities in the third quarter of 1968. That was the situation in September, 1968, when the annual meeting of the I.M.F. was held in Washington. In my speech at the annual meeting I pointed out, <i>inter alia,</i> that it was extremely important for the world to reinforce the role of gold in the international financial structure, and that the attempt at putting a stop to monetary reserves being supplemented by newly-mined gold, must weaken that structure. I emphasized that normally we would, in our own interests, sell part of our gold production on the free market, that as regards this matter we had always acted in a responsible manner, but that it would be neither fair nor in the interests of the monetary stability of the world to expect us to sell under all circumstances all our newly-mined gold on the free market. I said, however, that we were always prepared to consult with interested parties in order to seek a satisfactory solution. I may mention that the Managing Director of the Fund said the following in his address to the annual meeting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is important at this stage to do nothing to undermine, and to do whatever is possible to strengthen, the traditional reserve components &#x2026; This is no more than common sense. Gold is a traditional means of international settlement and a point of reference for the values of national currencies &#x2026; More than one-half of all monetary reserves consists of gold, and it continues to be the basic element in the world monetary system.</block>

<p>In the course of the annual meeting certain private talks took place, and late on the penultimate day of the meeting the so-called &#x201C;Group of Ten&#x201D; submitted certain proposals to me. I cannot disclose these proposals to the House. However, from what I have already said, it should be clear that I would not be prepared to enter into an agreement which does not give recognition to the following principles&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) South Africa has the statutory right to purchase foreign exchange from the Fund against payment in gold.</li>

<li>(2) The possibility of a further flow of newly-mined gold to monetary reserves&#x2014;irrespective of the price on the free market&#x2014;must be maintained.</li>

<li>(3) South Africa cannot undertake to refuse requests from other monetary authorities to buy gold at the official price.</li>

<li>(4) The attempt at divorcing so-called monetary and newly-mined gold permanently, must be reviewed.</li>

</ol>

<p>As the proposals submitted to me did not comply with all of these principles, I could not accept them. In my reply to the &#x201C;Group of Ten&#x201D;, I explained my point of view, but confirmed once again that I would always be prepared to consider any equitable proposal in accordance with the above principles.</p>

<p>Since then we have received no further proposals. Consequently we have continued to sell gold from time to time to monetary authorities as well as on the free market, and, as hon. members know, the price on the free market is much higher to-day than it was a few months ago. This is probably partly attributable to the fact that much of the gold which was purchased by speculators before March, 1968, and which threatened the stability of the free market at the time, has already been absorbed by this time so that it will no longer be sold readily on the market.</p>

<p>Therefore our position is still a strong one. Nevertheless, I hope that it will soon be possible to reach a satisfactory understanding with the other important countries in regard to the marketing of our gold. I say this, not because our position is weak, but because it is in the interests of the world as well as the Republic to eliminate the present uncertainty. I think that there is growing appreciation abroad both for the merits of our point of view and the responsible way in which we have acted in this delicate matter.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to refer briefly to my recent visit to Europe. A great deal of nonsense was said and written about that visit. The loans I want to discuss there, were not gold loans or loans for the purpose of coping with a critical shortage of foreign exchange. They were normal Government loans. It is true that the Exchequer does not need additional loan funds at the moment, but it is always advisable to keep one&#x2019;s name on the leading capital markets of the world. That is why a Swiss loan of 60 million Swiss francs (R10 million) which expires on 1st March, was renewed by us for a period of 15 years at an interest rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent and an emission rate of 98&#x00BD; per cent&#x2014;very favourable terms today. That is why it is also our intention to issue later on this year a loan in German marks on terms which are still to be determined in full but which will probably be less favourable to us than is the case with those of the Swiss loan.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that many of the bankers with whom I had talks, raised of their own accord the question of short-term loans for the purpose of bridging any temporary shortage of foreign exchange which may arise. I can inform the House that very large amounts have been offered to me on favourable terms. At the moment it is not necessary for us to avail ourselves of these offers, but it is good <span class="col_0839-0840" refersTo="page_0439"/>to know that they are available should we need them later on.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have tried to furnish a survey of the way I see the most main financial questions affecting South Africa, but if there are other matters in regard to which hon. members require information, I shall do my best to furnish it in my reply.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>In the Second-Reading debate on this Bill on Friday, I indicated that we had certain difficulties with the wording of clause 1 and its somewhat novel and wide implications. I therefore wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 6 and 17, respectively, to omit &#x201C;probably&#x201D;.</block>

<p>If one omits the word &#x201C;probably&#x201D;, then the law will read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person found disguised in any manner whatsoever and whether effectively or not, in circumstances from which it may reasonably be inferred that such person has the intention of committing or inciting, encouraging or aiding any other person to commit, some offence or other &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, the effect of this amendment will be that it will be a matter of fact whether the person in fact had an intention to commit an offence when he was so disguised or whether he did not&#x2014;not whether he probably had that intention. Sir, this is in accordance with the pre-Union legislation, which is repealed by this Bill, which in all four provinces included the words &#x201C;with intent&#x201D;&#x2014;with intent in fact and not with probable intent. I feel that if this amendment is not accepted we will find ourselves having to apply a somewhat novel test, namely whether beyond all reasonable doubt, on the balance of probabilities, the person concerned had such an intention. Sir, it is difficult enough inferring intentions from facts without having to introduce an additional complicating factor. In any event, the onus is on the accused to show that he did not have the intent, and if the amendment is accepted it will be less onerous upon the person who is being arrested upon suspicion&#x2014;because that is all it is&#x2014;and it will be more onerous upon the policeman effecting the arrest, I am sure hon. members will agree that this is a good thing because the arrest takes place not in respect of something which the policeman sees happening, which is the normal case, but in respect of what he, the policeman, thinks is in the mind of the person in disguise. I think this is a reasonable, realistic amendment, and I put it forward in the spirit that it will avoid all the difficulties which I dealt with at the Second Reading and in the hope that the hon. the Minister, who has shown a reasonable attitude in matters such as this, will accept it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In the main this Bill flows from the unanimous recommendation of the Law Revision Committee that legislation should be passed in terms of which insurance moneys and pension moneys shall not be taken into account in the assessment of the value of a dependant&#x2019;s loss of support as a result of the death of such a dependant&#x2019;s breadwinner which has been wrongfully caused by another.</p>

<p>As hon. members know it is a foregone conclusion in our law that in a case where dependants of a deceased breadwinner claim compensation in respect of their material loss which flows from their loss of support as a result of the wrongful killing of the breadwinner, they are entitled, as far as support is concerned, to be placed in the same material position as that in which they would have been had the breadwinner not been killed. They are not entitled, however, to be placed in a better material position than they would have been otherwise at the expense of the offender responsible for the death of the breadwinner. Consequently the courts off-set any profits or other benefits which may accrue to the dependant as a result of the death of the bread-winner against the value of the loss of support assessed by the court. This principle has been stated very clearly in decisions of the Appeal Court, of which <i>Hulley</i> v. <i>Cox,</i> 1923, is the leading case. In this case Chief Justice Innes said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; compensation is only awarded in respect of material loss caused to the dependants of the deceased man by his death &#x2026; But the object being to compensate them for material loss, not to improve their material prospects, it follows that allowance must be made for such factors as the possibility of re-marriage. Account must also be taken of eventualities which would have operated in any case. A father, for instance, would cease to maintain a son who became self-supporting or a daughter who married.</block>

<p>In <i>Peri-Urban Areas Health Board</i> v. <i>Manurin,</i> 1965, the general principle is stated as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general principle of the remedy in question aims at placing them (i.e. the dependants) in as good a position, as regards maintenance, as they would have been in if the deceased had not been killed &#x2026; A widow is therefore entitled to compensation for loss of maintenance consequent upon the death of her husband, but any pecuniary benefits, similarly consequent, must be taken into account.</block>

<p>In addition to the factors referred to in the quoted extracts from the case <i>Hulley</i> v. <i>Cox</i> which are taken into account by a court in considering the amount to be awarded as material loss to a dependant, various other factors are also taken into account. In this way the assessed value of the accelerated receipt by dependants of the proceeds of insurance policies <span class="col_0843-0844" refersTo="page_0441"/>which the deceased breadwinner has taken out on his life, and which are payable to his dependants on his death, is deducted from the assessed value of the loss of support. The tendency in various countries is, however, to curtail by legislation or judicial decision the matters to be taken into account in the assessment of the amount of compensation. So for example insurance moneys, pension moneys, legacies, etc., are not taken into account in the United States. The approach seems to be that the principal in diminution of his own responsibility can make no reasonable claim to benefits which may flow from an agreement to which he was not a party and for which the deceased had made provision out of consideration for his dependants in order to provide for them. In Canada, except in Newfoundland, insurance moneys are excluded by legislation from the assessment of the amount payable as compensation. This also applies in Australia. Similarly pension moneys are not taken into account either in those countries, with the exception of a few areas. The legislation of New Zealand goes further than this and excludes any profits which, as a result of the death of the deceased, are paid into his estate or to his dependants. In England the legislature passed the Fatal Accidents (Damages) Act in 1908 in terms of which it is provided that no amount &#x201C;paid or payable on the death of the deceased under any contract of assurance or insurance&#x201D; shall be taken into account in the assessment of damages. Apparently this legislation was not so much inspired by considerations of fairness. Whatever the truth may be, this Act withstood the test of time and in 1959 it was replaced by the Fatal Accidents Act, which extended the scope of the earlier Act considerably.</p>

<p>In South Africa the general rule has also been modified to some extent by the judiciary. Justice Holmes, Judge of Appeal, in the case of <i>Peri-Urban Areas Health Board</i> v. <i>Manurin,</i> to which I referred earlier on, made the following statement, in which the other Judges concurred, with regard to the question whether a woman was obliged to mitigate the damages she suffered as far as possible by finding employment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To suggest that she is obliged to mitigate her damages by finding employment is to mistake the nature of her loss. What she has lost is a right&#x2014;the right of support. She cannot be required to mitigate that loss by incurring the duty of supporting herself. If she does obtain employment it is more appropriate to regard her earnings as being the product of her own work than as consequent upon her husband&#x2019;s death. Marriage prospects are relevant because marriage would reinstate her right of support &#x2026; In the result I regard it as more consistent with the basic principle of the remedy in our laws to hold that no allowance should be made in respect of a widow&#x2019;s earnings or earning capacity.</block>

<p>Also as regards the question whether insurance premiums which the breadwinner would have had to pay had he not been killed should be taken into account, the Appeal Court has lately had an opportunity of expressing an opinion. In this connection the Court said through the mouth of the same Judge&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it was contended in this Court that life insurance premiums which the deceased would have paid had he lived, should be deducted from the deceased&#x2019;s gross income in ascertaining his net income to be apportioned as afore-mentioned &#x2026; On the facts I can see no reason for holding that these amounts must first be deducted from gross income in order to ascertain his net income available for expenditure on his family &#x2026; the preponderant judicial view in this country is that life insurance premiums, which the deceased would have continued to pay had he lived, are not required to be matters for deduction&#x2014;whether in diminution of his gross income or as a benefit to the dependant from the cessation of the premiums &#x2026; It must therefore be taken as settled in this country, in regard to insurance premiums which the breadwinner would have continued to pay had he lived that the position is as follows: The Court, in arriving at a fair and equitable estimate of the loss to the dependants, is not obliged to and generally will not (save perhaps in some exceptional case) make any deduction in respect of such premiums&#x2014;whether in diminution of the deceased&#x2019;s gross income or as a benefit from their cessation.</block>

<p>The principle that the proceeds of insurance policies should be taken into account is still established in our law, however, and it is to be doubted whether that principle will summarily be amended by our judiciary. As recently as 1963 in the case of <i>Legal Insurance Company Ltd.</i> v. <i>Botes,</i> the principle in connection with insurance moneys was repeated by the Appeal Court as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as regards life insurance policies, &#x2026; it is clear from <i>Hulley</i> v. <i>Cox</i> &#x2026; that in breadwinner cases the benefit of accelerated receipt by the widow of the proceeds of insurance policies on the deceased&#x2019;s life may be taken into account in abatement of damages &#x2026; With regard to accident insurance policies &#x2026; the full proceeds &#x2026; must be deducted &#x2026; The reason is that the respondent must be put in the position in which he would have been if the deceased had not been killed. If he had not been killed and had lived out hi&#x00AB; expectation of life, the widow would not have received anything from the accident policies.</block>

<p>Because it has recently been felt, by Judges as well, that it is unfair that a wrongdoer should get the benefit of the consideration displayed by a breadwinner in taking out insurance for the protection of his family at his <span class="col_0845-0846" refersTo="page_0442"/>own expense, the question has arisen whether it should not be laid down in legislation that the proceeds of insurance policies shall not be taken into account in the assessment of the value of loss of support in the case where the death of a breadwinner has been caused wrongfully. Consequently the Law Revision Committee investigated this matter.</p>

<p>This Committee, as I have already mentioned, unanimously recommended that consideration should be given to legislation providing that the proceeds of insurance policies and pension moneys accruing to the dependants of the breadwinner on his death, shall not be taken into account in the assessment of the value of the loss of support of the dependant. Hon. members will agree with me that the introduction of such a principle, for which clause 1 of this Bill makes provision, is only fair. In <i>McKenzie</i> V. <i>S.A. Taxi-Cab Company,</i> 1910, Witwatersrand Provincial Division 232, which was referred to with approval in various other cases, the court decided in pursuance of English law that the amount which the plaintiff might claim from a defendant who had negligently caused him personal injuries was not subject to diminution for the reason that damages were completely or partially covered by insurance. One may ask oneself why in the case of the death of a breadwinner a wrongdoer should get the benefit of protection which the deceased obtained for his family at his own expense? Why should he derive benefit from an agreement in which he was not concerned at all? Why should the dependants of a breadwinner who was wise enough to make provision for his dependants recover less than the dependants of a breadwinner who had failed to make provision for his dependants? Under the existing arrangement it seems as though the deceased had been paying premiums all the time for the protection of the wrongdoer. If person, A, for example is insured for R30,000 it is difficult to understand why the wrongdoer should be benefited to the tune of that amount. A wrongdoer may argue to himself that he is insured against his own negligence to the tune of any amount of insurance, save, of course, any criminal consequences, but this also operates unfairly against wrongdoers. Surely it is nonsensical that the responsibility of a wrongdoer should be determined on the basis of whether he has hit an insured or an uninsured victim. Surely what is at issue here is the wrongfulness and consequences of the deed of the wrongdoer and not the consideration which has been displayed by the deceased. One may add here in a lighter vein that under the existing state of affairs and provided one knows that one&#x2019;s enemy is well insured, one may allow oneself considerably more liberty as regards the personal safety of one&#x2019;s enemy as would otherwise have been the case.</p>

<p>The proposal of the Law Revision Committee was sent to various interested persons and bodies as well as to Judges for their comments. I do not want to tire hon. members by furnishing a long list of the names of the interested parties who were consulted, but in broad outline I may mention that those who were consulted include the Association of Law Societies of South Africa, the General Council of the Bar of South Africa, universities, Judges, certain government departments, the Association of Pension and Provident Funds of South Africa, the Life Officers&#x2019; Association of Southern Africa and the Insurance Councils. All of these were consulted. I may tell you, Sir, that the principle of this Bill received overwhelming support. One or two bodies or persons, however, drew attention to a possible implication, and I shall deal with this later.</p>

<p>I shall now deal with the principle in brief. To some extent the principle contained in clause 1 of the Bill is more comprehensive than that which was recommended by the Law Revision Committee. The recommendation of that Committee concerned insurance and pension moneys, whereas, as hon. members will see, the Bill also refers to &#x201C;benefits&#x201D;, as defined, paid as a result of the death of a person. The reference to &#x201C;benefits paid by a friendly society for the relief or maintenance of a member&#x2019;s dependants&#x201D; was inserted at the suggestion of the Office of Financial Institutions and the reference to &#x201C;benefits paid by a trade union&#x201D; was inserted at the suggestion of the General Council of the Bar of South Africa. The definitions too were adapted in consequence of certain proposals.</p>

<p>To return to the possible implication this Bill may have to which I referred earlier on, I have to point out that registered companies carrying on business in terms of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 1942, will of necessity have to pay higher amounts in settlement of claims, which may have the result, although not necessarily, that premiums in respect of third-party insurance may be affected. But I want to say at once that this should not be seen as a deterrent. It should be borne in mind that this Bill relates only to cases where insurance moneys, etc., have to be paid as a result of the wrongful killing of a person. It should also be borne in mind that the principle of this Bill holds the advantage that the dependants of breadwinners who have been killed wrongfully, receive the benefits of a higher award. Otherwise one has to ask oneself whether it is fair to carry on according to the existing arrangement and to perpetuate for an indefinite period a principle which seems to be unfair. Such an approach hardly deserves consideration. The rest of the Bill is self-explanatory.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>May I congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister on his maiden speech as a Deputy Minister, and may I say how pleasing it is to find such a change in his tone, which it seems responsibility inevitably brings. We are indebted to the hon. the Deputy Minister for the very clear and full explanation he gave not only of the provisions of the Bill, but of its historical background <span class="col_0847-0848" refersTo="page_0443"/>and of the conditions pertaining in other countries of the world which motivated the Law Revision Committee to give its blessing to this Bill. I may say that I hope there are no hon. members who, having listened to the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech, were confused in looking at their Bills, because the first printed Bill I received, A.B. 17, the Assessment of Damages Bill, says inside that it is &#x201C;a Bill to provide for the formalities in respect of a contract for the sale of land; to repeal section 1 of the General Law Amendment Act. 1957&#x201D;. Inasmuch as 1,280 copies of this Bill were printed, I hope that mine was the only one which contained this extraordinary misprint.</p>

<p>Now, despite the fact that everyone else seems to have approved of this Bill the most important matter is what our attitude towards it is. But let me assure the hon. the Minister immediately that we wholeheartedly support the Bill. It is a very good principle that no one should be penalized because of thrift and because he has made provision for the future. The only pity is that this principle is not extended by this Government in respect of other matters such as, for example, pensions, which in principle are no different from the principle we are adopting in this Bill.</p>

<p>There is only one question which arises and that is why it is that workmen&#x2019;s compensation in terms of the Act is omitted from this Bill. In other words, we here provide that if damages are assessed by a court one must not take into account what the plaintiff in the case receives from insurance policies or other benefits which are defined as being payments by a friendly society or a trade union for the relief and maintenance of dependants. But there is no mention of payments under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. Quite clearly, so far as those payments are concerned, they will be taken into account in assessing damages. One wonders why this was omitted, and the reason which suggests itself to one is that this payment info the fund created by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is a statutory payment; in other words, it is a compulsory payment whereas insurance policies and friendly societies and the other benefits defined in the Bill are voluntary payments depending on the individual. Now, that may or may not be the reason, but we would like to hear from the hon. the Deputy Minister what exactly the reasons were for excluding the provisions of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. Subject to that query, we offer no objection to the Bill.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>With the exception of the proposed amendment to section 14, all the other amendments are consequential in nature and require no comment at the Second Reading. As section 14 of the National Film Board Act reads at present, it is not possible for the State to make grants-in-aid to the National Film Board. The proposed amendment makes such grants possible. The Film Institute of the National Film Board meets a pressing national need because prior to its establishment as part of the National Film Board no organization existed to foster the preservation, for posterity and for research purposes, of archival cinematograph films and related matters, for example apparatus, scenarios, reference books, periodicals, etc., extremely important cultural legacies not only for the film industry but also for history, and because cinematograph films, especially the old nitrate films, deteriorate rapidly. As a result of this many valuable archival cinematograph films have already been destroyed through the years and are lost forever to our nation and to posterity. South African filmic history dates back to the beginning of the present century and has captured for posterity the complications and developments of those troubled early times. These first cinematograph films are irreplaceable evidence of the standpoints, aims and attitudes of that period in our history. Here one thinks especially of film recordings of President Kruger in Rotterdam and Paris, of Adderley Street, Cape Town, in 1898, the capture of a Boer general&#x2014;most probably General Piet Cronje&#x2014;propaganda against South Africa in 1899, the African Mirrors of 1913 to 1956, film recordings of Generals Botha, Hertzog and Smuts. These old films, valuable additions to our historical possessions lay neglected in attics and cellars and store rooms for years, and after they had been traced through the agency of the Institute, it was found that in many cases they were in very poor condition. There are many rolls of film at present in the possession of companies, bodies and persons <span class="col_0849-0850" refersTo="page_0444"/>which are perishing because those companies, bodies and persons are not equipped to care for them and do not have the necessary interest or funds for the purpose either.</p>

<p>All films printed before 1950 were printed on nitrate film which deteriorates very rapidly, and it is highly necessary that these films be restored as quickly as possible and reprinted on acetate film. Five hundred and eighty-four rolls, or about 525,600 feet, have already been reprinted on acetate film, and in the case of the important African Mirrors the work has progressed up to the late thirties. More than a thousand of the African Mirrors still have to be reprinted, not to mention the mass of documentary and feature films. It is therefore urgently necessary that the existing films be restored immediately. The material in the possession of the Film Institute must undergo the following processes. First it must be examined to ascertain the contents of the tins, which often do not correspond at all to the description which appears on the outside of the tins. In most cases the films cannot be projected and must be examined carefully foot by foot with the naked eye to ascertain both the content and the condition thereof. Subsequently they have to be catalogued and supplied with cross-references. Often there are more than half a dozen subjects on one roll of film. In the case of nitrate or acetate films of poor quality they must be reprinted on non-inflammable acetate film and the rest must be cleaned and restored. Then the films must be stored in new rust-free containers, which have to be specially purchased for the purpose. They must be placed in specially designed safes for preservation. Finally they must be printed for use in composite films of historic and educational importance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, from the brief motivation I have given here, it is clear that there are considerable running costs in respect of the Film Institute. However, in view of the fact that the Film Board is a business undertaking which must be able to compete with other film producers as regards the production prices of films for the State and State-aided organizations, it is not fair to load its cost structure with expenditure on a service for which the State is by rights responsible. For this fundamental reason the proposed amendment is necessary so that grants may be made to the Board by the authorities to help defray the expenses of the Institute.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, in discussing the contents of this Bill, which is a very simple Bill, one notices that there are three clauses. The first two clauses are consequential upon the name of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s portfolio having been changed from Education, Arts and Science to National Education. Those are the first two clauses. The third clause is one which extends to the National Film Board a power which they did not have when the board was established in 1963. The board was established as a business undertaking, and to finance the board loans would be made available; that is the main principle; and now in this third clause, in addition to loans being made available, it is possible for grants to be made. No information is given about the grants, but grants may be made to the board. Sir, I should like to say at the beginning that in trying to get information about the activities of the Film Board we are faced with real difficulties. The Act says that the annual report of the Film Board will be laid upon the Table and, presumably, would then be available to members. But there is only one copy available. That copy is filed, and therefore it is necessary for hon. members who wish to see the copy to make a special study of it, and one may not bring it into the House to quote from it. Usually when reports are made available and laid upon the Table, we receive copies. It is not necessary in the case of the Film Board for every member to get a copy, but I think at least one or two copies should be made available to Government members and to us in the Opposition. It is difficult for us to get this information and therefore we have to go to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report where we find a financial report and nothing further. We do not get the information that the hon. the Minister has been able to give to the House this afternoon. Sir, these annual reports are available only up to March, 1967, in other words, two years ago. We have not vet received the report for the period ending March, 1968, and the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, which would help to some extent, is in Part III of his report, and that we have not received. We have received Parts I and II but we have not received Part III. Therefore that information is unavailable. But from the information we have gleaned from previous reports of the Auditor-General and from replies to very good, searching questions put on the Order Paper by my colleague, the hon. member for Orange Grove, we have received some more information; so I should like to state briefly what the history of the Film Board has been financially, because we are now discussing the financial question. The merits of the work done by the board do not enter into this. We know why it was necessary to have the amendment because the film institute has to be maintained and the film institute, I think, should be maintained.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, let us take a look at the financial history of the board. For the first year, as far as I can ascertain, there was a loss of R79,700. Well, one has to expect that because, as the companies tell us when they have a loss in the first year or two, they have teething trouble. Well, probably this board too had teething trouble. They suffered a loss of R79,700 in the first year. The following year, up to March, 1966, the loss was R40,000 so they were getting on; they were establishing themselves and doing rather well. Then we come to the year 1967, the latest figure available to us; there was a profit of R9.800. In reply to a question put by the hon. member for Orange Grove we ascertained on Friday that for the year ending 31st March, 1968, the profit was not <span class="col_0851-0852" refersTo="page_0445"/>R9,800 but R74,000. By the way, Sir, may I say in passing that the reply to that question was prepared at short notice and we are very grateful to the hon. the Minister and his staff for assisting us as they have done. As I say, for the year ending March, 1968, the profit increased to R74,000. They are doing well. Now the hon. the Minister tells us that provision has to be made for the Film Institute. According to the records and according to the reply to this question, we find that the Film Institute last year cost R27,000; so, even making provision for the cost of R27,000 for the Film Institute, they still had a big profit. I accept what the hon. the Minister has said &#x2026;</p>

<p>They have borrowed funds and if they are financed on borrowed money we can see in the annual reports how they are getting on. I do not think it is necessary to rush in and give these grants when it has not been proved that it is necessary. After all, they have these funds; they have money of their own invested, and they draw interest on that money. I think they are running their business in a good businesslike manner. The question is whether the explanation of the hon. the Minister is satisfactory, and I hope that in reply to the Second-Reading debate he will give us a little more information. We are not quite satisfied, and if we have to define more accurately why the money is required it may be necessary for us to move an amendment in the Committee Stage, but at this Second-Reading stage we are prepared to accept the Bill because there is only one financial clause. Whether we discuss this clause, clause 3, in the Second-Reading debate or in the Committee Stage, it comes to the same thing.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>A number of misgivings arise in connection with this Bill, also as a result of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech. I wonder whether he can tell us if the appropriations made for the Film Institute in the past since its establishment in 1964, have now been found to have been <i>ultra vires,</i> to have been unauthorized, and whether one of the reasons for this Bill is not specifically that some or other body, or perhaps the Auditor-General, notified him that the loans made to the Film Board may not go to the Film Institute. As my hon. colleague said, we have unfortunately not yet received Part III of the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report in this connection, but it may be that the hon. the Minister has information in this regard. The aims, as explained by the hon. the Minister, meet with our approval, of course, but if one looks at the Bill itself, the aims are not as limited as the hon. the Minister would have us believe. According to the Bill grants-in-aid may be made on conditions determined by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance. In other words, it can cover a much wider field than that which the hon. the Minister indicated to us this afternoon. Like the hon. member for Kensington, I hope that in one way or another, either in the Committee Stage, or elsewhere, provision will be made so that the actual purpose of this grant-in-aid may be clearly defined, that it will be for the Film Institute, and that the conditions for this grant-in-aid which the Minister is going to lay down, will be made known, either in the <i>Government Gazette</i> or in some other way, so that we, Parliament, may know precisely for what purpose that money is going to be employed. Under no circumstances do I want to make the accusation against the hon. the Minister or the Film Board that either of them will use the money for a purpose other than that which they suggest here, but circumstances may change and there will be other Ministers in the future. Therefore it will be a good thing if we could get some or other assurance in this connection embodied in the legislation.</p>

<p>Grants-in-aid are something which one more readily associates with organizations outside Government or semi-Government bodies. There is, for example, the grant-in-aid to the National Botanical Gardens at Kirstenbosch, to the Simon Van der Stel Foundation and for South African war graves. There are also comparable grants-in-aid by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own Department, for example to the National Institute for Social Research. I think that that is the name of that institute which falls under the hon. the Minister and I am sure that he will have a grant made to it. These are, however, grants of a different nature to those given to a body which has its own revenue. The National Film Board is one of the bodies which have their own revenue. It has enough money to pay for the Film Institute, which in fact also constitutes a portion of its work.</p>

<p>I want to mention an analogy to you. The S.A.B.C. is also a body with a large revenue. It also has its own film archives, its own discoth&#x00E9;que, and these are paid for out of the S.A.B.C.s&#x2019; own revenue. Is it not also possible for the National Film Board to finance its archives from its own revenue? The National Film Board is a body which spends a great deal of money. It pays R260.000 to outside bodies. We should like to have the assurance that when money is voted, or permission is granted for these grants-in-aid to be made, the funds will be used only for the purpose stipulated by the hon. the Minister, and will not go to outside bodies, for example. In answer to my question on Friday the hon. the Minister was kind enough to give me an estimate of the budget of the Film Institute for the financial year 1969-&#x2019;70. If I remember correctly, the amount concerned was R64.000. He said that of that R64,000, R23,000 would be paid out in salaries and wages and R1,200 in respect of administration costs. The total expenditure in this regard is therefore about R24,000. Now we should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he can give us an indication of what the other R40,000 will be needed for in the ensuing financial year.</p>

<p><span class="col_0853-0854" refersTo="page_0446"/>Moreover, this is perhaps not the best way of maintaining the archives. I do believe that such archives are necessary, just as the work which the National Film Institute does is necessary. I wonder whether the archives themselves cannot preserve the films, as is done in other countries. I am now thinking of the Library of Congress in the United States, where films are stored and looked after properly. Is it not perhaps a task for which a grant-in-aid can be made to another Department? Is it right that the hon. the Minister should ask for such a grant to be made to the National Film Board?</p>

<p>I therefore hope to receive more assistance in this connection and that the hon. the Minister will answer a few of our objections and that we may possibly receive an indication in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of the extent of the actual work of the National Film Institute, a body which is not mentioned in the original Act of 1963. The Film Institute, for which grants-in-aid are being requested, will fall under the National Film Board.</p>

<p>There are able people serving on the Film Board, especially the heads of Government Departments. I am sure that where they, and especially the Film Institute, will now supply the films, they will be doing valuable work. I do not feel quite happy about the fact that all the members of the Film Board will serve in the Film Institute. I only mention in passing that the chairman of the S.A.B.C., Professor Weiss and a few other persons are serving on it. With these few words I want to conclude and to give the hon. the Minister an opportunity of replying to the few misgivings which we on this side of the House have raised.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I regret that the two hon. members of the Opposition felt that there were objections. Before this amending Bill was referred to me, I paid a special visit to the archival division of the Film Board by invitation. I think that if the two hon. members had accompanied me on this visit, they would have gained, or when they themselves pay such a visit in future, they will gain a completely new insight into the matter. The hon. members would call it a kind of sabotage and neglect of the past as a result of the fact that there was no organization to take care of this matter. When the Film Board was established, it was never the intention that it should undertake these tasks. Under the old dispensation, before the Film Board was established, a safe was constructed because there were a few enthusiasts who saw what it was all going to lead to. The temperature must be kept at a certain minimum in order to combat the process of deterioration. They opened a few tins for me which contained only powder; one could no longer even read on the outside what the contents of the tin had been. I think we must pay tribute to-day to the National Film Board, which, since its establishment, took immediate action, despite the fact that it could not be held responsible for these matters. The Board saved what could be saved by immediately taking the necessary steps, not only as far as restoration was concerned, but also for the preservation of those items that were still to be found. I stated very clearly in my Second-Reading speech that there is not the slightest doubt that the National Film Board is a business organization. Everything which the Board has done thus far, has been done with loan capital. The hon. member for Kensington said that in 1966 there was a profit of R9,000 and in 1967 a profit of R74,000. This is an ordinary profit on revenue and expenditure. This is not a net profit because it does not include the redemption of loans, the payment of interest, buildings which had to be erected and equipment required. Up to now the Film Board has had to borrow more than R2 million and with the repayment of this the Department is first going to help them to get back on their feet. The negligible amounts which constitute the profit, include the profit on expenditure and revenue, expenditure such as on material used, salaries paid, etc. Then provision has not yet been made for all the other matters for which capital is required. To call the Film Board a business undertaking, which must make use of loan capical, is to saddle it with a function with which it is not directly concerned. If the Film Board, which must now manufacture films for the various departments, had been indifferent to the matter, if they had asked, &#x201C;What difference would it make to us if all the old African Mirrors and all the old things perished?&#x201D; then hon. members could have accused the Board of irresponsibility. Neither was it a case of the Auditor-General stopping them and telling them that it was not their function to do archival work. There is no question of that. I think the hon. member for Orange Grove went too far. He drew a comparison between the S.A.B.C. and the Film Board. It is important for the S.A.B.C. to preserve its own material and to do the ordinary restoration work, but it is of no importance to the Film Board to do so, except if the function is allocated to it, and the function has been allocated to it. But it would be unwise for the Film Board to plough its profits into a function which, as I clearly stated in my Second-Reading speech, is actually a function of the State. The State has an interest in the matter, it is a cultural action to preserve records of the past because they give a vivid picture of what happened.</p>

<p>I can give hon. members opposite the assurance that as regards the allocation of these funds, which will be accounted for in the Budget each year, they will be employed for no other purpose. An explanation will be given. So much will be allocated for salaries, so much for other expenses, and the rest for material. There will only be a certain permanent staff engaged on the work on a full-time basis, and not persons from the Film Board working on a part-time basis. A separate staff will be engaged on the archival work, and we shall have to indicate separately in the Estimates what <span class="col_0855-0856" refersTo="page_0447"/>money is required for the Film Board for the restoration and preservation of old films.</p>

<p>There will be no revenue. We have so much of our own work which must be attended to. I merely mentioned in my Second Reading speech that we do not know what is still lying around outside, and if it is of sufficient value to be preserved for the nation this will be done, but it will have to be decided whether it is in the interests of the nation. We cannot simply give people cinematograph films which have been repaired and restored.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, I think there is a little misunderstanding. I regret that the annual report could not be tabled now. I want to break a lance here to-day for what the Film Board has done and especially for what they did with the able general manager, Mr. Jan Botha, in charge of affairs. I must say that these people have really done pioneer work, they have made a breakthrough, and I think we must give the Film Board full credit. I know hon. members opposite agree with me. They will only get this additional supervisory duty, but the funds may not be taken from their funds. It is my sincere hope that on second thoughts the Opposition will not find it necessary to oppose this measure any further.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment to this Act is of a technical nature, but it is essential for the efficient bookkeeping of the South African War Graves Board. In terms of the present wording of the War Graves Act, it is the duty of the Controller and Auditor-General to audit the accounts of the Board, but there are no instructions as to the manner in which the Board should keep its records. Clause 1 of this measure now eliminates this shortcoming by providing that the Secretary for Cultural Affairs may prescribe the manner in which the records should be kept. As regards clause 2, I want to point out that prior to the establishment of the South African War Graves Board by legislation, this body was established as an administrative measure and was known as the South African War Graves Board (Suid-Afrikaanse Oorlogsgrafteraad). Cher the years this latter South African War Graves Board, which was established in 1956, acquired certain movable assets which had to be transferred to the Board established by legislation. The provisions of clause 2 of the amending Bill are necessary in order to legalize the transfer of these assets.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The object of the proposals contained in this amending Bill is, in the first place, to round off what has been happening in the course of a few years with regard to the re-organization of the South African Defence Force.</p>

<p>On 17th October, 1966, the public servant who occupied the post of Secretary for Defence vacated that post and the Commandant General of the South African Defence Force was appointed to that post whilst retaining his duties as Commandant General. He was therefore both Commandant General of the South African Defence Force and Secretary for Defence. By Proclamation No. 124 of 1967 the designation of the head of the Department of Defence was changed from Secretary for Defence to Commandant General of the South African Defence Force. The proposed amendment legalizes the appointment and regulates his duties, functions, conditions of service and privileges as he is a member of the forces and not a public servant in the narrow sense of the word. Clause 7 provides for this.</p>

<p>Subsection (2) is necessary in view of the fact that non-members of the South African Defence Force are also employed in the Department of Defence. This group includes public servants and temporary employees who have been appointed in terms of the Public Service Act and fall under the public service <span class="col_0857-0858" refersTo="page_0448"/>regulations for the purposes of discipline. Members of the Defence Force are, of course, subject to the Military Discipline Code. Therefore, in order to enable them to apply the public service regulations to their civilian subordinates, they are deemed to have been appointed in terms of the Public Service Act. The Cabinet decided to put this matter beyond any doubt after proper legal advice had been obtained in regard thereto. Civilians are employed mainly in the inspectorate and in the accounting section, and women for the most part are employed as clerical assistants.</p>

<p>The second principle of this amending Bill is to make provision for various matters in respect of which the Minister may delegate some of the powers which are legally his, which will allow of matters of a purely routine nature and ones in respect of which the Minister has laid down his policy being executed on behalf of the Minister. This will bring about a general acceleration of activities and work, will relieve the Minister of unnecessary burdens and will entrust commanders with greater responsibilities. This is very important. The clause which deals with the delegation of powers, is clause 2, which relates to the appointment of honorary members of commandos. Clause 3 deals with refresher courses in respect of certain officers of the Reserve. Clause 4 deals with the employment of members of the Permanent Force Reserve in other portions of the South African Defence Force for service in terms of Chapter X. Clause 5 deals with something of a purely administrative nature. Clauses 8, 9 and 10 also deal with the delegation of powers.</p>

<p>In addition the amending Bill makes provision in clause 6 for the proper exclusion of 16-year-olds from the selection lists drawn up during the year in which they register. In view of the fact that training only commences during the year in which the person who is liable to undergo compulsory military service turns 18, and in view of the fact that the selection list is drawn up during the year which proceeds training, the persons whose names appear on the selection list must be in their seventeenth year or older, This merely is an attempt to exclude 16-year-olds effectively.</p>

<p>In addition a few things are being rectified, for example by paragraphs (b) and (c) of clause 6, as well as clause 11, which makes a grammatical improvement. This covers virtually all the provisions of this amending Bill. *</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the principle with regard to the post of Commandant General and Secretary for Defence is one which we on this side of the House have already accepted. It has our full support.</p>

<p>The other principle which the hon. the Minister is presenting in this Bill, i.e. that with regard to the delegation of powers, is another which we do not oppose. We realize full well that no matter how the Minister delegates his powers, he still is responsible to this House in the end for what is happening in his Department, wherever it may be happening. This being so, we have no objection to this principle.</p>

<p>As far as clause 5 is concerned, I should like to ask the Minister, however, to explain to us why he deems it necessary to delegate the powers to the registering officer. A new post is now also being created for such a registering officer. Or is this merely an old post which is now being defined? As regards clause 8, which deals with the retirement of members of the Force and the opportunity they have to stay on in the Force, I feel that this is a matter to which the Minister should give his personal attention in any event. I should not like to see him delegating these powers to somebody else.</p>

<p>With these few words I want to indicate that we support this Bill. If further discussion is necessary, we shall do so during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as regards the hon. member&#x2019;s question with reference to the registering officer, I just want to say that there is a registering officer. At times it does happen, however, that he is on leave or on sick leave, or something of that nature. What is being done here, is only being done to eliminate the tedious procedure which has to be followed when in such cases the Minister appoints a person to act in his stead. This is the reply to his question.</p>

<p>As regards the question of the delegation of powers in respect of officers whose terms of service have expired and whose terms of service may be extended, the position will be that the policy will first be laid down in consultation with the Minister, i.e. on what grounds such persons will be retained in service. In the second place, reports will be made to me from time to time on all delegations which have been made to different officers. The practice to-day is, where I have already delegated powers relating to certain matters, that reports are made to me to explain what actions have been taken under those delegated powers. But you will realize, Sir, that, with a growing Defence Force which is assuming the proportions our Defence Force is assuming at present, and in view of the fact that in addition to the activities of the Defence Force there now are other activities in connection with the production of armaments and the Armaments Development Corporation, it has virtually become a matter of impossibility for the Minister to give his attention to a whole series of routine matters, when he can quite easily lay down his policy and receive reports on those matters from time to time. This is the whole object we are seeking to achieve with this amendment.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This short measure became necessary because of the action Parliament took to introduce a system of national service for the Citizen Force and Commandos instead of the old system of applying the ballot. The definition of &#x201C;citizen&#x201D; will also now, if this is agreed to, include the South African citizens within the meaning of the South African Citizen Act of 1949; and include a non-citizen, to whom the provisions of section 63 of the Defence Act have been made applicable by the proclamation provided for. Hon. members will recollect that when the Bill was before a Select Committee, we made provision that national service also be applied to immigrants under certain conditions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the term &#x201C;service&#x201D; is reformulated to suit the provisions of the Defence Act, as amended. In clauses 2 and 3 the words &#x201C;undergoing compulsory military training&#x201D; are substituted by the words &#x201C;rendering service&#x201D; in accordance with the system of national service already in practice. Provision is also made in clause 4 to bring the position into line with the principle of national service. In other words, the basic idea contained in this measure is that the protection of the principal Act will now apply to all those called up under the provisions in respect of national service of the Defence Act.</p>

I just want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to clause 1, in which mention is made of a &#x201C;non-citizen&#x201D;, in other words, a person who has not declared that he does not intend becoming a South African citizen. I was under the impression that the following procedure was followed as regards the training of the non-citizens, namely that those who are not citizens, are asked whether they will become citizens later. If their reply is in the negative, they are not trained. Does the reverse apply now? If the person remains quiet, is he still going to be trained?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the principle that was accepted, was that we would issue a proclamation in terms of which this whole matter would be regulated. The crux of the matter was that people in certain age groups who had not become citizens yet, would be given the opportunity to say whether it was their intention to become citizens. If they declare that intention, they are registered and called up at the prescribed age to render compulsory service. However, this does not apply to those who do not intend becoming citizens. The principle as accepted by the Select Committee is not altered by this measure.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Since the Liquor Act first appeared in 1928 it has been amended on no fewer than 26 occasions. To assert that the position as far as liquor legislation is concerned is a fluid one because it deals with a liquid commodity is probably not too far-fetched. The provisions of the Bill of which I am moving the Second Reading, deal with liquor in general, but cover miscellaneous matters. It would be easier to deliberate on each separate provision in the Committee Stage, and consequently, for the <span class="col_0861-0862" refersTo="page_0450"/>purposes of the Second Reading, I will not go into details on the principles contained in each separate clause. I therefore intend confining myself in the main to what I regard as the most important principles of this Bill.</p>

<p>Hon. members may recall that in February, 1967, my Department published a Liquor Amendment Bill for general information and commentary. Many of the provisions which appeared in that draft Bill have been included in the Bill before you. Where practicable, and where it was found essential, the provisions of the 1967 draft have been supplemented and adapted. However, I want to mention that it was not possible in all the cases to comply with all suggestions and requests since there are too many conflicting interests and divergent opinions when it comes to liquor distribution. In the first place the Bill contains a number of provisions which are aimed at facilitating and rectifying administrative operations, administrative problems which crop up, and at clarifying certain provisions. In this connection I am referring, <i>inter alia,</i> to clause 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13. The provision in regard to prohibited brews such as Skokiaan and Barberton, and distillates of these, has in the past given rise to certain problems when prosecutions were instituted. That provision, i.e. section 122 of the Act, has now been rewritten as laid down in clause 41, and I hope that the problems will in this way be eliminated.</p>

<p>According to information illegal trafficking in liquor is assuming disquieting proportions. This is not only confined to shebeens but is also taking place in ordinary cafes. In order to combat this evil effectively provision is being made in clause 53 (c) for minimum penalties. I have no doubt that this measure will be supported by all hon. members. The Wine, Other Fermented Beverages and Spirits Act, 1957, was recently amended to make provision for the control of the manufacture of other fermented beverages, including the so-called orange wine. Up to now the sale of a beverage made from fruit other than grapes was controlled by the provisions of sections 6 (3) and 90 of the Liquor Act. As a result of the amendment of the Wine, Other Fermented Beverages and Spirits Act, 1957 it was resolved to overhaul the provisions regulating the sale of other fermented beverages as well. You will find the provision, which is in fact self-explanatory, in clause 3 of the Bill. You will note in regard to clause 3 that it is being envisaged that a wine farmer who wants to sell wine on his farm or a wine co-operative that wants to manufacture wine at a central cellar should be treated on the same basis as the manufacturer of other fermented beverages. This means that such a wine farmer or co-operative, in the same way as the manufacturer of other fermented beverages shall operate in terms of ministerial authorization, granted upon the recommendation of the National Liquor Board. If a manufacturer of wine should want to sell his wine elsewhere, i.e. at the so-called wine farmers&#x2019; depots, a wine farmer&#x2019;s licence must be applied for in the way already prescribed.</p>

<p>Furthermore I want to refer to clause 19 which envisages certain important changes in the system of classification. When provision was made for classification in 1963 it was stipulated that a classified establishment should apply for re-classification every three years. Subsequent to that a system has been introduced administratively whereby each classified hotel is inspected at least twice annually in order to determine whether the prescribed requirements are still being complied with. As a result of this, we regard it as unnecessary that three-yearly applications for re-classification should be made, and that requirement is consequently being repealed now. I am convinced that this provision will be welcomed by the hotel industry in particular. Hon. members are aware that upon classification the privilege of allowing women into certain restricted areas can be granted. Some of you will probably have visited these so-called ladies&#x2019; bars already, and will agree with me that it is a very big improvement on the old system of men&#x2019;s bars.</p>

<p>However, a problem has cropped up in this regard in that some hotel owners have constructed their dining rooms or restaurants or lounges in such a way that the ladies&#x2019; bar forms part of these. As soon as liquor is poured over the counter in a room, that room becomes a bar for the purposes of the Liquor Act, and consequently such a dining room or restaurant must be closed on closed days and persons under the age of 18 may in any case not be allowed in. This matter is now being rectified in clause 19. I want to make it very clear right now that what is being envisaged with this is not to allow general drinking in bars on closed days, and even less to allow children into bars. This concession will only be granted by me upon the recommendation of the National Liquor Board, and then it will be subjected to conditions and restrictions.</p>

<p>Prior to 1928 it was legal to employ women as bar attendants. With the commencement of the 1928 Act however, a prohibition was placed on this. In 1963 it was provided that a housekeeper could also be employed as a bar attendant. However, this provision is being circumvented by some licence-holders who are allowing charming your women to work behind the bar counter under the pretext that they are housekeepers. According to my information many of these women have little or no knowledge of housekeeping. That provision is therefore being deleted now. However, to alleviate the problems experienced by hoteliers in recruiting suitable male bar attendants, and also because it is felt that a woman behind the counter would be better suited to the atmosphere of a ladies&#x2019; bar, provision is being made in clause 19 for the employment of females in ladies&#x2019; bars. It is a privilege which it will only be possible to grant to classified hotels, and it will be subject to such conditions and restrictions as I, after consultation with the National Liquor Board, shall impose. In this connection I may state that <span class="col_0863-0864" refersTo="page_0451"/>such a woman will be subject to a process of selection by the local magistrate and the designated police officer in so far as character&#x2014;not her vital statistics&#x2014;are concerned. I also want to mention that although the relevant clause stipulates the minimum age for such employment to be 18 years, I intend to make it considerably higher by imposing conditions. I want to emphasize that if this concession leads to undesirable conditions, I will not hesitate to withdraw the privilege immediately in specific cases.</p>

<p>When an off-consumption privilege is granted to a hotel by virtue of classification, the licence-holder must pay an amount equivalent to half of the renewal fees for his hotel licence for it. It happens quite often that such off-consumption privileges cannot at first be taken up during the month of January, but only much later on in the year. At present no provision is made in the Act for a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in the fees payable for such off-consumption. In order to accommodate hotels further, provision is now being made for this as well in clause 19.</p>

<p>A day on which a Parliamentary or provincial election takes place is a closed day for the purposes of the Liquor Act. This provision must also be read in conjunction with section 181 of the Electoral Laws Act. It is also generally accepted that a day on which an election of members of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council takes place is a closed day. In clause 21 this matter is being dealt with as follows.</p>

<p>In the first place, liquor for on-consumption may be sold to Whites in the normal way on a polling day for members of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council provided the distribution point is situated in a white group area. Conversely, liquor for on-consumption may be sold to non-Whites (excluding Bantu) in the normal way on a Parliamentary or provincial polling day, provided the distribution point is situated in a non-white group area. In the event of authorizations in terms of sections 100<i>bis</i> and 100<i>sex</i> you will find similar provisions in clauses 32 and 33.</p>

<p>The reason for these changes is simply that non-Whites have nothing to do with Parliamentary and provincial elections, and that the opposite applies in the event of an election of members of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that this concession, which I am certain will be supported by all on-consumption licence-holders and particularly hoteliers, is restricted to the provision of liquor for on-consumption. As is at present the case liquor for off-consumption may not be supplied.</p>

<p>As has already been said, the polling days which I mentioned are closed days subject to what has just been explained now. In clause 21 it is also being provided that on such a polling day liquor for on-consumption may be sold in the normal way from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. In my opinion there is no good reason why on-consumption drinking localities should remain closed after the polls have closed.</p>

<p>Since I have now dealt with closed days and polling days, I also want to refer to paragraph (b) of clause 55. At present the day on which an election of members of an urban local government, excluding a by-election, takes place is a closed day. It is being envisaged in said clause to make this closed day an ordinary open day. We are doing this because we are convinced that the reasons for this restriction no longer exist. It is extremely unlikely that a voter at a local government election will allow himself to be influenced by a few tots of liquor, or that a candidate will make a few voters drunk in order to obtain a few votes.</p>

<p>Clause 23 deals with wholesale liquor licences, and is one of the provisions which appeared in the 1967 draft bill. The provision elicited quite a good deal of divergent commentary. I want to emphasize that what this clause is envisaging is not to deprive any person of his existing privileges. A wholesaler who traded with the public previously, will still be able to continue doing so, provided he complies with the prescribed requirements.</p>

<p>Clause 29 is a new provision. As hon. members are aware, the Minister can impose conditions and restrictions when he grants a new liquor licence. These conditions and restrictions, which of course differ for every type of licence, are known as standard conditions. When a local licensing board renews a licence granted by the Minister the board may impose additional conditions, but may not amend or delete the Ministerial conditions without consent. In the case of licences which were granted before 1965, every local administration imposed its own standard conditions, which differed from one licensing area to another. Those of you who have anything to do with liquor licensing will know about the tediously long list of roneod conditions which is attached each year to the licence itself. What is being envisaged in the clause is to make it possible for the Minister to announce by way of notification in the <i>Gazette</i> standard conditions and restrictions in respect of the various classes of licences. These conditions and restrictions will then be applicable to all licences of the particular class to which it relates. Provision is also being made for the suspension of any particular condition or restriction. A licensing board will not be able to suspend, amend or delete such a condition or restriction without ministerial approval, nor impose a condition or restriction which is in conflict with those imposed by the Minister. This measure will result in uniformity in so far as the general conditions and restrictions are concerned, will eliminate a vast quantity of work for magistrates and their staff, and every licence holder of a particular type of licence will know that he is being treated on exactly the same basis as his counterpart. I want to give the licensed liquor trade the <span class="col_0865-0866" refersTo="page_0452"/>assurance that the general conditions and restrictions which are being envisaged will first be published in draft form in the <i>Gazette</i> for general information and that they will be afforded the opportunity of commenting on and, where necessary, making representations in that regard.</p>

<p>The amendment to sections 100<i>bis and</i> 100<i>sex</i> (clauses 32 and 33) are to a large degree self-explanatory. In both cases the tabling of particulars of authorizations which have been renewed is being done away with. As a result of the increasing number of authorizations which are being granted (in the case of section 100<i>bis</i> there have been 430, and in the case of section 100<i>sex</i> 75) the documents dealing with renewals which have to be tabled each year are becoming more and more bulky. The necessary particulars are in any case set out once in the document which furnishes details in regard to the new authorizations which have been granted. I doubt whether the particulars which are furnished in regard to renewals serve any purpose and justify the enormous quantity of work involved in the compiling of those particulars. In any case my Department can furnish the particulars to any person wishing to have them. In the case of section 100<i>bis</i> provision is also being made for the granting of authorities to the Bantu Development Corporation and the Investment Corporation, whereas in the case of section 100<i>sex</i> the Coloured Development Corporation will also be able to hold authorities or have an interest in them as a shareholder. It will enable the relevant bodies to fulfil their aims more efficiently. Clause 33 also contains a relatively long new provision to deal with the position where a shareholder in a business authorized by section 100<i>sex</i> leaves the country permanently. It has come to my attention that in one case two shareholders left the country permanently, because, according to report, they were dissatisfied with certain aspects of Government policy. I am convinced that the considerable benefit which section 100 <i>sex</i> bestows upon Coloureds and Indians was intended for inhabitants of the Republic and not for people who are permanent residents outside our country. This provision will enable us to deal with such a position.</p>

<p>There are certain licensed clubs and restaurants of excellent quality which have so-called dummy bars. In these bars liquor may not be poured over the counter and this is done around the corner out of sight of the guest. Apart from the fact that something like this can lead to all kinds of irregularities, I am satisfied, in view of the success which we are having with ladies bars in hotels, that we can also allow ladies into club and restaurant bars. In the case of restaurants the same position applies in regard to the bar portion which in practice forms part of the eating locale and which therefore makes it a prohibited area for women and children under the age of 18. It will only be possible to grant this concession upon the request and after recommendation by the National Liquor Board, and will be made subject to restrictions and conditions. In this case as well it is not the intention that children should in future be allowed into bars and supplied with liquor. The relevant provision is clause 36.</p>

<p>The labelling of liquor containers with the name and address of the license-holder was previously controlled by the provisions of the Wine, Other Fermented Beverages and Spirits Act, and in some cases by the conditions imposed by local boards as well. In clause 40 provision is now being made for this. It is unfortunately the case that as a result of the smuggling trade this provision is necessary.</p>

<p>I also want to refer hon. members to clauses 15, 55 (h), 57, 58 and 59. These deal with the Mount Currie district. The provisions of the Liquor Act of the Republic are not at present applicable to that district, and the sale of liquor there is being controlled by the Transkeian Liquor Proclamation of 1949. According to the description of the Transkei in the Transkei Constitution Act, 1963, the Mount Currie district does not, however, form part of that territory. The present state of affairs, i.e. that applications for liquor licenses in that district are dealt with by the Secretary for Justice of the Transkeian Government, and that matters in regard to liquor should be controlled by provision which differs from the Liquor Act is an undesirable state of affairs. The matter was investigated <i>in loco</i> and I gave consideration to the objections of the local liquor license-holders. After careful consideration I decided that, notwithstanding the objections, which at this stage already I want to state are in my opinion rather unimportant, the Mount Currie district should be incorporated in the Liquor Act of 1928. One of the objections raised in regard to incorporation is the question of classification. Just as was done in the case of all other hotels in the Republic, the hoteliers of which there are six in the district, are offered a period of five years in which to have their establishments classified.</p>

<p>There are other provisions in the Bill which are possibly of less importance and which I should like to explain in more detail in Committee, if I am requested to do so.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we are all agreed that this Bill, like almost any other amendment to the Liquor Act, is a matter to be dealt with in the Committee Stage. I rise merely to indicate not what my personal views are, but to indicate that the United Party traditionally has a free vote on any amendment to the Liquor Act. We feel that it is a matter of individual conscience as to how members feel on liquor in relation to matters such as applications for licences and the various other matters which appear in this Bill for the first time, such as the provision for the presence of women in classified licensed premises. We feel that that is a matter <span class="col_0867-0868" refersTo="page_0453"/>to which each individual member should apply his own mind.</p>

<p>Sir, there are various principles in this Bill, as the hon. the Minister has said, but no main principle, and there are other principles which, while they relate to liquor, have an effect upon other aspects such as elections. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument that it is quite in order to allow liquor to be served in on-consumption premises during a municipal election but not during a parliamentary or provincial election, is one with which I would say at first blush many people may disagree. In fact, I might go so far as to say that in my own mind it might be in those circumstances, in a local election, that the possibility of anyone being tempted to vote for someone on the basis that he might get a drink if he did, is more real than it would be in a parliamentary or provincial election, for the reason that in a parliamentary or provincial election, one votes for a cause, for a party, for certain principles. One goes there to vote for the candidate who represents that party whereas in a municipal election&#x2014;and I must say that the figures indicate that the percentage poll in municipal elections is extraordinarily low in comparison with parliamentary or provincial elections&#x2014;someone might be induced to vote for the reason I have mentioned. However, that is a matter that we will have a look at in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>This is a very long Bill and it is no doubt the first of many that the hon. the Minister is going to have to introduce because of the unfortunate manner in which the 1963 Act was in fact handled. There we had basic amendments to the Liquor Act and, if I recall correctly, there were over 150 clauses, and they were not debated in committee. I think we got as far as clause 7 of that Bill when the guillotine came down, and as a result of the fact that there was no debate in this House the hon. the Minister now finds himself faced with all these difficulties. I am glad the hon. the Minister agrees and I hope he will never allow that to happen again with a liquor Bill. Sir, we are very pleased that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in this regard has been that he has given advance publication by publishing in the Gazette a draft bill which contained many of the provisions of this particular Bill.</p>

<p>There are many other aspects of it which do not fall within the principles of this Bill because the Bill, as I said, has no main principle, to which we will certainly give our attention in the Committee Stage. The provisions which the hon. the Minister has mentioned such as closed days and minimum penalties, are matters to which we may have to give consideration, not as individual members but as the collective unit that we are as the official Opposition. For all those reasons, Sir, we offer no objection to the Bill at this stage, and we look forward to debating these matters&#x2014;some in our private capacities, and others in our capacity as the official Opposition.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as in the case of formalities in respect of contracts of purchase and sale of land, there was no uniformity in connection with the formalities in regard to leases of land in the various provinces prior to the adoption of section 2 of the General Law Amendment Act, 1956. In the Transvaal, the Free State and Natal the matter was governed by pre-Union statutory provisions, while in the Cape Province there were no statutory provisions in this connection.</p>

<p>In carrying out one of its aims, i.e. to inquire into and make recommendations in connection with uniformity in the legislation applicable in the various provinces of the Republic, the Law Revision Committee considered the various provisions in force in connection with leases and recommended uniform legislation. Section 2 of the General Law Amendment Act, 1956, was a result of a recommendation by this committee. That provision, just like the provision in connection with the formalities in respect of contracts of purchase and sale, did not escape the scrutiny of the judicature and legal critics. There were judicial decisions and criticism in legal periodicals, but I do not think it is necessary to burden this House with the details. It is desirable that the alleged obscurities should be cleared up.</p>

<p>One of the grounds of criticism of the existing provision is that principles in connection with various legal concepts are combined in it in such a way that they have no relation to each other. The main provision deals with the formalities in respect of the conclusion of leases, while the proviso is allgedly related to the operation of the rule &#x201C;Lease goes before sale&#x201D; and of a cession of a lease, which have no connection with each other and with the main provisions.</p>

<p>It also appears that the expression &#x201C;third parties&#x201D; is a concept of uncertain meaning. It is not clear whether it is the intention that a successor under gratuitous title, i.e. a successor who has not given value for the land, such as in the case of a donation or inheritance, should also be protected where a long-term lease, i.e. a lease for a term of at least 10 years, is not registered against the title deed of the leased land, or whether it is the intention that the provision should only apply in respect of a <span class="col_0869-0870" refersTo="page_0454"/>creditor or successor under onerous title, for example a successor by way of purchase.</p>

<p>Then it also appears, in terms of the existing provision, that an unregistered long-term lease is invalid from the beginning, while in terms of earlier law such a lease was binding for the first 10 years in respect of a successor under onerous title or a creditor, where the lessee was in possession of the thing leased. This is alleged to be an anomaly if it is taken into account that a short-term lease, i.e. a lease of less than 10 years, which does not have to be registered, is enforceable on third parties where the lessee is in possession of the thing leased. A lessee on short-term therefore enjoys greater protection than a lessee on long-term where the lease has not been registered. Furthermore it is contended that the provisions in connection with cession are not necessary, as the Registration of Deeds Act, 1937, regulates the matter adequately. A further question that arises is whether the proviso in the existing Act is at all necessary and whether the common law will not in any event be revived if the proviso is not re-enacted.</p>

<p>All these vexed questions have once again been considered by the Law Revision Committee&#x2014;which, as hon. members know, consists of prominent jurists&#x2014;in the light of judicial decisions, the common law and statute law as it applied in the provinces prior to the passing of section 2. That Committee has now recommended that a provision such as is contained in clause 1 of the Bill be substituted for section 2. That provision regulates the formalities in connection with leases in a way which the Committee considers to be the most feasible in the light of judicial decisions and the common law. This should eliminate the problems I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>The date of commencement of the Bill, as provided in clause 4, corresponds with that of the Formalities in respect of Contracts of Sale of Land Bill and should afford interested parties sufficient time to become acquainted with the provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p>Having said this, Mr. Speaker, I think that no more need be said on the general principle of the Bill.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The amendments to the principal Act proposed in this Bill contain two principles. Clauses 1 and 3 are intended to abolish, with retrospective effect, the requirement that the conditions of service of the officials and employees of the Scientific Research Council be prescribed by regulation, and clause 2 is meant to authorize the Council, with retrospective effect, to receive money voted by the Provincial Councils in aid of the Council for research work. I may just say that both these provisions are only meant to rectify matters and to make them more streamlined; they contain nothing new, as I shall indicate.</p>

<p>Under section 10 (1) (a) of the Scientific Research Council Bill, 1962, no official or employee of the C.S.I.R. may be employed under conditions (including remuneration) other than those prescribed by regulation. Experience has shown, however, that in practice it is impossible always to keep to the letter of this provision. So many bodies have to be consulted about altered conditions of service and remuneration of officials, and it takes such a long time to obtain a final decision from all the bodies concerned, that it has often in the past been necessary to apply revised salary scales with retrospective effect. The payment of such salaries is not in accordance with the letter of the law, and therefore it is considered necessary to amend the original section with retrospective effect from the date of commencement of the 1962 Act (1st April, 1962).</p>

<p>The corresponding sections in the Acts by which other statutory bodies were established, <span class="col_0871-0872" refersTo="page_0455"/>do not make it compulsory to prescribe conditions of service by regulation, and there is no reason why the C.S.I.R. should be treated differently from these bodies. In other words, the C.S.I.R. is now being treated in the same way as other statutory bodies.</p>

<p>Provincial councils have for many years been voting money for research work in regard to matters in which they and local authorities have a direct interest. Contributions of this kind mainly went to projects launched by the C.S.I.R. in connection with air and water pollution, the re-use of water, efficient building methods, road construction and road safety. All these matters are of real interest to the provincial administrations and local authorities. Since 1964 a total amount of R263,600 has been donated to the C.S.I.R. for projects of this kind by the four provinces, but the law advisers have now expressed the opinion that these contributions do not fall within the powers of the provincial councils.</p>

<p>The Administrators decided during their latest conference to accept the principle that provincial councils should have the right and should be encouraged to make contributions, as in the past, towards research work on matters which are of direct interest to local authorities and themselves. They accordingly requested that the relevent legislation be suitably amended to grant the provincial councils this right and to legalize such donations as have been made in the past. Clause 2 is intended to accede to this request in so far as it is possible to do so in terms of the legislation under my control. The question whether the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, 1945 (Act No. 38 of 1945), should also be amended accordingly, is being considered by the Department of the Interior. I think it is clear that we are here, with the consent of all the parties concerned, rectifying a matter which is of fundamental importance to the C.S.I.R.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House will assist the passage of this Bill. We are particularly pleased that the anomalies which existed in the past, especially in respect of the affairs of the C.S.I.R., will now be removed. Furthermore, certain matters which were purely provincial matters were in the past not really dealt with by the provinces but by the Central Government. That anomaly is now also being removed. For these reasons we intend to support this Bill. At the Committee Stage we might criticize one of the clauses of the Bill. We shall, however, study the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation of that clause again before the Committee Stage of the Bill.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in this Bill amendments are being proposed to the two Acts which contain for the most part the provisions in terms of which the admission of persons to and departure of persons from the Republic is controlled, i.e. the Admission of Persons to the Union Regulations Act, 1913 (Act No. 22 of 1913) and the Departure from the Union Regulations Act, 1955 (Act No. 34 of 1955).</p>

<p>I should like to mention to this hon. House, by way of information, that during 1968 the following number of persons legally entered or departed from the Republic, from or to areas other than the three former High Commission Territories:</p>

<p>Entry: Whites 617,690</p>

<p>Non-Whites 34,693</p>

<p>Departure: Whites 596,699</p>

<p>Non-Whites 23,597</p>

<p>In respect of Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland statistics for 1967 only are available, and then only in respect of Bantu. These are as follows:</p>

<p>Entry: South African Bantu returning 113,033</p>

<p>Foreign Bantu 273,725</p>

<p>Departure: South African Bantu 121,073</p>

<p>Foreign Bantu 290,024</p>

<p>These statistics are being quoted in the first place to try and give an idea of the extent of the traffic to and from the Republic and secondly because it will become quite apparent from these statistics how essential the provisions of the above-mentioned Acts are and how necessary it is for efficient control that the provisions of these two Acts should continually be taken under consideration with the purpose of determining whether prevailing problems can still be dealt with by means of the existing powers and whether additional powers are not possibly essential in order to protect the peaceful inhabitants of the Republic against threats from within as well as from outside by persons who have no other interest than their own and who in addition are not even citizens of this country yet. Ours is a hospitable country which has a great deal to offer for those who want to and who can share our lot with us, but no sensible person can expect us to allow our hospitality to be abused in order to destroy what we esteem very highly. That is why I feel myself at liberty to approach this House with the proposals contained in this Bill. This is an extremely important <span class="col_0873-0874" refersTo="page_0456"/>Bill, and for that reason I deem it my duty to give as comprehensive a summary and explanation as possible of the aims of the proposed legislation and the reasons why these amendments are regarded as being essential and justified in my Second Reading speech already. The best way in which this can be done is to deal with those clauses of the Bill in question which are of importance and to the purpose one by one, and I am now proceeding to do so.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<p>In terms of the present provisions of the Admissions of Persons to the Union Regulation Act 1913, as amended by the Border Control Act, 1967, which came into operation on 1st February, 1969, every individual arriving at a port giving access to the Republic with the purpose of entering the country must appear before a passport control officer, and must satisfy that officer that he is not a prohibited person in terms of the provisions of this Act. Before the commencement of the Border Control Act, 1967, legal admission to the country was not restricted to the entrances and all a person entering the country had to do was report as soon as was practicable for him to a passport control officer for examination in terms of the Act. At such an examination by a passport control officer, it is in the first place ascertained whether the person in question complies with the requirements of section 24 of Act 22 of 1913, which provide for the most part that any person except a South African citizen by birth or origin, shall be a prohibited person in the Republic if he is not in possession at his arrival at a port of a passport or other document of identity which is recognized by the Minister, including a visa, unless he has been exempted from the requirement to be in possession of a visa. (Before the commencement of the Border Control Act, 1967, these provisions were not applicable to children under the age of 16 years.)</p>

<p>If said person complies with the requirements of section 24, it is subsequently determined whether he is affected by the provisions of section 4 of Act 22 of 1913, in which section it is provided that any person entering or having entered the Republic is a prohibited person in the Republic unless he is not subject, in terms of the provisions of section 5 of the same Act, to the provisions of section 4, if he is (to mention only a few of the most important impediments): (a) any person or class of persons deemed by the Minister on economic grounds or on account of standard or habits of life to be unsuited to the requirements of the Republic; (b) any person who is unable, by reason of deficient education, to read and write any European language to the satisfaction of a passport control officer; (c) any person who is likely to become a public charge by reason of infirmity of mind or body or insufficient funds; (d) any person who has been convicted in any country of certain serious offences mentioned in paragraph 4 (1) (f); (e) any person suffering from certain infectious diseases or (f) any person who was legally removed from the Republic, unless he has obtained permission to return.</p>

<p>Among the persons who are exempted from the provisions of section 4 are, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;(a) persons who enjoy diplomatic immunity in the Republic, other representatives of foreign states and members of their households; (b) persons, with isolated exceptions, who were born in areas which at present comprise the Republic, and (c) any person domiciled in the Republic. (What is understood under the concept domicile will subsequently become apparent from the explanation of certain other amendments.)</p>

<p>If said person complies with all the requirements of Act 22 of 1913 which may be applicable to him for admission to the country, and he is not a South African citizen and is not a person to whom permanent residence has been granted in terms of section 4 of the Aliens Act 1937 (Act No. 1 of 1937) or who has been exempted from the provisions of this Act, a passport control officer can, upon request, issue a temporary aliens permit to him in terms of section 5 (1) of the Aliens Act, 1937 (Act No. 1 of 1937), as amended, in order to enter the Republic temporarily or sojourn therein if they are already there for the purposes, period and subject to the conditions as are set forth in that permit.</p>

<p>Any person who remains in the Republic after the expiration of the period mentioned in the aliens temporary permit or who contravenes any one of the conditions shall be guilty of an offence and can be dealt with under the provisions of Act 22 of 1913 as a prohibited person in the Republic.</p>

<p>In terms of the statutory provisions which have so far been dealt with briefly, any person can consequently be a prohibited person in the Republic, firstly if he is not in possession of a passport and visa on entry, or secondly if he is subject to the restrictions mentioned in section 4 of Act 22 of 1913, or thirdly if he is not in possession, during his sojourn in the country, of a valid aliens temporary permit.</p>

<p>Section 2 (5) of Act 22 of 1913 provides that when admission to the Republic is refused by any passport control officer or police officer, or when any person is detained, restricted or arrested as a prohibited person, that officer shall give notice of that fact and the grounds of such refusal, detention, restriction or arrest, to that person in writing (as well as to the captain of the ship or aircraft if he arrived by those means). Every such prohibited person has the right of appeal, which except in exceptional cases must be exercised within three days, to a board constituted for the purpose of such appeals in the area.</p>

<p>In terms of section 24 (4) of Act 22 of 1913 any person who is a prohibited person in the Republic because he entered the Republic without a passport and visa (if this requirement is applicable in his case) is guilty of an offence and is liable upon conviction to imprisonment <span class="col_0875-0876" refersTo="page_0457"/> for a period of six months, and whether he is convicted or not, a passport control officer may arrest or have him arrested without a warrant if he is not already in custody and can remove him or have him removed from the Republic in terms of a warrant issued under this Act. While awaiting such removal such a prohibited person can be detained in a prescribed place of detention.</p>

<p>Apparently any person who objects to the fact that he has been declared a prohibited person in the Republic because he was not, as explained, in possession of a valid passport (and visa) or an aliens temporary permit, also has the right of appeal to an appeal board, and must consequently be granted three days in which to exercise that right.</p>

<p>If these persons, who are sojourning illegally in the country as appears quite clearly from the fact that they are not in possession of the documents in question, are not detained, they generally disappear like the proverbial needle in the haystack and to detain them, will, owing to the numbers, create practical problems at the places of detention. They are aware of the practical problems which make detention, particularly at border posts, impossible and that is why they make use of the three days&#x2019; grace to appeal in order to enter the country and then disappear, or after having been traced in the country, make use of the same subterfuge in order to disappear again. This behaviour on the part of such persons, once the loophole becomes general knowledge, will defeat all attempts to keep persons who have no right to admission or to sojourn in the Republic out of the country. In the light of the circumstances I have explained, I therefore feel myself at liberty to recommend in clause 1 that this loophole be eliminated.</p>

<p>I do not think that if reference is made to the provisions of section 24 (4) of Act 22 of 1913 in particular, there will be any doubt that it was not the intention that a person should have a right of appeal under these circumstances if he can prove his right to admission or sojourn by submitting only the documents in question.</p>

<p>In clause 1 it is being proposed further that the amount which can be accepted as a deposit from a prohibited person as indeminification against costs for the State when that person appeals against his prohibition, should be increased from a maximum of R200 to a maximum of R1,000. This amount was laid down many years ago&#x2014;I think it was in 1927&#x2014;and since then the costs in question have increased tremendously.</p>

<p>In this way for example ships refuse point blank to transport prohibited persons since their presence spoils the journey for other passengers and on the other hand airline companies almost as a rule demand that such a person be accompanied by an escort in order to protect the other passengers from any unpleasantness. If the entire amount which is taken as a deposit is not used for expenses, the balance is paid back.</p>

<p>I come now to clause 2, and at the same time I want to deal here with clause 6 (a) because it has a bearing on clause 2 (a). As was pointed out earlier, section 5 of Act 22 of 1913 provides which persons or class of persons cannot be declared to be prohibited persons in the Republic in terms of the restrictions contained in section 4 of the same Act. Section 5 (1) (e) protects, subject to certain qualifications, persons who were born in any part of the Republic before the commencement of this Act, i.e. 5th August, 1913, and subject to certain conditions and with the exclusion of certain categories, persons (chiefly Asiatics) who were born after 1st August, 1913, in any place of parents who were domiciled in the Republic at the birth of the person in question. This right is known in common parlance as the so-called birthright. Apart from this certain categories of persons domiciled in the Republic are protected from the restrictions of section 4 by the provisions of section 5 (1) (f).</p>

<p>Domicile for the purposes of this Act means in brief the place where any persons has his present permanent home or place of residence, or to which he is returning as his present permanent abode and not for a mere special or temporary purpose.</p>

<p>In addition it is a requirement that such domicile cannot be obtained in the Republic or in a province unless that person has lawfully resided therein for a continuous period of three years, otherwise than under terms of conditional or temporary residence or detention in a prison or gaol, reformatory or mental hospital.</p>

<p>Once this domicile has been acquired it can in general only be lost if the person concerned departs from the Republic and does not return within three years after the date of such departure, or had not returned within three years after 5th July, 1927, the date on which the Immigration and Indian Relief (Further Provision) Act, 1927, came into operation.</p>

<p>Apparently this provision in respect of the loss of domicile only after an absence of three years has this result that a person who in terms of the provisions of the repealed provisions of section 1 (b) of the Union Nationality and Flags Act, 1927, ceased to be a Union citizen through the loss of his common law domicile and consequently is not a South African citizen in terms of the South African Citizenship Act. 1949, is still protected from the provisions of section 4.</p>

<p>Common law domicile is of course lost as soon as a person departs physically from the country with the intention of not returning. In addition to this section 15 of the South African Citizenship Act, 1949 contains provisions in terms of which South African citizens automatically cease to be such citizens. One of the principal provisions is that such a citizen ceases to be a South African citizen if he acquires, while outside the Republic and provided he is not a minor, the nationality or <span class="col_0877-0878" refersTo="page_0458"/>citizenship of a country other than the Republic by some voluntary and formal action or other, apart from a marriage.</p>

<p>Consequently it is clear that there are persons who were South African citizens or even Union citizens who are not South African citizens because they gave up citizenship of this country of their own free will, but who are nevertheless exempted in terms of the provisions of section 5 (1) (e) and (f) of Act 22 of 1913 from the provisions of section 4 of that Act.</p>

<p>With the proposed amendments contained in clauses 2 (a) and 6 (a) it is recommended that such persons should also be made subject to those provisions when they make application for admission, and that the value of citizenship of the Republic is by so doing being enhanced and becomes of greater value for citizens.</p>

<p>A further matter of great importance which is made the subject of discussion in this Bill is the deportation of certain persons under clause 3 from the Republic in terms of the provisions of section 22 (3) of Act 22 of 1913. This section was added in 1956, and its intention was made very clear by the then Minister, i.e. to remove persons who are not South African citizens and who cannot be removed in terms of any other provision from the Republic if the Minister deems it in the public interest to order such removal. The principle is accepted that the Minister&#x2019;s decision shall be final, but since 1956 it has become apparent that the wording of this provision is at fault in certain respects, and the result of that has been that such persons cannot be removed forthwith. The present interpretation of the provision is that such a person has the right to lodge an objection, after a removal order has been served on him, to the Minister, and has the right to make representations in writing. There were no real objections to this, although the original purpose of this power has to a certain extent been defeated.</p>

<p>There is now a tendency, as an apparently logical extension of this interpretation, which grants a right to be heard, to interpret it as granting a right to have the reasons for the removal furnished by the Minister; otherwise it is not possible to exercise the right to be heard. In order to ensure that the original intention of this Parliament is not made null and void, it is being recommended in clause 3 that it should be prescribed clearly that the decision of the Minister is in no way subject to appeal to the courts, and that no person is entitled to reasons for such decision.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with clause 5 and want to explain that in terms of the definition (section 30) of a passport control officer, a passport control officer is any person, apart from a board of appeal, to whom the Minister has entrusted powers or duties in connection with the implementation of Act 22 of 1913. The result of this definition was that the Minister had to appoint every person as a passport control officer, a process which hampered the tracing of prohibited persons in the Republic and their detention. It often happens that a police officer comes across a prohibited person, but because he has not been appointed as a passport control officer, he does not have the authority to ask the person for the necessary documents to prove that he is not a prohibited person. The result is that the prohibited person simply disappears.</p>

<p>Consequently it is now being proposed in clause 5 that the Minister be vested with the authority to appoint any officer or group of officers in the public service as a passport control officer or officers, and to entrust to such persons such duties as he may deem necessary in connection with the implementation of the Act.</p>

<p>In addition to this it is being suggested that any police officer or person, authorized thereto in writing by the Minister, who suspects on reasonable grounds that a person is not a South African citizen, may require that person to produce to him proof that he is entitled to be in the Republic, and if satisfactory proof cannot be submitted, to take that person into custody and bring him before a passport control officer who can then determine what that person&#x2019;s rights are. This power is necessary so that police officers and even officers of local administrations can be used to contain the tremendous stream of persons who have no right to sojourn in the Republic and who are illegally resident here.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 7 it should be mentioned that in terms of the present provisions of the Departure from the Union Regulation Act, 1955 (Act 34 of 1955), no person may depart from the Republic except through a port and may not do so without valid travel documents.</p>

<p>On the basis of these provisions, passport control officers have in the past always prevented persons from acting in conflict with these provisions, but after an intensive investigation into more effective means of controlling entry and departure from the country, the conclusion was reached that every person departing from the country should before such departure display his travel documents to a passport control officer and shall only be allowed to leave the country if those documents are valid.</p>

<p>Since the best way of undertaking the examination of the person in question can only be determined by way of experience, taking into consideration the convenience of visitors, the problems which differ from one airport to another and from one harbour to another, it is being proposed that the State President should be vested with the authority to prescribe by regulation the necessary steps, which can then be adjusted according to circumstances.</p>

<p>I want to state that, arising out of the explanations which have been furnished, I believe that it will be clear that we are dealing in this Bill with a task of tremendous proportions, and of the utmost importance to our <span class="col_0879-0880" refersTo="page_0459"/>country which with all its attractions offers a refuge and a safe home to honourable persons, but which, at the same time also offers an attractive hunting ground for that kind of person whom we can definitely get along without and against whom the inhabitants expect and have the right to expect that the State should protect them. I hope and trust that this Bill will enjoy the full support of both sides of this House.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the remarks of the hon. the Minister make it quite clear that measures of this sort are of a rather complicated nature and I wonder whether a lot of time on the part of the hon. Minister and members of this House could not have been saved had there been an explanatory memorandum with certain cross references as far as this legislation is concerned. There is a further problem that arises from this Bill and that is the determination of the principle involved which we are to discuss during the Second Reading. It seems to me from the remarks by the hon. the Minister that the principle involved is the extension of powers, in one way or another, so as to tighten up the control of entry into and departure of persons from the Republic. If that is the principle, then obviously a great measure of our discussion will take place during the Committee Stage. The extent to which such an extension of powers, and the extent to which laws must be amended to give that extension of powers, is a matter which we will have to debate in more detail in the Committee Stage. I want to give the assurance that we on this side of the House will obviously support measures which are justified as being necessary to ensure effective control of the borders of the Republic of South Africa. The figures given by the hon. the Minister indicate the enormity of the task which faces our officials who have to keep guard on the borders and watch movements into and out of the Republic. Obviously also this side of the House will support measures which are necessary to ensure that there are removed from the Republic those persons who are not citizens of South Africa and about whom the hon. the Minister says &#x201C;ons kan sonder hulle beslis klaarkom&#x201D;. Obviously we will support measures to remove undesirable persons from the Republic, but at the same time there are aspects of this Bill about which one wonders whether they are ensuring that no citizen of the Republic, and no former citizens of the Republic&#x2014;and a former citizen can become a former citizen for various reasons which I will elaborate upon&#x2014;are unjustly treated by reason of the legislation that we pass. I therefore wish, at this stage, to deal with certain aspects of the Bill and I hope that the hon. the Minister will elaborate on them when he replies to the Second Reading Debate.</p>

<p>Firstly I want to turn to clause 1 (a) of the Bill. The hon. the Minister took a considerable amount of time in explaining to the House the implications of section 24 which virtually deals with aliens entering the country without proper documents. He also took a great deal of time explaining the implications of the provisions of Act 1 of 1937 which, in effect, deals with an alien exceeding the time that he is permitted to remain in the country. But there was a strong silence on the part of the hon. the Minister as regards the umbrella phrase which is included in this particular clause, namely &#x201C;a prohibited person in terms of any other law&#x201D;. That is a very wide provision. We know there are powers to declare a person a prohibited immigrant under emergency regulations, which are now being enacted. We know that there are times when, under the Citizenship Act, a person becomes a prohibited immigrant. But when one is here in this clause excluding the right of appeal I do think that the hon. the Minister should be more explicit as to which prohibited immigrants he in fact means to bring under this umbrella provision and under this clause. Perhaps he could indicate to us what the other laws are to which there is this generalized reference when he replies to this debate.</p>

<p>The other point in this clause 1 to which I want to refer is the question of the deposit being fixed in the case of an appeal. If clause 1 (a) of the Bill is approved by the House the appeal in clause 1 (b) of the Bill will then be of a person who is not a prohibited immigrant, in other words, a person who has a legitimate right to have a decision reviewed as to whether he can and cannot remain in the Republic. The amount of deposit which is requested is a maximum sum, but it seems to me that it is a very onerous and considerable sum of money, namely R1,000. At the same time I must concede that what that has to cover, namely the cost of detention, the cost of removal to the place of hearing, the cost of removal back and then the cost of removal from the Republic does not make the sum excessive. One appreciates also that the amount suggested is the maximum figure that can be demanded by a passport control officer. I wonder whether we are not doing an injustice to would-be appellants by puting the appeal completely out of their reach, especially as the persons who are appealing will not be prohibited immigrants if the first portion of this clause is approved.</p>

<p>I would now like to deal with the Minister&#x2019;s remarks regarding clause 2 (c). As I understand the position under clause 2 (c), a person who was previously a citizen of the Republic or a Union national and has lost that nationality will be treated for all purposes of the Aliens Regulation Act, 1913, as an alien. If I am correct I think it is necessary that we should examine under what circumstances citizenship can be lost. I would assume, from an international law aspect, that we in this country would in any event have to receive back, despite this proposed clause, a former South African citizen who has not acquired some other nationality and who is deported back to South Africa. I am also concerned <span class="col_0881-0882" refersTo="page_0460"/>with whether this clause does not affect those persons who leave South Africa on exit permits for purposes of permanent residence elsewhere, because they have no option and because of administrative procedures. I want to raise a matter here which is of considerable concern to sections of the population. One has seen complaints about this. There are sections of South African citizens, qualified under the Citizenship Act, who are not issued with passports to enable them to leave South Africa as South African citizens. The only way they can leave to go overseas to take up employment is to apply for exit permits and to state that they are leaving permanently. They are then given an exit permit and under section 5 (1) of Act 34 of 1955 they then lose their South African citizenship and for purposes of our laws are then regarded as aliens. If I am correct, I think that is a matter that the Minister might consider further and I think we may have suggestions to make during the Committee Stage to alleviate this position when this position is the result of Government action or administrative action. Coloured persons are for instance issued with exit permits and not passports. Sometimes they desire to come back to the country of their birth. They then become aliens for the purposes of this provision although they initially only wished to leave temporarily and to retain their South African citizenship. I think we will have further discussion with the Minister on that clause in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Then there is clause 3. The Minister has given us his reasons why it is felt that he as the Minister should be relieved of the obligation of disclosing certain factors to a court on an appeal against the exercise of his discretion. I also appreciate that this does not apply to a person who is a South African citizen, but only to an alien. We are not entirely happy that this should be enacted. There are various reasons why we believe that it is a provision which is abhorrent, that a man is determined to be undesirable in the opinion of the Minister and has no means of any review of the Minister&#x2019;s decision. I know that the Minister himself will use a legal or an unbiased mind when dealing with these problems, but one must also look at what might happen in the future and one must also have regard to the possibility of the Minister being misinformed. He may be misinformed as to the factors upon which he subsequently decides that it is in the public interest that a person should be removed. I know that the courts have asked for this information to be placed before them in appeals which have come before them. I think the Minister should give us some more acceptable reasons than he has done so far as to why he should be given these powers and why he should be excused from the obligation of justifying the opinion he formed.</p>

<p>The other aspect of this clause, as I understand it&#x2014;and again I would be indebted to the Minister if he would elaborate on it&#x2014;is that the right of proceeding to the courts on review on the normal grounds of <i>mala fides,</i> etc., are not excluded in any way by this amendment. The intention is that the amendment applies only to the question of disclosing the grounds upon which the Minister formed the opinion that the person should be removed in the public interest. In other words, all other aspects of review and rights of review are not in any way affected by this particular provision.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 4, the Minister has correctly drawn attention to the problem of identifying by name in the <i>Government Gazette</i> the number of persons who must operate or function as passport officers to a lesser or greater degree, as they may be authorized from time to time. One realizes the practical difficulties on the long borders of South Africa. As I listened to the hon. the Minister, I wondered why it was that when he appreciates problems of this sort his party should be contemplating the creation of eight more international boundaries. I merely mention it because the Minister already has so many difficulties in dealing with the boundaries for which he is now responsible. But one appreciates the necessity for giving authority to a class of persons or a class of officers so as to deal effectively with the problem.</p>

<p>There is one point in clause 5 to which I wish to refer. Again it is a question of what is intended by the Minister. One can understand that on some of the borders of the Republic, if one allows somebody to get across without immediate apprehension, there is little likelihood of finding him in the desert or in the bush which divides him from the police post where he might enter the Republic. I understand, therefore, that there should be the power of arrest, but it seems that there should be an obligation on the person affecting the arrest to bring the person before a passport officer, and that there should not merely be a discretion. I draw attention to line 30 of clause 5, which says that when a person is so arrested he may be brought before a passport officer. I shall move in the Committee Stage that this should be made obligatory and that he shall be brought before a passport officer so that his position can be investigated and decided upon with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>The final observation I wish to make now is in regard to clause 7. Here I understand that the difficulty at present is that although there is a check-up, for instance, of persons leaving some airports and seaports of the Republic, there is no record kept by the Department of departures and it is necessary that some procedure should be introduced in order that there can be a continuous record of the identity of persons leaving. It is a Utopian ideal that that should be done, but on the figures the Minister has given us in regard to these movements I wonder whether he can assure the House that this will not be some decision, some ideal which we hope for but <span class="col_0883-0884" refersTo="page_0461"/>which is unobtainable, and whether he feels it is possible in fact to implement what is contemplated here, that there should be a complete check-up of every person coming and going, and that the information about persons leaving should be passed to the aliens officer. It would probably necessitate a considerable increase in the number of public servants if such a record was kept.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say that we on this side of the House, as I said before, will not oppose the Second Reading of the Bill, but the question of how far these powers should be given to the Minister will be a matter for debate under the various clauses in the. Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point indicated that they were not opposing the Second Reading of the Bill on any principles, and therefore it will probably be better to discuss the various clauses in more detail in the Committee Stage. But the hon. member raised a few points to which I want to reply briefly now.</p>

<p>In the first place the hon. member expressed the view that an explanatory memorandum would have been desirable in the case of this Bill. Yes, that may be so. The Bill is not a very long one, but I am inclined to agree with him that the reference to all the various sections in old Acts which from the nature of the case have existed since the beginning of the history of the Republic, makes this a complicated piece of legislation, but I also have some doubt as to whether a memorandum would have made the matter much less complicated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It might have helped one trace them. *</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but as you have seen, I found it necessary to deal with this short Bill in great detail in my Second Reading speech, because I wanted to cover the entire field in order to indicate where these matters originated. I have some doubt as to whether an explanatory memorandum might not perhaps have caused more confusion. It is difficult to decide when one should have such a memorandum and when one should not. I felt that because the Bill is so short it was not necessary to have one.</p>

<p>The first point raised by the hon. member was the words &#x201C;any other law&#x201D; in clause 1. The reply to this is simply &#x201C;to make assurance doubly sure&#x201D;. These words have been inserted to be of assistance not only in the case of section 6 of Act No. 34 of 1955, but also in the case of any other provision which may be necessary in future, and in the case of the legislation and regulations of other Departments. Here we had in mind more specifically the legislation of the Department of Bantu Administration, bearing in mind that &#x201C;other law&#x201D; also refers to regulations. Therefore it was deemed desirable to tackle the matter on a broad basis and to use a comprehensive phrase, and as a result we have the reference to &#x201C;any other law&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the increase of the deposit to R1,000 in clause 1. It used to be &#x00A3;100, or R200, and now we have increased it to R1,000. I realize that people may find it difficult to find the necessary amount to deposit, but the hon. member will also agree with me that if R200 were deemed necessary at that time, then an amount of R1,000 is certainly not out of proportion in terms of the present value of money. I also want to direct his attention to the fact that it is within the discretion of the officer. I think the hon. member himself said the officer was not obliged to demand R1,000 as a deposit, but that a smaller amount could be demanded, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to someone who leaves the country on an exit permit and loses his citizenship as a result. That is so. Our view is that if someone leaves on an exit permit and with the intention of leaving South Africa permanently, he must be deemed to lose his citizenship by doing so. But I want to point out to the hon. member that according to the Hague Convention we are obliged to take such a person back if he is not accepted in the country of his destination. Therefore, if he is regarded as a stateless person there, we are obliged to receive him back in South Africa.</p>

<p>The other point raised by the hon. member relates <i>to</i> clause 3, which provides that the Minister will not be required to furnish reasons when he removes a foreigner from the country and does so in the public interest. The hon. member said I had to furnish better reasons. If I had been in a position to furnish the reasons, which in most cases I cannot do because it is not in the public interest and I should furnish them&#x2014;because I cannot furnish them in most cases, it is also difficult for me today to give the hon. member better reasons. But I should like to give him this assurance. In the first place my approach is that those people have no claim to residence in South Africa. Foreigners have no right or claim to residence here. Their residence here is subject to the willingness and the decisions of the Government. The hon. member will of course agree with me on that point. In cases where they forfeit their privilege to obtain residence in South Africa, we must have the right to put them out of the country. But now it happens so often, in most cases in fact&#x2014;just recently it happened again in one particular case&#x2014;that the Minister is obliged to issue an order that such a person be removed from the Republic and that the circumstances are simply such that the reasons cannot be furnished. If I could have explained the circumstances privately to the hon. member, he would have understood better why it is so. But the fact of the matter is simply that we are to-day living in a different world from the one we used to live in. The circumstances that prevail to-day in a world that has become small are different from <span class="col_0885-0886" refersTo="page_0462"/>the ones that prevailed previously, and as a result of international interest, the one in the affairs of the other, as a result of subversive activities taking place, and particularly as a result of the fact that one does not want to reveal the source of the information, it is necessary &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Is that not the crux of the matter?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is in fact the crux of the matter. In most cases one does not want to reveal the source of one&#x2019;s information, and as a result the Minister would not be able to carry out his duty properly if he were to be subject to a provision that he must give reasons as to why he takes such a step in the public interest. Consequently I feel, especially in view of the practical proof we have had in recent times, that the Minister should not be placed under that obligation when he has to take such a step.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to clause 5 and the word &#x201C;may&#x201D;. He feels it should be mandatory. I do not really want to enlarge on this; we can discuss it during the Committee Stage, but cases of illness or other cases may occur where it is simply not desirable that it should be made mandatory. I am prepared, however, to consider the matter and then to discuss it with a greater degree of motivation during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think these are more or less the matters that were raised here. I presume we shall be able profitably to discuss the matter further during the Committee Stage.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill was drafted after consultation with the insurance industry, and the comments and suggestions of the insurance industry were taken into consideration throughout. It contains a number of diverse provisions and it is not possible to indicate their content in terms of any special feature. One could, however, say that the general object of the Bill is to bring the Insurance Act, 1943, more into line with changed circumstances and to adopt it in the light of experience gained in its practical application.</p>

<p>I should like to refer briefly to the most important matters involved and I shall more or less follow the order of the Bill. I do not intend referring to proposed amendments which are only meant to improve existing provisions in the Act and in which no important principles are involved. If it proves necessary, I shall explain these less important provisions during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>In terms of the proposed amendment to the definition of &#x201C;funeral policy&#x201D;, the maximum value in money of an obligation which may be incurred under such a policy is increased from R200 to R300. Representations were received from the insurers to increase the limit to R400. It was taken into account, however, that benefit societies registered under the Friendly Societies Act, seldom in practice offer funeral benefits exceeding R300. If the Insurance Act were now to raise the limit to above R300, it might lead to an artificial increase in funeral expenses. I may just point out to hon. members that concern has been expressed in this House in the past in regard to high funeral costs.</p>

<p>A concession is made in regard to the calculation of the net liabilities of a registered insurer. An insurer will, subject to the approval of the Registrar, in the calculation of his net liabilities be permitted, in addition to other deductions permitted by law, to deduct a liability to a creditor who has waived his right of discharge in concurrence with other creditors. This concession is proposed to cover the case in which an insurer has established a full subsidiary for the purpose of undertaking specialized forms of medical insurance and underwriting medical schemes. Members of such schemes insist on the underwriting company limiting its share capital so that the surplus assets which the company is obliged to possess over and above its net obligations, cannot be provided by the parent company in the form of share capital</p>

<p>The proposed amendments will make it possible to draw the surplus from loan funds provided by the parent company. By waiving its rights the parent company virtually places itself in the position of a shareholder and the loan funds may be regarded as share capital for the purpose of the calculation of obligations</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that an insurer will only be able to make use of this concession with the approval of the Registrar, which will ensure that it will remain strictly limited to the cases which we now have in mind.</p>

<p>In addition a concession is proposed which will make it possible to obtain registration in respect of long-term insurance business without paying the required deposit to the Treasury. This is intended for the type of case where it becomes necessary to register a new insurer for the sole purpose of taking over long-term business from an existing insurer, having it fully re-insured by a registered insurer and letting it terminate, a situation which sometimes occurs in practice. The requirement that the obligations should be fully re-insured by a registered insurer will provide an adequate safeguard to the policy-owners concerned. A further amendment which is logically related to the concession which has <span class="col_0887-0888" refersTo="page_0463"/>just been referred to, is the provision which is being made to the effect that a deposit already paid by the new insurer, may be repaid to him if the circumstances agree with those just described.</p>

<p>In the case where an insurer has ceased to undertake insurance business or has failed to commence with it within a reasonable period after registration, the Registrar is now being authorized to take the initiative and to with draw the registration. It has been proved in practice that it is undesirable that inactive insurers should continue in existence as such to no purpose, but in terms of the present wording of the Act, withdrawal at the initiative of the Registrar is practically excluded. When the insurer opposes the withdrawal, the Registrar has to afford him an opportunity of stating his case.</p>

<p>At present an insurer is permitted to transfer assets which he possesses in excess of the minimum requirements laid down by the Act in regard to either long-term or short-term or compulsory third party insurance business freely among these sectors, on condition only that he notify the Registrar of such transfers. It is now propoed that the approval of the Registrar is made a pre-requisite for any internal transfer of assets, including surplus assets. This amendment is deemed desirable because it is not possible in practice to draw a defenite distinction between surplus assets and other assets.</p>

<p>Certain forms of amalgamation and transfer of business in which a domestic insurer is concerned are at present subject to confirmation by either the court or the Registrar. There are others which do not require confirmation at present, but which may be to the disadvantage of policy-holders and creditors. It is now proposed that these should also be made subject to confirmation.</p>

<p>In addition to this it is proposed, <i>inter alia</i> with a view to affording better protection to policy-owners and creditors, to extend the existing requirements to the effect that the Registrar be notified of certain forms of acquisition of interests in the insurance industry.</p>

<p>The Act already provides that the court may issue directions to the liquidator of the business of a registered insurer, but a difference of opinion arose in the courts about the validty of such a direction when it is in conflict with certain provisions of the Companies Act in particular. The express purpose of the liquidation provisions in the Act is to make provision for a particular and elastic liquidation procedure in the case of insurers on the basis of the particular problems that are experienced and in regard to which the liquidation provisions of the Companies Act are difficult to apply in practice. It is therefore deemed desirable to amend the Act in such a way that directions issued by the court to a liquidator of an insurer will be valid notwithstanding the provisions of any Act other than the Insurance Act.</p>

<p>A further problem that occurred in regard to the liquidation of insurers, in the form of conflicting court opinions on the question as to when the insurance cover provided under a policy by an insurer who has been placed in liquidation, terminates, has given rise to a further addition to the liquidation provisions of the Act. The proposed addition will have the effect that after the date of final liquidation, no further obligations can arise for the insurer in liquidation.</p>

<p>A minor of at least 18 years of age already has the contractual capacity, in terms of the Act, to take out a life policy on his own life and to pay the premiums for it. This capacity will be expanded so that he may undertake to maintain the policy for a certain period of time from his own earnings. This is considered to be a logical expansion of the capacity which a minor already has.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the maximum amount to which certain life policies and the yields thereof are protected against the creditors of a person or his estate, is being increased from the present R3,000 to R10,000, but at the same time provision is being made for benefits which are already protected under the Friendly Societies Act to be taken into account in the application of the new maximum. The maximum amount to which certain life policies and the yield thereof is at present protected in favour of married women as against their creditors, is likewise being increased. The maximum to which life policies are in certain circumstances excluded from the estate of a man in favour of his wife, is also being increased from R3,000 to R10,000. The proposed increases are deemed desirable in view of the change in the purchasing power of money and the important part played by life policies in social security.</p>

<p>A new provision in the Act lays down that an incorrect representation made to an insurer may only affect the contractual position between the insurer and the policy-owner where such incorrect representation has probably had a material effect on the calculation of the risk.</p>

<p>It is intended by means of this provision to put an end to the allegation that insurers sometimes evade their liabilities on the ground of incorrect representations&#x2014;for example, that a man is 21 instead of 22&#x2014;which in fact have nothing to do with the determination of the insurance risk.</p>

<p>The power of the Registrar to classify insurance business of a certain kind as insurance business of another kind at the request of an insurer, is being extended so that in the case of a difference of opinion the Registrar may decide what kind of insurance business it is. At present there is no limit as regards the age of returns and statements which the public are entitled to inspect and make copies of. Some of these documents are only of temporary interest to the public. To eliminate the useless storage of such documents those that are older than about 10 years are now being excluded from this right.</p>

<p><span class="col_0889-0890" refersTo="page_0464"/>Finally it is proposed that the directions for the calculation of obligations under policies that are still current, be amended in so far as they relate to long-term policies. The amendments provide for the use of mortality tables of more recent date than those prescribed at present, as well as for an increase in the rates of interest applicable, to bring them more into line with existing interest yields. These amendments will make it possible to calculate long-term insurance obligations on a sounder basis than the present one. The application of the replacement mortality tables and of the higher rates of interest will lead to a long obligation figure under unterminated long-term policies. Advantages which may result from this are more favourable premium rates for future policy-holders, better bonus rates for existing policy-holders, and higher dividend rates for shareholders.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have now come to the end of a short exposition of the most important matters that are dealt with in this Bill. I want to say in advance that I shall move a few minor amendments of a textual nature in the Committee Stage which will not bring about any substantial alterations. These amendments will be handed to the other side of the House beforehand and will appear on the Order Paper before the Committee Stage is reached.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as the Minister said, this is a Bill which has the support of the insurance world. The insurance organization felt that the time was overdue for a tightening up of the Insurance Act. There have been one or two unfortunate incidents in recent years, which showed the necessity for tightening up the insurance legislation. On the whole, I think it is agreed on all sides of the House that South African insurance companies, in general, have a good record. In his address, the hon. the Minister referred to the funeral policies and indicated the amendments to the Act affecting the funeral policies. That is an admission on the part of the Deputy Minister that not only has the cost of living gone up but the cost of dying has also gone up and there is no doubt that this was the reason for the amendments in the Bill. I think that the tightening up of funeral policies is overdue and I think it is necessary that this form of insurance which, in many cases, plays on the emotions of people, should be tightened up so that there is adequate security for the policy-holders. Many of these policy-holders do not read the conditions of their insurance policies and find out, or rather the relatives find out, too late that the policies do not give them the cover which they anticipated.</p>

<p>The rest of the Bill covers the general question of the assessment or the calculation of liabilities. There too the Bill introduces a more conservative element and quite rightly so, because having regard to the fact that the value of money is eroding, it is only right that in the calculations of liability proper calculations should be made so that the liability of all life policies should be calculated on a conservative basis to ensure that the policyholder under the conditions of his contract will have the necessary funds available in the company. This is part of the conservative approach which one expects from an insurance company and this legislation puts it into effect.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will have adequate staff in his department to make sure that the administrative side of this Bill can be adequately supervised. So often one finds&#x2014;I do not say necessarily in this particular department&#x2014;that legislation is put on the Statute Book and when it comes to be implemented one finds that the necessary technical staff is not available to ensure that adequate control is maintained. This is a measure to improve the Insurance Act; to improve the security as far as the public is concerned; to ensure that the insurance industry as a whole, takes adequate steps to ensure that the contracts will be fulfilled. For those reasons we support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>
