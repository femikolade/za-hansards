<speech by="#van_breda">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister indicated to us here last night what a multitude of facets this Department of Planning has, so much so that every representative can probably choose a particular section of that Department which he regards as the most important to his constituency. In the light of this, the function of the Department which has to do with the determination of separate residential areas for the race groups and through that the orderly arrangement of our coexistence is probably the most important to me personally at this stage. The United Party now accepts this principle, and we therefore probably do not have to argue about it any further. But if they want to apply themselves to the practical implementation of this policy, then we may expect constructive criticism in this field from the side of the Opposition as well, instead of mere attempts to score political points. It is precisely in this spirit that I want to pay particular attention to-day to the situation in respect of the proclamation of group areas and industrial areas. In this process of the proclamation of areas the investigation committee of the Group Areas Board naturally fulfils an extremely important function, and it is precisely about this that I should like to exchange a few ideas. I want to ask to-day that the investigation committee should give urgent attention to the determination of proper and appropriate buffer areas for the effective physical separation of the race groups.</p>

<p>Sir, at this stage of the investigation this question of buffer areas may probably not appear so topical, but there are various factors which arise in this process of the development of the group area which can make the situation untenable in future, so untenable that the whole object of racial separation may be frustrated by them. Sir, I am not theorizing now as far as this aspect is concerned, because we have real problems in this connection, and I also have real problems in this field in my constituency in particular. But, Sir, you will allow me to add at once that I have only the greatest admiration for the exceptional understanding with which the hon. the Deputy Minister and his Secretary of Planning, Mr. Van Niekerk, are handling and trying to solve this vexed question. By way of local investigations and many discussions they have already spent days on only one particular case in my constituency, i.e. that of Tiervlei. But I venture to suggest that the hon. the Deputy Minister will not be able to carry on in this way; he will burn himself out completely if he has to deal in such an intensive way with every problem of this nature that comes his way. In other words, we shall have to prevent similar situations from arising in future, or see to it that they arise as little as possible. Far greater attention should be paid by the investigation committee to the factors which can influence the future development of a group area. I am not saying this in any spirit of reproach towards our investigation committee; the investigation committee is probably doing it already, but then we should like <span class="col_6951-6952" refersTo="page_0625"/>to have the hon. the Minister’s assurance on that point. Sir, the determination of available and future public transport is of vital importance. the availability of trade facilities, the situation of the industrial areas and other labour matters are only a few additional factors which determine the direction of movement of the various race groups.</p>

<p>This is precisely where the determination of proper buffer areas is of vital importance to us, It is no use having proper physical separation between the residential areas when the non-white population nevertheless have to move through the white residential areas in enormous numbers to their public means of transport on their way to their daily places of employment. In this way friction is intensified rather than eliminated. I want to say today that we must be prepared to go to any amount of trouble and expense and to apply all our ingenuity to try to put matters right where this situation has already arisen. But more than that, in future we shall have to investigate intensively and scientifically all these contributory factors, of which I have mentioned only a few in the course of my speech, even if it should delay the proclamation of specific group areas for a while. These scientific investigations will become more and more essential to us, particularly here in the Cape Peninsula, as the population densities in the various areas increase. That is why it may also be necessary for us to take a second look at old proclaimed areas in order to see whether the buffer areas which we created there in our wisdom in the past, are still serving their purpose and whether it is not necessary to streamline matters there as well. In this tremendous task resting on the Minister and his Deputy, and in particular on the Department, i.e. to effect this orderly arrangement in respect of residential areas, we want to wish them every success and we hope that we, on our part, shall be able to show appreciation and to offer our co-operation at all times.</p>

<p>I just rise to reply to one or two matters which are still outstanding. The first is in regard to Indian farms, which was raised by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). I may inform the hon. member that the matter is being investigated by a research fellowship under the guidance of a steering committee for incorporation as part of the guide plan which is being drawn up by the Pietermaritzburg-Durban Regional Planning Committee. A report from the research fellowship is anticipated by the end of this year. The regional plan will indicate such areas as are suitable for occupation by Indian agriculturists.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply, but do we accept then that the principle is established that they shall be allocated farming land?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to give a decision on that now, because I do not want to anticipate this report. We will have to judge the report when it is before us. The fact of the matter is that we have Indians to-day who are dependent on farming for a livelihood and this Government has never been unsympathetic towards the specific form of livelihood of any population group.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then the hon. member also inquired about the allocation of R250,000 for research. I may inform the hon. member that it was allocated to the following institutions: The Universities of the Orange Free State, Cape Town, Natal, Potchefstroom, Rhodes, Stellenbosch. Witwatersrand, the Rand Afrikaans University and the University of Port Elizabeth, the University Colleges of Fort Hare, Western Cape and Durban, and also the Research Institute of the Southern Universities, the Namib Desert Research Station, the Institute for Medical Research and the South African Museums. It was also used for 19 South African students doing research overseas.</p>

<p>*Then one last matter. I see according to a report in <i>Die Burger</i> of this morning that the inference may possibly be drawn that the Divisional Council of Cape Town is loath to undertake housing projects. I should like to make it very clear that I did not say that by implication or intend it in that way, because in contrast with the Cape Town City Council we are receiving full co-operation from the Divisional Council, and I want to thank them for that and express my appreciation for it.</p>

<p>The hon. member who spoke just before the hon. the Minister started off by saying that we accept separate residential areas, and I want to start off by saying that we are pleased to hear that at last hon. members opposite are in agreement that we accept separate residential areas. [Laughter.] It is all right for hon. members to laugh, but at least we on this side of the House know which party we are in. On that side of the House they do not know whether they are in the &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; Nationalist Party or in the &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; Nationalist Party. We have never had any doubt as to where we stood in this regard, but what we do suggest is that in many cases the removals that do take place could take place with a great deal less hurt to the individuals concerned and with a great deal more investigation before they are undertaken.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister one or two questions before dealing with the main point I wish to raise. That is that according to the report of the Department of Planning on page three there is an amount set aside for the investigation of housing, design and construction. I should like to ask the Minister in what way this duplicates the work of the Department of Community Development, which also undertakes similar investigations in <span class="col_6953-6954" refersTo="page_0626"/>regard to housing, so much so that we have had the experience of the previous Minister of Community Development taking extensive trips overseas to study this particular aspect. I would would like to hear from the Minister whether his Department is duplicating the work of the Department of Community Development.</p>

<p>I would particularly like to deal with the Grey Street complex in Durban, but before doing so I would like to ask the Minister whether he does not think it is about time that new group areas declarations should at least be halted until such time as those which are already in the process of being declared have been cleared up. I say this because what is happening is that the Government continually goes on declaring new group areas, but in the meantime it is merely adding to the existing chaos. Surely the first priority is to see that those areas already declared are properly developed and that the necessary housing is made available, with schools, hospitals, etc., before we add to the chaos by declaring further areas. I would also like to ask the Minister, because this falls under the Department of Planning more than under the Department of Community Development, what special qualifications do the members of the Group Areas Board have for the job that they are doing.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite clear. They must be Nationalists, but they need know nothing about the particular group which they are proposing to move, or the particular area in which they are carrying out investigations. [Interjections.] Some of the injustices that have been committed by the Group Areas Board would not have been committed if the members of that Board were better qualified to carry out the functions allocated to them. Also, when the Group Areas Board is investigating a particular race group, if a member of that race group were at least co-opted to that board, they would not make so many mistakes. Here we had an investigation carried out just recently in the Grey Street area of Durban. Will any member of this House tolerate the uncertainty which has occurred in this particular area? As far back as 1963 the then Minister of Indian Affairs said that Grey Street would remain Indian, and he repeated this in 1964. Yet in 1969 the Government comes along with a Group Areas Board investigation. While this sort of thing takes place, is it any wonder that people are entitled to query the fact that too often the various race groups are moved from areas and the element of greed is the underlying motive? Because this is the suspicion with which one is left if one is told as far back as six or seven years ago that the area would remain as it is and then suddenly they come along with a new investigation. What permanency is there in South Africa for a person living in any group area if at any time the Government can come along and have an investigation into that area? That might even happen to the hon. member for Klip River. His area might one day be investigated by the Government to decide whether it should remain White.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>But you know we do not lightly do that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, you do not do it while members of the board are Nationalists. They will not do that to other Nationalists, but what I am saying to the hon. the Minister is that at least when a particular race group is being investigated, a member of that race group should be co-opted to the board, because then some of these mistakes which occur would cease. We had the instance in Durban where an Indian area was declared and there was no provision made for a cemetery. These Indians had to carry the coffins on their shoulders to the cemetery, the nearest cemetery being 15 miles away. If a member of that particular race group had been on that board investigating that particular area, this would not have happened.</p>

<p>But talking about Grey Street, why investigate Grey Street at all? The Indians in Grey Street have been there for 100 years. It is 95 per cent Indian-owned and 97 per cent Indian-occupied. The vested interests are worth over R200 million, and only economic disaster could result if this area is declared anything but Indian. Anybody living in Natal, even as far away from Durban as the hon. member for Klip River, would appreciate that Grey Street is typically Indian, that it is entirely Indian and should remain so. Why investigate Grey Street at all? Has the Government not got enough to do; has it not sufficient problems? Has it supplied sufficient houses? It has moved people all over South Africa hither and yon, but it still has not supplied the housing. The hon. the Minister of Community Development knows that in my own constituency eight years ago they decided to move the Coloureds, but they still do not have sufficient houses for those Coloureds and they are still living in that constituency. In other words, they are still living where they are and they do not know whether they are coming or going. So I say to the (Minister in the name of these people who are being treated in such a manner, that he should at least clean up those areas which have already been declared before he goes ahead and declares other areas. Talking about Grey Street again, I notice that the <span class="col_6955-6956" refersTo="page_0627"/>Chairman of the Board criticized the Press publicity that was attached to the Grey Street investigation, but I want to know why he should do this. Surely Press publicity is essential. The Act itself lays down that the investigation has to be advertised in the Press, and surely that is an invitation to the public at large, and to the Press in particular, to put forward their views. How can the Chairman of the Board then criticize the Press and say that they are pre-judging the issue? I suggest that it is a good thing that the Press does so, because it does highlight the sort of thing the Government is doing through a board such as this, which I repeat is highly unqualified for the tasks entrusted to it. It is all right for it to investigate an area and call for evidence, but why does it not have a member of that particular race group co-opted to help in the investigation?</p>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that this morning the hon. member for Port Natal has once more given a fine demonstration of how the United Party blows hot and cold on various occasions. Must we now accept that in principle the United Party supports the question of separate residential areas for the various race groups? If this is so, why has the United Party in the past, when it came to the question of the establishment of group areas, opposed this tooth and nail? In particular I want to refer to the conditions which we had in Johannesburg in former years. There is the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) sitting next to the hon. member for Port Natal. The hon. member is one of the most fiery supporters of the <i>status quo</i> being maintained in Johannesburg as it has been throughout the years, i.e. that Whites and Blacks should live side by side in that area. In spite of this the hon. member for Port Natal said that we had once more accepted the United Party’s policy, i.e. that different residential areas should be established for those people. It is the biggest lot of nonsense I have ever heard, and I think the hon. member made his claims here for the sake of the political effect this kind of speech would have on Natal.</p>

<p>On behalf of a constituency with a strong industrial element, i.e. the Benoni constituency, I want to thank the hon. the Minister and the Department most sincerely here this morning for the unbiased and just implementation of the Physical Planning Act. I think that such actions are appreciated throughout the country, and in particular in my constituency. Under the guidance of the National Management Foundation a symposium was held in my constituency last year to which virtually all the industrialists in that area were invited, and the Secretary for this Department gave a very interesting and illuminating lecture about the actual physical implementation of this Act. I can say that in my constituency I have really had no difficulty in connection with this Act. I think that it is this kind of sympathetic action on the part of the Department and the Minister, in cases brought to their attention, which makes it easier for us, as representatives, to keep our people satisfied. I think that all these spectres which the United Party saw in connection with the implementation of this Act, i.e. that it would bring large scale unrest to industry and that there would be opposition as a result of these actions, have been cleared away, and industry in general is very satisfied about this matter.</p>

<p>In addition I want to say I have a very difficult constituency inasmuch as I am faced there with the housing of all Indians on the East Rand. There will eventually be about 6,000 Indian families in my constituency. The biggest problem is to supply those people with work. The policy is that Indians should begin to diversify and not only move in one direction, i.e. that of business. I think that the figures which were furnished here this morning by the hon. the Minister, in reply to a question from the hon. member for Houghton, were illuminating. They indicate to us that we should also diversify these people into labour and industrial channels. Since, under the Physical Planning Act, requests are made for more Bantu labour to be made available, my plan is that the hon. the Minister should instruct the Department to bring it forcibly to the attention of industrialists that, instead of getting Bantu labourers, they should make use of the available Indian labour, especially in my area and in other areas which are easily accessible to Indian labour forces living in Benoni. At the beginning of this year, when I was in Natal, we were told in evidence that there was a tendency among industrialists to make greater use of Indian labour in their industries. I think that here we have a chance to help those people.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the hon. the Minister and the Department for the implementation of a portion of the report of the P.W.V. Committee which deals with open spaces, i.e. the approval which the hon. the Minister gave for a portion of the Suikerbosrand area to be purchased and developed now as an open space for the population of the P.W.V. area. This is a long-felt need and we are grateful that this is now being done and that the local authorities of the Witwatersrand, the Vereeniging complex and Pretoria, who want to contribute to its development, can now create facilities there for the population of these areas. My plea is also that other portions of this report which deal with open spaces should receive attention in order to see if we cannot <span class="col_6957-6958" refersTo="page_0628"/>implement the additional recommendation of that report. Knowing the Witwatersrand, Vereeniging and Pretoria areas, I am afraid that the hour-glass is running out as far as the availability of open spaces in those areas is concerned. We see here the tremendous incentive displayed by land developers to-day to obtain certain areas, and at times very high prices are paid for land which is still available. I think that we shall have to put our heads together in order to acquire more open spaces in those areas for ourselves, open spaces which can be developed into recreation areas for these population groups. In connection with the further study being made in respect of this P.W.V. planning, I regret to say that, as a result of a shortage of manpower in the Department, no further progress has been made in connection with that investigation. It is an essential investigation. When one looks at the development which is in progress in my own area, i.e. Benoni, Springs, Boksburg, the Kempton Park complex and the whole of Alberton, one is really concerned at the fact that we have not yet designed a master plan according to which we can work on the development of those areas. However, I do not want to blame anyone in particular. I know what is going on there and that the problem is a shortage of manpower. As soon as the Department has trained a person to such an extent that he begins to be useful, he is snapped up by the private sector. And we can do nothing about that, because that is what happens in a growing and young, developing country, particularly where one has a country which develops so easily under a good Government such as we have to-day. I just want to put forward one idea, i.e. that in these matters we should also follow the pattern which is being followed throughout the world: Where one finds large complexes of this nature and one wants to initiate regional planning, where one wants to determine the utilization of space for those areas, one must also call upon the assistance of the private sector, which can do it as it is done abroad. I am aware of the fact that in this country we have excellent urban and regional planners whom we can use very profitably and who can work out projects of this nature for us at a fee. Then the Department’s task need only be to co-ordinate this work. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Benoni who has just sat down raised a point here which I would like the hon. the Minister to clear up.

<p>What does the hon. member think people who work in factories are other than labourers? Steps are being taken by the Department to investigate the Grey Street area in Durban, the greatest concentration of Indian wealth in the whole of South Africa. In this area there is a tremendous concentration of wealth and business, sports and educational activities. I want to know what the hon. the Minister is going to do with those people and what he has in mind and what is behind the investigation which is going on in the Grey Street area in Durban to-day. If the intention is to declare this area for Whites, what is going to happen to that tremendous concentration of wealth of the Indian community which is to-day at Grey Street? Where is it to go and where can it be reproduced? Is the kind of thought that is in the hon. member for Benoni’s mind also in the mind of the hon. the Minister? Only 22 per cent of the whole Indian population, according to the figures of the hon. the Minister, is engaged in commerce to-day, wholesale and retail, and here we have the thought being expressed by the hon. member that these people must now be used to replace Bantu labour in various areas in the Transvaal.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member can search his own conscience, because I heard very distinctly what he said. I want to raise a matter with the hon. the Minister which affects my constituency where I believe that not perhaps this hon. Minister’s Department, but the department responsible for the planning of group areas around Pietermaritzburg has made an unadulterated hash, in relation to the planning of the Coloured areas and the Indian areas, namely in the Mountain Rise&#x2014;Woodlands&#x2014;Northlands complex, between Pietermaritzburg and Greytown. I understood the hon. the Minister to say last night, and I want to make sure that I have it right, that it is the duty and the responsibility of his Department to determine residential areas. Am I correct in saying that it is the duty of the hon. the Minister’s Department to determine residential area in relation to group areas as, for instance, near Pietermaritzburg? The hon. members for Pietermaritzburg and myself were with the hon. the Minister when he investigated the area with the City Engineer and members of the Maritzburg Corporation. We undertook an on the spot investigation in connection with the siting of a new Coloured area for Pietermaritzburg. The point which I want to make is that an earlier determination placed the Coloured community in Woodlands, which is to-day known and recognized as being too small for the Coloured community of Pietermaritzburg. The City Council is now engaging on the last housing scheme that it can undertake, and the City Engineer estimates that the council will need <span class="col_6959-6960" refersTo="page_0629"/>within the next 20 years a further 2,000 acres of ground and 7.000 to 8,000 houses with all the sports facilities that are going to be necessary adequately to house the Coloured community in Pietermaritzburg. The Department of Community Development which undertook the planning before this hon. Minister’s Department took over, had at their disposal the whole of the Mountain Rise area planning for Indians with the hinterland that goes 50 miles in the direction of Greytown. But the department has bottled them up in an area which is now too small for the Coloured community and they will have to duplicate every single facility provided by the City Council for the Coloured community in another place, separated by a belt of Indian development from the existing Coloured community. I believe there was shortsightedness and that the then department did not realize that there was going to be concentrated in Pietermaritzburg practically the whole of the Coloured population of the Natal Midlands. There has been a slip-up somewhere. It is having the effect that the department has two choices now. The one is to expand the Woodlands area, and the hon. the Minister will remember the terrain we saw there and the difficulties of developing that area, or else they will have to create a totally new area. Pressure is now being placed on my constituents by virtue of the fact that the Minister will now be introducing a new element into that area, i.e. a Coloured element. I believe the Minister has a duty to those people. I want to say that we in Natal, particularly in Pietermaritzburg, are proud of the contribution which is being made by the Coloured people; they are sound and responsible people. However, it is inevitable that where you introduce a new group, especially a non-white group, into an area it affects property values.</p>

In terms of a letter I have here, I believe the Minister is going to advertise these proposals. As I understand it, he is going to advertise the extension to the Woodlands area and also in the Bishopstowe area. Could the Minister please confirm this? I can tell the hon. the Minister that he is going to get a considerable volume of complaints from both areas. The extension of the Woodlands area can only go in the direction of the Chase and Town Bush Valley areas where there is development to-day for settlement by high class white residents. On the other hand, if you go on the other side of the Bishopstowe area, the hon. the Minister, by proclaiming that as a Coloured area, is going to cut off the last white access for the people of Greytown, New Hanover and Wartburg to Pietermaritzburg.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has now landed himself in the position where he has to sort things out. To be fair to the people involved, he should, when he proclaims an area, take the valuations of the properties which are affected by his proclamation, because anybody affected by this proclamation is obviously not going to be bought out immediately; it is a development which is going to take place over a considerable number of years. However, the people who are moved in terms of the proclamation at a later date will have to re-establish themselves at the prices ruling on the day they have to move. They will then be faced with the proposition that the value of the properties at which they are proclaimed to-day will then have declined. The least the hon. the Minister can do on proclamation is to establish present day market values of the properties affected by his proclamation, in order to be fair to those who are going to be affected some time or other, sooner or later. I should like to know from the Minister whether it is possible to proclaim the area, to take control thereof and to take transfer thereof when it is proclaimed. I realize, of course, that this is a considerable area and that a considerable amount of money will be involved.</p>

<p>The Minister of Planning will proclaim the area and it is his responsibility to make sure that the department whose job it will be to carry out the proclamation acts fairly towards those affected, because this is something of the greatest importance to the people involved when they have to re-establish themselves later on at a price obtaining then instead of the price they can get to-day.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister. Last night the hon. the Minister said that there had been consultation between him and the Administrators in connection with planning of industrial areas. This is something which affects me particularly. In my area the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development is building a township for 20,000 Bantu, i.e. at Montrose, as part of the Swartkops Bantu location, or Bantu reserve or homeland&#x2014; whatever you like to call it. The problem now is, who is going to decide where the industrial area is going to be where these people are to be employed? They will be 17 miles from Pietermaritzburg, the growth point established in our area. In our area there is only one factory but this can provide employment only for about 2,000 to 3,000 people. <span class="col_6961-6962" refersTo="page_0630"/>There is, furthermore, a growing Indian population which at the moment is estimated to be 2,500 in the immediate vicinity of that factory.

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>I am rising to reply to a few matters. There is, firstly, the matter raised by the hon. member for Tygervallei. Unfortunately he cannot be here to-day because he had to attend a Republic Day celebration. In regard to the matter he raised I want to state that the Group Areas Act makes provision for the establishment of border strips only in cases where there are no physical or other obstacles which can serve the same purpose as a border strip. Border strips are always determined within the limits of practical implementation, as well as in consideration of the financial implications. In addition these strips are being planned as efficiently as possible in order to eliminate any possible point of friction between the race groups. In built-up areas it is sometimes difficult to establish such a border strip. In that case we are forced to make use of backyards in order to effect back-to-back separation. If it is possible to incorporate industrial strips into town planning, these are also used. In sparsely developed areas border strips are proclaimed with a view to utilizing them for some purpose or other apart from residential purposes, so that the boundary does not have to exist as an open space.</p>

<p>I now come to what the hon. member for Port Natal said in regard to the Grey Street area in Durban.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Members of the Indian group have expressed themselves through the Press in a way which was considered to be contemptuous of the Group Areas Board. They also made expressions which can be considered to be defamatory. It was even stated in the Press that members of the Group Areas Board sat with preconceived ideas and that the Government had already decided to make Grey Street white. All parties took part in the inquiry and pleaded for certainty about the Grey Street area. However, this area is still under consideration. The planning of this area is part of the overall planning of Durban. In this connection, therefore, the hon. member for Mooi River has also prejudged this issue because until such time as the report of the investigating committee has been considered by the full Group Areas Board and their recommendations submitted to the Minister of Planning, I cannot say what the status of the Grey Street area will be.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there was a formal inquiry in regard to the Grey Street area. We have not yet received the report of that investigation. Yet the hon. member acts as if a decision has already been taken in regard to the matter.</p>

<p>I now come to the matter raised by the hon. members for Benoni and Smithfield. This concerns the application of the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Act of 1967. The standpoint adopted by the Minister was that all applications in terms of this Act will be dealt with according to merit. This Act has been in operation for 18 months now, and I now want to testify here to the major assistance and support we have received from our industrialists in South Africa. We received a large measure of co-operation from them, in virtually all the metropolitan areas. But I think they are entitled to know what criteria we use in the application of this Act. Applications are either for new factories, or for the removal of existing factories, or for the consolidation of activities under one roof, or for more Bantu. With the consideration of all these applications the first consideration is always whether the industry concerned is an industry which can be removed to a border area or not. That is always the first consideration. If we are of the opinion that we are dealing with an industry which can be removed to the border areas, we do not refuse the application immediately but make temporary assistance available, for two years, say, and refer it in the meantime to the Permanent Committee for Industrial Location in Group Areas. That Committee then supplies the industrialist concerned with all the information and sees whether it cannot accommodate him elsewhere. In the consideration of such applications there are three aspects which are regarded as being of decisive importance. The first is that the number of Bantu in the urban complexes must be reduced. That is the first consideration throughout. The second consideration is that capital intensive industries must remain in the metropolitan areas for the other race groups. The third consideration is that the fixed rate of growth must be maintained. In this connection the following factors are taken into consideration. Firstly, what is the nature of the activities being carried out? If we are dealing with a strategic industry, an ammunition factory, for example, then it is obvious that such an industry should not be removed to a border area. Secondly, it is asked whether the industry concerned is localized, for example as a result of the minerals it requires or as a result of the market for its manufactured products. A factory is, for example, localized if it makes use of by-products and waste products of other factories in the vicinity. In this category there are the factories which are now being established and which make use of the by-products and the waste products of the chemical industry at Sasolburg. We must also take the market area into account. Very often the transportation costs of manufactured articles are such that those articles cannot be manufactured in a border area because the article may then become too expensive. A further <span class="col_6963-6964" refersTo="page_0631"/>consideration is whether the articles are tailor-made, i.e. whether they are being manufactured for a specific purpose. Is there continuous consultation with the person who is going to use the article or not? If so, we regard that industry as localized. Another factor is whether a specific industry is a service industry&#x2014;for example, a bakery, a dry-cleaning plant, petrol stations, garages, plumbers, printing works, building contractors, cartage contractors, laundries, carpenters, funeral undertakers, blacksmiths, and others. These are all service industries which, in our opinion, cannot be removed. Another factor which is being taken into consideration, is the availability of facilities, such as land, factory buildings, etc. In addition the capital investment for specific factories is always taken into account. Of course we do not regard the amount of capital as a decisive consideration. Nor does the Permanent Committee regard it as a decisive consideration. But it is nevertheless being taken into account in the granting of such a factory’s application or not. The number of employees of each race group who will be employed, is another consideration. The hon. member for Benoni raised the position of the Indians. It is true that the Indians, for example in Benoni, will receive preference in regard to the provision of work in factories above Bantu.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister, when he was appointed to the office of Minister of Planning, was an enthusiast for his job. He is now probably concerned about the amount of criticism he is getting. This criticism is largely due to frustration on the part of people concerned with the various areas of South Africa, because they cannot get finality. I am not querying the Minister’s statement that planning is a difficult task. There are a number of problems. We have this report of the Minister referring to the Durban-Pietermaritzburg and Natal South Coast areas. The paragraph referring to this reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The surveys of these areas, which are carried out in conjunction with the Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission, are progressing according to expectations but, as previously indicated, they will take a long time to complete.</block>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Paragraph 55 of the Department’s report. What we should like to know is what the word &#x201C;long&#x201D; means. I have endeavoured for 21 years to get finality in regard to the area which I represent. Shortly after I was elected as a Member of Parliament, because of the concern about Bantu housing, I asked the then Minister of Bantu Affairs to visit my constituency. I also had the late Dr. Jansen, the late Dr. Verwoerd, Minister de Wet Nel, the present Minister of Bantu Administration, the Deputy Minister Koornhof as well as the Bantu Affairs Commission visit my constituency. Still there is no finality. With regard to the Pinetown-New Germany complex there is no finality as far as housing is concerned either. The police are concerned, because there is no finality as far as the Clairmont area is concerned. The Government has already made one decision but afterwards changed its mind. It provided for the establishment of a Bantu housing scheme. After it was established and after the Minister attended a function there and after the Bantu were told that that was a suitable place, the Government changed its mind and decided that the area should be used for Indian housing. It is a frustration for the people in the area. There are over 150 factories at Pinetown. Pinetown does not count as a border area, although the Minister has said that he virtually regards the town as a border area. Pinetown area has Bantu reserves on its boundaries. The Minister visited the area. He was enthusiastic. He gave us a courteous reception and indicated that he was co-operative. However, the point is that despite all the Minister’s assurances&#x2014;I accept that he did not give a time schedule&#x2014; the position is no different to-day as far as finality is concerned than it was 20 years ago. It is for that reason that I ask what the Minister regards as &#x201C;long&#x201D;. There was over R10 million invested in one factory alone in the New Germany area. They have Indian staff and Bantu staff. The Minister knows the factory concerned. In fact, he visited it. Now they have to plan for the future. They have to plan as far as the Indian staff is concerned and as far as the Bantu staff is concerned. The Minister knows that any factory to be efficiently run must have a stable labour force within the area. I know the hon. member for Klip River has visited the area. He is doing the best he can. But the point is how long do we have to wait? I would recommend to the hon. the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am not suggesting it will take another 20 years. I am trying to be objective in this matter, because it is a serious matter. I have in my file to-day a letter from a financial organization in Central Europe who wants to invest 10 million dollars in this country. Only a fortnight ago they wanted to invest 10 million dollars in South Africa. They wanted to know where to go in <span class="col_6965-6966" refersTo="page_0632"/>South Africa; they wanted to use South African raw materials. When I advise them I have to tell them that they have to get into touch with the Department of Planning or with the Department of Economic Affairs, who in turn will recommend that they see the I.D.C., the Department of Indian Affairs, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, the Department of Labour, the Bantu Affairs Commissioners as far as permits for Bantu labour are concerned, and the Department of Community Development for housing. How can you write to a firm in Central Europe and give all that detail? All you can do is to inform them as to the markets and where the raw materials can be found, and as far as labour is concerned, indicate the type of labour available. Then you have to start to make a survey. Because of our peculiar race problems, it takes far longer in South Africa to make a survey to decide where a factory should be situated than it does in any other country. I know that for a fact, because last year I visited Australia and I made a special point of discussing the matter with the Minister of Industrial Development in Western Australia. It is far quicker to get an industry established in Western Australia than in South Africa because of the time factor. I would commend to the Minister the action of Mr. Truman when he became President of the United States of America. He had a little note on his table which read, &#x201C;the buck stops here&#x201D;. When the hon. the Minister of Planning was appointed I got the impression that it was to avoid the passing of the buck. I am not suggesting that it is done deliberately, but everybody suggests that another department should be consulted. I understood that the Minister’s function was to co-ordinate all the efforts of all the other departments so that the interests of South Africa, of the race complex in South Africa, the financial interests, the markets and all factors concerned should be co-ordinated before a final decision is made. I appreciate that it takes time, but the point is as regards an area I know very well, there is no final decision. The hon. the Minister knows what the position is. When are we going to get finality in regard to the Pinetown-New Germany complex? When are we going to get finality so that people can plan because in the meantime, people are making money in cases where partial decisions have been given. For example in regard to the centre of Pinetown, an indication was given that that was a white area, but the whole area has not been planned. Certain Indians knew that they would have to get out of Pinetown, but they have not made the money in most cases. I have in mind one particular property in Pinetown which was valued at R5,000 or R6.000 and which was sold by the Indian for R.22,000 a couple of years ago. That place has not changed hands for R22,000; it changed hands at well over R100,000 in merely two years. The Indian has not made the money; the white property speculators made the money. I can name other cases in the Pinetown area. These people have not acted illegally. It was legitimate business, but the point is that the Indians have been told that there is no future for them there and they have sold as a result.</p>

<p>There are still many Indians in the area who still do not know their future. The poorer type of Indian does not know his future. He does not know what his future is as far as housing is concerned, and he cannot borrow money from a bank or a building society, because the area has not been finalized. Therefore he is frustrated and he translates his frustration into general dissatisfaction. Some of the more responsible ones have come to us and said they would like finality so that they can know where they can house their wives and children so that they can carry on working in the Pinetown area. The hon. the Minister met some of the fine type of Indians when he came to my area. He gave them a courteous hearing and assured them that they have nothing to fear. The point is at this stage, two years after the hon. the Minister was there, they still do not know what their future is. They still do not know whether they have a future in the factory. If they are to move a long way away, the transport costs will &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am leaving the hon. member’s remarks in the competent hands of the hon. the Minister. I am standing up more specifically to raise two matters here. Mr. Chairman, on a previous occasion in this House this year I pleaded for the more extensively organized and more purposeful interest in our country’s marine resources. I specifically pointed out that since our country was almost surrounded by a more than 2,000-mile long coastline, we should regard it as within our financial capabilities to display a new approach to our oceans. Since then I have noticed from Press reports that by 1970 a country such as the United States is going to make more funds available for oceanographic research <span class="col_6967-6968" refersTo="page_0633"/>than, for example, for space research and, Sir, that is quite a mouthful, judging by present trends! Facts already indicate that at present this country spends about a thousand million rands a year on the mining of minerals in the ocean. Similar examples also reveal themselves in countries such as Japan, Australia and others. There is every indication that, in spite of the dramatic attempts at space reconnaissance, in the ensuing three years the world is going to turn its eyes with quickening interest to the oceans. I think that in this situation South Africa cannot be allowed to lag behind. I notice, for example, that on occasion a permanent committee was appointed by the United Nations to investigate additional research in respect of the deep-sea bed. As far as I know South Africa is not represented on this committee. Neither do I know what the procedure is for obtaining representation on a similar committee, but I want to plead to the hon. the Minister for an effort to be made under these circumstances to ensure that South Africa will, in fact, have a seat on this committee, and if this is not possible I want to plead for the hon. the Minister to see whether it is not possible for South Africa to have at least a representative as an observer on this committee. Lastly, as far as our own oceanographic activities are concerned, I want to plead for this department to do everything in its power to bring about greater and more effective co-ordination. I really feel that the Department of Planning has an urgent and an actual function to fulfil here, as I have already indicated on a previous occasion. I want to plead to the hon. the Minister for this matter to receive urgent attention.</p>

<p>The second matter to which I want to refer is that of regional planning. I want to make a plea here for more calculated and imaginative attention, on the part of the Department of Planning, to our voluntary regional development associations. Within our larger and more general planning machinery I feel that greater status should be given to our regional development associations, and I shall say why this is so. It is remarkable with what degree of ignorance subjects such as decentralization are lightly discussed at congresses and meetings. People simply assume that you can take an industry from here and put it down there. We hear pleas about the depopulation of the country districts, without a penetrating look at the background of a similar situation, and then we have moving pleas about growth points which the state must simply create here and there. Sir, if we analyze these pleas more closely, we frequently&#x2014;I do not say always, but frequently&#x2014;come to the conclusion that modern man in his own environment has lost his own creative abilities, or that these abilities have become blunted. I think that we would all agree that it is basically true that where man’s creative powers are lacking in a particular environment, poverty prevails, or, to put it another way, we must concentrate to an increasing extent upon teaching the human being within the regional context to create his own future and not merely to struggle ahead with a pressure group mentality. Sir, a region may be richly endowed with natural resources which embody great promise for the future, but the human spark which is necessary for the extension and utilization of these latent resources may be temporarily or even, in many cases, permanently absent. I could indicate several such regions to you. On occasion a well-known planner expressed it as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The mere presence of gold on the Highveld as a mineral was of no value as such to the Bushmen who lived on the Highveld 150 years ago.</block>

<p>This is an extreme example, Sir, but it actually conveys what I am saying. The time has come for us, within the regional context, to kindle anew the human spark, the disposition of man to develop within the regional context, his enterprise. In other words, if I may take a short cut, we must begin to lay more emphasis on the creative powers of man himself in his particular environment. This is perhaps a deeply-rooted function, but it is a function which the Department of Planning cannot escape from in our greater structure to-day. Sir, I know of no better place within our planning structure to-day where we can cultivate this basic disposition than specifically in our regional development associations, and therefore my plea is now that the Department should look for a few choice men, if I may put it like that, to give more specific attention and emphasis to this human aspect within the regional context. If, within our regional development associations, we can succeed in stimulating and initiating this disposition, we shall be doing South Africa a great service; from a planning point of view we shall actually be making a very great investment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg made a plea for more research into the efficient utilization of our marine resources and our ocean beds. I agree with him wholeheartedly. He made a further plea for our participation in international conferences about the ocean and the ocean bed. I agree with him once more. These are all matters which I have already raised under the Vote of the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>Sir, I did not intend to take part in this debate until the hon. member for Tyger Valley spoke. In the first place he spoke of buffer strips in group areas. He pleaded for proper physical separation between group areas and asked the Minister to give his full attention to that. He referred to transportation difficulties, when members of one race, for example, travel through the group area of another race. I know that he is up against similar difficulties in his constituency and in the bordering division of Maitland. He made a plea for a thorough local investigation prior to the proclamation <span class="col_6969-6970" refersTo="page_0634"/>of group areas. I agree with him. His further plea was for us to look anew at the existing proclaimed areas. The hon. member said that some of them were perhaps wrong and should be changed. Throughout the years we have said that a thorough investigation should be instituted before group areas are proclaimed, and what he said is actually a justification for the attitude which this side of the House has adopted through the years.</p>

<p>But I want to refer to-day to an additional difficulty which is, in my opinion, the lack of co-ordination at a high level. There is already a lack of co-ordination on the level of local authorities, and yesterday the Minister said that he was negotiating with the provinces about difficulties on a provincial level. But I should like to refer to difficulties at a higher level, in other words, co-ordination between various Government Departments. In support of my argument I want to refer to the Slangkop housing scheme for Coloureds in the Southern Peninsula. The Coloureds of Simonstown are now being transferred to Slangkop. We held an inspection there recently; the hon. the Minister of Community Development was also present. There is no police station; no policemen have been appointed there; there is no post office; there is one public telephone; and the bus services were not planned beforehand.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on reading the Department’s report one gains an impression of the progress that the Department has made in the short space of two or three years. The report contains a number of interesting facts, but of greater significance to me are the conclusions one can draw from the facts reflected in this report. In the first place, I conclude from this that there is a particularly intimate interaction between research and planning. We note that a total amount of R10,719,000 was spent on actual scientific research and the question which arises is what the results of this research are. What is the result, converted into development, of this research? The question is also asked abroad and in this connection there is interesting research to determine the eventual correlation between the research which is done and its results. I am convinced that we shall find that, in the very short time in which this interesting matter has fallen under the Department of Planning, very good results have been furnished.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>To what report are you referring?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>The report of the Department of Planning. I want to say once again that I believe that for future planning it will be important to determine the correlation between the money spent on planning and the results obtained by way of development. Sir, a further conclusion to which I have come is that full recognition is given to this planning at our universities. It is very clear to me that our university students are hereby also consulted, as fellow-architects, in future development. I find this so important, Sir, that I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give attention to the matter of affording public recognition to our students for the research which they have done. We note that there is hardly a project which has been tackled here, and which this report mentions, in which university students were not involved. We are for ever looking for tasks for our university students in order to utilize their excess energies, Here is a wonderful opportunity and may we congratulate the Department on having, in fact, done so. I believe that this will be done on a much larger scale in future. I shall refer back to this at a later stage, but I want to make one more point in this connection, i.e. that public recognition by way of a medal could be made to each member of a research team. In fact, consideration could be given to particular merit awards where, by virtue of reports and research projects, other Departments proceed to undertake active development. We also note that the Department has, indeed, succeeded in co-ordinating, because just look at what a tremendous service it provides for other Departments in connection with research projects. We note that in Community Development, research was done in connection with the design of efficient, better and cheaper housing for all race groups, and even out country’s security, in all its facets, enjoys the attention of the Department. We are referring here, for example, to the South African Police and to Civil Defence. This speaks volumes for the successful co-ordination by this Department in respect of the needs of other Departments.</p>

<p>A third conclusion which I draw from this report is that we are rapidly approaching the stage where there will be a general development plan available for the Republic of South Africa. This is evident from the fact that tremendous progress has already been made with the development atlas. It is also evident from the fact that an investigation was undertaken in connection with the utilization and application of our lakes, rivers, etc. An investigation was also carried out in connection with recreation and tourism, viewed in the general national spectrum. An investigation was also carried out in connection with refractories, ferrous alloys, etc., and also in connection with the development potential of various regions. We are also glad to note that the plan for the development plan of the Free State Goldfields will soon be available. All this will eventually enable us to earmark each region for a particular purpose, and this will also <span class="col_6971-6972" refersTo="page_0635"/>stimulate the imagination of the development associations concerned with each region. I want to express the hope that such knowledge will enjoy wider publicity so that the local individuals concerned with that region can obtain the maximum benefit from it, and that it will not, for example, be of benefit to people who come from elsewhere and are perhaps well-provided with capital. The local individuals ought to be the first to avail themselves of the local potential of each region and to benefit by it.</p>

<p>This bring me, then, to the question of what the destiny of the Coloured population of Bloemfontein is. According to figures which I obtained from the Department of Coloured Affairs&#x2014;and this is a mere projection&#x2014;there are about 9,500 Coloureds in Bloemfontein. 500 of these are children in high school and 1,700 are in primary school. This is an increase, as far as high school attendance is concerned, of almost 40 per cent on last year. This indicates to me that Bloemfontein is undoubtedly destined to have a group area for Coloureds, as has in fact been declared there, and to become a growth point for Coloureds. In order to do justice to this aspect we shall have to give attention to providing Bloemfontein with the maximum possible development factors as far as the Coloureds are concerned. With a view to doing this, we shall have to give consideration to whether Bloemfontein will not be entitled to enjoy the same industrial benefits as those which Heilbron, Upington, Knysna and George are enjoying at present. Not only would this contribute to preventing the Coloured from sinking to the same level as the unskilled Bantu labourer, but it would enable him to remain in his own group. It would also benefit Bloemfontein in the sense that we could then draw industries which make use of Coloured labourers. I therefore want to ask the hon. the Minister to give consideration to affording Bloemfontein these benefits. It is a fact that our whole country is planning-conscious to-day. In fact this is surely the basis of every step in our lives, but seen in relation to the activities of this Department, it is necessary that there should be the closest possible liaison with local bodies. Therefore we want to express the hope that it will, for example, be possible for this Department to decentralize its own activities, with a view to bringing about direct contact between the local development associations and the provincial planning and advisory council.

<p>I want to thank the Minister for the statement he made last night. I know he looks surprised because he seldom hears me praise him in this House, but I must say he is the only Minister who has done anything for the Border area, and therefore I must express our gratitude to him. I am certain that everybody living in the Border area, especially around King William’s Town and East London, will be pleased to see that at last something is going to be done for the development of that area. The Minister started his statement by saying that in the implementation of Government policy aimed at the decentralization of industrial development to the border areas the Transkei-Ciskei area is one of the highest on the priority list. Then he went on to say later that the area was geographically very well situated especially in view of its close proximity to the Transkei and the Ciskei, which holds the advantage of a large source of labour supply. When he was talking about the assistance to be given, he said that the local authority is responsible for the provision of the necessary services as well as the creation of desirable living conditions for both white and Bantu workers, and with their co-operation something could be done. I want to draw the Minister’s attention to the fact, that despite his reference to the Transkei the Transkei is not going to get anything out of this.</p>

The Government’s policy of establishing industries in the border areas was firstly to assist the decentralization of industry, and we support the decentralization of industry. But there was also a second reason as far as the Government was concerned, and that was the ideological reason, the idea that the African should be able to sleep with his family at night. The Minister who interjected just now is the man who laid so much stress on this when he was still Deputy Minister. The Bantu must work in the white factory in the daytime and he must sleep with his family at night.</p>

<p>Of course I do, but then you must be practical, and that is why you must put the industry in Umtata and not in Berlin. I do not know whether that Minister has been to that area, but the Deputy Minister will be able to tell him that at the nearest point on the Kei River there is no area suitable for establishing a village or a town, even if the Government is prepared to cart the labour 50 miles or so by bus to the <span class="col_6973-6974" refersTo="page_0636"/>industry at Berlin. I want to know of what assistance this will be to the Transkei? When is the Government going to wake up to the fact that there is no suitable spot on the border of the Transkei for the establishment of a border industry? Nothing has been done and nothing will be done, and to come now with a statement like this and to pretend that this is in furtherance of their border development policy to help the Transkei is utter nonsense. This will not help the Transkei at all, and this is another proof of the failure of the Government to appreciate all the implications of the establishment of border areas to accommodate the people living in their own homeland. This will not enable the Transkeian worker to sleep with his family at night, unless you take the Transkeian worker out and establish a township at Berlin for Transkeians. I am hoping that the Minister of Planning will have a greater sense of realism than the Minister of Community Development and the Minister of Bantu Administration and see that the only thing he can do in the way of proper planning is to go into the Transkei and to establish industries there. The sooner he starts investigating through his department what can be done in the Transkei to give employment to people living in the Transkei, the better for the Transkei and for the Government.</p>

<p>In the extremely limited time at my disposal I should like to come back to the hon. member for Port Natal. The hon. member stood up here this morning and posed as the high priest of apartheid. The hon. member is now coming forward and I want to ask him whether, on behalf of the United Party, he is now standing up here as the high priest of apartheid? Then I want to remind him of what he said in this House on the 20th April, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We move voiceless millions of people about the country with little regard to human rights and dignity or disruption of family life. Because the department forces people to move from areas which they had occupied for generations, areas which, in many cases, were never occupied by white people, hardships are suffered by these two groups.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask whether the hon. member and the United Party will tell me: If they are in favour of apartheid, how can one have separate areas without moving people around? In other words, if one accepts the principle of apartheid, one must accept the principle of moving people around. The one is a consequence of the other. One must accept it.</p>

Then I say he should go and sit there beside the hon. member for Houghton where he belongs. Then I say that he is towing the whole United Party along on this road of liberalism, and between the United Party and this side of the House there is simply no bridge that could bring us together. There is no road to reconciliation; we shall never hit it off.</p>

<p>Apartheid is the fact that that hon. member can, in future, continue to exist in South Africa as a white man. It is the basis of his white nationhood and the perpetuation of his white nationhood in the future of the Republic of South Africa. I actually stood up in order to put forward another matter. When we on this side of the House thank the Ministers or the Government, United Party members always shout &#x201C;Yes, they are saying thank-you again&#x201D;. I want to do a strange thing this morning and, on behalf of the United Party representatives of Natal and the hon. members of the National Party of Natal, thank the hon. the Minister and the Government for bringing us the first key to the development of Natal, in the shape of the establishment of Iscor at Newcastle. In the second place the hon. the Minister gave us a second key to the future development in Natal, in the form of the Industrial Development Corporation at Ladysmith.

<p>No, I did not have any options there, and I am not here in my own interests, but in the interests of my constituency. Natal, and the Republic of South Africa. This morning I want to say to the hon. the Minister that, with the coming of Iscor and the activities of the Industrial Development Corporation at Ladysmith, I foresee that the Tugela basin is going to develop, and so rapidly and dramatically that within a very short period it is going to overshadow the Witwatersrand urban complex. I say this because there is a population explosion, because those people have to be accommodated and because the Tugela basin lends itself to the future accommodation of these people. Now I want to say to the hon. the Minister that we must see the modern planning of the Tugela basin as a unit. In the Tugela basin, which covers three constituencies, i.e. Newcastle, Klip River and Mooi River, the hon. <span class="col_6975-6976" refersTo="page_0637"/>the Minister will find local authorities and the Tugela basin development association who are prepared to co-operate in every way possible in the modern planning of this area. In the year 1969 we have the opportunity of letting this large complex develop, not sporadically, but as a unit. I want to make the point that early consideration will have to be given to the fact that Boeings will have to land in that complex, that the Tugela basin will have to be linked with the rest of the world, and that a watch will already have to be kept for an airport of international proportions in order to handle those aircraft such as the Boeings, and even larger ones, in the future. This basin is going to be the terminus for many people who come to Natal from abroad. Therefore I not only want to thank the hon. the Minister, but I also want to give him the assurance that the Tugela basin development association will do everything in its power to assist him and his department with this planning.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the few minutes at my disposal I am not going to waste my time with the red herring which the hon. member for Klip River tried to draw across our path here. I also want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister and his Department for the statement which he gave us yesterday and for his kindness in sending a copy of it across. I also want to thank him for visiting that area shortly after assuming office and for spending time there in order to see what was going on on the Berlin Flats. There are only a few points that I want to mention in the short time at my disposal. The hon. the Minister knows that industrial land has been sold out in the East London area because the people expected that greater development would possibly take place than has appeared from the statement which the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs issued. The first question which arises is what the extent is of the area to which reference was made here by the hon. the Minister. Is the water position such that extensive development can take place in that area, in terms of the statement which has already been made by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs in connection with the development of water sources for a limited amount of land? Are there future plans for bringing water down from the Eastern slopes of the Drakensberg Mountains to this area which will certainly not have enough water? The rivers at its disposal cannot supply this area with sufficient water if there is development. One of the most important factors is also the incentive factor which will have to come into effect. One of the bodies at the hon. the Minister’s disposal, i.e. the Council for Scientific Research, will still have to do a great deal of research to give guidance in connection with the industries that ought to be established there. I want to make a strong point here. I know that the hon. the Minister and his Department are busy with this, but some indication will nevertheless have to be given to industrialists from abroad as to where they ought to establish themselves and where the raw materials and the labour will be available to them. Apart from this, indications will have to be given about what industries can do this successfully. I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister that the Council for Industrial Research and other bodies are always hammering on the textile industry. In the past the textile industry has experienced great difficulties, and not only there, but also in the Uitenhage area. Consideration must be given to encouraging other industries to establish themselves in this area, and to the Government itself taking the initiative by establishing some heavy industry or other there, as an incentive factor to draw industrialists to that area.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to the hon. member for East London (City) for what he had to say in regard to my announcement last night. I should not like to mention the size of the sites here, but the available land for industrial sites is quite unlimited in the Berlin area so that there will be no obstacle whatsoever. As far as the matter of water is concerned, I indicated in my statement what the position was, but I also want to make it very clear that at this stage no industry which is considering moving to East London need feel any concern about there being a water problem. As regards the incentive factor, the hon. member knows that the Government is very sympathetically disposed towards the East London-Berlin area as far as this matter is concerned, but that every application will of course be considered by the Permanent Committee on its merits. This is of course a matter for which funds are being made available under the Vote of the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs. I do nevertheless want to say in regard to location in this area and in other areas that my Department states clearly, upon application, which areas are suitable, and East London is one of them. It is very difficult for us to give preference to one area over another, but I went so far as to say that the East London area and the Berlin area which have now been designated, are very high on the list of priorities, for the simple reason that half the Bantu we would like to provide with a reasonable livelihood in the years that lie ahead are in fact concentrated in that area. It is for this reason that we give that area such a high priority.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klip River mentioned a few other very important matters. He indicated the differences between the United Party and the National Party in regard to the matters which we discuss under this Vote in a very effective way. The hon. member referred to the announcement that Iscor is to be stablished in Newcastle. In addition he also mentioned the border area development at Ladysmith which I announced some time ago, and as he correctly stated, this is being done in co-operation with the I.D.C. With reference to <span class="col_6977-6978" refersTo="page_0638"/>this I just want to say that as far as Natal is concerned, and apparently most of the members on the opposite side have never seen it in this way before, because they definitely did not bring it up in this debate: There were three announcements which were of the utmost importance for the future of Natal, i.e. the announcements in regard to the new Iscor, the border area at Ladysmith and the further steps in regard to Richard’s Bay, <i>inter alia,</i> to create a local authority there. No province in the country can ask for more than to hear three such major and important announcements. These were such important announcements that the hon. member for Klip River was quite right. My Department of Planning will have to give very careful consideration, and so will other Departments as well, to the fact that we will have to make an early start in regard to the construction of airports, at any rate for this northern Natal area and for the Richard’s Bay area. This emphasizes once again what I tried to say last night, i.e. that the primary function of the Department of Planning is not to plan for tomorrow, but so that 20, 30 and 50 years hence a finger cannot be pointed and it cannot be said that in Natal, as far as northern Natal and Richard’s Bay are concerned, we neglected to look to the future and to establish an airport. To my mind this is a fine example, and the hon. member raised a very important point here.</p>

<p>While the hon. member for Klip River was speaking, an interjection was made by the hon. member for Port Natal, which I do not want to leave unanswered. When the hon. member for Klip River was referring to the border area development at Ladysmith, the hon. member for Port Natal asked whether the hon. member for Klip River did not have any options there. In other words, whether the hon. member for Klip River would have derived any personal benefit from it. I think a remark of this kind is not worthy of this House. I want to give the hon. member for Port Natal an example of how personal interest cannot be allowed to play a part in this matter and how we should not use tactics of that kind outside this House, because it is the most deplorable criticism which any person can use. I just want to mention an example in regard to the establishment of Iscor at Newcastle. In 1946 my late father left a farm at Newcastle to me, my brother and my sister, which was subsequently registered in our names. In other words, I and my family benefit personally from the fact that the new Iscor is to be established at Newcastle. It was not a question of options, or of a recent acquisition. It is land which has belonged to us since 1946. I am just mentioning this as an example in pursuance of the interjection made by the hon. member for Port Natal. The fact of the matter is that the decision that the new Iscor should be established at Newcastle was quite correct. All factors, such as the economy and other factors, were taken into account, and the Government took the correct decision and I am in full agreement with it. Although I had a personal interest in this matter the function of my Department of Planning was to the last to advocate and to present the case for Iscor being established at East London and not at Newcastle. This was done in an effective and powerful way, but as I have said, after everything was taken into consideration, the correct decision, that it should be established at Newcastle, was taken. I want to express my deepest censure of this interjection made by the hon. member, and I hope that it will not become a feature of our public life.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I would like to thank the hon. member for Transkei for the thanks he expressed. The hon. member also asked of what assistance this development will be for the Transkei. But surely development at Berlin will also create jobs for people from the Transkei. In that Bantu area which is already being developed not only Ciskeians are present, but also people from the Transkei.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>They will have to leave the Transkei and go and live in the Ciskei.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Apart from that they will still be living in a Bantu area. As is the case in other parts of the country, Transkeians can work there, stay in hostels, and be home during week-ends. That is a much better proposition than in other provinces.</p>

<p>*Let me also make it very clear that the development of the border area at Berlin is in no respect being opposed to development inside the homeland at Umtata. As far as the development at Umtata is concerned, if it were in any way practical and physically possible, I would rather see ten times more development taking place in Umtata than in Berlin. But we must be practical. That is why I just want to inform the hon. member that as far as the Department of Planning and the Department of Economic Affairs is concerned, location of industries at Berlin is not a <i>quid pro quo</i> and must in no respect be connected with the development we would like to see taking place at Umtata. The hon. member will be aware, because he knows that part of the world, that location possibilities at Umtata are restricted by various factors. I just thought that I should make this matter very clear.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein (West) raised quite a number of points. In the first place he requested that public recognition should be accorded to students who were doing research work and who had done well in that field. He mentioned the possibility of the introduction of a public medal of honour. The Government is investigating the question of recognition in various fields. This matter is being dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The idea the hon. member raised here was a good one, and I shall request my Department to bring it to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs. As far as planning is concerned, full courses in planning <span class="col_6979-6980" refersTo="page_0639"/>have been introduced at four universities through the mediation of the Department of Planning. There are 10 temporary posts on the establishment of the Department in order to afford people the opportunity, while they are engaged in investigations and projects for the Department, to acquire their master’s and doctor’s degrees. I can therefore state that we on our part are taking certain steps in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member also discussed the spending of leisure time by students, particularly if this is related to the possibilities which exist for research. I agree with the hon. member that our students can do far more in this respect, and for that reason I want to encourage them to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of development associations. To a certain extent this ties up with what the hon. member for Moorreesburg had to say in this regard. At the moment there are as many as 51 development associations in the Republic. Many of them came into being through the co-operation of the Department. This co-operation has been cordial. I shall subsequently, in my reply to the hon. member for Moorreesburg, have a few more things to say about this.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the Coloureds in Bloemfontein. The fact of the matter is that Bloemfontein is not a Bantu border area. We have no intention at the moment of changing the situation of the Coloureds in Bloemfontein. As the hon. member knows however, the position of the Coloureds in the O.F.S. has been dealt with in a report. The report is still receiving consideration. But we hope to reach a decision soon. Then the possibilities for the location of industries in Bloemfontein can be reconsidered. If there should be any applications in this regard, I would be pleased if they could be addressed to the Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown spoke about the lack of co-ordination on a high level. As an example of that he mentioned the fact that although Coloureds had been settled at Slangkop, there was no post office or other facilities. Subsequently he requested that all these facilities should be supplied before an area is declared to be a group area.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<p>Better co-ordination must take place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Let me now inform the hon. member that this is not a function of my Department, and that I have no intention of making it a function of my Department either. The function of my Department is exclusively to designate an area as a group area. That in itself is a Herculean task. But the moment an area is allocated as a group area, it is out of my Department’s hands, and that is how I want it to stay.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg also discussed regional planning. <i>Inter alia,</i> he pointed out the importance of people and asked that people should not merely be a pressure group within a regional development association, but that they should realize that they have a task to fulfil. On that score I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member. No matter how much is done by the State there can be no development in an area if the people within that area do not contribute their share. That is why I am very pleased about the objective argument the hon. member put forward. A I have already said, I am in complete agreement with him as regards his view of development associations. Nevertheless, I must address a word of warning here to all the different bodies in the various regions. As responsible people we must be careful not to say things which would cause false hopes to rise among the people in a region. We recently had an example of this in the Transvaal. By doing this, we would be doing the area which we would in fact like to benefit a disservice.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked for a new approach in regard to our oceans and stated that South Africa should ensure that it does not lag behind a far as taking an interest in that matter is concerned. <i>Inter alia,</i> he referred to a U.N. committee dealing with this matter. Now I should like to make a short statement in regard to it. During the past few years unprecedented interest in the utilization of marine resources has flared up in various countries of the world. What the hon. member said is correct, i.e. that in the U.S.A. more is going to be spent on oceanographic research next year than on the space programme This is almost unthinkable, but true nevertheless. At present $516 million is already being scent on this. Together with that the value of the exploitation of the ocean by the U.S.A, amounts to a tremendous total, something like $1,000 million per year. Towards the end of 1967 Malta introduced a motion at the General Assembly of the U.N. to the effect that the deep-sea and the deep-sea bed beyond the territorial waters should be reserved for peaceful purposes and that the resources there should be utilized to the benefit of the poorer countries in particular. This is a far-reaching and revolutionary idea for the &#x201C;deep-sea bed beyond the territorial waters&#x201D; also includes the Agulhas bank which would consequently also have to be reserved for the benefit of poorer countries Discussions of this matter are still continuing in various committees of the U.N., and a permanent committee consisting of 42 countries has been appointed to go into this matter further. The committee has just met for the first time. South Africa is not one of the 42 member countries, but has a representative there in the capacity of observer. Recently we also sent a deputation over, including officials from my department. Arising out of this an auxiliary committee of the Planning Advisory Council was appointed, whose task it will be to co-ordinate the legal, technical, economic and scientific aspects of the utilization of marine resources, and to advise the Cabinet in this respect. Hon. members will realize that it is necessary to tackle it in this way because <span class="col_6981-6982" refersTo="page_0640"/>we are dealing here with a new development. The Planning Adviser is chairman of the auxiliary committee, and it members include the scientific adviser, representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, Planning, Mining, as well as the C.S.I.R. and Soekor. The findings of this auxiliary committee will eventually go through to the general Planning Advisory Council. The Department of Mines has also for some time been engaged in oceanographic research, in conjunction with the university of Cape Town. Seismic apparatus, two magnetometers and an ocean gravimeter, which are the property of the Department of Mines, are being used on the research ship <i>S.A.S. Natal,</i> for the purpose of taking readings. The staff consists of two officials from the Geological Survey section, and the salary of a third person who was recruited by the university is also being paid by the Department of Mines. In addition there is a very well-equipped research ship for marine observations, i.e. the <i>Meiring Naude,</i> which was taken into operation in May 1968. In addition to this, mention must still be made of the hydraulic research unit at the University of Stellenbosch. Nor must we forget that a wealth of information is being brought to our attention as a result of the search for natural oil in our territorial waters. The contracts which have been signed with 12 sub-lessees read that all information should go to Soekor, from whence it can be channelized to the various Government departments. Hon. members will note therefore that as far as this matter is concerned we are already active in various fields. In regard to the hydraulic research unit at Stellenbosch, I just want to mention that it is functioning in close conjunction with the engineering faculty of that university. Purely scientific oceanographic research is being coordinated by the South Africa National Committe for Oceanographic Research. This committee concentrates on basic research and ties in with the aforesaid auxiliary committee and the planning advisory council.</p>

<p>In addition I just want to announce that the Government has approved in principle that the Republic will participate in a proposed international decade for ocean exploration which will start during the seventies. This may afford the Republic an opportunity of cooperating with a number of countries&#x2014;for example, the U.S.A., the South American countries, Australia, Japan, Madagascar and others&#x2014;in an important scientific programme, a programme which may, on a long-term basis, produce major practical and economic benefits. Some of our officials were in the U.S.A, recently to assemble information in this regard. In September this will be followed up by further discussions.</p>

<p>The importance of the utilization and development of marine resources is an aspect to which the Government is devoting serious attention. The idea of a body which would deal jointly with all matters related to the utilization of marine resources&#x2014;for example, a separate Government Department, which has occasionally been mentioned&#x2014;has recently been mentioned by various persons. I feel, however, that the auxiliary committee and the Planning Advisory Council concerned must first place the entire matter on a firm basis and report to the Government at an appropriate time. After that this matter can be reconsidered. I thank the hon. member for Moorreesburg for having raised such an important matter as that here.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Pinetown referred to so-called frustration, because the report which he referred to was also mentioned in the secretary’s report which we have before us and that it was indicated that it would still take a long time before the Durban-Pietermaritzburg report would be completed. I am sorry to inform the hon. member that making these surveys, which forms the basis of such a report, does take time. At the moment I am not in the position to indicate what exactly the time factor in this particular case will be. I should, however, like to agree with the hon. member that a stable labour force is of primary importance in industrial development. Knowing the area that he referred to, I am more than in sympathy with him if he says that a stable labour force is of absolute necessity in industrial development. But may I say to the hon. member that we as a Department have never changed our plans. The Indian group area at Klaarwater was only established after the Department of Bantu Administration had decided to house the Pinetown Bantu elsewhere. I am also in agreement with the hon. member that there is at the moment actually no housing for Indians at Klaarwater. However, the function of my Department is merely to indicate the group area. After that, of course, it goes to the Department of Community Development. Then the hon. member for Pinetown inquired about what stage has been reached regarding the Bantu area at Claremont. I may inform the hon. member that discussions have taken place with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and have reached an advanced stage as to the most realistic division between the races. This is now a matter for the Department of Bantu Administration.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Benoni raised a few matters here. In particular he pointed out that in his constituency no problems were being experienced in regard to the application of the Physical Planning Act. I want to inform the hon. member that I am grateful to him for saying that, for virtually the same applies throughout the country. This is the case because for the application of this Act we have dedicated officials who go out of their way not only to treat people courteously but also to provide instruction wherever that can possibly be done. He referred here to the instruction provided by the Secretary at Nigel. I can give numerous examples of other officials, together with the Secretary, who have taken <span class="col_6983-6984" refersTo="page_0641"/>steps on such occasions. This is now bearing fruit. The hon. member also referred to Indians at Benoni. I held discussions with representatives from that constituency and that town council. I want to inform the hon. member that the idea there was also that an Indian industrial area should be allowed to develop where Indian industries could be established. However, I think it would be a good thing if industrialists throughout the country take cognizance of the fact that in the Benoni area Indians are available and will be available to work in the industries, and in this way not only to replace the Bantu but also to occupy the place the Bantu would have occupied if it had not been for the Physical Planning Act.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member mentioned the question of the P.W.V. area. Now I just want to avail myself of this opportunity of expressing my thanks to him for the work he did in drafting these reports when he was still chairman of that commission of inquiry, and of that committee. The hon. member for Benoni was chairman until Benoni became Nationalist in 1966, and he had to relinquish that post. In addition the hon. member also referred specifically to the Sugar Bush Ridge. As he is aware, the report has been completed and submitted to me. I have already referred it to the Transvaal Provincial Administration. They are in fact engaged at the moment in trying to obtain the necessary funds from the Treasury in order to make a start with the implementation of this matter. I could have elaborated further on the question of recreation, but time does not allow.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal referred derogatorily here to what the qualifications of the members of the Group Areas Board were.</p>

<p>Yes, I am still coming to that. Secondly, we appoint well-balanced people to the Group Areas Board. This is something we have always done. Thirdly, we appoint persons who arc well qualified.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to give hon. members the academic qualifications of the members of the board. The Chairman. Mr. Wessels, has a B.A. LL.B, degree. Mr. M. C. Barker a B.Econ. degree, Mr. Van Wyk, B.A. LL.B, and M.A., Mr. S. W. van Wyk, M.A., Dr. G. A. Brand, M.A. LL.B., and Mr J. A. F. Nel, B.A. LL.B. I think that the hon member will gather from that that these men are academically qualified men. Mr. Wessels, the Chairman, was a chief magistrate in Pretoria. Mr. Van Wyk was a magistrate and also the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Public Works. Dr. Brand served in various Departments, including the Departments of Bantu Administration, Justice and in the Department of Planning as Under-Secretary. Mr. Van Wyk was a school teacher. Mr. J. A. F. Nel was an advocate at the Bar and is also a former M.P. and he has vast experience, especially of commission work. He was also a member of the Bantu Affairs Commission.</p>

<p>*I do not think there can be any doubt that these people are not competent to fulfil their duties in a very satisfactory way, as they are in fact doing to-day. Now I do nevertheless want to point out to the hon. member that these members of the board do not simply make up their own minds in regard to the matters, but must also form a judgment of all the evidence submitted to them. This evidence is submitted by competent persons, and persons who take a personal interest in the matter. I hope that this will never happen again, i.e. that doubt is expressed in respect of the persons serving on the Group Areas Board.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>What I said, is that I have had discussions with the Administrators as to how the functions in regard to planning could be divided between the Provincial Administrations and the Department of Planning. I did not refer to the question of industry itself.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Mooi River also referred to the advertising of the Bishopstown area and Woodlands for Coloureds. The fact that an area has been advertised does not necessarily mean that the particular area will be proclaimed for the particular group. That is why a public inquiry is held to give all interested persons an opportunity of submitting their representations so that all the evidence can be considered by the Group Areas Board. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that that will also be the case in this particular instance.</p>

<p>*There are just one or two other points raised here to which I would like to reply. The impression was created here that deproclamation of group areas is being done at random. I want to make it very clear here that we will try our best, and will always proceed from the premise, that deproclamation of group areas should be restricted to the absolute limit because we do not want to create uncertainty in any race group The Group Areas Act has been in operation for quite a number of years now. I think the Act was passed in 1951, or 1952. In the 17 years the Act has been in operation, only 20 group areas have been deproclaimed throughout the entire country, and some of them are a question of four morgen or a morgen and a half or one morgen in extent, but what is most interesting is that the number of deproclamations from White to Coloured was ten; from Whites to Indians four; in other words, from White to non-White there were 14 out of the 20; from Coloured to White there were three; from Indian to White two and from Coloured to Indian one. I think the hon. member can therefore rest assured that no random steps are being taken.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank hon. members for their contributions and for the pleasant way in which they discussed the activities of this Department, and in particular I want to extend a cordial word of thanks to the Opposition for the fact that after the Physical Planning Act had been in operation for only 18 months and after a very stormy passage here, nothing was raised in this debate in regard to Act No. 88 of 1967, and that I need therefore furnish no reply in that connection either. I am grateful to my officials for having administered the Act in this way.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is in the fortunate position that the degree of knowledge of health has advanced enormously. With this advance in knowledge, we have arrived at the point where most diseases as such can be controlled. The Minister is now in the position that his problem is not one of dealing with ill-health but one of making circumstances and conditions in the country such that he can preserve health itself. The control of illness generally has reached a fairly advanced stage. Sir, it was in 1919 that the last Public Health Act was passed in this House, and while the Act has been amended from time to time it has not really been considered as a whole, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will give thought to the question of completely consolidating the laws which have been passed since 1919 and at the same time introducing a new outlook into his Department and turning it from more or less a passive Department which tries to eliminate ill-health into a Department which is actively and dynamically concerned with prevention.</p>

<p>After all. Sir, prevention is better than cure. Up to now his Department has concentrated largely on curing disease. It is true that there have been a few advances in prevention but basically the outlook of his Department has been to try at all costs to keep ill-health away. He should go forward now with the thought that the danger of epidemics is small; that he should concentrate on the preservation and improvement of health. That should be his outlook. He must turn his Department’s attention to the environment of the living creatures in this country. One might call this the environmental attitude. The country is entitled to drink pure water, to breathe pure air, and to receive not only uncontaminated food but food of the highest quality. If he can do this, he will have achieved a great object. He has been given a little evidence of the necessity of breathing pure air and of avoiding air contaminants but little has been done in this regard. The Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Bill was passed in this House in 1961, and since then we have heard nothing further; we do not know what is happening and we see very little evidence that the committee which was created at that time has been tackling this task. It would be a great advantage to all of us if he could persuade this council for the prevention of atmospheric air pollution to publish a report so that the public will <span class="col_6987-6988" refersTo="page_0643"/>know what is happening. Air is almost his greatest immediate problem. The two things which he must face and which I hope he will face, are contamination with dust and contamination with fuels.</p>

<p>This problem is there, but apart from the mines nothing has been done about it. Every time the question is asked, one receives the answer that it is under consideration. Meantime lives are threatened and not only are they threatened but they are made, towards the end, most unpleasant. Many a man dies gasping for breath, emphysematous, because he has been breathing comparatively foul air over the last years, or even the early years, but particularly over the last years of his life. It is difficult to obtain pure air unless one goes far out into the country areas, or one goes to sea. We are not as bad as many of the more industrialized nations, but we are quietly and steadily poisoning our air. One cause of it I would like to point out is the absence of control over diesel engines, which are among the most venomous of air pollutants. We even find that when we complain in Durban about the Greyville shunting yards and the smoke from the shunting engines there, we are told that the hon. the Minister of Transport will as soon as possible replace them with diesel engines. The use of diesel engines in the desert of South-West Africa is perhaps excuseable, but to replace steam engines, in spite of all their smoke, by diesel engines almost amounts to murder in that particular area of Natal. It is not necessary. Most of the railway engines in the Durban station are electric. Why then must the steam shunting engines be replaced by diesel engines and make the position even worse? You will not see the poison as you see the smoke, but you may smell it, and certainly you will breathe it The Minister knows that in all dusty occupations, other than the mines, there is no pre-employment examination. Many industries use dust as abrasives and it creates a very serious dust problem. The rope industry and the demolition industry are probably the worst pollutants of all, so that every time a house or a building is demolished the people working there and all people living close by are breathing contaminated air.

<p>There is a great deal more air which the hon. member for Durban (Central) still has to clear on his side. I should like to break a lance for that unfortunate sector of our population the handicapped persons. We undertake planning and all we think of is economic growth. If we think of planning then three quarters of us think only of industrial development, but we are to a large extent shutting off our social conscience by forgetting about those unfortunate people who do not have the same opportunities we do. Actually I want to confine myself here to the mentally handicapped, those people who are on the borderline, who are not quite certifiable, but who cannot be trained either. It may be said that this does not fall under the Minister of Health, but then my counter question would be: Under what does it fall? I am thinking here of special institutions. In Bloemfontein there is an institution which is named after our First Lady, the Lettie Fouché Institution. This is an institution which originated out of a crying need at a stage when there was no haven for these people. Some people saw the need and accepted the responsibility and voluntary assistance was offered and voluntary organizations took over. I mentioned one of these institutions, but there are so many of them in the country.</p>

<p>Because these institutions do not quite fall under the Department of Health and do not quite fall under the Department of Social Welfare either, these people are in fact in a rather hopeless position. I know there was a commission of inquiry, but I hope the hon. the Minister will not take it amiss of me if I break a lance for these people so that we can decide where these people must receive assistance from and from whence they must obtain the supervision they require even after having left school. This is one group of people, but I also want to break a lance for another group of handicapped persons, and here I want to mention more specifically the physically handicapped. There are so many of our people, particularly in this modern time of traffic congestion and road accidents, who have been permanently handicapped or crippled who can nevertheless do a proper days work. But our problem is that we can no longer allow these things to escape our notice and I believe the Department of Health will have to take the initiative here so that an opportunity can be created for these people to do a proper days work.</p>

<p>These people can do honest labour. We will have to introduce this into our planning. Here we are engaged in constructing a colossal building opposite the Houses of Parliament. I do not know what the position is but if I am to judge from all the other buildings I do not think we could have done our late Prime Minister, after whom this building is going to be named, a greater honour than to plan in such a way that those people who are handicapped and who are perhaps confined to wheel chairs will one day be able to obtain work, and that there should be planning for them in that building as well. In most of our buildings&#x2014;I almost want to say in all&#x2014;no <span class="col_6989-6990" refersTo="page_0644"/>provision is made in the latrines, or anywhere else, for these people who are the unfortunate among us, but who can nevertheless make a particular contribution to the solution of our labour problem.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have dealt with the question of air to a limited extent. I should now like to move to another feature of the hon. the Minister’s departmental policy. That is the tendency to move more and more towards immunization rather than prevention. For instance, if there is an outbreak of typhoid&#x2014;fortunately it occurs rarely; but it should be even less common than it is &#x2014;we immediately are informed that all contacts have been immunized, of course by injection. But it would be very much better if the policy of the Department is as far as possible to avoid artificial immunization. It is necessary in some diseases to immunize people. It is nevertheless undesirable and unpopular. People, on the whole, are not anxious to be vaccinated. All of us who are in favour of this use of various sera for immunization, feel that it is only used as a second best; in other words, prevention rather than cure. You see, Sir, it is only this Minister’s Department which is really concerned with the prevention of diseases, either through its own officials, or officials to whom it has delegated responsibility. But, nevertheless, the responsibility rests with this Minister.</p>

<p>I draw attention particularly to the very heavy load of intestinal parasites which the average human and many animals carry. The animal parasites are in many occasions transmitted by the human to the animal and by the animal to the human The heavy load of nematode worms which the Bantu, particularly, and I think also quadrupeds, carry, should be thoroughly investigated. These are waterborne diseases on the whole. Some effort should be made to provide pure water to every inhabitant, whether animal or human; because here is where the disease is carried, apart from, of course, the ordinary worms which are carried by meat. It is quite common to have dogs &#x201C;dewormed&#x201D; as they say. Of course, it is very good for them. It has to be repeated very often. But it should not be necessary to constantly deworm humans. I am sure the veterinary department will be very pleased to have co-operation in this respect. This is another dynamic aspect to which I think the hon. the Minister should attend. There is no research going on as regards parasites, except to a certain extent at the institute in Durban which, to tell you the truth, Sir, is largely concerned with amebiasis. I do not think they are concerned greatly with the ordinary worm. Unless the Department of Health tackles it, there is nobody else to tackle the problem. As far as I know, research is not going on to any great extent.</p>

<p>I have spoken about the pollution of water and air. The position as regards food is the same. That is perhaps less contaminated. It is perhaps not contaminated, but it is nevertheless sometimes allowed to deteriorate. This Department should definitely go into the problems of the deterioration of food, to the extent to which food is tinned and frozen. Because we are now becoming a people who mostly open tins or go to the ice chest. This is an undesirable state of affairs. The hon. the Minister should tackle this problem and see how it can be solved. Otherwise the general good health which we have enjoyed here, owing to our sunlight and our climate, will gradually disappear. We will become, as it were, physically a second grade race. This has happened to many other nations, particularly nations in the tropical and sub-tropical regions.</p>

<p>I want to turn to another small matter which I feel is important. I should like to discuss the question of noise, peace and rest with the hon the Minister. It is his job to see that people can get a decent night’s rest without being disturbed. It is his job to see that people’s ears in their working hours are not hammered by compressors outside their windows. All these are matters which affect the health of the people, and it is the responsibility of his Department. It is time that he investigated thoroughly the question of hearing and noise.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to draw attention to what is perhaps the effect of the recent purchase tax, namely a rise in the price of the saccharin derivatives and the food specially prepared and manufactured for diabetics. The diabetics are finding that the prices of their particular foods, which they need in order to get a sufficient nourishment, which should be free of carbohydrates, have recently gone up in price considerably. I do not know whether it is due to the taxing or whether it is just some profiteering. I think it should be investigated certainly and soon.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned for lunch I was stating the case of two groups of persons in our society; in the first instance, the so-called mentally handicapped, or mentally regarded, and in the other case the physically handicapped. I should like to contrast the mentally handicapped with the physically handicapped. As I see the matter, these physically handicapped people are people who may perhaps be trained, but who definitely cannot be educated. Once they have completed their school training they can definitely not look after themselves. My plea is that between the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare a refuge should be found for these people under supervision. I realize fully that at the moment they are not <span class="col_6991-6992" refersTo="page_0645"/>certifiable. But, Sir, it is an illusion that these people can look after themselves. In fact, we are only too aware that as a result of their mental handicap these people are far more sexually stimulated than others. This is definitely a danger to our population. It is my plea that the Government will take steps in accordance with its responsibility in this matter.</p>

<p>As regards the second group, the physically handicapped, I may possibly have created the impression, because I had to stop too soon before lunch, that I was pleading for a labour bureau under the Department of Health. That is by no means what I have in mind. I want to advocate a change in the attitude of employers, because we have among the physically handicapped, in contrast with the mentally handicapped, people who are able to look after themselves on the labour market and to do South Africa a great service. The problem is that there are so many of these people. I am not thinking only of paraplegics here. I am thinking of people who have undergone operations of all kinds, for example lung operations, lobectomies and heart operations. In present-day circumstances those people are quite healthy and can do a proper day’s work. But the resistance&#x2014;I do not want to say antagonism&#x2014;to their employment is still so strong that one still finds to-day that if a person who has suffered from rheumatic fever applies for work on the Railways he cannot be employed because he cannot join the Railway Medical Scheme. I know it may perhaps take years, but I am advocating a change in the disposition of the employers towards these people who are able, if they received just a touch of encouragement, to do a full day’s work.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say one or two words about the doctor shortage in South Africa. At the moment I feel that the Minister should take notice of what is happening throughout the world. Recently I read a report which was published in the United States at the beginning of 1960. In this report it is stated that in America there were 275,000 doctors in practice there, which gave a ratio of 1.4 doctors per 1,000. In South Africa we have one doctor to every 2.000 of the population. Of course, here we have a complication in that the Whites in the main have to provide the services for the white and the non-White population. The output of non-white doctors in South Africa is really only starting now. It will take a considerable time before we can depend on the non-white doctor to do his share in looking after the health of the total population. As matters are to-day, we also have to realize that while in South Africa we are not producing sufficient doctors for ourselves, the calls that are being made from the surrounding countries are becoming more urgent. It was with pride that we read recently that teams of our doctors were going to the surrounding states. We want to encourage that. Although we in South Africa have one doctor for every 2,000, which relatively means that every 1,000 people have half a doctor, we have to realize that Swaziland, Lesotho, Botswana and Malawi have an eighth of a doctor for every 1,000 people there. We do not have the exact figures for the Soviet Union, but they have approximately two doctors per 1.000. In little Israel they have more than two doctors per 1,000.</p>

<p>The necessity for increasing the output in South Africa must be borne in mind when one looks at the present conditions that exist, not only in South Africa, but throughout the world. Just to come back for a moment to Africa, in the whole of Africa there are 15 medical schools. Five of these 15 medical schools are in South Africa. There are only two dental schools south of the Sahara. Both these dental schools are in South Africa. So it means that calls for our South African doctors in Africa are going to be more and more. The death rate throughout the world in the main is decreasing and life expectancy is being lengthened. The doctors are discovering more germs and they are learning how to kill them. But for every 20 years that a man’s life is lengthened, we have to increase our doctor output by 40 per cent. We have the notion I think, that death comes suddenly to people. But it does not really. I think, usually, it is a very slow process. This slow process requires much medical attention. It is like the old lady said, death takes a little bite out of me every now and again. If we look at the picture as it may be in 10 years’ time, we will find that we are more than 10 per cent short of our present set-up. How will we be able to meet this? Are we going to bring more students into our present universities? Is it possible for us to increase the classes of the universities by, say, doubling the number of students bearing in mind always that we have virtually a 50 per cent loss? Classes of 100 are already difficult to maintain. What would happen if we had to have 200 students in a class? Will the efficiency of the doctors in South Africa be maintained with larger classes? What will be the solution? To these the obvious solution is that it is necessary for the Minister now to go into consultation with the Minister of Education and see whether it is not possible to establish another medical school in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister asked that same question last year. I told him then what I thought would be the most suitable place. Johannesburg has a medical school and Pretoria has a school. There are two medical schools in the Cape. There is a medical school in Durban in Natal. It is for non-Europeans. But we talk about all medical schools, because non-Europeans have to play their part. The only province in South Africa that does not have a medical school is the <span class="col_6993-6994" refersTo="page_0646"/>Free State. I do not think it would be a bad idea if a medical school was erected in Bloemfontein. The Minister should give consideration to the Free State. But failing the Free State I think that Natal should have another medical school. I want to leave it at that. Because of the shortness of time, I cannot go into further details on that matter.</p>

<p>In the minute or two that I have left at my disposal, I want to bring to the notice another very pressing problem, namely the increasing incidence of venereal disease in South Africa. I think the Department must immediately take steps to notify the public by every possible means as to the dangers and the ease with which one can become infected with venereal disease. With the introduction of penicillin into medicine and the ease with which venereal disease was being dealt with led to a certain amount of laxity. That is increased tenfold now by the use of the contraceptive pill. Because of these two incidents that have occurred, the introduction of a contraceptive pill and the belief that penicillin can cure venereal disease very quickly we have had a very, very rapid increase in the number of cases. The Minister knows, I know and medical people know that it is almost impossible to keep an accurate check on the number of cases that occur. It is a notifiable disease, but people do not notify it. One only has to go by the records of the hospitals. If my information is correct, we are finding an increasing attendance at clinics which are used to dealing particularly with this disease. I feel during the past few years there has been a laxity on the part of the Department of Health in putting up notices in public conveniences and toilets. There has not been enough publicity given in the Press to the dangers of venereal disease and the necessity for immediate medical attention to have this disease quickly cured. I also find that it is becoming a little more penicillin resistant. If we do not do something about reducing the incidence of the venereal disease, it will become more and more difficult to eradicate it later. I bring those two points to the Minister’s attention. I hope that he will be able to deal with it.</p>

<p>350 million. It deals with migraine. It knows neither bounds nor time. In the form of the Medical Research Council Act of 1969 we have the machinery for dealing effectively with this matter. As a result of this legislation it is possible for us to obtain international co-operation by joining the rest of the world in investigating this matter. I am very serious about this matter, although I am no doctor. However, I am also much more than that. As a patient I am the employer of every doctor who walks on two legs. That is why I am taking the floor, for as long as the employer holds the floor everything will be fine. If it is left to the employer to be the only one to speak, we shall soon have strikes, and that must not happen. I know that I am not going to be able to finish my speech. For that reason I want to ask the hon. the Minister in advance whether he is of the opinion that what I wanted to say is sufficiently important for him to feel concerned. I should also like to know whether he can tell us roughly what the extent is of the research which is being done for the purpose of preventing and curing migraine. In the third instance, I want to know whether it is possible to inquire into the extent of manpower erosion, road accidents, unhappy homes and injustice to children as a result of migraine.</p>

<p>On 17th May, last year, I made a speech in this House on this very same topic. The Press responded to this in a favourable manner. On 18th May the <i>Cape Times,</i> amongst others, published a report under the following heading: &#x201C;Migraine worse than birth pains, says M.P.&#x201D; As a result of the above-mentioned report I received between 20 and 25 letters. These letters were for the most part from ladies here in the vicinity of the Cape. I am still waiting for the hon. members for Houghton and Wynberg to add their testimonies. They have not done so as yet. Amongst others there was a letter from Major C. M. Grigg. He is the director of the Migraine Trust in London. He wrote, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Its purpose (i.e. that of the Migraine Trust) is research into the causes of this terrible suffering which now, it is estimated, affects 10 per cent of the world’s population.</block>

<p>That comes to 300 million people. Apart from this letter there were approximately 20 or 25 others. I just want to refer to two of them. In one of them it was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am in the position of confirming your statement that ‘birth pangs’ are not as severe as migraine. I have four lovely children all born normally and I am in a position to say: Give me birth pains in exchange for migraine. I have been to the most competent specialists in Cape Town and London and I have been told: &#x201C;You have a typical migraine. Go home and learn to live with it.&#x201D; I have also given birth to twins and I confirm again that migraine pain is still worse.</block>

<p>Another person wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was with great interest that I read the report of your recent speech in Parliament on migraine. As a sufferer, I can only but <span class="col_6995-6996" refersTo="page_0647"/>certify what you have said. I am pleased and grateful to you for bringing this malady to the notice of all and I sincerely hope that through your efforts something will eventuate that will lead to a cure.</block>

<p>What is migraine? The Migraine Trust illustrates it as follows: A man is sitting on a chair. He has migraine. On each of his shoulders there is a little devil. On each arm rest of the chair there is a little devil, on the back of the chair there is a little devil and on the chair next to him there is another one. What are they doing? The first is blowing a trumpet in his ear. The other is singing a song of destruction in his other ear. A third is operating a pneumatic drill above his right temple. The fourth is drilling a hole into his skull. The fifth is sawing and removing parts of his skull with a bow-saw. The sixth devil is wielding a 14 lb. hammer and hitting away at the only part of his skull which has not been staked off. Now I shall leave this to our imagination by merely saying what happens to a migraine sufferer between the attacks of migraine. This is what a poet, Uris Carter, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A snake lives in my head; at the moment he lies mercifully asleep in a circular heap at the back of my neck.</block>

<p>But watch out when it wakes up and uncoils itself. Doctors say that all migraine sufferers are intelligent, that they are diligent, conscientious, and that all of them are perfectionists. We should not be in too much of a hurry to blush with pride if we happen to be migraine sufferers, because I want to mention a number of world-famous figures from the past, all of whom were migraine sufferers and who were no angels. The first person to whom I want to refer is Mary Tudor. She was Queen of England from 1516 to 1558. She has gone down in history, rather unjustly, as Bloody Mary. I just want to say in passing that John Knox referred to her as the wicked Jezebel of England. The second sufferer I want to mention is Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, 1844-1900. He was a brilliant author and a talented musician. In addition he was a tireless searcher after truth and he died an unbeliever and a lunatic at the age of 56. He was also keen to become a minister of religion, just as his father and his grandfather had done. On 118 out of the 365 days of a year he suffered from migraine. The third sufferer was Rudyard Kipling, an author who lived from 1865 to 1936. This is what he wrote about migraine to a friend&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">Do you know what hemicrania is? A half-headache. I have been having it for a few days and it is a lovely feeling.</block>

<p>Just listen!</p>

<block name="quote">One half of my head in mathematical line from the top of my skull to the cleft of my jaw throbs and hammers and sizzles and bangs and swears while the other half&#x2014;calm and collected&#x2014;take note of the agony next-door.</block>

<p>The fourth sufferer was Alexander Pope, 1688-1744. This was said of him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He scribbled away on the sidelines of life and he was advised by Swift to &#x201C;descend in the name of God, to some other amusements as common mortals do&#x201D;.</block>

<p>However, he was not an ordinary person. He was frail and delicate, deformed, 4½ feet tall and he was greatly concerned about his physical appearance. He was literally in conflict with the whole world because of the migraine from which he suffered. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I write my poetry to help me through this long disease, my life!</block>

<p>He called his whole life a disease.</p>

<p>Speak of confusion! You know, Mr. Chairman, the most famous specialists in this world have removed healthy appendices and gall bladders only to find out that it was merely a migraine pain which took cover there. That is what is so confusing about this illness. It is calculated that in America $1,232 million is spent annually on migraine remedies Does this not justify research, no matter at whose expense? I want to read out to hon. members what was written in the Migraine Newsletter of December, 1968. Listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the reasons why research into migraine has been neglected is because it is not a dramatic illness &#x2026; a headache is still often regarded as something to be ashamed of.</block>

<p>Especially if one is a man.</p>

<block name="quote">If you go to bed with a headache you are more likely to be considered a nuisance than a sufferer.</block>

<p>From replies to a questionnaire it appears that chocolate is responsible for 72 per cent of migraine attacks, dairy products for 47 per cent, citrus for 32 per cent and alcohol for 25 per cent. What a blissful thought it is to know that alcohol is only responsible for 25 per cent of migraine attacks! But it is enough to make one desperate if one wants to go on a diet and one pays attention to the following two findings. In the first instance, it is said that it takes three to four weeks to rid oneself of the last traces of food proteins which were taken. If one has to wait three and four weeks to rid oneself of the after-effects of that food which one has eaten, when is one to try again? In the second instance, a doctor gave the following diet to a patient who suffered from migraine. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then you can cut all fried foods, sherry, wine, spirits, beer, chocolate, salt, pepper, <span class="col_6997-6998" refersTo="page_0648"/>mustard, vinegar, bananas, pickles, salad, cream, mayonnaise, gravies, soups, cheese, milk, oxo, bovril, marmite, puddings, rice and porridge.</block>

<p>What is left? Water and bread.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to what Professor Douw Steyn of Pretoria, a former professor in pharmacology, had to say in a warning to motorists in regard to the abuse of drugs. He said that exhausting journeys by car caused facial strain and headache. One takes a pill and becomes tired, lethargic and sleepy, and that is dangerous for oneself and for the people who are travelling along with you in that car. There is no scarcity of pills Apart from the 6,000 remedies which doctors may prescribe to us to-day, it is possible for us to buy another 25,000 kinds of remedies over the counter, just as cigarettes are bought&#x2014; freely and without a prescription. It is these pain-killing pills which are a source of danger to the motorist. As I have already said, they cause the field of vision to be reduced and they also affect the eyesight and bring about dizziness, deafness and sleepiness, and they can be perilous to the driver and the occupants of the car. Impaired and retarded reflexes result in the driver not responding to his environment.</p>

<p>I have now spoken here as a layman. I just want to know whether the hon. the Minister does not think that this is really something to be concerned about. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterberg has introduced a certain amount of levity in his serious plea for the help for sufferers of migraine. He and I both have an interest in the question of migraine for different reasons; he as a sufferer and I as a pharmacist. I am quite sure that the hon. the Minister will explain in due course that there are certain medical and scientific difficulties in dealing with a subject such as migraine.</p>

<p>I want to raise the question of drug abuse and drug distribution. With the position in regard to the Suez Canal and the implications which that has for South Africa in regard to the influx of harmful drugs, I feel that in passing I should point out to the hon. the Minister that in the four major ports of South Africa, Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, and Cape Town, of the total establishment of 666 customs officials, there is a shortage of 103. There are 56 vacant posts and 47 posts are covered by temporary staff. I realize that it does not fall within the purview of the Minister, but it is something which must really cause him concern. It must cause him concern to think that drugs may come into the country because of insufficient control at the point of entry.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, Sir, I am passing on. I want to refer to the question of potentially harmful drugs handled, distributed and promoted by medical representatives, who are not necessarily medical practitioners or chemists and druggists. I know that this has been discussed in respect of previous legislation and when I questioned the Minister he indicated that he did not regard the illegal possession clause, which was passed by Parliament, as being applicable to this type of person. He said he would give this matter further consideration. I am encouraged by the remarks the hon. the Minister made in his speech which was read on his behalf to the Pharmaceutical Society’s annual general meeting in Johannesburg last week. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">It is my considered opinion that it is most undesirable that large quantities of medical samples be carried around by unregistered representatives of firms to be distributed <i>ad lib</i> as a means of advertisement. In the case of scheduled drugs this practice readily lends itself to possible abuse and malpractice.</block>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister went on and he referred to the amending Bill. He also referred to the question of unauthorized possession of schedule six drugs and he said that this is something which is to be made an offence. He said that this is a matter which should be noted It is not my intention to impinge on the function of the statutory bodies which are there to advise the hon. the Minister, but I feel that I have the responsibility to place certain facts before the hon. the Minister and before this Committee. During the Easter recess I happened to be in Durban and I was approached by a medical representative. He said he wished to compliment me for having raised this matter in the House. He said he was not a qualified person, but he was deeply concerned at what was going on. He gave me an example of one of the procedures which he claimed was taking place. He said that certain medical representatives and I emphasize &#x201C;certain&#x201D; because I know that there are many men of integrity in this class of person, visited hospitals on their rounds and left potentially harmful drugs, including the pill, in the restrooms and toilets of the nurses and the medical staff in the hospitals.</p>

<p>He said to me: &#x201C;If you do not believe it, contact the Medical Superintendent and ask him.&#x201D; I did, Sir, and he confirmed it. He said that the position was now that he had laid down strict rules whereby medical representatives were confined to visiting the medical men and certain members of the staff at certain times only and under controlled conditions. But, Sir, he said: &#x201C;You know, I interviewed a medical representative the other day. I asked him how long he had been in the service of his present company. He replied: ‘Six and a half weeks.’ I said to him, ‘Well, that means that this is your first call; you have had six weeks’ training and this is your first call?’. He agreed.&#x201D; The doctor then said to him: &#x201C;How did you enjoy your course?&#x201D; His reply <span class="col_6999-7000" refersTo="page_0649"/>was: &#x201C;The lectures were dull but the night life in Johannesburg was fantastic.&#x201D; The doctor then said to him: &#x201C;What were you before you took up this position?&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;I was a paint salesman.&#x201D; Sir, this is one example But I want to refer the hon. the Minister to an advertisement which appeared in <i>The Argus</i> on 17th May: &#x201C;Young aggressive men: Applications are invited from young aggressive men for the position of medical representatives in Cape Town. A thorough training course will be provided for the successful applicants&#x201D;&#x2014;no mention of the night life&#x2014; &#x201C;Previous experience in selling would be an advantage.

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Aggressive. The only qualifications required apparently were aggressiveness and an ability to sell. I believe that the time has come when we could consider the suggestion put forward by this medical representative himself. He said he felt that medical representatives should be registered in some way; that the firms which employed them should have some record of them and so should some statutory body or this department have some record to show who was handling potentially harmful drugs. The hon. the Minister assured me during the debate on the Bill under which midwives are entitled to handle these drugs, that the control would be strict and that there would be records kept. I would earnestly urge the hon. the Minister to give this matter his urgent attention, because I believe that it is playing a big part or a fair part in the illegal distribution of drugs to people who should not be using them.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, in the few minutes at my disposal I wish to refer to the question of the committee to investigate insecticides and other poisons. I know that this committee was appointed in 1964 during the period of office of the Minister’s predecessor. But to me there seems to have been an inordinate delay in submitting a report, and I wish to put it to the Minister that the time has come when urgent consideration should be given to this matter. The committee was formed in 1964. In April, 1965 I was told that there would be an interim report in six months’ time; in August, 1966 I was told that the investigation had become more extensive but that an interim report would be submitted at the end of 1966. In February, 1967 I was told that this whole matter was being investigated over a wide field and that there would be an interim report during 1967. In February, 1968 I was told again of the wide scope of the work of this committee and that there would be an interim report in the near future. In February, 1969 I was advised that there had been no interim report but that two reports had been issued, one of which had only been received recently. In May of this year I was told that the report was being studied. Sir, I deprecate this delay. I believe that if there was a suggestion in 1965 that there should be an interim report, there must have been a certain degree of urgency in this matter, and I believe that if an interim report had been submitted, possibly means could have been devised to overcome some of the obvious problems which exist in regard to the distribution and use of some of these dangerous insecticides. I feel that five years has been a long time. I am not alone in my concern because I know that the S.A. Timber Growers’ Association is also concerned; I know that the Women’s Agricultural Association is worried and I urge the Minister to give us some statement in connection with this report and to indicate that it is his intention as soon as possible to implement the recommendations contained in this-report.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it will not be taken amiss of me if I do not follow up what was said by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, because to-day I want to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister a matter which, to my mind, is of great topical interest, i.e. the long-felt want in respect of the scope of the existing medical aid schemes, especially as far as the farmers in the rural areas and our lower income groups are concerned. At present provision is being made for medical aid schemes by various employers’ organizations. The South African Railways, Iscor and other organizations also have compulsory schemes. For the purposes of my representations I want to classify our white population into four categories. The first category consists of those who are prosperous and who, from the nature of their income, meet their own medical expenses. The second category consists of old age pensioners, persons who receive maintenance allowance and who, by virtue of their financial inability to pay for their own medical services, receive free treatment. The third group consists of those whom I have just mentioned, persons who are covered and find security within these schemes to which they belong, to which they contribute and in return for which they are subsequently provided with services. The fourth group consists of those who fall outside the scope of the previous three categories. In respect of this group, in which I include the primary producer, the farmer of South Africa, as well as the middle and lower income groups, which account for the majority of the population, there is no-coverage whatsoever in this regard, except by means of the usual disability policies which may be taken out with insurance companies, but which from the nature of the case are expensive and do not meet this specific need. To them it is a financial nightmare to have serious illness in the household. It is for this section of our population that I want to break a lance this afternoon. It is unnecessary to emphasize the effects of steadily rising medical costs, doctors’ fees, hospital fees and particularly the costs involved in being admitted to private nursing homes and in under-going <span class="col_7001-7002" refersTo="page_0650"/>operations. To young people who have families and who do not belong to one of these existing schemes, this state of affairs, this worry, has really become a nightmare. Many people declare that it is cheaper to die than to be ill. To the rural farmer the long distance which separates his home from the nearest medical practitioner or from a hospital, is an important factor. The visit of a medical practitioner to a remote farm, the transport costs involved in being taken to hospitals and nursing homes, together with the inconvenience and financial implications involved, doubles the medical expenses for those people who do not have medical cover of some form or other. Often this is enough to ruin a beginner financially. Sir, it is hard to observe some of the cases of which I know, such as the case of a widow who receives an account of R600 for the treatment of her deceased husband and an account of R100 for the extraction of teeth and the provision of a new set of teeth. In fact, one has to go to the rural areas to witness the concern and fear felt by these people who do not have medical cover, before one can understand what this means. It is estimated that approximately 50 per cent of the population have been excluded from the existing schemes.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to risk asking the hon. the Minister to devote his attention to the establishment of a State-aided comprehensive medical aid scheme. What I mean here by &#x201C;comprehensive&#x201D;, is that although it is to be established for the primary purpose of covering illness, it should also be possible to extend it so as to cover a wider field, such as disability benefits; it could even include pension benefits. What one should really establish, is a medical aid and provident fund, as the English call it. For instance, I am thinking of a scheme such as the one which has just been introduced by Metlife. Its basis differs from those of other schemes since it is linked with growth units, etc., but its comprehensive basis of coverage may be used as an example. I also believe that the Central Council for Medical Schemes can assist in this regard in preparing a draft, because they can draw on their experience in regard to medical aid services of this nature. I believe that this would be practicable if a consortium of existing insurance companies could be persuaded to work out and undertake such a scheme on a basis similar to the one on which the consortium of companies is handling third-party motor insurance at present. Sir, time does not permit me to elaborate on this important matter. What gives young married couples and families in the lower and middle income groups and farmers in the rural areas the greatest cause for concern is, in the first place, the question of how they are going to meet unforeseen medical expenses; how they are going to keep their heads above water if they should suddenly become disabled as a result of an accident or a chronic indisposition; how they are going to make ends meet in their old age without a pension or with a small pension. In other words, they are concerned about illness, disability, and a pension for their old age. The insurance and security element of such a scheme would gradually accumulate and would only yield its best fruit in years to come. I know that the agricultural unions have already given thought to such a plan, and that representations have also been submitted to the Minister and that he did not see his way clear to establishing a national scheme, but I want to plead with him once again to devote attention to this matter again, because to my mind this want is a very real one. I believe that if the co-operation of existing insurance companies could be obtained, it would in fact be possible to work out a comprehensive and an effective scheme. It is at least worth the trouble to devote attention to it, and this would be a scheme which would benefit this section of the population which I mentioned and which has been excluded from existing schemes. The necessity in this regard is knocking at the hospitable door of our helpful Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like under this Vote to refer briefly to a world problem which is nonetheless a very serious one in our own country, a problem which I believe can only be dealt with by the Department which this Minister controls. I refer to the population explosion problem. Mr Chairman, this problem is the same everywhere, and that is that there is a very rapid increase taking place in the population amongst those who can least afford to rear their offspring. This in turn throws the burden on the State, which in effect is kept going by the minority. The result is further a shortage not only of food supplies but of other things which are so essential in a modern community, and here I am thinking of items such as housing, educational facilities, jobs, health services, etc.</p>

<from>Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, provision is made in the Estimates for a certain amount for family planning. That is the item which I am discussing. This fast increase results in the lowering of standards everywhere. It brings social problems such as nutritional diseases and many other problems. Many countries of the world have recognized this problem and even in some of the so-called under-developed and backward states steps have been taken to reduce this fast increase. We think, for example, of the spectacular results achieved in Japan, and we also read about the fine results achieved in countries like Pakistan and India, where very drastic measures are being taken, and even in a country like Egypt which is now embarking on a very big campaign in this direction.</p>

<p>Family planning to-day is a must in every country of the world. In South Africa we expect <span class="col_7003-7004" refersTo="page_0651"/>a population of 40 million or more by the end of this century, which means that in actual fact in the next 30 years we will more than double our present population. We ask ourselves whether we can feed and house and educate our population, and can we provide jobs for them? I must admit frankly that I do not think we can. If we cannot provide for this increase, what course is open to us? The course open to us, to my mind, is that we must reduce this very fast increase we are already suffering from a backlog in so many aspects of our national life, backlogs in housing and education, to mention only a couple.</p>

<p>I must at this stage make it clear that I do not think that this is a problem for only one race group or one section of the community, but unfortunately we find this increase to be greatest in the under-privileged and lower income groups of our population and we have to face the facts. These groups must be assisted to limit their families. One must further urge that assistance must be on a voluntary basis and not compulsory at all. Limitation of families is accepted by the vast majority. We hear that from welfare organizations and from persons dealing with this subject. Their only limiting factor is the shortage of funds.</p>

<p>Now I notice that in the Estimates provision has been made for a much larger sum of money for these services this year, namely R170,000 as compared to R100,000 last year, which shows that the Government is thinking in the right direction and is realizing the seriousness of the situation. But I maintain that more should be done. This is South Africa’s biggest problem. It is unfortunately a difficult and a delicate problem, but it must be solved. The solution is essential if we are to maintain our way of life. If this unchecked increase of the population is allowed, we shall have chaos not only in the economic and social spheres, but also on the political plane by the end of this century. We cannot close our eyes to this problem any longer. It is one of our most important problems, more important than apartheid or separate development and all the other problems we are struggling with here all the time. I must plead with the Minister that this problem must be faced, and that we must be bold and tackle it in a &#x201C;kragdadige&#x201D; way.</p>

<p>I hope the hon member for North Rand will forgive me if I do not follow his line of thought. I want to support the hon. member for Fauresmith in his plea for mentally and physically retarded people. In my constituency of Maitland there is the Alexandra Institute for mentally retarded children. I take a great deal of interest in that institution and I often go there, and I want to pay tribute to-day to the wonderful spirit of dedication and devotion to these poor children that I have seen there on the part of the medical and nursing staff. Everything possible is being done to make life pleasant for these children. I want to support the hon. member for Fauresmith in his plea to the Minister to take the initiative in training those unfortunate members of our population who cannot compete in the open labour market due to some physical impediment. I think a place should be found for them. Then I also want to appeal to the Minister to find a refuge and a place in society for those unfortunate people who are not mentally strong enough to be full citizens and to play their part as such, but who are not certifiable and therefore cannot be placed in homes. Something must be done to train them and to find some refuge for them.</p>

<p>I want to speak about what seems to me the Cinderella of the medical profession. I speak obviously as a layman and we all have the utmost admiration for Dr. Barnard and for the Groote Schuur Hospital and for what we have achieved in surgery and medicine. There is always public acclaim on the front pages of the Press for these doctors and it is right that it should be so, but I want to refer briefly to the problems of mental health, which is one of the greatest problems of illness. Mental illness is looked upon as one of the greatest problems of health in the world to-day. We know that at least 10 per cent of our population suffers in one way or another from mental disease or mental deviation An investigation made by Dr. Gilles in the Western Cape amongst our Coloured people in 1965 showed that 11.8 per cent of our Coloured people suffered from some form of mental deviation, and yet according to a statement in this House in 1967 by the hon. member for Brentwood, there are only 24,000 beds for the mentally ill in South Africa, mostly for the serious cases, and there are only 80 psychiatrists. So it is quite obvious that nothing really adequate can be done to help these people. It must be realized that mental illness is just illness like cancer or heart disease, and anyone can suffer from it. I want to appeal for more funds to combat this problem and for greater attention to be devoted to it.</p>

<p>Then there is a stigma attached to a mental hospital. I know people who know they should go for treatment, but they are afraid to go because of the stigma attached to it. I know of people who come back from mental hospitals and find that their families are ashamed of them because of this stigma. I think the Press should play its part in educating the public to accept the proper medical view that mental illness is just illness and has to be treated as such. These people should be looked after in every way. I know there is a shortage of land, but in my constituency there is the old institution of Valkenburg with plenty of land. The building is very old and the facilities do not seem to be adequate, but I want to appeal to the Minister to consider building a modern mental hospital on those grounds which will appeal to psychiatrists and other doctors to join that part of the profession and which will attract nurses to go and work there. I have had constant complaints <span class="col_7005-7006" refersTo="page_0652"/>that nurses do not want to work there because the facilities are inadequate.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>There are two matters in regard to our mursing services which I should like to bring to the notice of the hon the Minister. They deal with one central idea, i.e. the status of our nurses. Thanks to the nursing techniques of to-day and thanks to the medicine which is available, more lives are being saved to-day than has ever been the case before. Diseases which a generation ago caused the death of the patient, are being dealt with effectively to-day. Patients who a decade or so ago would perhaps have died or become total invalids, are to-day enabled to return home, after being in hospital, as people who can lead a normal life. I say that in spite of all these things which are happening, this phenomenal progress in the sphere of health services, the position is that the status of our nurses has not been enhanced accordingly. The status of the nurse is still being associated with the idea that the nurse is a person who has to sweep hospital wards, fetch and carry food and put thermometers into the mouths of patients. But circumstances have changed completely. This is no longer the position. In her own right the nurse at present is really the substitute for the doctor at the bedside of the patient for whom she is responsible. In addition to that we must bear in mind that our nurses come from the very best homes of South Africa. If one looks at the background of our nurses, one finds that 47 per cent of them come from our farming community, 33 per cent from the ranks of the administrative staff, etc., and 20 per cent from the ranks of professional people. In other words, they represent the best human material we have in South Africa. Because of that background and because of their keenness to render their very best to the profession they love, and because of the fact that we have also created at our universities more extensive facilities for the training of our nurses, we find that at present a greater number of them have degrees and that it is no longer at all possible to refer to them as people who sweep wards, as though that were the only purpose for which they were any good.</p>

<p>But although this is the case, what do we find in practice. We find that for the purpose of determining salaries, the Public Service Commission is using a formula based on a Std. 8 school certificate, which is no longer valid in the nursing profession to-day. A very small percentage of the people who follow this profession to-day only have a Std. 8 certificate. In fact, the position is that in 1956 824 pupils started at four training schools.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>All right, Sir, I shall come back to the Vote, you will be glad to hear. There are two other matters I want to raise with the hon. the Minister. One has to do with a matter raised earlier on by the hon. member for North Rand. I want, to some considerable extent, to support his plea for the extension of family planning. I did this last year, but the hon. the Minister was then not in charge of this portfolio. I think it is possible that one may now have a more sympathetic reception. I notice from the Estimates that the amount to be voted in respect of this particular item has increased by R70,000. I am very pleased about that. However, not only the voting of money for personnel, clinics, etc. is required here. There also has to be a new attitude to the propaganda one finds in this connection. I have had it drawn to my attention by social workers that there is considerable resentment in the non-white section of the country, because of the emphasis which is always placed on the need for family planning in the non-white groups. Propaganda which is made, talks which are given and newspaper items which appear are always directed at family planning for the non-white group. It is absolutely clear, of course, that the non-Whites largely represent the lower income groups, and therefore it is necessary that family planning be carried out essentially in these groups. There are also, however, lower income groups among the white people. Family planning is just as urgently required among these groups. The point I am trying to make is that one should use a little psychology in this regard; otherwise it becomes a sort of political matter with these people and this should not be the case. This should be something which is essentially presented to them for their own benefit, in order to improve the conditions of living of these non-white families. I should just like to bring this to the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The other question I want to raise, which is of very great importance indeed, is the whole question of malnutrition in South Africa. Of course, the family planning aspect is tied up here, because it is a well-known fact that the higher the standard of living, the fewer children in a family, and therefore the better chances there are that malnutrition will not occur in a family with fewer children.</p>

What is disgraceful about this situation is not the issuing of a pamphlet. What is disgraceful, are the figures in regard to malnutrition in this country. I may say that these figures do not come from any political party. They were supplied as a result of a survey carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which can hardly be considered a liberalistic organization. I have an official issue of the <i>South African Medical Journal,</i> which is devoted to the whole subject of malnutrition in South Africa. The figures revealed here are scandalous for a country with the resources we have. I see from the Estimates that we are voting the same amount as was voted last year, namely R90,000, for subsidies payable to local and Bantu authorities on skimmed milk powder. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that this is not nearly enough.</p>

[Interjections.] I shall be grateful if, when I am making a speech, he will be quiet. The point I am making with the hon. the Minister is that this amount is not enough, and that not enough is done to persuade local authorities to take advantage of this scheme either. It has been shown beyond doubt by medical experts that kwashiorkor could be wiped out almost immediately in South Africa if a half pint of skimmed milk per child daily were available. This involves a further distribution of skimmed milk. It involves the stopping of this ghastly waste, as described by articles in newspapers, <span class="col_7009-7010" refersTo="page_0654"/>where millions of gallons of skimmed milk are thrown away. If we cannot dehydrate the milk, and if the facilities are not available, for heavens sake let us arrange some form of distribution. We have cut out school feeding, and this should be reintroduced. One meal a day for the poorer children of this country of all races, but more particularly for this group, since this is the class affected by kwashiorkor, and the distribution of dried skimmed milk powder, or fresh skimmed milk, would wipe out this ghastly disease almost overnight. Our figures are really disgraceful, for a country which prides itself of being a developed, modern, industrial country. The figures are nearly as bad as those for some of the most underdeveloped areas in Africa and in India.</p>

<p>There are figures, gathered by means of surveys by doctors, for a typical reserve in the Northern Transvaal, showing that about half the children who are born, die before they are five years of age. These figures have been compiled by doctors. I shall give this article to the hon. member to read. He will then see what I am talking about. This state of affairs is brought about largely as a result of malnutrition, and the fact that children who suffer from malnutrition are particularly susceptible to infective diseases and gastro-enteritis, which is also a great killer in South Africa. Coloured children, too, are particularly susceptible to kwashiorkor and pellagra. In 1968, for some reason or other, it was decided that kwashiorkor should no longer be a notifiable disease. I asked a question about this, and the only explanation that was ever given was the one given by the Under-Secretary for Health, which was published in an interview with <i>Die Burger,</i> where he said: &#x201C;The disease is now completely under control and there is therefore no reason why kwashiorkor should remain a notifiable disease&#x201D;. Sir, by any stretch of the imagination, and bearing in mind the survey which was carried out by the C.S.I.R., and the survey carried out by doctors, who produced this special medical journal on malnutrition, can we possibly say that kwashiorkor is under control and that there is no reason why it should be a notifiable disease? I want to ask the hon. the Minister, who is a doctor, unlike his predecessor, and who can understand what I am talking about, to reintroduce the regulation making it necessary to notify kwashiorkor, because only in that way will we be able to know the magnitude of the disease we are trying to combat. I want to point out that kwashiorkor has irreversible repercussions. If a child has suffered from kwashiorkor in the early years of his life, no matter how well-fed he is later on, he has suffered brain damage that cannot be reversed. This means a retarded population and a non-productive population. We are laying in store enormous problems for the future, if we do not tackle this disease now. It can be tackled cheaply and without much difficulty, because it is easily rectified by nutritional means such as fortified food and skimmed milk. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Why was that allegation made? That is not intended for South African consumption. It is done so that the outside world may know that although apparently everything is peaceful here, this is the world’s second Biafra. [Interjections.] I asked the hon. member whether she had any particulars. She replied that there were particulars. I want to tell hon. members the following: In conjunction with the Department, the National Nutrition Research Institute&#x2014;i.e. in regard to the Bantu in Johannesburg&#x2014;sent a questionnaire to all medical practitioners. Valuable information was collected from 200 medical practitioners and published during 1966. Out of a grand total of 195,175 Bantu and Coloureds representing all age groups, 1.6 per cent suffered from pellagra Out of the <span class="col_7011-7012" refersTo="page_0655"/>94,433 Bantu and Coloured patients&#x2014;not all of them, only the patients&#x2014;under the age of 12 years, only 7.4 per cent suffered from a protein-calorie deficiency. And then the hon. member speaks of malnutrition. She claims that they do not get enough to eat. There are many people who in fact eat too much and may still suffer from malnutrition. There are thousands of them. One cannot five on poridge alone. One has to add milk to it. One has to eat vegetables and meat.</p>

<p>But that is not all. According to this inquiry the incidence of malnutrition in general is estimated at approximately 4 per cent. I shall mention examples. In Johannesburg a special study was made of 5,000 young children under the age of five years. It was found that only 3.8 per cent of this representative group suffered from kwashiorkor.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member does not even know what &#x201C;kwashiorkor&#x201D; means. She referred to powdered milk. In 1966 almost 10 per cent of Krugersdorp’s Bantu children between the ages of six months and five years were treated for kwashiorkor. The incidence of this deficiency disease has shown a considerable decrease. At the end of 1968 only 70 children still needed powdered milk. This is the survey that was made in Johannesburg. She could have obtained this information before they littered the streets of Cape Town with this smear pamphlet. She could have asked the secretary about this. Surveys made in Johannesburg by the unban health staff, confirmed by consulting specialists in internal diseases, show that deficiency diseases are found amongst 5 to 10 per cent of the adult Bantu. Does this amount to 67 per cent who do not get enough to eat?</p>

<p>And then they add another statement to this. I loathe their making an instrument of political propaganda out of death and disease. They say: &#x201C;50 per cent of the Bantu children in the Peninsula die before their fifth year.&#x201D; Does this not amount to saying to the outside world, &#x201C;This is a Biafra&#x201D;? After all, we do have registration of births and deaths. What are the real figures: In 1967 96.4 deaths per 1.000 of the total number of infants born in the Cape Peninsula area were registered. They claim that 50 per cent of them die. The corrected figure for 1967, according to the Department, came to 13 per cent. Is this a death rate of 50 per cent?</p>

<p>That was in 1967. In 1968 there was a further improvement in the position. The infant death-rate for 1968 was 72.6 per 1,000 births. Approximately 8 per cent of them died before they reached the age of five years. Is that 50 per cent? After all, it is possible for one to correlate that figure. Every death has to be registered. It is possible for one to obtain the statistics. But all births are not registered. If one has the real birth-rate, that percentage will be even less. The hon. member knows that. And yet she still comes forward with these banal statements.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down, dealt with a pamphlet issued by the Progressive Party which I have not seen. I am, therefore, not in a position to say whether I agree or disagree with the figures. But I want to say to the hon. member that it is common knowledge that more than one university institution in South Africa have issued figures to show that the poverty datum line of the Bantu is round about 70 per cent. If this is so, I believe that it does somewhat support the statement that malnutrition in South Africa stands at a higher figure than any country could be satisfied with.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister something entirely different. It concerns the question of ambulance services throughout South Africa. The hon. the Minister has received a report from Lions in regard to ambulance services. I am not aware of whether he has had time to study this report or pass it on to the necessary authorities. I should like to add my plea to that of the Lions in their report by reminding the hon. the Minister and this Committee of one or two matters relating to ambulance services. The first report was sent to the then Minister of Health in 1963. The report asked for a commission to be appointed to investigate the whole aspect of ambulance services throughout the Republic of South Africa. It was suggested at that time that a commission be formed consisting of representatives from the provinces, local authorities, medical schools and all bodies interested in this particular aspect. Nothing has come of this report. That is why I raise the matter to-day to add my plea to that of the memorandum submitted to the hon. the Minister. The facts of the matter are quite clear. Within the ten-year period, ending in 1961, deaths in road accidents came to over 207 per cent. Injured people came to 160 per cent. That is an increase over the previous period. In respect of vehicles on the road the increase amounted to 91 per cent. It is obvious that something has to be done in this respect. By its very nature it cannot be done by small local authorities. It is something that has to be done by the Department itself. The department <span class="col_7013-7014" refersTo="page_0656"/>will have to co-ordinate the whole aspect in regard to this matter. I suppose it will be quite right to say that the road accident rate in South Africa is probably one of the highest in the world. It is a certainly among the highest in the world.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be better if we drove a little more to the left than to the right. I do not intend to go into this aspect with this particular hon. Minister, but I should like to question the fact whether our ambulance services have kept up to date with the increase in vehicles and the increase in the number of accidents in South Africa. I should like to point out to the hon. the Minister one or two aspects of this. In recent months we have had on the Reef the position that there have been disputes as to which ambulance would attend to a particular accident. I do not believe that this can be sorted out by anybody else except the hon. the Minister. We have had cases where people lay injured at the scene of an accident for hours while local authorities were trying to sort out whose responsibility it was. We have had the ease where the wrong ambulance for the wrong race group had been sent to the scene of an accident, with the result that the injured person was left lying there as well. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that as far as I am concerned, this is carrying apartheid to rather callous extremes. If anybody I know is involved in an accident, my feeling is, no matter what ambulance comes along, that the first ambulance which arrives on the scene, can take them to wherever they have to go.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Not only is it silly, but it is callous and cruel to the persons who are injured. I think it is about time that the hon. the Minister’s Department gave specific instructions on this matter. If anybody is injured, then for heaven’s sake, get him to the nearest place of attention, regardless of the ambulance and whether it is pink, white, blue or yellow. There are other aspects in regard to ambulance services about which the Minister will know, as they are contained in the memorandum sent to him. In London an ambulance can reach the scene of an accident in an area of 117 square miles in seven minutes. It can return to hospital within 14 minutes. In New York within 320 square miles an ambulance can reach the scene of an accident in 10 or 15 minutes. The hon. the Minister knows, and I am sure everybody in this Committee knows, that in the largest cities of South Africa it is impossible for an ambulance to reach the scene of an accident and return to the hospital, particularly in peak hours, in anything under two or three hours. This is not unusual. It happens in all our cities. It is nobody’s fault, but I do believe that it is up to the Minister’s Department to have an investigation into the matter to see what can be done. The hon. the Minister knows, as well as I do. that on some of our busier roads, particularly the main road between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, people who have been seriously injured in accidents may, because of the distance involved and the time factor in getting through busy traffic at peak hours, lie on the side of the road for three or four hours. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that only he can look into this matter in a proper light. If this was done I am quite sure that if the co-operation of the Army and the Police could be obtained, a helicopter ambulance service could be made available on these main arterial roads. I do not suggest for one moment that each local authority could afford to have a helicopter ambulance, but if some arrangement was made with the Police or the Army where these helicopters are based, I am quite sure that they would be only too willing to cart these injured people to hospital when they are injured in areas which are inaccessible or some distance away from a hospital. I do not believe that local authorities can any longer afford to finance the very expensive ambulance services that they have to maintain. I do not know of any city in South Africa that can any longer afford to maintain these big ambulance fleets at the expense of the ratepayer. I believe that this commission of inquiry set up by the hon. the Minister could go into the whole aspect of ambulance services, the training of their crews, the equipment of the ambulances and whether, for instance, ambulances should have a two-way radio so that they could be diverted to emergencies when on its way to less urgent cases. I leave these thoughts with the hon. the Minister, hoping that after this long period of delay some action will be taken in this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, having listened to the hon. member for Waterberg this afternoon, I simply cannot help saying that when Mary Tudor was alive there were still no remedies for migraine. If every <span class="col_7015-7016" refersTo="page_0657"/>body knows migraine as we who suffer from it do, it is no wonder to me that they eventually decapitated her in desperation. I wonder whether to-day that is not still the only effective treatment.</p>

<p>In the last few seconds of this rapidly moving debate I just want to call attention to a few aspects. The Department of Health has, <i>inter alia,</i> two very important functions, i.e. to prepare and publish reports and statistics or other data relating to public health and, amongst other things, also to promote public health. Until recently the approach in medical science was to cure people and to prevent diseases, but not to promote good health. Here I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Durban (Central) said. Good health enhances the productivity and the usefulness of our people in society. We do not always appreciate this. The onslaughts made by medical science has resulted in our conquering infectious and many other diseases. To-day we have in actual fact become obsessed with technical skills in surgery. But in society we have to do with numerous semi-healthy persons. We still find a tremendously great deal of under-nourishment and malnutrition amongst our people. In addition there are many other abuses as regards the health of our people to which we are, to my mind, not devoting the necessary attention at this particular stage and in regard to which people are still ignorant. That is why some of the most common epidemic and infectious diseases are still so commonly found amongst our people. They are still found, in particular, amongst our non-Whites in the Bantu communities. As far as I am concerned, the alarming fact is that amongst members of our white population who maintain a tremendously high standard of living in an era of good living, we still find that we have in the form of malignant diseases, cirrhosis of the liver and mental diseases, major factors cutting off the lives of many. As far as heart diseases are concerned, approximately 35 per cent of our men die in the most productive period of their lives in one specific year. In one year’s time 4,283 men, of whom many were still in their prime, died in South Africa. As against that 2,232 women died. Many of these deaths could have been prevented or delayed if there had only been a little elementary knowledge about the prevention of heart diseases and a better way of life for promoting good health. I want to express the thought to-day that we should, as a matter of national importance, give top priority to a planned system of health guidance aimed at the improvement and the maintenance of good health, physically and mentally. I regard this as one of the most important functions of our Department, since the medical professional group of people who are responsible for sick people would always prefer to go in for the healing and surgical aspects. This problem was mentioned as far back as 1959, in the first interim report of the Borekenhagen Commission. This brings me to my main theme, i.e. that the State should endeavour, by means of a comprehensive guidance service, to make our public more health conscious. I have merely to think of the large number of our members of Parliament who regularly avail themselves of lifts in order to reach the third or fourth floor. They can promote their health and make better use of their time by merely spending that extra half minute on regularly making use of the stairs.</p>

<p>The most appropriate time is now, because public attention is concentrated to-day on medical science and its miracles, even though it is on the more dramatic aspect of medical science. In that respect I think that we are not concentrating on the best aspect of medical knowledge: the aspect which can give good health and which will prevent us from having to deal later on with a large number of semi-healthy people. So many men in the prime of their lives are disappearing while they still look healthy. This is the kind of robust health which already carries the seeds of ruin in it. We must foresee and plan for phenomena such as under-nourishment and malnutrition. In my plea for guidance I am also advocating planning in respect of our health services and that we have regard to problems such as the increase in population and family planning, which are of course connected with this matter. In the year 2000 we shall probably have a population of approximately 40 million in South Africa.</p>

<p>Actually, I want to conclude with this, because our time is limited. I know that the State is doing its duty in this regard. I know that various departments are doing their duty in regard to health and guidance, such as the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of National Education, and also the Department of Bantu Administration. But these are fragmentary guidance services. I should like to see an integrated health guidance service being introduced, with full utilization of the mass media we have at present, namely the Press, the radio and films. The Whites will derive greater benefit from this. But the non-Whites are also listening more readily to the radio, although at this stage the Bantu will not yet be able to derive full benefit from that. In conclusion I want to congratulate the Department of Health on the training of health guidance officers and health educators in the Bantu areas. I think 27 of them qualified last year. These people are doing very good work. But, in conclusion, I am asking for this integrated organization which will disseminate information on an expert basis to all strata of our community. I think that if we do it in this way, we shall be making proper use of these instruments, and we shall be performing an important national task which will yield many dividends, not only to-day, but also in the future in a country in which we cannot afford to lose one member <span class="col_7017-7018" refersTo="page_0658"/>of our white labour force, i.e. one who could be healthy.</p>

<p>There are one or two matters I want to raise with the hon. the Minister. The one is a perennial, but it is unlike the perennial which is planted in my home garden, because the one I wish to refer to does not seem to flower. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can give us some information as to what is happening about this nursing commission. The hon. the Minister knows that it was appointed in 1964 by his predecessor and it had the task to investigate the conditions of the training of nurses. I have asked questions each year as to when this commission is likely to report. I think the last information I had from the hon. the Minister was that he hoped to get the report during April or May of this year. We have reached the end of May, but I doubt whether he has got the report. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister to sack the Commission and to do this job himself, because it is an important matter and it is a matter which should be attended to.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>They are doing very good work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Well, after five years, we have seen nothing. If we had a report, we should have known that something has been done at least.</p>

<p>The other matter the hon. the Minister has referred to before, and which we discussed last year, is the review of the powers and control of various health services, following from the Borckenhagen and Schumann Commissions reports. Can the hon. the Minister tell us how far that is progressing? Last year it was promised that a White Paper was being prepared and that the information would be laid before the House, but 12 months have elapsed and we have not received anything. Then I am going to lodge my third complaint in regard to a certain matter. I want to tell the hon. Minister that it would help the work of this House considerably if we can have the report of the Secretary for Health for the preceding year before we discuss this Vote. It is not much use to us if we receive this report in the recess because the figures are out of date and the information is out of date by the time we come to discuss the Vote in Parliament the following year.</p>

<p>Then I want to mention another matter to the hon. the Minister, and it is a matter concerning all of us who are in some way connected with hospitals. There seems to be growing an extreme pressure on hospitals in so far as services to out-patients are concerned. I raise this with the hon. the Minister because I believe that it is due to some extent, if not to a very great extent, to the fact that there is no adequate buffer in so far as preventative medicine is concerned, between the home and the hospital. When one gets the situation, as we have now at the Groote Schuur Hospital for instance, where there are 2,000 out-patients per day, it is becoming an impossible task to handle them. The provinces are finding this difficulty, and many of the people who come there could well have been dealt with by district nurses or dealt with in some way at their homes so that they did not have to come to the hospitals. One of the reasons for this is, I suggest, a shortage of staff. I want to raise one matter with the Minister and I hope he will go into it. There are many nurses who do not wish to continue in hospitals and who after their three years training period give up their jobs. They could be well absorbed by the preventative medical nursing services, which fall under this Minister. That includes home nursing, school nursing, the inspecting of schools, and district nursing, and I believe that not sufficient help is given to those women to do what is a post-training course, namely a course in public health nursing. If a nurse qualifies in a provincial hospital and then goes on to do a course at the technical colleges in public health, she is given paid leave in which to do the course. If she desires to take the course, after a short period of retirement from nursing services. I understand that a small grant is paid to her something like R520 per annum. She is paid that amount for the purpose of undertaking that course. My inquiries have indicated to me that the technical college fees and exam fees amount to about R200 per annum. The woman who wishes to take up district nursing is then left with the small amount of R300 with which to sustain herself, clothe herself, provide for travelling and so forth, during the period of training.</p>

<p>There is a great demand for these Public Health trained nurses and I am sure that one would be able to attract a large number of married women, women who cannot find the time to do normal hospital nursing but who would be available for the Minister’s Department to undertake this type of work. I hone that the hon. the Minister will give thought and attention to this matter and indicate what he has in mind to try to stimulate this aspect of training.</p>

<p>Then there is a final matter which I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister and that is whether he is satisfied that there is a sufficiently comprehensive plan for medical inspections at schools. The hon. the Minister shakes his head Perhaps this is not a matter which falls directly under him.</p>

<p>The Minister of Health as such, at the present moment, is concerning himself with the co-ordination of health services throughout the country and I wonder whether he is satisfied that this very important aspect of national health is being sufficiently attended to. After all, it is quite simple for the Minister, if he feels that it is not being sufficiently attended to, to co-ordinate it with the general preventive health measures for which he is responsible. I think the Minister will agree with me that one of the most important preventive health measures is to check disease in every possible field at the earliest possible moment. I should like the hon. the Minister to give us his views in regard to this aspect of medical services.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank hon. members who referred to my appointment as Minister of Health. I may just say in passing that it is a very pleasant task to perform. I can remember very well that when I came here in 1953 I was the only medical doctor on this side of the House, and that on the other side of the House there were only two. Dr. Steytler and Dr. Zac de Beer, and two dentists, the Shearer brothers. To-day we have a much better situation in the House, which I welcome.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point referred to the report of the Secretary for Health. It is quite true that the report has not been made available for quite some considerable time. I would like to inform the hon. member that the Afrikaans text of the report for the two-year period 1965-’67 is at the moment being printed, and I hope that the English text will reach the Government Printer by next week. I do not think that it will be ready to be laid on the Table this Session, but the report for 1967-’69 is already in the process of being prepared, and that report as well as the report for 1965-’67 will be laid upon the Table next session, with the result that we will then have the reports up to date.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I think that would greatly assist hon. members in discussing the Vote. Sir, the hon. member then mentioned the Borckenhagen and Schumann reports. The White Paper is being prepared, but I am not in a position to say whether it will be made available during this Session. I would like to give the hon. member the assurance that as far as I know it will definitely be available next session. With regard to the report of the Commission on Nursing, the position is that this commission has been sitting for quite some time. It has covered a very wide field. I have twice had discussions with the chairman, and I was promised the report by April, but apparently they had some difficulty in getting hold of one or two members who were overseas; so it seems to me that the report will not be available this Session either.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Durban (Central). The hon. member raised the question of the Public Health Act of 1919 and expressed the opinion that the time is long overdue for that Act to be consolidated, I can assure the hon. member that that is also the view of this Department and we intend tackling this job as soon as a decision is taken on the recommendations contained in the Borckenhagen and Schumann reports. It would be foolish to re-write and consolidate the Act before a decision is taken on those recommendations.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member raised the question of air pollution which, of course, is a very important matter. I should like to tell the hon. member that the National Advisory Committee on Air Pollution has been very active since its establishment some three years ago. It held 18 meetings to organize its work and there are a number of sub-committees working as well. Their approach to the problem has been to solicit the co-operation of local authorities and industrialists, and to that end propaganda has been undertaken in the form of film shows, newspaper articles, seminars and personal visits to industrialists by the chairman and the technical staff. This, of course, is a tremendous job. In order to become <i>au fait</i> with the latest developments in this field both the chairman and other members of the board paid visits overseas on, I think, two occasions. The committee’s activities have been carried out in close co-operation with other Government Departments and attention has also been given to the training of personnel in controlling smoke and similar nuisances. Hon. members will realize that trained personnel to do this have not been available in South Africa. I must say that the hon. member for Durban (Central) has not been so forthcoming about Durban, because his own city is certainly the city that has done most in regard to this question of combating air pollution, and I am very grateful to the authorities there for what they have done up to now. Several areas have already been declared to be smoke-controlled zones under the Act, and a set of smoke-controlled regulations has been drawn up for the guidance of local authorities.</p>

<p>The other question which he stressed is the question of fumes from diesel engines. In this connection the National Air Pollution Advisory Committee has decided that this aspect of air pollution, purely for technical reasons, should be dealt with under the provincial traffic ordinances, and the proposed traffic regulations in respect of diesel vehicles will shortly be referred to the inter-provincial advisory council.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Gordonia mentioned the question of too little exercise, as well as <span class="col_7021-7022" refersTo="page_0660"/>the question of coronary diseases. As the hon. member knows a symposium was held in Pretoria on 12th and 13th August of last year in which many leading authorities from abroad and also of our own country participated. It was a very good symposium, and one of the things which emerged very clearly there, was that there are a multitude of factors influencing the incidence of coronary heart diseases. I do not want to enter into the details now, but hon. members may be interested to know what the recommendations were. One of the recommendations was that people who are susceptible to coronary heart diseases should be identified at an early age by means of clinical and biochemical examinations, and that special attention should be paid to persons with a family history of coronary heart disease, such as myself, in whose case hereditary metabolic factors may play a part; secondly that these susceptible groups should be encouraged by means of guidance to avoid a diet which is rich in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates; to control the weight carefully; to do regular physical exercises; to alleviate mental stress by partaking in regular pastimes and recreation; and to smoke fewer cigarettes. It is rather interesting that it is recommended here that people should smoke less and that smoking is not prohibited altogether. In the third place it is recommended that research into coronary heart disease be undertaken in the Republic of South Africa, especially because the diversity of population groups lends itself excellent to such research. I am sure that this aspect will also receive attention as soon as the new Medical Research Board comes into operation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Port Natal raised the question of ambulance services and referred to a letter from the Lions organization. We have already replied to this letter. May I say to the hon. member that one of the difficulties, or perhaps the main difficulty, in regard to ambulance services is the many authorities responsible for providing ambulance services. In saying that I am not in any way implying that local authorities, the provincial administrations and our own Department are not doing excellent work, but when you have divided control you have the sort of difficulties that we run into in practice. The hon. member also referred to what he called &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; in ambulance services. Let me say immediately that there are very good reasons&#x2014;and I do not propose to go into those reasons at the moment&#x2014;why the provincial administrations and the local authorities and our own Department and all concerned, have separate ambulances for the different racial groups. There are very good reasons for it and this practice must be continued. But may I also say that it is not in conflict with Government policy at all, in case of emergency, to use whatever ambulance is available.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Brentwood quoted striking figures here in regard to the question of the so-called under-nourishment. Mr. Chairman, I call it &#x201C;so-called under-nourishment or malnutrition&#x201D; in South Africa, because if one would just keep one’s eyes open one would realize that nutrition in South Africa is on a much higher level than it is in many other countries of the world. The attempt made by the hon. member for Houghton to compare the malnutrition conditions in South Africa with conditions in India is quite unfair, but it links up, of course, with the figures appearing in the pamphlet from which the hon. member for Brentwood quoted.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I should like to read out to the hon. member what the position is with regard to malnutrition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the Cape is concerned, based on the latest statistics available &#x2026;</block>

<p>this is from the Regional Director of the State Health Service&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the number of Bantu dying during the first five years of life was calculated as follows: Cape Town Municipality, 1967, 12.8 per cent &#x2026;</block>

<p>not 50 per cent&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; 1968, 8 per cent; Cape Town Divisional Council, 1968, 36 per cent; Paarl Municipality, 15.4 per cent; Paarl Divisional Council, 15.2 per cent; Stellenbosch Divisional Council, 15.4 per cent; the Divisional Council of Worcester, 44 per cent.</block>

<p>That is very high.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is very high, but I think it is reasonable to say that the two figures for the Cape Town Divisional Council and the Divisional Council of Worcester must be unreliable because the figures for the others are so much lower. I may point out to the hon. member that in all the calculations, except in the case of the Cape Town Municipality, where corrections have already been made for births not registered with the Divisional Council, no allowance has been made for births not registered. These are not inconsiderable and make the figures unreliable. In contrast, all deaths are notified, and this can give an exaggerated picture of the number of deaths. In other words, the figures that I quoted here, <span class="col_7023-7024" refersTo="page_0661"/>if anything, must be lower. I think it is doing South Africa a great disservice to say that 50 per cent of children die before reaching the age of five years. There is no truth in that whatsoever. On this question of malnutrition I may also give this information as far as Tuberculosis is concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In regard to the subject of the possible relationship that an improved nutritional standard may have on tuberculosis, it is generally accepted that the level of nutrition, and more especially the protein intake, is related to the susceptibility of the individual to tuberculosis, to the spread of the disease in a community and to the progression of the disease in undiagnosed cases.</block>

<p>That has been the assumption all these years. In this connection I wish to state that during the past 10 years the World Health Organization and the British Medical Research Council have clearly demonstrated that the diet is unimportant, both in response to treatment and in the occurrence or relapse of tuberculosis. To me that is quite an astonishing finding. The factor of overriding importance is the prevention of the disease by isolation of intense cases, and the administration of effective therapy for an adequate period of time.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member, and also the hon. member for North Rand, raised the question of family planning. May I say that family planning in South Africa is strictly on a voluntary basis and I can assure the hon. member that it will remain that way. Secondly, it is very necessary, especially in regard to the non-Whites, to have their own people advising and instructing them in regard to family planning. Family planning in South Africa is done solely for health reasons. My Department will not touch anything that is done for any other reason, but that does not mean that there is not a great demand and a great necessity for family planning in South Africa. I may say that we have prepared films on this subject which will be shown both to the non-white communities and to the white inhabitants of the Republic. But there can be no question of compulsion whatever.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred me to the S.A. Medical Association and the leading article&#x2014;I have it in my pocket&#x2014;in regard to the differentiation in salary scales of Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu. Of course this is not a question to be discussed here because this is not the appropriate time, but I invite the hon. member to raise this issue later in the Session when an opportunity therefor will arise, because I would like an opportunity to reply in full on this question of the differentiation in salaries, which I think is very necessary.</p>

<p>Well, we will have another sort of miniature Budget debate before the end of the Session, but we can in any case have a discussion before the end of the Session.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Springs mentioned a few problems in connection with the nurses. He confined himself to the status of the nurses, and I may just say that the hon. member spoke about this matter because he knew what he was talking about, as he has been a member of the Nursing Council for many years, and I am grateful for the work he is doing there. I fully agree that every possible opportunity should be used to raise the status of the nurses. I may just say that this has in fact come about in recent years, because, as you know, we already have two faculties of nursing: at the University of Pretoria and at the University of Bloemfontein. I am grateful that he touched upon this and that this has come to the fore once again, because I think that if there is one profession which deserves the highest respect of the public it is the nursing profession.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Maitland raised the question of mental illness, and from what he said, it was quite evident to me that he had a thorough grasp of what it is all about. The hon. member is quite right in saying that there should be no stigma attached to a person who has had treatment for mental illness of some kind, because, after all, the percentage of complete cures is very high indeed these days. I should like to take this opportunity to encourage everybody who needs this treatment, or members of their families, to undergo psychiatric treatment. The hon. member did not raise this, but I might tell him that in regard to the Brooklyn Chest Hospital, which he raised with me on previous occasions, we might be able to assist him, because that is a very good hospital. But the fact that it caters for non-Whites in a white residential area is, of course, against Government policy, and something will have to be done about that in the near future.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know which institution the hon. member is referring to, but if the hon. member will let us have the names we will go into the matter and let him know. I may say to the hon. member that in regard to psychiatric treatment, the hospitals being planned in the Bantu homelands will not be hospitals for psychiatric patients but ordinary hospitals, but one hospital will cater for both and there will be a psychiatric section in the general hospital, which I think is also a step in the direction of the hon. member’s contention.</p>

<p><span class="col_7025-7026" refersTo="page_0662"/>*The hon. member for North Rand actually spoke about an agricultural matter, the population explosion. He also mentioned the question of family planning, to which I replied when replying to the hon. member for Houghton. I may just tell the hon. member that we feel very strongly about the fact that the guidance given to the various race groups should be given by their own people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Marico made me feel very good, because if he looks at Hansard, vol. 82, col. 661, of 1953, he will see that the theme of his speech is exactly the same as that of my maiden speech in this House. But we have come a long way since those days. I am glad this has come from an hon. member representing a rural area, because he asked whether there could not be any medical schemes for the farming community, which is not provided for at present, and he pointed out that for a young married couple, or even for other people, it was a nightmare to think of their possibly being ruined financially as a result of protracted illness. In that there was no reflection on the people who have to provide the services, but he expressed his concern very clearly. I may just tell him that the Medical Schemes Act is not there to establish schemes, but to exercise control over schemes and to see to it that the benefits for members are provided in such a way that the members are not exploited. As regards the farming community, I know that the agricultural unions are working on this, and the Orange Free State already has a scheme for the farmers of the Free State, through the agency of the Free State Agricultural Union. It is no longer merely a proposed scheme; it has become an accomplished fact there, and I hope it will also be extended, and I want to encourage this, to all the provinces and all the farmers in the country. The hon. member spoke about a State-aided, comprehensive medical scheme. I may tell him the answer to that is no, because we have made enormous progress with the provision of schemes where the contributions of the members are sufficient to cover all costs which could possibly result in financial ruin. If the hon. member has specific problems in this connection now, there is in any event the possibility at this stage of obtaining medical insurance. My own family and I have carried this for many years now, for almost 12 years.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not so expensive. For my wife, my four children, and myself I am paying R13 per month, and it even covers dental services and medicine. It is an individual scheme, and I may just say that we were covered even for the three years we were in London. I realize that the premium is not very low, but I want to point out to hon. members that the costs of medical services, and of the apparatus used, are so enormously high these days that only one little illness sends R13 down the drain. The salvation of our people lies in medical insurance under some scheme or other. If we can achieve the position that the entire population is covered by it, then we shall have prevented the evil of a State medical service in South Africa, which is something that I can never allow in this country.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Berea spoke about drug distribution and the potentially harmful drugs distributed by unregistered persons, and he gave us some very interesting facts. I might tell the hon. member that since we last discussed this matter it is now being considered by the S.A. Pharmaceutical Council and my Department and I are awaiting their recommendations in this regard.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Waterberg also raised the matter of migraine in a very skilful way. There was some laughter while he spoke, but the laughter was not about the migraine, but about the striking way in which he stated the matter. But let me say that the question of migraine is a very serious one, because it is not merely unpleasant for the people who suffer from it, but also very painful. This is really the case. Unfortunately I can do only two things about this. I do not think it is necessary to appoint a commission of inquiry about it, but I shall again bring it to the notice of our training centres, the medical schools. I think it should occupy a more important place in the training of our doctors than is the case at present. In the second place, the hon. member read certain letters to us which showed how many people were interested in this matter, and it was very clear to me from the letters, especially from the one written by the lady about her twins, that one knows what to do if one wants children in the family and that one knows what to do if there should be no children, but that no one knows what to do if one really wants to combat migraine. I think in this connection it will be of very great use if the Medical Research Board, which has now been established, will have research undertaken specifically in this direction by some or other university, or by universities, and I shall certainly undertake to bring these matters to their notice.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then the hon. member for Rosettenville raised the question of the shortage of doctors. I may tell the hon. member that as far as our medical schools are concerned, this year 397 doctors will qualify at the different medical schools and it will be possible by 1974 that 602 will qualify from the existing schools. This figure can be raised slightly but not very much, because as the hon. member quite rightly pointed out, a class of from 100 to 125 students is about the maximum any medical school can carry. I have the report here in my hand of the committee which investigated medical training, and I may say that I have the matter <span class="col_7027-7028" refersTo="page_0663"/>before the Cabinet at this moment and perhaps I will make an announcement in the near future in regard to future medical schools in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) raised the question of hearing. As the hon. member knows, there was a commission of inquiry into the question of hearing aids and what goes with it. This report was handed to the department, I think, in 1966 or 1967. A few weeks ago I asked the chairman and a member of the committee to come and see me and on their advice I referred this report back to them because after two years certain developments had taken place. They are bringing this report up to date now and it will be brought to finality in the recess.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Fauresmith and the hon. member for Maitland referred to the very important matter of our mentally retarded persons. I want to tell the hon. member that the report of the Van Wyk Committee is already available in Afrikaans. The English text will be available shortly. The Afrikaans text has been available since February. The whole matter dealt with in this report was investigated very thoroughly. It is clear that the Department of Health, the Department of Labour and the Department of National Education all three have a function to fulfil. I firmly believe that these children can be educated, or can be taught something, in some way or other. The idea is also brought forward in this report that those who can be educated are not actually cases for the Department of Health, but cases for the Department of National Education. I want to thank the hon. member, however, for raising this matter. It is one to which we are paying serious attention at the moment.</p>

<p>I also want to tell the hon. member that a research project is at present being conducted by the C.S.I.R. in regard to mental retardation and guidance to parents. This project forms part of the C.S.I.R.’s research work, but will now be transferred to the Medical Research Board. As regards the physically retarded, the hon. member will realize that this is to a very large extent a matter for the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions or the Department of Labour. The Department of Health intends expanding the work therapy divisions of our own institutions to a very large extent. I hope that we shall eventually succeed in getting our industries to give assistance here, because such people are perfectly capable of performing routine jobs. I think this will answer hon. member’s questions. However, there are three further matters I want to mention.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would just answer my question as to whether he is prepared to make kwashiorkor a notifiable disease?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not prepared to give an undertaking that I shall do so. The incidence of this disease is in fact so low in South Africa&#x2014;I think it is something like 4 per cent&#x2014;that I do not consider it justified to make it a notifiable disease. We are at present considering other matters, for example the notifiability of coronary diseases.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Hardly the same incidence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I agree with the hon. member. One does not want to impose too many burdens on our doctors or our hospitals, but in the case of a disease such as kwashiorkor, which really does not merit it, I cannot give her the undertaking that I will make it notifiable.</p>

<p>I should like to say something in connection with Police investigations in regard to district surgeonships. From time to time hon. members have read newspaper reports of doctors or groups of doctors having appeared in magistrates’ courts. Certain cases have already been decided. Several doctors have been acquitted. Some were found guilty on minor charges, and a few, of course, were found guilty on major charges. Unfortunately the impression exists that these Police investigations and prosecutions of district surgeons were initiated by the Department of Health. This is not true, and for this reason I want to read out a short statement in this connection. Approximately two years ago it came to the notice of the Secretary for Health that the Commissioner of Police was concerned about the increase in the cost of drugs that were provided to members of the Police Force and their dependants by prescription of district surgeons. It appears that the Police had for some considerable time been conducting an investigation of which the Department of Health had no knowledge whatsoever. It was only later, after the arrest of a part-time district surgeon in the Orange Free State, that the Department learnt, through a Press report, of a large number of charges of fraud against the district surgeon concerned, and upon inquiry it was found that the Police were conducting preliminary investigations at various places. Several district surgeons have since been arrested on charges of fraud, and in some cases found guilty, while others have been found not guilty, and the investigation is being continued on a country-wide basis. This has resulted in the Police demanding certain documents from the Department of Health for the necessary investigation, but it must be made clear that the initiative in connection with the entire matter came from the Police. The Police, of course, are carrying out their duties, and there can be no criticism in that regard. It would be wrong, however, to think that these investigations were initiated by the Department of Health.</p>

<p>Another matter I want to mention concerns the responsibilities of medical and administrative staff in the administration of departmental hospitals and institutions. The present dispensation in regard to the administration of hospitals and institutions in terms of which a division of responsibilities between the medical <span class="col_7029-7030" refersTo="page_0664"/>and administrative staff was brought about, has been changed. The position is now as follows: The senior State medical officers or the senior psychiatrist of a hospital or institution, who will in future be known as the &#x201C;superintendent&#x201D;, is fully responsible for the efficient administration thereof.</p>

<p>In other words, the administration of a hospital or an institution now falls under the charge of the medically qualified person, and not under an administrative person, as the position was during the past years. Where there is no full-time medical officer or psychiatrist at a hospital or an institution, the Secretary will appoint an acting superintendent. Then there are also a few administrative arrangements, which I do not want to mention now.</p>

<p>The last matter I want to mention concerns the Secretary of Health, Dr. C. A. M. Murray. Dr. Murray will retire from the service of the Department on 1st July. Dr. Murray entered the service of the Department as a temporary assistant pathologist in Cape Town on 1st March, 1934. He served as an additional assistant pathologist for a considerable time. Then he became a medical inspector in Durban. After that he was assistant health officer at our head office in Pretoria and after that he was health officer in Durban. This was in 1947. It is interesting to note that the salary scale attached to that post was £1,200 at the time, i.e. R2,400 per annum. Then he became deputy chief health officer in Johannesburg, and later a regional director. After that he was transferred to head office, and he will have served as Secretary for Health from 1st November, 1966, until he retires in July. At present he is on three-months’ leave. I want to avail myself of this opportunity to express my gratitude and appreciation towards a very loyal and very distinguished officer, who has served the Department of Health for many years. I also want to thank him for his cooperation with me personally during the short while I have worked together with him. I want to wish him a very pleasant time of rest. As regards his family, I want to wish them health as well, because this is the one thing they really need.</p>

<p>Then I want to say that I am glad that General Raymond will fill the post of Secretary for Health as from 1st July. He has occupied the post in an acting capacity since 1st April. General Raymond qualified at the University of Cape Town. After a period of hospital service and private practice, he joined the Permanent Force in 1956. First he was appointed second in command of a military hospital, later as officer in command, and from 1960 he was Surgeon-General. At present he has the rank of Major-General. I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in recognition of exceptional service, the Southern Cross Medal was awarded to him in 1961, and I want to congratulate him very sincerely, because recently the highest peace-time decoration, i.e. the Star of South Africa, was also awarded to him for outstanding services. I want to convey my sincere congratulations to him, and I look forward to a pleasant term of service in co-operation with him in this Department, where he, as a medical practitioner too, will carry on the good work he did while he was in the Defence Force.</p>

<p>Revenue Vote 39.&#x2014;Radio Services, R2,460,000:</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this rather unusual Vote, amounting, as it does, to some R2½ million, presumably is coming under the control of the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Generally, when one asks for information about radio services, the hon. the Minister replies that it is not under his control. Of course, we accept that. But here we have actually R2½ million which is going to be spent by him, because he is presumably responsible for it. It is evidently going to be spent on the radio services of the country. What grounds can he have for spending R700,000 on special services for the Bantu of South-West Africa? Has he conducted a survey of South-West African Natives, whose languages I believe differ considerably one <span class="col_7031-7032" refersTo="page_0665"/>from the other? Has he considered how many radio sets have been sold in that area, or does he distribute them free, in order to put across the various programmes to the listening public of that area? For instance, does he specify the Department responsible for the programmes? Is it his. Department or some other Department of the Government that compiles the programmes? Of course, we know that Springbok Radio programmes, which is to some extent at least under his control, or under the control of the radio service of the country, are compiled by the various companies or sponsors who want to advertise their products. Is the hon. the Minister in the same position? This is a large sum of money for external broadcasting. It amounts to R1,760,000. Has he control over what is broadcast? He has no other control. He constantly tells us that he has no other control. He does not know who broadcasts Current Affairs, for instance. He cannot stop it, even if he wants to. But here he is spending R2½ million. If he is setting up a new broadcasting station &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on this Vote. No. 39, provision is being made for the spending, as it was called by the previous speaker, of R1,760,000 on the external radio service. An amount of R700.000 is in respect of running expenses of the F.M. radio service for Natives of South-West Africa. The hon. gentleman who has just resumed his seat, put a few questions to the hon. the Minister. I believe he will most certainly receive replies to those questions. I am surprised, however. that the hon. member still does not know by this time that when some F.M. service is introduced and a specific Bantu language is used in the programmes of that service, there are sufficient listeners who can enjoy the benefit from those programmes. The hon. member need not concern himself in the least about these F.M. services which are going to be introduced for the Natives of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the question of the external radio service.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What language is being used?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>A variety of Bantu languages is being used. I just want to point out in brief that as far as the Northern Sotho and the Southern Sotho and the Zulu, Xhosa and the respective associated dialects are concerned, only one language need be used, because if one uses one basic language virtually everyone can follow and understand that programme. The hon. member knows that this is so. I hope he will not put any further nonsensical questions to me.</p>

<p>Three years have elapsed since the introduction of the external shortwave service of the S.A.B.C., i.e. Radio R.S.A. After this period of three years during which Radio R.S.A. has been serving the outside world, one is able to form an objective idea which enables one to ascertain whether or not this amount which is being asked for now for this service is justified. I maintain to-day that this is an excellent investment as this short-wave radio service is conveying to listeners in the outside world a great deal of objective information concerning South Africa, and the true picture of our people and our way of life. So as to be able to form a better understanding of the South African way of life and the ideals of South Africa, those listeners need knowledge and information. From the annual report it is also very clear that the reaction of listeners in the outside world to this external service testifies to an appreciation of as well as sympathy with South Africa and it also testifies to an interest in the solution of these major problems with which South Africa is struggling.</p>

<p>I simply want to mention these problems so as to enable us to gauge more accurately the value of the external service. In the first place there is the implementation of our policy of peaceful co-existence, which, to a large extent, is not being understood very clearly in Africa, Europe. the United States of America and in the East. Therefore the propagation of the image by radio R.S.A. is of enormous importance and value to South Africa. This is all the more so in view of the fact that over the past few years, actually since the National Party came into power in 1948, South Africa has to an increasing extent, and after it became a Republic, to an even greater extent, found itself up against poisonous propaganda emanating from the United Party on the one hand, the Progressive Party on the other hand, as well as from the poisonous English-language Press.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>With all respect, Sir, I am referring to the consequences of and the reaction to this poisonous propaganda in the outside world. That is why we need this R.S.A. service. That is my argument. I am merely referring to the consequences of that. I have made this point. I am convinced that this is in fact so. In order to achieve these objects broadcasts are being made in nine languages at present, namely French, German, English, Portuguese, Afrikaans, Dutch, Swahili&#x2014;for the information of the hon. member for Durban (Point)&#x2014;Tsonga&#x2014;also for his information&#x2014;and Zulu. Just as this is being done by that service, it is also being done by the F.M. service. In other words, the language which they can understand is being used on this radio network. This means of communication also enables the immigrant to communicate with his family and friends in the language they can understand and appreciate when mutual communication does take place. The broadcasts of Radio R.S.A. to the territories in Africa are extremely essential. They are all the more essential as news reports of overseas countries, <i>inter alia,</i> the United States, are hostile towards South Africa and contain poisonous propaganda which is being broadcast in Africa and in the outside world. In this case this service is not being used for broadcasting counter-poisonous propaganda against those countries, but only for projecting the true picture so that the listeners may become acquainted with that and may be converted to the correct standpoint. Radio R.S.A., by means of its external service for which these amounts are being made available, is in my opinion the best method of making direct contact with those listeners. At the same time it facilitates and expedites news reporting. That is why it is such an important service in my opinion. However, I appreciate not only the news reporting but also these other programmes broadcast by the R.S.A. radio service. I want to mention only a few programmes this service has been broadcasting lately. A series of Bantu folk tales is being broadcast in the programme &#x201C;Bantu Fireside Tales&#x201D;. Stories, fables and legends are told in this programme. It is necessary for people in the outside world to have knowledge of these as well. Another programme is &#x201C;Spotlight on South African Industry&#x201D;. This is a concise, informative description and review of South Africa’s industrial development. This is to the benefit of both South Africa and business concerns in the outside world. Another programme is &#x201C;300 years in Africa&#x201D;. This programme is also broadcast over the external service. This is a series dealing with our history. It can only be to the benefit of South Africa to have this brought to the attention of listeners in the outside world. In the Afrikaans programme we have what is a fine attempt by Radio R.S.A. to make contact with our Afrikaans-speaking people in Central Africa by broadcasting to those people in their own language religious services and Festival of the Covenant programmes and music. One can picture to oneself how enjoyable it must be, when one is removed from people speaking one’s mother-tongue, to be served by a service such as this which is in one’s own language. This also applies to English-speaking people who may have relatives in South Africa.</p>

<p>Finally I should like to mention the service which is being rendered to the people who have to go and work for long periods in the Antarctic, on Marion Island or Gough Island. If one could only realize how fervently those people long to make contact with their fatherland, one could to some extent gauge how much this R.S.A. radio service means to them. In my opinion this contact with their next-of-kin is something wonderful to them. I want to conclude by saying that the appropriation of this amount of R1,760,000 is an excellent investment when measured in terms of the valuable service given to people of the Republic in the first place and to listeners in the outside world.

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is an unusual Vote. I think we are not familiar with it. The hon. member for Harrismith seems to have information which we do not have. We are anxious to discuss this Vote in the spirit of the S.A.B.C. and St. Pauls Epistle to the Philippians to think on these things. I think in introducing this new Vote, the hon. the Minister could have made an introductory statement to the House to explain to us what this is. We have to depend on the hon. member for Harrismith for information in this regard. I think the hon. the Minister could explain to us what the purpose of this Vote is and give us the information that we want for discussion. Then we can continue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this first item makes provision for the continued payment of the running expenses of the external shortwave service of the S.A.B.C. This is not a new item. On the contrary, it is an old item. Hon. members can see that the increase in this connection is R235,000. This service yields no revenue. In view of the fact that it is fulfilling an extremely important function, i.e. giving the outside world factual information about South Africa, the running expenses are borne by the State. This is a generally accepted principle one also finds in the case of other governments, i.e. to make contributions in respect of the expenses incurred on this kind of service, as the dissemination of information and understanding of a country promotes good international relations. At present the broadcasts of Radio R.S.A. cover the whole of Africa, Europe, the United States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. These broadcasts <span class="col_7035-7036" refersTo="page_0667"/>are made in 10 languages, as the hon. member for Harrismith said.</p>

<p>As regards the running expenses of the F.M. radio service for Natives of South-West Africa, I may just mention that these expenses come to R700,000. It is correct that this is a new item. The South African Broadcasting Corporation is continually extending and improving its broadcasting services. In the interests of the country broadcasts in their own languages are already being made to different Bantu population groups through the medium of the Xhosa service, the Zulu service, the Northern and Southern Sotho service, the Venda and the Tsonga services. By means of the installation of a F.M. service, which will broadcast in Herero, Kunyama and Ndonga, the S.A.B.C. is at present arranging to make provision for the Native population of South-West Africa as well. The service will reach approximately 60 per cent of the Native population of South-West Africa and is expected to come into operation during September of this year. The Government has agreed to assist the S.A.B.C. initially as regards the running expenses of this service. Running this service for a full year is estimated to cost R920,000. In view of the fact that the programme will be in operation for only part of the year, however, the costs involved come to R700,000. In addition I may just mention that the Administration of South-West Africa will make a contribution towards these running expenses.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But if this is Bantu propaganda, why does it not fall under Bantu Affairs?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think this matter can be argued as this is not a new principle. At the time of the introduction of Radio Bantu, that service could not be undertaken on a profitable basis either. At that time the Government also rendered assistance in connection with financing the running expenses of that service. Therefore, the principle of the State financing similar Bantu programme services is not one which this House now has to consider for the first time. At this stage the costs of the F.M. service for the Natives of South-West Africa are extremely unpredictable. But, as I have said, initially Radio Bantu operated at a loss. The State had to assist in financing the running expenses of that service. At the moment, however, no further assistance is being given as the loss has been converted into a profit and the programme is able to support itself now. The same thing may probably happen in South-West Africa in the future.</p>

<p>In addition I may say that available broadcasting services elsewhere in South-West Africa have also been improved now by the installation of facilities which, in Windhoek and its immediate vicinity, make the Afrikaans, English and Springbok Radio services available on F.M. Outside this area listeners in South-West Africa are at present enjoying the benefit of direct special shortwave broadcasts over 100 kW. senders from the H.F. Verwoerd transmitting station which also offer the Afrikaans, English and Springbok Radio services. This replaces the shortwave broadcasts over 20 kW. senders which were transmitted from the transmitting station in all directions as far as Parys in the Free State.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) asked how the money appropriated for this purpose was to be controlled. I may just inform the hon. member that the S.A.B.C. is spending this money for the services in South-West Africa. As I have said, exactly the same thing was done in connection with Radio Bantu. It is true that the South African Broadcasting Corporation is doing the spending, but I think we cannot argue about this principle. There was ample opportunity for discussing this matter during the Post Office budget debate, and that is where this matter in fact belongs.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half-hour? I must commence my remarks by asking why there is no report before the House. The last report that has been tabled by the department was for 1966. The work of this House and this Committee is hampered and delayed by the failure of hon. Ministers to see that reports are before this House timeously. I want to point out that this hon. Minister’s Loan Vote is the second largest one on the Budget; it is exceeded only by the capital expenditure for the Railways and Harbours. We are here to discuss the workings of this department and the last information we have is what happened up to the 31st December, 1966. This information should be here and should be readily available to the House, tabulated and detailed so that the members of this House and the public may know what has happened with these large sums of money and in what manner they have been expended. The result of not having these reports&#x2014;and I suppose it is the same story here as we have heard from the hon. the Minister of Health, namely that it is still with the printer&#x2014;protracts debate and members on both sides of the House have to put lengthy questions on the Order Paper to extract information that should be available. I hope the hon. the Minister will give this House an explanation and an apology for the fact that these reports have not been tabled by his department.</p>

<p>I feel that one of the biggest problems that is facing us in this country, and one for which this hon. Minister must find a solution, is the question of housing. I want to deal with certain aspects of this matter as they fall under the control of this hon. Minister. I want to see whether he cannot give some thought to the proposals I wish to put before him to alleviate this particular problem in South Africa.</p>

<p>In 1968 the question of loans to individuals who wished to build houses was dealt with and revised by the Government. Individuals with an income up to R5,000 per annum were able to obtain through the building societies and the National Housing Commission 90 per cent bonds at a rate of interest of 7.583 per cent. In March of this year the Government announced that certain concessions would be given as far as public servants were concerned, and we welcomed this. Our public servants are now relieved of some of the burden which still remains with the ordinary individual, to the extent that public servants can now obtain a 100 per cent bond and that where a public servant’s income does not exceed R3,000 the rate of interest is 4 per cent per annum, and where it exceeds R3,000 but does not exceed R7,500, the rate of interest is 5 per cent. But the individual citizen who wishes to avail himself of this facility is baulked by the limit which is being set by the department as to the cost of either acquisition or the building of a house. That limit is set at R10,000 and it is applicable when a person purchases or when he builds. I want to refer to remarks which have been made quite recently, in March this year, by Mr. Tom Murray, who is a member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council. He referred to the question of the acquisition of houses by the individual; by &#x201C;individual&#x201D; I mean a salaried man who is not employed by the State. He said that South Africa’s problem is to provide more houses and flats at the right price tag for the huge majority of the working population. He went on to say that the cheapest possible new house which is available in the Johannesburg area costs approximately R13,000. This means that the would-be buyer has to find at least R2,700 in hard cash for his deposit and transfer costs. He then poses this question: How many young married workers have that sort of money in their pockets?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Who said that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Tom Murray said this in March this year. I have mentioned that because I believe that the Minister should give consideration to the adjustment of the ceiling for certain areas and particularly for the metropolitan areas. It is done in other aspects of legislation. We have wage determinations which apply on one scale in certain areas of the country, and apply on a different scale in a metropolitan area. I think that the hon. the Minister would be giving some relief, if there could be consideration of an extension of the ceiling in so far as the larger urban areas are concerned. It is obvious that in smaller towns and smaller rural townships houses can be acquired at less than R10,000, but I want to say to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I am sure that he and his department will agree with me&#x2014;that it is very difficult to find anything suitable for a family at that price in the cities.</p>

<p>There is another matter which was discussed last year, but in regard to which we have seen no further developments. That is the matter of assistance and some relief for the really low income groups who are on the sub-economic and virtually sub-economic basis of assistance from the National Housing Commission. The position at the present moment is that rental is assessed for an income between R101 to R130 per month on the basis of 3 per cent. From R130 to R160 per month, the rate is 5 per cent. I believe that that is a burdensome basis because of the depreciation of the purchasing power of money. We have already seen that as a result of the introduction of sales tax the cost-of-living index is up by 1 per cent. Last year there was an undertaking that the National Housing Commission would investigate the scales again in regard to the rentals of sub-economic housing to see <span class="col_7039-7040" refersTo="page_0669"/>if some suitable adjustment could be made. I should like to know what has actually been done in this regard. I have raised these matters because in the report for 1967 the Secretary has made the following remarks. I want to read it here because I think it is important in viewing this problem. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">A roof is one of man’s primary physical needs. Since the housing demand in South Africa is reaching such large proportions, as the result of natural increase, immigration and large-scale industrial development and urbanization, greater priority will have to be given to housing and the allocation of funds to this Department.</block>

<p>That, of course, is directed to the Treasury. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the funds which have been made available during last year, for instance, have been completely utilized by the various departments which can use them. In other words, has the National Housing Commission utilized every possible rand which was made available to them and has the same been done by the Community Development Board in the establishment of housing schemes? I know that the hon. the Minister on occasion in a general way has suggested that there is no real acute housing shortage. I think we have come to the stage of arguing on adjectives; we are arguing whether it is &#x201C;acute&#x201D; or &#x201C;real&#x201D; or whatever it is. I think the Minister must accept the position that it is really a serious problem and that it remains a serious problem. I believe that it is going to continue as a serious problem because it is not tackled at its roots as far as the Government is concerned. Conservative estimates maintain that 28,000 new residential units are needed per annum for the natural increase in population, immigration, etc. I want to know what investigations have been carried out by the hon. the Minister, or what investigations is he undertaking to find a solution not only in regard to the inability to cope with providing this number of houses plus the number of houses required for the transference of race groups, but also to find some solution for the spiralling costs of land and construction. I was amazed when I saw recently from a report of a building society in Johannesburg that the general average repayment of bonds granted for the providing of homes for the middle-class person was R40 per month over a 25-year period in 1960. This would have meant that a house was within the reach of a man earning R160 per month, on the normal basis of 25 per cent of income spent on interest and redemption. The estimate of the building society is that, nine years later, in 1969, the annual repayment for the similar type of loan for the similar purpose has increased to such an extent that the man who wishes to avail himself of a building society loan for the same type of house will now have to find R80 per month for interest and redemption. This means that his salary must be double the amount of 1960. This is causing a tremendous amount of frustration and difficulty for the younger people in this country of ours.</p>

<p>There are some matters in which help can be given, and I want to suggest some of them to the hon. the Minister. Some of them are not novel; they have been suggested before. The State gives no encouragement whatsoever to a young man who is beginning a job to start purchasing a plot of land for himself for a home in the future. If he was, for instance, entitled to have some tax benefit for instalments which are paid for a plot which is for home ownership purposes for himself, I am sure a lot of the young men who now buy insurance policies to cede to their wives under ante-nuptial contracts would much rather put instalments into a plot of land. I am sure they would much rather do this, because it would eventually become their home if and when they get married. I believe that we have to give some encouragement of that nature to young people so that they can purchase property. They should be able to put their money into acquiring land for future building.</p>

<p>Then the second point is that there seems to be no possibility or no steps have been taken by the State to stabilize land prices in some way. I know it is a big problem, because with every land speculator there is the profit motive. But I believe some steps can be taken whereby land prices can be stabilized. For instance, you immediately stop speculation if when a township is opened and developed, it is a condition of the acquisition of a plot in that township that a house shall be built upon it by the purchaser within a certain time; then there is no holding of plots, no waiting for an abnormal demand and there is no profiteering by somebody who has acquired a plot at an early stage.</p>

<p>Another matter which the department can deal with is the elimination of building delays, and there are colossal delays in the completion of buildings. One also realizes that the interest rate of 8½ per cent which house-owners have to pay in South Africa is the highest interest rate of this kind in any country of the world. This is the burden which is being put on to this country and which is continuing in this country. These matters I have mentioned are some matters which can be dealt with and which call for action by the Government.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to mention the elimination of delays in the proclaiming of townships. Something which I have found very interesting was a recent assessment of the break-down of costs. This break-down of costs of the establishment of a township allows for the delays in getting townships established, undertaking the surveys and obtaining the approval of local authorities. It is stated in a report which appeared recently that between 1955 and 1965 the average break-down on the cost of residential stands to the developer was as follows: The land cost 19 per cent, the services 21 per cent, the endowment 18 per cent, the selling commission 10 per cent, the tax 10 per cent, <span class="col_7041-7042" refersTo="page_0670"/>leaving the developer a profit of 22 per cent; so the man who eventually pays R100 pays that price for ground which initially cost R19. This position is aggravated if there is a delay in the establishment of the townships and there is an interest burden on the money invested over a long period of time. Sir, another matter which I know is of great concern to the hon. the Minister and his department is the inability of the building industry at the present time to cope with this backlog. I believe the situation there is quite frightening, when one looks at the need for a dynamic programme of building. Sir, I want to quote again what I quoted last year from the 1966 report of the department (paragraph 136)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to figures furnished by the Bureau of Statistics, the conventional building industry cannot cope with the execution of all the building projects in respect of which building plans have been approved. The building industry has, for instance, in respect of plans approved in the years 1964 to 1966, accumulated a backlog with the erection of approximately 10,000 single dwellings and R87 million worth of flats in addition to approximately R170 million worth of other types of building projects. It may well be accepted that some of these projects were deferred by investors themselves owing to financial implications, but this image, seen in conjunction with other factors such as the absolute dearth of apprentices joining the building industry, a condition of no unemployment, etc., is nevertheless no uncertain reflection on the building industry’s ability due to a shortage of manpower.</block>

<p>That is the position in which the building industry finds itself. This report of the department is supported by a survey conducted by the National Institute of Personnel Research of the C.S.I.R. and submitted to the National Development Corporation. According to that survey, the recruitment of apprentices is falling well below half the required figure. The industry’s skilled labour contingent is at present about 40,000. To supplement this, according to estimates made by the C.S.I.R. in 1962, a minimum of 2,400 apprentices were needed in the trade each year. This report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to the Building Industry Federation the average recruitment for the last few years, an improvement on former years, has hovered around the one thousand mark. This figure has been fortuitously supplemented by the injection of about 11,000 artisans through immigration from 1962 to 1967. It must be stressed too, that the figure of 2,400 apprentices is a conservative estimate, firstly, because it is based on an investigation undertaken seven years ago, and secondly, because it is a calculation which takes into consideration the changes in the labour structure viewed as necessary by the industry. In the survey which dealt with 66 firms of various types in all the major centres, 26 companies indicated that they were already suffering from serious labour shortages.</block>

<p>The report then goes further and deals with the matter which has been dealt with already under the Labour Vote, and that is the question of using non-Whites in the building industry. I realize that that is not a problem of the Minister’s and that he cannot control it, but I also realize that the Minister has a responsibility, when he finds that he cannot complete his programme, to go to his colleagues in the Cabinet and say, &#x201C;I can never do my job unless there is a review of the rule so far as employees in the building industry are concerned.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, I want to turn for a moment to Coloured housing, and I want to deal in particular with the question of housing for Coloured persons who have been required to move from one area to another in terms of the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p>A very good thing.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am not going to react to nonsensical comments of that nature. Sir, I wonder whether the designing has been correctly thought out, not of the houses but of the townships themselves. When one looks from the air at the townships in the Cape Flats and other areas where there is plenty of land available, they look nice and neat geometrically but one wonders whether this is really the correct method of laying out townships for the types of persons who in the main have been moved. You see, Sir, it is very nice for the normal person who has some leisure time on his hands to have a small cottage with a little bit of ground around it, but then he must have time to work in the garden and to keep it tidy and to look after it. I wonder whether the right thing has been done in building these houses as single or semi-detached small units, with a lot of ground to become neglected and derelict around each of the properties, because these people are not there during the day; they leave home in the morning while it is still dark to go to their jobs, and they come home at night when it is dark. I wonder whether in designing the metropolis in the Bellville South area, for instance, and on the Cape Flats, more thought should not be given to the provision of density living quarters with adequate communal parks and recreation areas which are maintained by the local authority. I think they would provide far more attractive and more pleasant surroundings for these Coloureds than these small houses dotted in the sand, with no ability on the part of the occupiers to tidy them up, to clean them up and to have lawns around them.</p>

<from><span class="col_7043-7044" refersTo="page_0671"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there are some but they are the exceptions. Sir, I have been connected for years with a non-profit housing company in Cape Town, where we build houses to sell to Coloured persons, and our great difficulty always was to keep these places looking neat and tidy; to get these people to keep the houses, the fences and the surroundings tidy. I believe that if you had a park or a communal area which is looked after by the local authority and if you have a greater density of living quarters, one would have more attractive and more pleasant townships.</p>

<p>Sir, there has been a lot of talk about the new metropolis on the Cape Flats in the Western Cape, and I wonder if the hon. the Minister can tell us what is being done as regards the planning of that area. I hope that there is a master plan being prepared for the lay-out of that area, with the industrial and other complexes that will grow there, and that the streets and roads are being planned on the basis of a metropolis. I would be interested to know to what extent the hon. the Minister can enlighten us with regard to the planning which is being undertaken or should be undertaken at the present moment. Sir, there are other aspects of the wider lay-out which have been adopted so readily on the Cape Flats which I think are disconcerting and that is that the cost of services in that type of township are always very much higher than in a concentrated residential area. It seems that what is going to happen, judging by what is happening in townships created quite recently, is that slum conditions are going to start developing in these townships unless very definite and radical steps are taken to prevent that state of affairs. I know the Minister will say it is the responsibility of the Coloured people and I know there is a responsibility resting on them. But we can surely do our planning in such a manner that we do not aggravate the difficulties they have in trying to maintain the homes to which they are moved.</p>

<p>I want to deal with those Coloureds who have had to leave their properties because of Group Areas Act proclamation and what happened to those properties. In answer to a question I put to the Minister in February this year, I received information from him in regard to certain erven at the Strand which were taken over by the Department of Community Development from four Coloured persons. The procedure was that the basic value of those erven would have been set under the Act by the Department, and an offer would have been made to these Coloured persons and they would have had the right to go on appeal to a revision court if they so wished, or they could have accepted the offer. These persons accepted the offer and were paid out something, in the aggregate between them, of less than R10,000. In October, 1968, having expropriated the land in 1966, the department decided to sell these erven and they were offered for sale. Tenders were called for and the price obtained by the Community Development Board was R100,050. The Minister was good enough to show me the tenders. The one tender which was accepted was out of proportion with the others, in so far that it was so much higher than the other tenders, but in fact the property was sold at that figure, and even if it was sold to one of the other tenderers, at say R21,000, i.e. double the price the Minister paid, it would have meant that the Coloured owners were deprived in two years of R10,000. I am sure the Minister knows as well as I do that the profiteering which is going on in areas from which Coloureds are being asked to move is something which should shame all of us. Companies are formed by people who have no interest whatever in the Coloured people, and there are several such companies in Cape Town. They go along and buy up from the Coloureds a house which is dilapidated although still fairly substantial basically. They spend a bit of money on dolling it up, putting in new window-frames and putting some whitewash on the walls and they call it a Chelsea area. The Minister, by his proclamation under the Group Areas Act, has made it a White group area and the profiteering that goes on has to be seen to be believed.</p>

<p>What is the remedy?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point. I believe that the remedy is to be found in the fixing of the basic value. The basic values at the Strand, as I pointed out, turned out to be 10 per cent of what those properties were eventually sold for. I believe the whole system of fixing basic values and the compensation paid to the owner who is being deprived of his property should be thoroughly revised. I hope the Minister, with his usual enthusiasm and determination, will tackle this job because there is a great deal of hardship resulting from this type of exploitation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to refer to a matter I discussed with the Minister earlier this session, and that is the necessity of his obtaining the co-operation of the local authorities. I want to say to the Minister again that I believe that the local authorities are quite prepared to co-operate with his department. When I suggested that to him before, he mentioned various localities which are now not really material, but I want the Minister to know that the information he gets may not always be accurate, even though he gets it from his department. After all, they have a wide field to cover and they may not have enough local knowledge or information which they should have. The Minister knows perfectly well that in the case of Stellenbosch he has been so informed by the Mayor of Stellenbosch, that his information was incorrect. I want to go further, just to have it on record in this House, and say that when a public meeting was called in Stellenbosch&#x2014; and I have the minutes of that meeting which was held on the 12th of this month&#x2014;the <span class="col_7045-7046" refersTo="page_0672"/>matter was thoroughly ventilated, and this was the resolution adopted by that meeting-&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point covered a wide field but did not make much of an impression. He hit out at random, but I do not believe he inflicted any wounds. I just want to refer to the statement he made at the beginning of his spech when he said that the Department would have to give an account of what it had done with the large sum of money with which it had been entrusted. One need only open one’s eyes to see where that money has gone, and when we bear in mind pre-1948 conditions and see how things are to-day &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know the hon. member for Durban (Point) is scared of that time, because we always have to measure the times in which we are living in terms of conditions which prevailed at that time, and if we want to ascertain what has become of the money, we can very easily do so by drawing a comparison between conditions now and conditions prior to 1948. I want to agree with him that housing is a very important aspect of national life. It is essential for sound national growth and family life, but as far as this is concerned, I have reason this afternoon for alleging without any fear of contradiction that the Government, as far as this is concerned, has done its duty and has done it very well. Therefore I should like to express my appreciation at this stage to the Department for the way in which it is performing its task and for the great interest it is showing in the weal and woe of our less privileged people in the performance of its duties. I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the hon. the Minister and to express my appreciation to him for the role he is playing, and I should also like to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister of Community Development. Just as he has built up a tradition in this House of being a formidable political fighter and an undaunted defender of his principles, so we believe he will also build up during his term of office as Minister of Community Development a tradition of being a man who will really achieve success in his work. We want to wish him every success and offer him our sincere co-operation.</p>

<p>As I have said, we on this side are proud of the achievements of the Government in respect of housing which has been provided for our people. The question now is: How is this being done and what is being done? In the first place I want to point out that the way in which this is being done testifies to the interest and the determination of the Government to make provision, in the first place, for the needs of people who cannot be self-sufficient. In contrast to the lamentations of the hon. member for Green Point here to-day, I want to say that it is everyone’s duty to try to be self-sufficient in this regard, and we probably also have the right to appeal to employers to try to meet the housing requirements of their employees. But the way in which this assistance is being granted reveals the ideal of the Government to look after everyone in such a way that healthy family life will not suffer. There are various methods of providing assistance. In the first place, the Department is assisting in the development of housing. It is rendering assistance in the field of slum clearance, because where the local authorities do not do this, the Department itself does so. Furthermore, the Department is always assisting local authorities, the bodies whose duty it actually is to provide housing for Whites, to do so, and in cases where the local authorities fail to do so, the Department brings pressure to bear. If this does not help, the Department itself develops that housing scheme. That actually explains why so much success has been achieved lately. We find at present, as regards the various schemes which differentiate between the various income groups, that the obstacles which obstruct sound development in connection with the provision of housing are being removed. We have schemes under which money is made available to local authorities at a very low rate of interest, 3¾ per cent, for sub-economic housing schemes. The State carries the balance of the interest paid on that capital. The fact that the Government has consented to do so, is a feather in its cap. In addition there are other schemes, economic ones, under which money is provided at a higher rate of interest in accordance with the income of the group provided with housing. When we go into these matters we see that everything is being done to provide the right assistance at the right place where it is most essential to do so. In addition there are the other schemes for the provision of old age homes. We also have schemes under which people who want houses are given the opportunity of buying houses themselves. Consequently I am of the opinion, in contrast with what the hon. member for <span class="col_7047-7048" refersTo="page_0673"/>Green Point said here, that the Department is doing its utmost to meet these needs.</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to show hon. members in the short time I have at my disposal what was done in the past few years in respect of the provision of housing. When we examine these things, we may rightly be proud of this National Government for what it has done in respect of this matter. I should like to mention a few figures in this regard. I am referring only to the past five years. In the year 1964-’65 an amount of R23,345,000 was voted for housing. In 1965-’66 this amount was R30,445,000. In the year 1966-’67 it was R34,750,000. In the year 1967-’68 it was R50,240,000. For the current financial year an amount of R52,300,000 is being requested. During this period of five years the amount of money voted by this Government for housing has therefore doubled itself or more than doubled itself. The amount increased from R23 million to R52 million. This indeed is evidence of the very sympathetic attitude the Government has in respect of these problems. As I said at the outset, if one only opens one’s eyes one will see what has been achieved in this field.</p>

<p>But let us also consider the number of houses which have been built. Now I am referring only to White housing because this is what I should like to confine myself to to-day. The United Party likes to inform the public that this Government is looking after the Black people only. At other times they maintain that nothing is being done for the Black man. As far as White housing is concerned, 2,673 houses were built in the year 1964-’65; 4,578 in 1965-’66; 5,806 in 1966-’67; 4,600 in 1967-’68 and 3,600 in 1968-’69, a total of 21,000 houses built by the Department. Up to 1968 as many as a total number of 77,982 White houses had been built. This indeed is an achievement and it is proof of the earnestness of this Government to overcome this problem. It is not a case of fine words and empty talk; it is a case of striving purposefully towards the ideal of housing our people properly. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the time I have at my disposal I should like to touch on a few small matters. In the first instance I should like to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Langlaagte. We are truly impressed by the way in which the Minister, in the short time he has had, has gained proper control of and a firm grip on this very important and complicated Department. Those of us who have the chance and the opportunity of working very closely and intimately with the Minister are convinced of the fact that he is making a very great success of the work of this Department. It is no easy matter to be in charge of this Department. It is a Department which meets very involved problems and many thorny situations along its road. But the hon. the Minister has showed us that he got his teeth into this matter in next to no time. We want to congratulate him on that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point&#x2014;I am sorry that he is not here at the moment&#x2014; spoke of Coloured housing. He said we should pay some attention to the design of Coloured housing. All the same, I want to say that we have had a great deal to do with the provision of Coloured housing. I think that in general the Coloureds are satisfied and happy with the design of the houses in which they are living to-day. It is a very practical design which allows of the Coloureds fitting their families very easily into these houses. But we should also have regard to the fact that it is very easy for the United Party to say that we should build large and spacious houses for these people. The United Party is not responsible for finding the necessary funds. When we consult Loan Vote K, one is truly grateful to see that this year we have obtained an additional amount of more than R5 million. This proves to us that housing is a matter about which this Government is in earnest and in respect of which all of us want to do our best to make up the leeway which developed in the course of years as a result of the lack of planning and disinterest of a United Party Government. Because of the tremendous population increase we are determined to house our population properly.</p>

<p>Sir, for a few moments I should like to dwell on my own constituency and the circumstances prevailing in my constituency. I should like to address a word of thanks to the Minister and to the Department for what is being done in that area. I am grateful for the fact that with the assistance and through the agency of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure a large piece of land has been placed at our disposal in the Kleinfontein area on which we shall establish a housing scheme for the lower and middle income groups. As I have said, we are grateful for what is being done for housing projects in the Benoni area, especially in the municipal area. The development which is taking place in Northmead Extension, in the direction of Kempton Park, is a very fine scheme. It is a scheme which is very popular, particularly amongst the income groups concerned. The larger part of the community of Benoni consists of factory workers, people employed in industries. They have to make use of train services as they work in other parts of the Witwatersrand. To live closer to their places of employment is a major need as regards the majority of these people. Therefore I say that the situation of this new Kleinfontein area, which is being acquired by the city council, is extremely convenient for these people, within reach of their places of employment. New Kleinfontein is situated virtually next to the Apex industrial development area. It is not situated far from the other established industries in Benoni either. It is virtually within walking distance of both the station at Apex and the industrial area. We have rendered a great deal of assistance to the local authority of Benoni, a body <span class="col_7049-7050" refersTo="page_0674"/>that is also favourably disposed to this matter, to carry through these negotiations. The only remaining thing is that we have to obtain our funds from the Department. I think the Minister should canalize some of these increased funds on the Estimates in the direction of Benoni so that we may start that project. The plea I want to make is that when the city council of Benoni approaches the Department for these funds, the Department should accommodate us in the same way as it did in the past.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to express a word of gratitude and appreciation for the funds which have been made available for the housing project at Actonville for the Indians of the East Rand. The policy of the National Party is to clear up our country by settling our people properly in their own areas. At the moment there still are quite a number of these people who are living in places scattered over the East Rand. Some of them live in shanties. They are living in conditions which are truly undesirable. At the moment a very active building programme is being carried out at Actonville. Houses are being built at Actonville for these people. A business centre is also being erected there in which dealers who are still trading in White areas at the moment, can be concentrated in a proper business centre in that area. I speak with knowledge of the feelings of these people. The Indian community in that area is grateful for what is going to be done for them there. I want to inform this House that last year I had the opportunity of addressing 500 of these people at a rally where I explained matters to them. There we received the warmest affection and the most sincere promise of co-operation from these people as regards the implementation of our policy. If there are hon. members in this House, especially on the opposite side, who want to maintain that these people do not stand with us as regards the implementation of our policy, they will be talking the biggest lot of nonsense. I am able to testify to the fact that these people are standing with us in the implementation of our policy, and I am able to produce conclusive proof of this.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by wishing the Minister every success. I hope and trust that he will find time to pay us a visit one of these days.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to me it was a wonderful experience to hear the hon. member for Benoni making a plea that people should be given the opportunity of living in close proximity to their work. He even went so far as to ask that the Minister should help to see to it that people lived within walking distance of their work. That is fine. That is a spirit that has our support. But I cannot help seeing the anomaly in that, because when it comes to non-Whites and Indians that same member will get up here and strongly defend the removal of the Indians of Johannesburg to a place 18 miles from the hub of their employment. I hope when we debate these matters again in future, the hon. member will adopt that same attitude and not measure by two standards.</p>

<p>Last week during the discussions on the Group Areas Amendment Bill we discussed the question of domestic servants. I pointed out at that time that there were members on the Government side who adopted the attitude that the system of domestic servants was something bad and that we should get rid of domestic servants. A few members on the opposite side expressed their surprise at the fact that I could say something like that. They then wanted to know who had made that statement. I referred to the hon. the Minister of Community Development. That made the hon. the Minister very indignant and he called out &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D; two or three times.</p>

<p>That is on record in Hansard and that is how it was reported in the Press. The hon. the Minister will understand that no member can walk round with a pile of cuttings and always have the proof on him at every moment. I can tell him this, however, I am always very careful, and when I make a statement about something which an hon. member or a Minister has said, I make sure that what I say is correct; otherwise I do not make the statement. However, one cannot always prove it immediately. I then told the hon. the Minister that I would raise the matter during the discussion of his Vote. What I referred to was the speech which the hon. the Minister had made not very long ago at a Day of the Covenant celebration as reported in <i>Die Burger</i> on 17th December, 1968. The heading of the report is (translation) &#x201C;Whites must make sacrifices&#x201D;. What are the sacrifices which they have to make? &#x201C;Do without servants, asks Coetzee&#x201D;. That is what the report says. I hope the hon. member over there is listening now. The report reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">White South Africans had to learn&#x2014;and learn quickly&#x2014;to make do without non-White servants, Mr. Blaar Coetzee, Minister of Community Development and Public Works, once again said yesterday at the Day of the Covenant celebration. He addressed an appeal to all Whites to make a noble effort in this regard and to make great sacrifices. &#x201C;It is wrong to believe that the non-Whites are here to be our servants,&#x201D; he said.</block>

<p>On that score I surely agree with the hon. the Minister. It is wrong to look at every non-White as a servant. In that regard I can agree with him. They are also individuals in their own right. But to adopt the attitude that it is wrong to be a servant and to earn in that capacity, and that South Africans should learn to make do without servants, is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I still have a second point on which I should like to touch. The hon. the Minister is responsible for issuing permits to South Africans of Chinese descent to live at some place or other. Is that correct? It is the task of the hon. the Minister. I just want to tell the hon. the Minister that these people are South Africans, but they are suspended in the air like Mohammed’s coffin, as it were. As far as I know they cannot own property anywhere, surely not in Johannesburg. They cannot build a house anywhere, because they cannot buy property. They are dependent on the hon. the Minister for their residence in White residential areas. I think it is an unsatisfactory state of affairs that they should be suspended in the air, as it were. I think the time has arrived for the hon. the Minister to give us a frank indication of what he is envisaging for these South Africans of Chinese descent in Johannesburg. As far as I am concerned, I must honestly say that I cannot see how we can have conflicting provisions in this connection, for example, for people of Chinese descent on the one hand and Japanese on the other hand. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what he is envisaging; how many residential permits have been issued to Chinese to live in a proclaimed residential area such as Johannesburg; what is the average duration of a permit; whether permits to buy property are also issued, and which residential areas have been selected for this purpose in Johannesburg? These are a few questions and I hope the hon. the Minister will reply to them.</p>

<p>At present the Department of Community Development is also operating in South-West Africa. I see an amount of R2,200,000 for this purpose in the Estimates. According to this item in the Estimates there is a staff of five. What I really want to ask the hon. the Minister is whether the whole system of group areas is also applicable to South-West Africa now? I should also like to know whether he is going to put into operation in that territory all the machinery of group areas.</p>

<p>Then I also wonder whether I may discuss on the item &#x201C;Minister’s salary&#x201D; the question of the announcement made by him on the gradual replacement of notice boards reading &#x201C;Whites only&#x201D; by ones on which only the words &#x201C;Whites&#x201D; or &#x201C;non-Whites&#x201D; would appear? This is a step in the right direction. Although it is <span class="col_7053-7054" refersTo="page_0676"/>not a major step in the right direction it is an improvement nevertheless.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down, has put a few direct questions to the hon. the Minister as regards domestic servants and permits for Chinese. On this particular occasion I should like to confine myself to housing. I hope the hon. member will not take it amiss of me if I do not follow up on what he has said in his arguments.</p>

<p>It is history that on Sunday morning, 1st September, 1968, Port Elizabeth suffered one of the worst flood disasters ever experienced in South Africa. These floods were of such magnitude that the houses of many of the inhabitants were flooded and several families had to flee to the more higher-lying areas of the city. I should not like to create the impression on this occasion that one is not anything but highly appreciative of what was done at the time for our people by our welfare organizations, including the Department of Social Welfare, the Police force, the Defence force and the City Council of Port Elizabeth. On behalf of my constituency, the tenants and the inhabitants who suffered so heavy an affliction, I want to avail myself of this opportunity of conveying the sincere thanks and appreciation of our people to our hon. the Minister and the staff of his department for all they did for us on that occasion. I have personal knowledge of the intense interest the hon. the Minister showed in our afflicted areas and in our people who had suffered so heavy an affliction. I have personal knowledge, too, of the fact that our Department of Community Development made alternative accommodation for these afflicted people available during and immediately after the flood. No community will ever forget a thing like this. For that reason I am finding myself in the privileged position to-day of being able to convey the sincere gratitude and appreciation of my voters to the Department of Community Development and to our hon. the Minister for what they have done during those difficult times. But those of us who take an interest in community development, including our Department of Community Development, have learned three very important lessons from that disaster. I would say that the most important lesson was that the South African&#x2014;and I think the voters of Port Elizabeth Central represent the average South African&#x2014;has an irrepressible urge and drive to get back on their feet again after the most trying circumstances and, as has been the case in Port Elizabeth, to clear their houses of the debris, move in again and cheerfully to start from scratch. One wants to say that one felt on that occasion that we as South Africans may always be grateful for the sound stuff of which this nation is made.</p>

<p>We have also learned a second lesson, namely that it must have ben a great encouragement to us and to the Department of Community Development to find that, after only one appeal was made, thousands of citizens, males and females, other individuals and private bodies collected a vast amount of money in the form of an emergency relief fund which enabled us to repair the damaged houses. This money also enabled us to replace damaged furniture. On this occasion it is a privilege for me to pay tribute to those South Africans for the great sacrifice they made to help us who had suffered so heavy an affliction.</p>

<p>There is also a third lesson we could have learned from this disaster, namely that after our people had moved into their houses again, after they had started painting and cleaning operations, after the sun had begun to shine and the children could go to school again, rumours did the rounds in those afflicted areas that tenants might as well stop cleaning and painting their houses because those houses were going to be demolished in the near future. After that had happened, the tenants would be obliged to vacate their houses before demolition work would start. It took the regional representative of the Department of Community Development, our provincial council member and myself days to go from house to house to convince our people that nothing would come of these malicious rumours. One can easily understand that our tenants who had had to live under those rumours had to be protected. Our legislation is quite clear in this connection. One finds it more difficult to understand that there are people who could spread these rumours and that they hoped wrongly that if the tenants were to vacate their properties and that the houses were to stand empty, it would be easier to obtain a demolition permit and then indulge in a little speculation. To my mind tenants not only in my constituency but throughout South Africa do not seem to appreciate fully what rights they have in terms of the Housing Act and particularly in terms of section 45 of the Act. This Act was passed by this Government. Our people are well protected in this regard. It means that nobody shall demolish a dwelling without the approval of the Minister. Nobody is allowed to use a dwelling for purposes other than residential purposes without the approval of the Minister. Nobody may notify a tenant to vacate a dwelling if he wants to demolish such dwelling before having obtained the necessary permission to do so, and in case the owner of the dwelling has, in fact, obtained permission to demolish such dwelling, he should give at least 6 calender month’s notice to the tenant concerned. Anyone who contravenes <span class="col_7055-7056" refersTo="page_0677"/>the conditions of the Act as laid down in section 85 shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding R200 or to imprisonment for a period of one year. I just want to quote a practical example in this connection. If you take a property which is situated within the area of jurisdiction of Port Elizabeth and in respect of which the owner desires to obtain a demolition permit, such owner has to apply to the local city council in the first place. The local city council will then send its medical and hosing officers to ascertain whether such a dwelling is suitable for occupation, whether people are actually occupying the dwelling and, if such a dwelling is to be demolished, whether the occupants have alternative accommodation. After the City Council has considered the matter, it submits its recommendations to the regional committee, consisting of a member of the National Housing Commission and other senior officials of the Department of Community Development. The powers vested in the hon. the Minister are delegated to this regional committee. It is then a matter for this regional committee to decide whether a demolition permit may be granted or not. My experience is that the regional committee in my area is not very keen to grant a demolition permit if a dwelling is occupied and if such dwelling is fit for human occupation. Of course, for this we are very grateful. The owner of the dwelling is allowed to write to the tenant giving him six calender months’ notice to vacate the dwelling only after the demolition permit has been granted. I think it is vitally important that we must bring about peace, order and contentment among our tenants in South Africa. It is important for them to know that the owner cannot order them arbitrarily to vacate the property if he wants to demolish the place they are living in. For that reason I know that if people contravene the provisions of section 85 and if it is brought to the attention of the hon. the Minister or the Department of Community Development, ruthless steps will be taken against such people, because it is important that there should always be peace among our people as regards the housing sector as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, after the hon. member for Benoni had spoken and said that the residential areas which would be established at Benoni would be conveniently near the places of employment of those people and that it would be the ideal state of affairs, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout deemed it fit to refer to the non-Whites once more.

<p>The Whites have to rely on transport as well, but the difference is that virtually all the transport of the non-Whites is being subsidized by the Government. Apparently he does not know it. It is convenient for them on that side of the House to advocate this because there is no danger that non-Whites might come and live near them, because they buy apartheid in the residential areas in which they are living. I now want to ask the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to tell us whether he would like non-Whites to come and live in his constituency so that they can live near to their places of employment? Let the hon. member get up and tell us.</p>

<p>When one treads on their toes, they say one is talking nonsense. As soon as one gets behind their policy of integration for which they plead here time and again, they say one is talking nonsense.</p>

<p>I should like to express my personal gratitude and appreciation to the hon. the Minister for the way in which he approaches the problems we have in Boksburg. I want to express my gratitude for the sympathetic interest displayed by the hon. the Minister and for the undertaking he gave us at the time of his visit. I should like to mention here for record purposes that after I had discussed with him the problems as regards the resettlement of Indians in Boksburg, he immediately went out of his way and visited Boksburg to see for himself what problems existed there. I want to tell him to-day that we rely on the sound undertaking he gave us.</p>

<p>However, there is another problem I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. This problem concerns the Indian traders who infiltrate into our White residential areas and our White business areas under the names and licences of Whites. One may think that this is not so, but it is a fact that <span class="col_7057-7058" refersTo="page_0678"/>one does find White people who are prepared to sell their birthright for a mess of pottage and to betray their fellow Whites. They betray their own people by allowing Indians to take out a licence in their name. I appreciate the problems the hon. the Minister and his Department have to find a solution for that problem. The licence is in the name of a White person and when one enters the premises of that business there is ostensibly one single White person present but in reality that whole business is being run by Indians. For the sake of convenience, that White person simply sits on one side. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it would not solve the problem to compel those traders to divulge the names of the directors. Cannot we compel those business undertakings to put up a notice board on which the names of the directors are displayed so that we can see who the directors are? Has the time not arrived for us to allow those Indians only to work for those White persons if they have a permit to do so? We cannot allow the good work that has already been done in this way, to be circumvented.</p>

<p>I now want to raise the problem of housing and the costs attached to it. I believe that the cost of land is one of our major problems to which the greatest amount of publicity is being given in the newspapers to-day. People who want to acquire a house of their own find that the plot on which they want to buy or build a house is extremely expensive. When one has to buy the plot, one finds oneself in a most difficult position by the time one has saved enough money as a deposit on one’s bond. Has the time not arrived for us to lay down what the size of plots should be when a township is established? After all, we know that the bigger the plots, the more expensive they are. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that our local authorities should be compelled to make provision for the lower and middle income groups. It is a fact that most of our local authorities are only interested in providing prestige residential areas for the wealthy people. Has the time not arrived that local authorities should be compelled, when developing a residential area, to make half the number of plots of a size that could be used by the Department of Community Development? Then both the poor man and those in the middle income groups will have the right to build a house in that area. To my mind the poor man has as much right as the rich man to own a small piece of land here in South Africa. It is the God-given right of every person to have a share in the land of South Africa. I know the Department of Community Development is continually making money available. As a matter of fact, more money is made available than the amount used by the local authorities. Houses are not being built because there is not sufficient land. The fault really lies with the local authorities. If they make plots available which were neither too large nor too expensive, I believe our housing problems will be solved. Much is being done by the private sector, but I can only say that I believe that profiteering is more important to them than the service they render.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the malpractices of lessors of buildings. In the first place, they circumvent the rent boards. I just want to quote an example. The lessor applies for the determination of the rental of a certain building, for instance, a block of flats. The value of the block of flats amounts to, say, R50,000 and the lessor takes out insurance for R100,000. The rental is determined according to the high insurance he pays. However, after a year he does not take out insurance for R100,000 again; he takes out the minimum insurance and pays much less. In the meantime the lessees have to pay that extra money. Another malpractice concerns commission on rent collections. When a lessor submits his application, he states that a certain agent will collect the rent on his behalf and the collector then claims 5 per cent commission. As soon as the rent has been determined, the commission is no longer applicable because the lessor collects the rent himself. I know this creates many problems, but I believe that this Department may very well carry out random tests from time to time to ascertain whether the original insurance on the building is still as high as the owner said it was when he applied for a rent determination. The Department may also carry out random tests to find whether the rent is still being collected by agents.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was very interesting indeed to hear the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) trying to stress the necessity for the application of Section 85 of the Housing Act. He said it should be applied with the very greatest possible firmness. Of course, this section of the Housing Act, as the hon. the Minister knows only too well, does not in fact provide adequate protection against the demolition of a dwelling under certain circumstances. I have already had quite a lot of experience in this regard. As the hon. the Minister knows at the end of last year there was the case of the landlord who demolished all the houses of those Coloured people in Klip Road, Grassy Park. No action was taken against him because the hon. the Minister said that he was not certain of securing a conviction. On those grounds he was let off. I really think that the hon. the Minister might well be advised to consider amending that section in order to apply it more firmly in circumstances of that kind.</p>

<p>I move as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its profound regret at the death on 31st May, 1969, of the Honourable Jozua Francois Tom Naudé, and places on record its sincere appreciation of the invaluable and distinguished services rendered by him to his country during an unprecedented period of almost 50 years of continuous Parliamentary service. He served as a member of the House of Assembly from 1920 to 1960, as Chief Government Whip from 1935 to 1938, as Deputy Chairman of Committees of the House of Assembly from 1938 to 1939, as Speaker of the House of Assembly from 1948 to 1950, as Cabinet Minister from 1950 to 1961, as Senator from 1960 and as President of the Senate from 1961 to the time of his death. He also served as Acting State President for a period of 10 months during 1967 and 1968.</block>

<block name="quote">This House further resolves that an expression of its sincere sympathy be conveyed to Mrs. Naudé and the members of the family in their sad bereavement.</block>

<p>When the late Senator Tom Naudé came to this Parliament, and specifically to this House, nearly 50 years ago, many of the members sitting here to-day had not yet been born, and most of the members sitting here to-day had not yet gone to school. Fifty years is a very long time in the life of any person, and next year Tom Naudé would have been a member of either of the Houses of this Parliament for fifty years. During his Parliamentary career he made a deep impression on all who came into contact with him. He was a friendly person with a keen sense of humour. But that is not all that he was. He was a man who applied himself with exceptional devotion to the tasks that were entrusted to him. The list appearing in this motion before the House is indeed a long and impressive one. Normally a Parliamentarian occupies one or, by way of exception, a few of the offices mentioned here. The late Senator Naudé occupied all of them, and he occupied these various positions with distinction. One is grateful to think that just recently, on the occasion of his 80th birthday, fitting tribute was paid to him from all sides for the long years of service which he had rendered. One is indeed grateful that it was granted him to know during his lifetime what his friends and his colleagues thought of him and how they appreciated his person and the work he had done.</p>

<p>We know that he was looking forward with almost child-like excitement to completing his 50 years of service to Parliament next year. But now it has been willed otherwise, and one is thankful under the circumstances that he was spared the long suffering that so often occurs in these cases. One is grateful that, seeing that Senator Naudé had been a member of this House for so many years, for 40 years, and had served it with such distinction, one can on this occasion pay tribute to him in this way. If the question should perhaps be asked what the secret was of the success of the public career of Tom Naudé, I think one can find the answer in the fact that whatever he did he did with complete self-surrender. Seeing him in church, seeing him in Parliament, seeing him at a rugby match, one noticed that everything he did he did with his whole heart in it. He lived in the fullest sense of the word and he enjoyed it. We accordingly wish to pay tribute to him on this occasion, and in our wishes and in our prayers we shall remember Mrs. Naudé and the children.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it falls to my lot to have the privilege of seconding the motion of the hon. the Prime Minister from this side of the House. Sir, I want to say at once that it is no uncommon thing for us to have a motion of condolence at the passing of one of our colleagues but. Sir, it is never a formal occasion when we lose one of our number. From whatever side of this House one of us goes to join the great majority and there is a motion of condolence, it is no formal matter, because we have lost one of the people who sat here with us and whom we came to know so well. Sir, on this particular occasion I think our feeling is much more than even the normal feeling that one has on these occasions. I want to speak not only on behalf of the Official Opposition in this House but also in a personal capacity because from long before the time that I came to this House, only 21 years ago now, I knew the late Senator Naudé, and even in those days he was generally known as Uncle Tom to everyone on this side of the House as well as to hon. members on that side of the House. Sir, this was not only a term of respect and appreciation but it was a fundamental term of endearment because the late Senator Naudé meant something in our public life to, I think, everybody irrespective of their political allegiance and irrespective of what their calling may have been here in South Africa. Here, Sir, was a man who started as a very young man away from the big centres of civilization in those days when he first began his public life, his career in public life. He finished up as President of the Senate, and acted as State President at one time. Sir, I may say this in respect of the period when he acted as State President. I had the privilege of sitting beside him only last year at a big rugby match at Newlands in Cape Town, and I was astounded again at his intimate knowledge and appreciation not only of the finer points of the game, but of the people who were participating in what is probably our national pastime. It was <span class="col_7061-7062" refersTo="page_0680"/>a remarkable demonstration of versatility and the nimbleness of mind&#x2014;the active mind&#x2014; of the late Senator Naudé.</p>

<p>Sir, the history which we are narrating here this afternoon of the late Senator Naudé, is a history of achievement in respect of which I think it can be said that there are few men who had not only the qualities and the qualifications to serve with such admittedly great ability in so many different positions in out public life but who also did so without, as far as I am aware, making enemies amongst the generality of our people of all races and all kinds in South Africa. Sir, that a man may achieve eminence is undoubted; a man may achieve eminence in more than one sphere of life, but that a man can achieve eminence in so many spheres and still be able to say that he has in the broadest of broad language remained in harmony with the population is, I think, an amazing thing and a wonderful tribute to the memory of the late Senator Naudé. Sir, this is the man to whose memory we have come here to-day to pay tribute. From this side of the House and as far as I personally am concerned we say with the very deepest feeling of sincerity that this is our official &#x201C;tot siens&#x201D; in this House, in which he played such a prominent part, to the late Senator Naudé. To his widow and his family our sympathy and our understanding go out at this particular moment of time. We hope that they will be given the strength to be able to stand the sorrow which has come their way and that as time goes on their sorrow will be allayed and that, standing back in the fullness of time, they will come to appreciate even more the history of a great man, this great South African, with whose destiny they have been so closely linked.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I second the motion.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to support the motion before the House and to associate myself with the eloquent tributes paid to the memory of our departed friend. Sir, it was my high privilege as a much younger man to be admitted to the society and friendship of the late Mr. Tom Naudé, more affectionately and almost universally known as Oom Tom, whom I have always esteemed, respected and greatly admired. I have known him personally and intimately for well over 40 years. Over these years there formed between us a friendship and a theme of common interest which bridged the gulf of a different generation. Over these years his friendship to me is something which I shall never forget. He had in unbounded measure the human quality of inspiring and maintaining a cordial and harmonious relationship with countless people, indeed with thousands of people, of different political views and outlooks. He was one of the kindliest and friendliest men I have ever known. He was an outstandingly good mixer, keenly interested in every aspect of life. He was full of fun and would spontaneously engage himself in all kinds of topics from grave to gay. He was a sportsman in every sense of the word and possessed a veritable fund of stories to suit almost any occasion. At the same time, however, as the hon. the Prime Minister has pointed out this afternoon, in absolute contrast to what I have just said, he was capable of producing a wise and mature judgment upon any public or private issue with which he was confronted. He had a massive common sense and a wise comprehension which made his advice invaluable whether in public conflict or in private embarrassment. He was a man of great versatility and of unswerving friendship. He will be sadly missed as the previous speakers have mentioned this afternoon.</p>

<p>The milestones of Tom Naudé’s public life, extending, as they did, over half a century embraced most of the fateful events of our country during that spectacular period. He, in his own quiet and inimitable way, has won for himself a place of the highest distinction in the history of our South African nation. Many men when they die after busy and active lives leave behind treasures of material wealth. Oom Tom banked his treasures in the hearts of his countless friends, who will always cherish his memory. To-day our thoughts go out to his devoted widow and to the members of his family. We fervently pray that the Almighty will sustain them all in this very sad period of affliction.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that I am permitted to say a personal word to pay a personal tribute to the late Tom Naudé, known as Oom Tom. When I came to this House in 1933, he was the Chief Whip of the party and shortly afterwards I became a provincial Whip. It was at his hands that I learnt about Parliament, and I have been ever grateful to him. If one has to say what was his great attribute and the reason for his great success, I should say it was the fact that whatever the position he graced, whether it was Chief Whip, Minister, Speaker, President of the Senate or Acting President of the Republic, he always remained Oom Tom. In other words, the greatness of the position never changed him. He was always the same to everybody he met and to his friends in particular. He was also a sociable man. He liked his fellow men and his fellow men liked him and therefore they were always very ready to meet him and pleased to see him. I also believe that he had an attribute which many of us could follow as an example, and that is that he was able to make firm friends across the party line, irrespective of politics. There are many people in this country who were firm friends of Oom Tom. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I should like to pay the personal tribute of those who knew him as individuals, of whom few are left, to his widow and his family, not only as a tribute by <span class="col_7063-7064" refersTo="page_0681"/>the parties, but as a tribute by every individual in this House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not propose to ask for the privilege of the half hour because there is such a short time available for the discussion of this Vote and there are so many hon. members who wish to speak on it. This is the first occasion in the time that I have been privileged to serve in this House that we have had the latest report of the Department of Police available to us when we have discussed the Police Vote. This is a matter for commendation and something we are very pleased about. I may say that it is an excellent report. The statistics are well presented and very well broken down from the point of view of the discussion of this Vote in this House. Indeed, when one looks at this report from year to year, one could I suppose say that it is a kaleidoscope of South African life. It represents all the difficulties and all the events which make up our day to day life in this country. On page 12 of the report there is even a new word which has been imported into the English language. I refer to the &#x201C;Bantuization&#x201D; of various Departments. The hon. the Minister has in fact shown himself to be a keen student of the English language in previous debates during this Session.</p>

<p>I think the enormity of the task of the Police Force is shown in this report if you consider that members of the Police Force travelled over 107 million miles in motor vehicles during the past year and that more than 2 million cases were committed for trial. All these cases require not only the opening of a docket, but investigation and the collection of statements by the Police as well as the giving of evidence by the Police. The task of the Police involves rescues, the use of dogs and helicopters. It also involves fighting terrorists in Rhodesia, the extension of our activities on the borders and even the manning of the vessels which have to keep a watch on trawlers and other ships which enter our territorial waters, although this is not dealt with in the report as far as I am aware. Having regard to the enormity of their task and to the expansion of their duties, there are some aspects of the report which are somewhat disturbing.</p>

<p>In the first place, it seems that the establishment is below par. What is disturbing is that more than 1,500 policemen purchased their discharge from the service during the course of last year. Of these 1,249 were Whites. The question which arises in this connection is, why is this happening? Why is the establishment below par? Mostly, I think, the answer must relate to their conditions of service, that these are not what they ought to be. Let us consider their conditions of service. Is there anyone else in the Public Service who does not get paid overtime in the circumstances and under the conditions policemen have to operate? After having investigated a case, they have to go to court. If, for example, they come across a drunken driver, they may have to spend three hours of their time on pure investigation and if they come off duty at five o’clock in the morning they have to be in court by nine o’clock despite the fact that it falls within their off-duty time. Yet they do not get paid for it. This is an example of the conditions policemen have to work under. The S.A. Police have to investigate traffic offences even if the local authority traffic police may be dealing with it. In short, I think the S.A. Police are overtaxed in their duties and this report indicates the respects in which they are overtaxed.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the crime of violence. In paragraph 5 of the report, hon. members will see that 3,799 people were committed to trial for murder. In 1,256 cases of apparent murder those responsible for it remain undetected. Of the 3,799 committed for trial 2,647 were acquitted. This is according to the report. Unless there is some other explanation for it, <i>prima facie</i> it seems that the Police need more <span class="col_7065-7066" refersTo="page_0682"/>time to concentrate on the investigations of the more serious types of crime against society and that less of their time should be taken up by other matters, especially those matters I am going to mention now. The report indicates that during the past year Police had to investigate and had to give evidence in court about 690,296 cases relating to curfew and pass offences, an increase over the previous year of some 60,000. Everyone of these cases have to be investigated by the Police irrespective of whether an official of the Department of Bantu Administration brings them in or reports them. In view of the large number of serious offences which the Police seem not to have been able to give their fullest attention &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Why do you say that? They might have been found guilty of culpable homicide.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>They might have been, but when something like half of those charged were acquitted and when something like 1,249 cases remain undetected, then I suggest &#x2026; The hon. the Deputy Minister may not have practised as an advocate although he carries that title, but he ought to know that a lot of people are acquitted, certainly. But how many are acquitted? When the Police have completed their docket and the Attorney-General decides this is a <i>prima facie</i> case many are still acquitted because of lack of a proper or incomplete investigation. And when one considers that the Police have to deal with about 700,000 pass offences, it is not surprising that they have no time to investigate all these crimes sufficiently. Surely, some other body could deal with these matters? Take, for instance, the question of traffic offences. Why do members of the S.A. Police have to investigate, e.g. take measurements, go round and collect statements and make up a docket, in respect of every single traffic accident that occurs? Surely local authorities and provincial authorities could deal with that?</p>

<p>There are many disturbing features about the conditions members of the force have to work under. Having regard to their conditions of service, the amount of work members of the S.A. Police have to do is quite fantastic. For that the whole country owes them a debt of gratitude. If we look at the Estimates we find that the emoluments of members of the S.A. Police are assessed in the most extraordinary way. For a constable up to a lieutenant the maximum is R3.000 per annum. Therefore, you can have a constable who earns more on account of the fact that he has been in the service longer than his station commander who is a warrant officer or a lieutenant. Sir, this does not seem to accord with normal practices; it does not make sense and does not provide the incentive that normally goes with promotions. The housing conditions of members of the S.A. Police will be dealt with by other hon. members who have made a greater study of it.</p>

<p>I should like to refer the hon. the Minister to page 12 of the report and ask him why there is such a disparity. There under the heading &#x201C;Buildings&#x201D; it is stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although the accommodation requirements of this department will entail an expenditure of approximately R22,872,000, only R3,870,450 was voted for the financial year.</block>

<p>Surely, Sir, this is a most serious state of affairs. Why is it that so little has been voted for the current year for so important a service as this? Having regard to the conditions of service and having regard to the scales of pay of members of the Police Force, I would have thought that something more could have been done in respect of housing. The Railway Administration does it and also the Prisons Department. Why cannot the same be done for the Police?</p>

<p>My time has expired and consequently I can only express the hope that we shall get some sort of explanation from the hon. the Minister. Of course, he will still hear a lot of argument about this from other hon. members on this side and we hope we shall get down to it and that the Minister will tell us why, in fact, so little has to be voted when so much is apparently needed. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#havemann">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is not often that one can agree with the hon. member for Durban (North) on so many points. I want to associate myself with certain aspects he raised on this Vote. We on this side of the House also want to congratulate the Department on the up to date report of the Department of Police and on the fact that it has been tabled. We want to go further than that and also express our gratitude for the way in which this report has been drawn up and for the work it reflects. Then I want to associate myself with the statement of the hon. member for Durban (North) that this report, when one analyses its figures, gives a very striking picture of the scope and the nature of the work of the Police. We realize what these men have to do. We realize that they are the men who have to patrol the streets, who have to patrol outlaying districts and who are guarding our borders. They combat crime from day to day, not crime as it used to exist many years ago, but crime which has kept up with technological developments of recent years. They also have to deal with more sophisticated crimes, with espionage and forgery and various other forms of crime. Because this is so, we should like to learn from the Minister, since this report gives us a picture of the activities of our policemen, whether he does not want to give us a more comprehensive picture &#x2014;the public outside is also waiting for this&#x2014;of the activities of these men and of the services they are rendering on our borders? I think not only the members of this House, but also the public outside would like to have a more complete picture of what these men are doing <span class="col_7067-7068" refersTo="page_0683"/>there and to what things they are exposed. It seems to me that because the Police Force is so successful we are beginning to take some things for granted. When one reads through this report, as the hon. member for Durban (North) also said, one is struck by the exceptional achievements of these men. But because of these very achievements the public is beginning to take them for granted as achievement follows achievement. We must have regard to the fact that we do not have a Police Force, which in numerical relation to our population, is stronger than those of other countries, when we have regard to the fact that in countries such as England and Wales, they have 1.6 policemen per 1,000 of the population, that New Zealand has 1.02 policemen per 1,000, that New South Wales has 1.04 policemen per 1,000 of the population, that the United States have 2 policemen per 1,000 of the population, and that we have Ï.79, ours is a perfectly normal ratio. Ours nevertheless is a Force that has to serve a very heterogeneous population over vast distances and that has to combat not only ordinary crime as the Forces in those countries do, but also communistic infiltration and the activities of terrorists on our borders. Only when we have regard to all these things do we realize how great the achievements of these men are.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with the statement of the hon. member for Durban (North) with regard to overtime. However, I should like to point out something else and something more positive, and that is that a member of the Police Force is a man who is always on duty 24 hours a day. They are the men who are pre-eminently exposed to temptation and provocation. Therefore, when one checks on the percentage of convictions of policemen on charges such as assault for instance, it strikes one that less than 1 per cent of Police Force members have been so convicted. This is an exceptional achievement on the part of these people who are subject to things like this and who constantly have the spotlight on every mistake they make.</p>

<p>I also want to associate myself with the statement of the hon. member for Durban (North) with regard to certain conditions of service. I particularly want to emphasize that the problem which is being experienced, especially in the rural areas, is that the newly married members of the Police Force are transferred. Of course, it is also sound policy not to have a policeman stationed at the same place for ever, precisely because of their working conditions. Such a policeman purchases his discharge from the service or he resigns, because housing he should like to have for his family is not always available at the place to which he is transferred. This is one of the most pressing problems in the Force and especially, in my experience, in the rural areas. At certain centres, such as Welkom, for example, we have excellent and well-appointed quarters, but at smaller places this is a bottleneck.</p>

<p>Before my time expires, I should like to raise another aspect to which reference is made on page 4 of the Report. Here I notice the exceptional keenness of these people to make use of bursaries for further academic training. Under the heading &#x201C;Academic Training&#x201D; one reads that this is borne out by the fact that there were 75 applications for the 10 bursaries granted this year. If these men are so eager and so keen, I want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister for these bursaries to be increased in number for people who want to make use of them. In various other departments and control boards we find the phenomenon that money which is available for bursaries is not taken up, whereas here we have the phenomenon that the number of applications exceeded the available bursaries by 700 per cent. Therefore I should like to make the plea to the hon. the Minister that this system of bursaries, which is proving to be so popular, should be extended.</p>

<p>Another statement made by the hon. member for Durban (North) was that the Police were wasting their time on what he called technical offences, but the irony of the matter is that it is in fact these so-called technical offences which, potentially, can lead to the serious crimes to which the hon. member wants the Police to devote their attention. Recently we had a question here from the hon. member for Orange Grove who wanted to know what the Police were doing in connection with handbag thefts or snatchings in Johannesburg. In his reply the Minister pointed out that this type of crime was being committed by loafers and vagrants and that these were the very people against whom the Police were taking strict action as regards these so-called technical offences as they were the ones who were doing this kind of thing. And then hon. members opposite ask what the Police are doing in connection with this matter. The question was put: If nothing is being done, why is nothing being done? The reply was that more intensive patrolling was being done for the very reason of restricting these people. They are not such innocent people who commit only minor, technical offences. Many of these offences we have to deal with, include ones relating to the presence of prohibited immigrants. Therefore the measures which are being taken do not relate only to the question of solving crimes but also to the question of the prevention of crime, and that is what is indicated by those figures. If we do not do this, we shall soon enough hear from that side of this House: The Police are failing in their duty.</p>

<p>After having brought these few matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister, I should like to touch on a local matter in conclusion. I want to express to the Minister my gratitude for the provision which has been made for the police station at Viljoenskroon. This is welcomed by all and we have been waiting for it for many years. I should like to use the last minute of my time to ask the hon. the Minister to give very serious consideration to the <span class="col_7069-7070" refersTo="page_0684"/>representations which have been made in respect of a police station at Bothaville, because functionally that police station is very unsuitable, and I should like to make the request that this matter should please be placed on the list of priorities.

<p>I also want to start off by complimenting the Department on producing their report timeously. This report starts off with a roll of honour and I want to express our respect for these men whose names appear on the roll of honour and our sympathy to their families for the loss of their breadwinners and dearly beloved ones who were killed in the course of duty. These men were not all Permanent Force members, as we also see that there were three reservists among them and that they included Whites and non-Whites. They were killed in the course of duty and I am sure the House would like to express sympathy with the families of those men.</p>

<p>Before I get on to the other troubles of the Police Force, I want to say a word about the Minister. When the Minister was still the Deputy Minister he showed great promise, and we were glad when he got promotion, but he started off rather unfortunately. We remember the speech about &#x201C;some of my best friends are Jews&#x201D;, and then there was the D’Oliveira incident, when he stopped a political meeting to announce that D’Oliveira had not been selected for the M.C.C. Team; and then finally we had his exhibition here in this House when the hon. member for Durban (North) raised the question of the deaths of the prisoners in the police van. I must say that the reaction of the Minister was a most remarkable one. We never expected it from him. Why the Minister should take such exception I do not know. He started off by saying that the matter had been raised purely for political reasons by the hon. member for Durban (North) in competition with the hon. member for Houghton and he said that the hon. member should not show such disinterest in the country’s interests abroad. He said that the matter had only been raised to embarrass our country; that merely by raising the matter in this House we were embarrassing this country abroad. Sir, nothing could have done our country more good than the raising of this matter in this House. Sir, the tragic death of those prisoners was already world news. The whole world knew about those tragic deaths, in respect of which we all expressed our regret. The world knew of the court case; the world read the remarks of the judge, so we were not bringing anything to the notice of the world that they did not already know about, and the best thing that could have happened in the interests of this country was the fact that the Opposition raised this matter in this assembly for discussion. It showed the rest of the world that this democratic Parliament takes an interest in and protects the rights not only of the Whites but of all the other groups in this country. Sir, if white prisoners had been involved and the matter had been raised in the House, the Minister would have taken no exception to it at all, but the fact that non-Whites were involved caused him to express his displeasure. Why is he so touchy when matters affecting the interests of the non-Whites are raised? Sir, it is not only we on this side who objected to his attitude; he was criticized, as he knows very well, by his own Press which pointed out that it was the duty of the Opposition to raise matters of this nature. We shall continue to raise matters of this nature when necessary; we shall not be intimidated by the Minister or any other member on the other side. A matter of this importance to the Government would have been raised in Parliament if it had happened in any other country and the Minister would have been called upon to give an account. Why should the position be different in this Parliament? What did the hon. the Minister do? All he did was to do what the judge said the police witnesses had done: They gave an explanation but they gave no excuses.</p>

<p>His explanation was that so many prisoners had to be conveyed; that they had to travel so many miles; that so many policemen were involved. The Minister said that there were enough vehicles; it was just unfortunate that on that day large numbers of vehicles were out of commission. But that is not the point, Sir. If the vehicles were out of commission those prisoners should not have been conveyed. The Minister said that he had issued an instruction that they were not to be conveyed. Obviously his instruction was ignored. The Minister has appointed a commission to go into this question and we want to know whether he can give us any progress report at this stage and tell us what that commission has done.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another matter that I want to raise in regard to public opinion abroad. In yesterday’s <i>Tribune</i> you will see that there is a report to the effect that the chairman of the Durban branch of a Coloured political party, a Mr. Le Roux, has complained that he has been visited several times during the past week by the Security Police. This matter of the Security Police interfering with members of non-white political parties not favourably disposed towards the Government was raised here last year by the hon. member for Karoo. Reports of this kind frequently appear, and these reports do our country no good abroad either. Therefore it is our duty to raise the matter here and to ask the Minister whether his Security Police are interfering unnecessarily with non-white politicians whose parties are opposed to the policies of the Government? The Minister has no doubt seen this report, and I shall be glad if he will tell us in his reply whether this in fact has <span class="col_7071-7072" refersTo="page_0685"/>been happening; whether the police have been interfering with these Coloured politicians in Durban and, if so, why? With regard to the Police themselves I want to mention that I have raised the question of the Police Force in the Transkei every year and I want to do so again now. I do not have the time to go through the whole case in their favour, but the hon. the Minister will know that I have complained that the Police in the Transkei are being discriminated against in that they do not receive the allowances civil servants receive. I want to say that this is most unfair.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Of course they do. What is the hon. the Minister talking about? I have given him all the figures. Civil servants receive up to R70 in the case of a senior civil servant which civil servants in other parts of the country do not receive. It is a special Transkei allowance. When I served on a Select Committee I found out that civil servants do not only receive an allowance in the Transkei but also if they work in any territorial area and are serving territorial authorities. But the Police, the Post Office and the Railway employees in that area do not receive the allowance. The civil servants do, and my complaint is that there should not be discrimination against other branches of the service, namely the railwaymen, the Post Office and the Police Force. The Police Force are stationed in outlying places and are not as well situated as ordinary civil servants who receive allowances are. The Police Force in the rest of South Africa also serve in isolated spots, but in these isolated spots there are white farmers and the police have some social contact. White people are leaving the Transkei more and more, however. In the rural areas there are very few white traders left, and the policemen find that their amenities and the social activities they are used to are going. They can no longer take part in sport, which they used to enjoy, because of the dwindling number of the white people. I will be glad if the hon. the Minister will tell me why I am wrong in saying that the Police do not receive these allowances, and I will be glad to hear if the Government is going to change its attitude towards policemen and will start paying them allowances too. This dissatisfaction amongst policemen does not only apply to the Transkei, but they are dissatisfied about their conditions. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) has referred to the question of their housing. We know that most of the Prisons Department personnel and members of the Defence Force are housed by the Government, but in the Police Force it is not so. We know that members of the Police Force find it difficult to obtain housing loans. We know that they can obtain hundred per cent loans but then they have to repay these loans to the building societies. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is an important matter which I want to raise with the hon. the Minister before I reply to what the hon. member for Transkei said.</p>

<p>As the representative of an area which stretches to the Kunene River which lies on the border of Angola, I should like to say a few words about the terrorist threat there. We are all, of course, interested in what goes on on our borders and further to the north, and it goes without saying that the farmers living in those remote parts are more worried about what is going on there than other people are. All that we know about events there is what we read now and then in a brief newspaper report. I would consequently appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would give us more information about that matter, with due consideration, of course, for the security of the people there and of the country in general. We want to know, for example, whether the hon. the Minister has sufficient men there, how they are trained and whether they are specially trained for that purpose. A short while ago we read that horses were being used there in police manoeuvres and I should like to know whether this is true and whether it can be done efficiently. Something which is very important and which we should like to know is whether there is any way in which the public in South-West Africa can contribute to that effort. I want to give the hon. the Minister the assurance that he can count on the wholehearted support of the entire South-West Africa public if he should need anything in that connection. I can inform hon. members that the terrain there in the North is probably of the most difficult that there is, and that the area is altogether a morass, particularly during the summer months, from November onwards. There is also impenetrable bushveld, so much so that the patrols there must endure the greatest hardships. Because this is so and because we realize that the men there in the North are risking their lives so that we can live safely here, I should now like to appeal to all charitable organizations in South-West Africa to devote a part of their time to collecting funds to provide those comforts which, of necessity, cannot be supplied to these men by the Government. I am thinking particularly&#x2014;and I want to say this now, because it is the last chance I will get before we adjourn&#x2014;of the Christmas and New Year ahead, and I should like to appeal to those bodies and organizations to make these comforts available in good time. The police station in Windhoek has the necessary transport and can be regarded as <span class="col_7073-7074" refersTo="page_0686"/>the chief contact point through which these organizations can operate in connection with these matters. I take it that the hon. the Minister will have no objection if the head office is at the disposal of these bodies. I should therefore be glad, having thus sketched the position, if the hon. the Minister could perhaps give us some reassuring answers in connection with the position in the North.</p>

<p>In connection with the accusation against the hon. the Minister by the hon. member for Transkei, in respect of the actions of the police and the death of prisoners in a police van, I just want to mention that I was in the House and it was my observation that the hon. the Minister accused the Opposition and the hon. member for Houghton of politically-motivated conduct, not because they raised the matter here, but because of the way in which they raised it. The hon. Opposition used the incident for an attack on the Department instead of using their time to express their gratitude for the praiseworthy action of the hon. Minister and his Department, who, immediately after it had occurred, brought the matter directly to court without a preparatory examination and immediately appointed a commission of inquiry, with the Chief Magistrate as chairman, to put the matter right at once. Instead of that the hon. Opposition attacked the hon. the Minister as if it had all been done wilfully. As the hon. member said, the matter was already before the court and was not submitted to us for our information. Everything was thrashed out in court where the facts were presented. The judge has already given his judgment and expressed his criticism. The necessary steps have also been taken. It was because of the way in which things were done here that the hon. the Minister naturally reacted by saying that the matter had been raised for political purposes.</p>

<p>In the few minutes at my disposal I also want to express my gratitude and appreciation for the competent way in which the police are dealing with matters in South-West Africa. It is a very large area with a small population and the Police work under difficult circumstances. We also want to express gratitude for the way in which they do their job. I just want to mention that South-West Africa is in the fortunate position of having accommodation available for almost all the members of the Police Force.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to follow further along the line of the hon. member for Omaruru, not only in regard to the Police serving on the borders of Angola, but also the Police serving in Rhodesia and elsewhere where there is terrorist danger or terrorist infiltration. My information is that the training and the facilities which are provided for the men who are on that duty, are good. But I do not believe that it should be up to charitable organizations, such as the hon. member for Omaruru mentioned, to provide the facilities to counteract the difficulties of the service that the people are doing there. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister, if he could tell us, what the allowances are which are paid and what privileges or benefits are granted in order to make up for the difficult conditions under which those policemen work. These policemen are guarding our safety in South Africa and are protecting us just as soldiers protect their country in times of war. I believe we are not paying enough attention to that group of young South Africans on whom much of our safety and the safety of the country depend.</p>

<p>I want to refer, for instance, to the aspect of compensation. I have made inquiries and I have been informed that if a policeman is injured or killed on duty, irrespective of where that may take place, he is protected under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. In case of death, that means that there is paid two months’ normal pay, or R300, whichever is the greater, plus 40 per cent of the normal pension which would then be due to that person if he were injured on duty. These are mainly younger men and at that stage of their service their pension would be very small if they were to retire. I believe that 40 per cent of pension plus two months’ pay, for death on service, is not the sort of compensation which South Africa owes to people serving in the field. If a soldier is injured or killed on duty, he falls under the provisions of the Military Pension Act. The provisions of that Act are very much more generous. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to consider placing policemen on active service on the same footing in regard to compensation as soldiers who are on active service, defending the country. I also plead with the hon. the Minister to make the allowances and privileges granted to these men some compensation for the danger and discomfort which they suffer. I believe that certain facilities have been improved; paraffin refrigerators, and so on have been provided. However, unfortunately an offer of free beer was refused because it was not regarded as being in their interests. I think we have grown out of that Mother Grundy stage and I think that that approach is something which is not in keeping with the responsibilities which these men carry.</p>

<p>I want to pass on to another matter and it is that of pensioners who have retired from the Police Force prior to the date on which they were able to participate in the medical benefits of the normal serving policemen. I think the date was 1964. Those who retire subsequently may continue to contribute and to enjoy the protection against illness, whereas that small band who retired prior to that date, are denied this privilege. I realize that this is a question of actuaries and of a fund which calculates its liabilities, but I believe that the number of pensioners affected is so small and this hardship is so real that the State should subsidize the Medical Aid Fund, if necessary, in order to enable it to include that small group and give them protection. It <span class="col_7075-7076" refersTo="page_0687"/>would come to a very small amount, but it would be an additional recompense to people who have given their lives in service to law and order and to security in South Africa. I also believe that the amount of subsidy required would not be a great burden on the taxpayers as a whole. So, I plead again with the hon. the Minister to investigate whether there is not some method by which these pensioners can be brought into the scheme.</p>

<p>In the moment or two left, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to give some information on a local issue. That is that of the new Police Headquarters in Durban. I should like to know about the progress on the building and the anticipated date of completion of the new headquarters at Old Fort Road together with the ancillary services. The hon. the Minister knows the present position. A block of flats has been taken over for temporary housing. There are a number of suburban police stations which are due to be closed down and which will be centralized in the new headquarters. Centralization has tremendous advantages, but there are disadvantages involved. I am interested to know, firstly, when the new headquarters will be established; and flowing from that, when and at what pace the closing down of other police stations in Durban is likely to take place. Because I believe that when that happens, we will have to do something either to replace the old &#x201C;bobby on the beat&#x201D; or to have some method of communication which will bring the public into closet communication with one centralized police station. If there is trouble at any rush period, the vehicular police will be unable to move through the traffic jam to get to a trouble spot quickly. A great deal of planning will be needed to ensure not only that there are sufficient patrols, but that they are so stationed that they are not going to be cut off from where they are required in any emergency. I do not believe that the policeman in a van can ever replace the &#x201C;bobby on the beat&#x201D; when it comes to local confidence of the public in the Police Force. I realize the problems and the difficulties. But I do believe that in a heavily built up area, such as the centre of a city, such as my own constituency, there must be a certain number of policemen on the ground, going around amongst the people, where they can bring about the feeling that &#x201C;here is law and order right amongst us&#x201D;, and not a van which they see passing by.</p>

<p>While on that, Mr. Chairman, I feel that something must be done about the manner of that passing by. If one hears the tyres squealing on police vans and one thinks of what some of the drivers are doing to the vehicles and to safety, it makes one shiver. One can imagine that if there is an emergency, they must take chances. But when they are going to investigate a normal crime, there is no need for some of this dangerous driving which one sees. I think the accident rate will bear it out. There seems to be some sort of competition to see who can make the loudest noise with the tyres, taking a corner on two wheels. This is one aspect of the vehicular patrols which I think is going to require some attention. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I also want to express my gratitude to the South African Police for what they are doing on all fronts to preserve the peace and quiet which we enjoy. The peace and quiet which we enjoy in this country are, in the first place, attributable to a strong government being in charge of affairs, and in the second place, to a strong arm of the law. I think that to-day we can pay no better tribute to the South African Police than was paid to them in the following words by the poet G. A. Watermeyer (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>We are the watchers on the tower. Raising ramparts in the crisis hour;</p>

<p>We are the men who, weaned of fear.</p>

<p>Our strength against all odds must bear.</p>

<p>Our blood among familiar stones must weave Our last farewells before we leave.</p>

<p>We are the bit that curbs all crime, A child’s street guide at crossing time, We are the order&#x2014;we are the law The eye that His Great Visions draw;</p>

<p>We are the buffalo whose crouched head Turns back hordes in sudden dread.</p>

<p>I think that, particularly during the recent period of terrorism, we can truly say that the S.A. Police are the &#x201C;buffalo whose crouched head turns back hordes in sudden dread&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The S.A. Police report points to an unbelievable diversity and mass of investigations, prosecutions and convictions. It goes without saying that in the course of the investigations involved, the police must have been exposed to a tremendous amount of temptation. In my opinion it speaks volumes that, in the course of these investigations and with the great amount of work which has to be handled, only 33 white policemen were dismissed out of a total of more than 16,000. In my opinion this is a remarkable achievement for the report year concerned.</p>

<p>There is a tendency in the whole Western world, and specifically in America, towards what the Americans call polarization. Crime groups, leftists and vandalists, polarize to one side and, in underhand ways, present the Police as supreme dictators, persecutors and sadists. When the police have to act harshly, use is made of every opportunity to make them pay for this. Charges of crimes as serious as murder are made against them in circumstances which do not justify this. In America, for example, this tendency causes the police to polarize to the right. One finds to an increasing extent that those two poles are very hostile to each other and act accordingly. So serious have the onslaughts of the leftists become that throughout America, on a national scale, so-called police committees have been established among the general public, with, <span class="col_7077-7078" refersTo="page_0688"/>as their slogan &#x201C;support your local police committees&#x201D;. They assist with evidence in defence of the police. Where a policeman is unlawfully charged, funds are employed to assist in his defence, etc. The question now is: Is it desirable for us to have this polarization in the Republic as well? Is it in the country’s interest that our police should also, to an increasing extent, be judged as a persecuted, sadistic group? I think that the reply on both sides of this House is that we do not want this. I do not think that we can infer from the actions of any of the groups on both sides of the House that this is what is wanted. But I think that we should most certainly act more judiciously, not because we ourselves want this kind of thing, but so that our actions cannot be exploited by leftists and fellow-travellers. With all due respect and with a full sense of responsibility I want to say that something like the flash debate which was called for here a few weeks ago, could also be seized upon by such people in their efforts to cast suspicion on the Police; I am not speaking of the merits of the case; it is most certainly a democratic Opposition’s duty to expose, in a responsible way, any shortcomings in the police or in the Government, but to request a flash debate about such a matter is to dramatize it more than it deserves and to afford the leftists unnecessary ammunition.</p>

<p>In addition, I want to come to the matter which has already been mentioned by an hon. member on this side of the House, and I want to elaborate on it. I want to deal with the Police Comfort Fund. This is a fund which had its origins in the Second World War, but it is a fund which is now chiefly used for the police serving on our borders, whether internally or externally. I feel at liberty to say something about this fund because my own constituency has set a very good example in this connection. My constituency enthusiastically collected money for the fund and handed over a large amount to the Commissioner of Police, as well as making a large donation to the Army and to the Portuguese fighters. I want to plead here to-day for each community to collect for the fund on an organized basis. It is not a question here of feeling that the Government is not creating the necessary facilities there; it is a question of local communities, by contributing to this fund, indicating to the police that we are infused with the highest admiration and gratitude for the selfless service which our boys are doing under difficult circumstances in far-off posts.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Kroonstad quoted a poem here. I want to congratulate him on reading it out because I think it is most applicable and appropriate as far as the South African Police are concerned. I will be excused, I think, if I say that I am slightly biased towards the police, because I speak as an old officer of the S.A. Police and I have always been proud of having been one. At the outset I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his appointment as Minister of Police. I am quite certain that he will do his best for the Force as a whole and for the public in general. It is my great pleasure to thank the Commissioner of Police, his officers, his N.C.O.S and his men, as well as the Police Reservists, both white and non-white, for the law and order they have maintained during the past year and for the wonderful service they have rendered to South Africa. I notice that during the past year 16 members of the Force lost their lives during the execution of their duty. We salute them in passing and we sympathize with their dependants, but we hope that those dependants will be looked after in the way they should be looked after. I also notice that no fewer than 992 members of the Force were decorated, a very large number of them for long and devoted service, and we on this side of the House want to congratulate them on their service. I also notice that 33 Whites and 370 non-Whites were dismissed, which is an exceedingly low percentage in a force of nearly 31,000 men. But one thing I am glad of. It does show, very often contrary to public opinion, that discipline in the Police Force is very strictly enforced.</p>

<p>Then I think of the men on our borders, who guard the borders for us. Several of them have already given up their lives. It is said that no man can show greater love for his country than when he is prepared to give up his life. We can say that they died that we may live. But they do not only face the bullets of terrorists. There are other annoying things up there in the bush. It is thick bush in the Rhodesian teak section, and the mopani section of South-West Africa. There are snakes, scorpions, elephants, buffaloes, crocodiles in the rivers, and lions, but the most annoying is the smallest, the mosquito and the mopani fly, which thinks nothing of sitting three deep on one’s bare arm. I mention this because I hope that they look after not only the pleasurable side of comforts but also that side of it, because when you are in the bush there and you are tormented by these things, you must have something to ward them off. I think of the two men, a white warrant officer and a non-white, who were shot by a terrorist on a boat on the Zambezi. They both recovered from their wounds, but the warrant officer was buried last week as the result of his wounds, and the non-white, I believe, has lost his sight. It is these things that make us think of the serious job these men are doing in protecting our borders. The hon. member for Omaruru mentioned gifts and comforts. They should have all the comforts we can give them, but I also say, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) said, that that is something for the Department to do. The taxpayer must pay for that. We must not ask for charity as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>Then there are a few small matters I wish to raise to make the policeman’s lot a happier one. The one is the national housing loans they are given to buy homes. I am told that a constable with nine years’ service is given <span class="col_7079-7080" refersTo="page_0689"/>R5,600. A lieutenant with 20 years’ service was given R6,500. Loans normally vary from R3,000 to R5,400. I wonder whether the Minister can tell me where anyone can buy a decent house in a decent locality at that figure. Surely even a policeman has pride and likes to live in a decent area. With that amount available they have to turn towards sub-economic schemes, which I think, in view of the service they render the country, is altogether out of the question. The South African Police Provident Fund has millions on hand. They possess large stocks of Government bonds and other similar stocks. They have, I think, over R5 million out on bond. Is it not possible to build flats and to let those flats at a reasonable rental to our policemen? Why must members of the Force live miles and miles away from their work and then have to come back, as mentioned here by one member, after he has been on night duty, to attend court at 11 o’clock the next morning? Sir, this is something which should receive very serious consideration. As far as flats are concerned, I want to ask whether it would not be possible to allow members of the Force to buy flats in blocks of flats? After all, the S.A. Police Provident Fund belongs to the men and they should get the benefit of it. Then, Sir, there is the question of free uniforms. Year after year we harp on this matter. Members of the Department of Defence and of sister services are given free uniforms. Why not give members of the South African Police two free uniforms a year? I notice that provision is made in the Estimates for R193,000 for clothing allowances. I do not know whether this is to clothe police reservists or not; it would be interesting to know what this large amount is for. Then there is the question of maternity grants. This maternity grant of R10 has been given for years and years. Prices have gone up, even in this field. I notice that one man had to pay no less than R66 for the hospitalization of his wife and R24 for medical expenses, a total of R90. That is what he had to pay for an ordinary confinement without complications. Surely confinement expenses should be treated as ordinary medical expenses. After all, even policemen are entitled to families. I believe that in the case of complicated confinements it is left to the Public Service Commission to decide what proportion of the confinement costs they would pay and that each case is treated on its merits. Then there is another matter which has already been mentioned by a previous speaker and that is the question of ordinary salary scales. I think it is wrong that when a man gets promotion he is not given a higher salary scale. We have constables, second-class sergeants, first-class sergeants, warrant officers and lieutenants, to mention a few of the ranks, all on the same scale. Fancy a constable who has no ambition and who stays for years in this rank drawing a larger salary than his lieutenant! [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>All of us on this side of the House appreciate the words which the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, addressed to the hon. the Minister and our Police Force; we appreciate this. Sir, when my hon. Leader was still Minister of Justice he had the following to say at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the South African Police Force&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is not only a beautiful country, it is also a safe and prosperous country, and it will remain so. This is not only the policy and the ideal of the Government, but it shall also be the endeavour of every policeman.</block>

<p>Sir, on this path which we, as a community in South Africa, are following, I believe that we shall do everything in our power to maintain these fine aims in the years ahead, and I have no doubt that the South African Police Force will also, in the years ahead, as in past years, endeavour to keep South Africa the peaceful country it has been, and still is, to-day. But one wonders whether people who are at times so sceptical and so unnecessarily critical, directly or by implication, have ever considered in what difficult circumstances the South African Policeman finds himself in this modern world of to-day. What are the conditions in the modern world in which we live, under which the South African Policeman must maintain law and order to-day? It would certainly be childish for us to argue that the international trend of superficialization, decay and agitation has not left its dreadful mark on South African society. It is this type of decay which is referred to in certain circles as an aspect of the permissive society. It is those international trends which have, unfortunately, also left their dreadful mark here and there on South African society. But, apart from these international trends, our South African Police Force is to-day, as in the past, also faced with particular conditions which are, in fact, unique to South Africa, and I just want to refer to a few of them. In the last two decades the South African population, which had previously been known to a large extent as a rural population, became urbanized. This happened within two decades, two very short decades, because a decade in the life of a nation is like a day in the life of an individual. It is general knowledge that when, virtually overnight, one has a large population shift, this is accompanied by the development of socioeconomic problems. There is also a second important difference in the task of our Police Force, and this is that as a result of the strong Government which we have to-day, and have had for the past 21 years, this State has experienced a greater industrial explosion and development than any modern state in the world. This has also resulted in a heaping together of people&#x2014;actually an absence of decentralization&#x2014;and the development of socio-economic problems which have not facilitated the task of our South African Police.</p>

<p>Sir, let me also refer to a third specific state of affairs with which our Police Force is faced&#x2014;this <span class="col_7081-7082" refersTo="page_0690"/>is the fact that the present generation, and our Police Force, are being called upon to maintain, perpetuate and extend a 300 year-old pattern of living, and to continue to do so in the years ahead. There are forces which do not like this pattern of living that we are maintaining, extending and establishing here in South Africa. There are bodies and elements in the world, and individuals in South Africa, who want to destroy this pattern of living, and this makes the task of our South African Police Force much more difficult. Then there is also a fifth factor which is that, as a result of the multi-racial nature of our country, our various languages, cultures, habits and customs, our Police Force must carry out specialized tasks. The members of our Police Force must carry out very delicate tasks. On the one hand they are faced with primitive communities in out of the way places, and on the other hand with highly civilized communities. The South African Policeman is frequently called upon to handle delicate situations, and for those situations he must have special knowledge. It does not make his task easier; in many cases it makes it much more difficult. It is, therefore, not strange that even a newspaper such as the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> has, on occasion, written, &#x201C;South Africa is a country which must be one of the most difficult in the world to police&#x201D;. The <i>Cape Times</i> also reacted to this and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is not an easy country to police, but having local conditions in mind and taking their total conduct into consideration, the South African Police are a force which compares favourably with any in the world and are considerably better than many, even in countries reputedly Western.</block>

<p>Then there is also a sixth special matter which makes the task of the South African Police more difficult, and that is that their geographic area of operation has been extended. Through no fault of this Government, the South African Police have had to stand sentry along the Zambesi in order to protect civilization in Southern Africa. On this occasion we, as a community here in South Africa, can justifiably pay tribute to those who have already had to make big sacrifices while guarding all that we South Africans hold dear. One frequently asks oneself the question: Are we as South Africans aware of the big sacrifices which the South African Police Force must make, and of the great services and the great job of work which they must do there in the far north. Although it is no one’s plea to-day that the State should not honour its obligations to these men, I want to say it is up to every South African to give those men in the far north every tangible proof, at every possible opportunity, of their appreciation of the services they are rendering and of their contribution to the maintenance of civilization here in the southern corner of Africa. This fine mother country of ours can never allow those terrorists with their devilish plans to penetrate to the south. The South African Police stand between them and us. Since we can enjoy our sleep in peace, it remains our duty to furnish tangible proof, at every opportunity, of our gratitude to them for what they are doing, proof in the form of packages, edibles, fruit, etc. This is but scant evidence of our gratitude to a lot of young men who are prepared to offer their lives for their mother country here in the south. If we review the position prevailing here in South Africa, in contrast to conditions prevailing in other comparable Western countries, we can say that, in the first place, our position is attributable to a stable Government during the past 21 years. But we must remember that the Government could only maintain its stability with the help of our Public Servants, including members of our Police Force. Without their co-operation we could not have made a success of that. It is with their help that we have peace in this country to-day. Without being malicious we may look at other Western countries, countries which have made such a great contribution to our civilization here. We find it regrettable that J. Edgar Hoover, head of the F.B.I., has had to say the following&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure we all agree with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) that the Police have to do a lot of dangerous work and that many of them act very courageously indeed. I also think it is absurd that we should overload our Police with duties in connection with this enormous number of statutory offences. This results in an intolerable burden being placed not only on the Police, but also on the prisons. For all the talk we have in this country, talk about law and order, it does not seem to have occurred to anybody within this Chamber that we have one of the largest average daily prison populations in the Western world &#x2014;more than double, in absolute figures, of that of Great Britain with a population of 55 million against our estimated 19 million. A large percentage of our average daily prison population are people sent to gaol for statutory offences. I think the hon. the Minister, who has to carry the brunt of the tragic occurrence earlier this year when three prisoners died in a police van, should make known to his colleagues in Bantu Administration that an intolerable task is, in fact, being placed on the shoulders of our Police in trying to implement this system which has been imposed on this country as a result of the Government’s policy. I do not think any design for new police vans, or anything of that nature, will ever alter the fact that it is not going to <span class="col_7083-7084" refersTo="page_0691"/>be possible to transport prisoners backwards and forwards between gaols and Bantu commissioners’ courts without overcrowding. This has been the practice for many many years and this tragic occurrence only brought it to light. If one realizes that within the Johannesburg municipal district alone 700 Africans are being conveyed daily between gaols and Bantu commissioners’ courts, one can realize what sort of a task is facing our Police. I hope the hon. the Minister is not going to take any of this criticism personally, nor any one of his policemen. After all, some of my best friends are policemen. [Interjections.] Well, I have been waiting the whole Session to get that one in! Let me tell the hon. the Minister that very honestly. Before I leave this matter, I want to say to the Minister that I hope he is giving attention to the matter I have raised with him twice already, at one-monthly intervals, i.e. the question of <i>ex gratia</i> compensation to the widows of the three men who were suffocated to death in the police van. I hope he can tell us how much progress has been made in this matter.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the question of arrests and detentions by the Police in terms of the Terrorism Act. I raised this matter under the Justice Vote and I stated then that I thought in certain respects the use of the very vast powers which the Minister and the Police have under the Terrorism Act was being abused. I have the gravest misgivings in this regard in the light of certain cases which have come to light already. I have mentioned before the case of the Rustenburg tribesmen. Originally they were arrested on a charge of alleged murder, following a tribal dispute. On one person an interim order was served preventing him from being interrogated by the Police and then, promptly, the charge of murder was withdrawn the following day and all these people were arrested under the Terrorism Act&#x2014;a most extraordinary set of circumstances.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the number of deaths which have occurred while people have been held by the Police <i>incommunicado,</i> as this Act allows them to do. As a matter of fact, there have been four such deaths already. Two of those were suicide, one of which is now subject to inquest proceedings. Here I may say that the evidence so far gives rise to much misgivings. Of one other it was stated that he died either of TB or pneumonia. I do not know why it should have been so difficult to decide which of the two it was. The fourth one, according to the official report, slipped on a piece of soap and fatally injured himself. I think it is imperative that under Acts like these, Acts which give tremendous powers to the Police, <i>inter alia,</i> to deny access to the courts, legal assistance, etc., the most narrow scrutiny by the Minister be constantly directed at the manner in which these powers are being exercised. No doubt the hon. the Minister has taken note of the remarks made by Judges when these cases served before them. One Judge, in the case of the Bukhubeng people, the Rustenburg case I have mentioned already, said that the court owed the public an explanation why this man was suddenly detained under the Terrorism Act and thereby removed from the jurisdiction of the court. &#x201C;There is much room for abuse. Should not the Police urge that the whole matter be ventilated?&#x201D; Should it not be the Minister of Police who should ventilate it? Anyhow, this is one thing which causes me grave concern, the fact that in the Mbindi case the Government settled for R3,000. This is a case where a person complained that he was tortured while being held under the Terrorism Act. Then there is the Francis case, an Indian who was held for something like 421 days, so I understand, in solitary confinement. He too was being held under the Terrorism Act without ever being charged with anything. As a matter of fact, he gave the most unsatisfactory evidence in the case in which he was called upon to give evidence. I understand he was not even properly cross-examined because his evidence was obviously irrelevant. When he complained that he was badly treated while under detention the Judge’s comment simply was that it was not the concern of the court. However, the prosecutor was meant to follow up this allegation. Also in this regard I should like to know what has been done.</p>

<p>There is the name of one officer which occurs with alarming regularity in all of these cases of alleged ill-treatment. I hope the hon. the Minister is aware of whom I am referring to; if not, I shall give the name to him because in practically every case involving the Special Branch and involving charges of ill-treatment the name of this man crops up over and over again. I should like to have some explanation, as the court in fact urged, and to which we are entitled.</p>

<p>I wonder whether it has occurred to the hon. the Minister that he should do something about trigger-happy Mr. Sam? This is the café owner who claims he has already shot dead eight people. The hon. the Minister in a reply to a question of mine said he shot two people dead. Several Africans and one white man that we know of were shot by this café owner. I know that under the Criminal Procedure Act anybody is entitled to arrest without warrant and indeed if somebody is resisting arrest he can be apparently shot dead in so doing without charges being laid against the man who shot him. However, the courts have held that one should not use any more force than is being used against one. I cannot understand how it is that this man gets away with case after case, that no charge is ever laid against him and that the Police apparently think it perfectly all right for Mr. Sam to continue to have the use of a weapon. This is a most extraordinary case. In every case the people whom he has shot, as far as I can understand from the newspaper reports, were people who have been fleeing from him. So his own life has evidently not been in danger. As far as we know, even if goods have been <span class="col_7085-7086" refersTo="page_0692"/>stolen, this is not a capital offence. Why this man should over and over again be allowed to take the law into his own hands without any repercussion, is quite beyond me.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a typical answer from the rear benches, &#x201C;Skiet horn dood&#x201D;. Anyway, those were three of the matters I wished to raise to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I now want to also raise one other matter with the hon. the Minister, namely whether the Minister is satisfied that complete impartiality has been exercised by the Police with regard to student protests? I want to start at once by saying I pay the highest tribute to the Police Force in the Cape. I think they handled the recent student protests with the utmost good sense. There were no ugly incidents despite, I might say, considerable provocation from an M.P., who apparently was trying to encourage a certain gang of young people to attack the students who were protesting. But the Police themselves behaved in an exemplary fashion in the Cape. I want to know why the same impartiality could not have been displayed at the Rand during the recent protests? [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to reply to a few allegations which the hon. member for Houghton made. She spoke of the arrests in terms of the Terrorism Act. I think the hon. member for Houghton is aware of the fact that there are certain security measures embodied in that Act in respect of prisoners. Hon. members will remember that that subject was debated in this House. A report is sent to the Minister of Justice every three months. The Minister keeps abreast of what is happening to those people. I do not think that the hon. member’s criticism was justified. She quoted four cases. Two people committed suicide. It is, of course, extremely likely that those suicide attempts were attributable to a sense of guilt. As is often the case, those persons probably decided to take their own lives rather than give evidence against their companions who were also criminals. The other person died of tuberculosis. The way in which the hon. member for Houghton tried to suggest here that the doctors could not determine whether death was due to tuberculosis or to another disease is, in my humble opinion, beneath the dignity of this House. I am quite prepared to accept that that person died of tuberculosis, or whatever other disease. The other individual slipped on a cake of soap. The strangeness of this accident proves the truth of what took place there. If the police wanted to tell an untruth, it would have been much easier for them to think up a better story than that such a person had slipped on a cake of soap.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also spoke of &#x201C;trigger happy Mr. Sam&#x201D;. As far as &#x201C;trigger happy Mr. Sam&#x201D; is concerned, I am altogether satisfied that if he in any way misused the weapons in his possession, the Police would already have confiscated them. But I think that the hon. member does not give sufficient consideration to the fact that every person is entitled to afford proper protection to his property. When burglars break in, and when he is possibly in danger of his life, I think it is quite justifiable to stop them by shooting them. In the last case to which, I think, the hon. member referred, the burglar was in fact, shot through the leg in order to foil an attempt at escape. When one begins a criminal career, when one breaks into a certain shop in order to steal, one does so fully at one’s own risk. Then burglars realize that there could possibly be an armed person inside such a shop. In my humble opinion people must of course not come along and complain, particularly not in Parliament, if they get hurt there.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the students. As far as the students are concerned, we also want to say to the Police that we admire their patience with this group of young people who, in my humble opinion, are incited by people from outside and also at times by politicians. I have found it quite striking that the first person who quickly went and held a meeting there was the hon. member for Houghton. If there is anything to complain about it is the fact that responsible politicians endorse such irresponsible actions by students.</p>

<p>I should like to congratulate the Commissioner of Police warmly on this fine Report which he has submitted. I want to refer to page 8, where reference is made to the arrest of Yuriy Loginov. In this case I really think that we may congratulate our Police, particularly the Security Police, on the arrest of this spy and on everything which resulted from that arrest. I really think this is an achievement which is, in fact, unequalled in the world. This is quite probably why it was specially mentioned in this Report. I also want to refer to the roll of honour which appears at the very beginning of this report. One bitterly regrets the fact that there is a roll of honour, because it actually lists people who have all died. But all these people have died as a result of the services they rendered to the State and in the course of their duties. I think that we are extremely grateful to these people. I want to say to their next of kin, whites and non-Whites, that we are particularly proud of this Police Force and of this roll of honour which is mentioned in this report.</p>

<p>Then, under the heading &#x201C;Wastage&#x201D;, I noticed that 33 people were dishonourably discharged from the service. If one bears in <span class="col_7087-7088" refersTo="page_0693"/>mind that there are more than 17,000 policemen, this means that there were fewer than .2 per cent of our Police Force who committed offences which entailed their discharge. It is, in fact, to the credit of the Force that such a small percentage of our policemen were discharged owing to offences.</p>

<p>On page 8 we find a reference to the quantity of dagga which was, one may almost say &#x201C;harvested&#x201D; by the Police last year. They confiscated about 3 million pounds of dagga. If one considers the fact that one of the greatest evils in the world to-day is the use of drugs in various forms, of which dagga is perhaps the worst, it is, in fact, a compliment to our country and to our Police Force that they obtained that large quantity of drugs in such an excellent fashion. In so doing they have protected our people from this evil.</p>

<p>On page 9 I find a reference to the work of our police dogs. There are several stories there which fill one with pride that that branch of our Police Force is being developed so strongly.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to give consideration to making greater use of Group B of the Police Reservists for patrol duties in the suburbs of our cities. Hon. members know that it is tremendously difficult for the Police, travelling around in police vans to patrol the streets, while it would be very easy if reservists were used. I am of the opinion that by those means we would be able to combat a tremendous amount of crime.</p>

<p>I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister that more financial encouragement be given for the obtaining of ordinary academic degrees in the Police Force. It is always an asset for a Force when people are trying to qualify themselves academically to a greater extent. Academic proficiency gives one a much wider view of life, a much greater knowledge of people and, in fact, makes one a better person. We are very proud of the fact that so many of our policemen, above and beyond their police exams, are devoting their energies to acquiring academic degrees. Perhaps the hon. the Minister could consider giving them sufficient financial compensation, and promoting those who obtain academic degrees.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by asking the youth of South Africa to join our Police Force. It is an adventurous life; it is a kind of life which the young people ought to find thrilling. One of the policemen said to me a short while ago that war breaks out about once in 20 years while a policeman is engaged in a constant war against crime. In the combating of crime a young man has the best opportunity of giving expression to his adventure lust. There is a particularly fine future in the Police Force. In the days when I was practising I met people who were ordinary sergeants. When I came to Parliament, several years later, those people were already colonels, captains and some of them even assistant commissioners. I want to say to the youth of South Africa that the combating of crime is the greatest service which our youth can render to their country and nation in peace-time.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Prinshof has dealt with certain matters and he has made reference to the roll of honour which appears in the Report wherein 16 persons are listed. There are four other names to be added to this roll of honour. They are the police reservists who are mentioned later in the Report and who also lost their lives in the service of this country. I refer to them because I think the time has come that the hon. the Minister should deal with certain matters which will become rather more the occurrence than the exceptions in the future, if matters develop generally as they are throughout the world. I refer to the involvement of the civilian population in the activities of the Police Force, not in competition with the Police Force, but in conjunction with the Police Force. The hon. the Minister is aware that at the present time the Police are at liberty to call upon any citizen to assist them in effecting an arrest in dealing with the normal occurrences of crime. When a citizen refuses to assist the Police, he makes himself guilty of an offence. With the trend throughout the world at the present moment, with the development of planned and sponsored terrorist incursions into other countries, with the development of subversive activities throughout the world, the possible involvement of civilians in the activities of the Police Force, becomes more of a reality than it has been in the past. It was for this very reason that it was decided in 1960-’61 to form the Reserve Police Force. As I see from the Report, this force now consists of some 17,530 members, of whom four lost their lives during the course of this report year. In addition to the force of reservists, there are many other members of the public, who from time to time render services to the Police and who are called upon by the Police to render services. A few days ago we had the death of a member of the rescue team of the Mountain Club in the Cape when he was, as I believe, attempting, at the request of the Police, to retrieve the body of a person who had come to grief at Chapman’s Peak. People who will also be called upon from time to time in the future are the members of the newly-established National Sea Rescue Institute. That institute, which has been established by public spirited people of Cape Town, is well equipped to undertake hazardous and dangerous work along our coastline. More and more the nation will be involved in civil defence procedures which also have reference to the general maintenance of law and order. I believe that the public now should be reassured as to what the position is of the dependants, widows or children, of any persons who might lose their lives in rendering assistance in this manner. An assurance should also be given as to what is to happen to people who in assisting in this <span class="col_7089-7090" refersTo="page_0694"/>manner are disabled, either temporarily or permanently.</p>

<p>It is correct that of all the war pension codes used by the countries who were our allies during the last war, the code applied in our country is the best. It is the most satisfactory and the most realistic code. There is no question of flat rates. There is a basic rate of pension, but it takes into account, by means of supplementation, the earning potential of the person who is involved in the accident or who was killed. I do not need to go into the details at this stage, but it is a system of determination of pensions of persons losing their lives or becoming injured in the service of their country, which has worked satisfactorily and which has generally been accepted as satisfactory. It has been extended now by the hon. the Minister of Defence to the Citizen Force, the national servicemen, whilst on duty. I wonder whether the time has not come for the Minister to give consideration or whether the Minister has not himself perhaps already given consideration to the extension of this code to these other persons, including the Police Force, who are injured in the performance of the duties I have mentioned. If the hon. the Minister has not had an opportunity of doing so, I am sure it would bring considerable comfort and will be a considerable encouragement if the public in South Africa knew that there was a move towards a more realistic basis of compensation, should death intervene. People do not want to find themselves at the mercy of the Treasury as to what compensation should be paid to their dependants in the event of a fatal accident. One knows from one’s own experience that if these people are to be dealt with under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, and in terms of the procedure of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the compensation will be very small indeed for most persons who were involved in these organizations whilst assisting the Police. As I have mentioned, the matter has come pertinently forward as a result of the unfortunate accident at Chapman’s Peak where Mr. Watt lost his life. I think it will be a matter of great consequence to the public generally, if they know that this particular problem is having the attention of the Minister.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, there is another question I should like to put to the hon. the Minister, and it is a question which has arisen directly from the Budget. I notice that despite the establishment of the Bureau for State Security there is no reduction; in fact, there is a slight increase in the provision for funds for secret services as far as the Police is concerned during the current year. Is it not so that some of these services will be taken over by the new Bureau or will the Police continue with their secret service activities? I believe this service is separate from the question of the detection of crime. The hon. the Minister will find the figure under paragraph E of his Vote.</p>

<p>Lastly, I notice that the amount in respect of the investigation of crime for this year is nearly double the amount it was for the last financial year. I wonder whether this has not been caused by what the Commissioner called in his Report &#x201C;the extraneous duties&#x201D; which descend upon the Police Force. It is quite startling to find that the Commissioner has found it necessary to report the following:</p>

<block name="quote">More than 817,000 manhours was spent on extraneous duties such as prosecuting, excise duties, the registration of citizens, security measures on State diggings, agricultural censuses, foot and mouth disease control, naturalization, taxation, and the tracing of certain types of debtors.</block>

<p>I am certain that this is possibly the reason why if anybody wants to know anything, and does not know where to get the answer, we are depending more and more in South Africa on the nearest policeman.</p>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree whole-heartedly with the hon. member who has just sat down as regards the payment of compensation to people who tender their services either voluntarily or when asked by the Police to do so for the purpose of carrying out certain work of a special nature or assisting the Police. In this connection I want to mention the incident at Chapman’s Peak, an incident which certainly came as a great shock to the whole country, and one is grateful for the fact that one still finds civilians of the calibre of the person who offered his services there and of the other members of the Mountain Club who tendered their assistance to the Police after they had been asked to do so in that particular case. I should like to lend my support to the hon. member as regards any representations he has made to the hon. the Minister in this connection.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to another aspect before dealing with my own matters, namely what was said by the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member referred to a certain person with the Christian name of Sam as &#x201C;trigger happy&#x201D; Sam. To my mind this was a most unfortunate thing for the hon. member to have said, namely to drag into the discussions in this House the personal affairs of a civilian outside after the Police had investigated every case. These files are referred to the Attorney-General for decision, and in every case he found that this person had acted within the provisions of the law. We know there are cases in certain urban complexes where people are robbed time and again of everything they possess, so much so that they actually find themselves on the verge of bankruptcy as a result of these thefts. Should these people simply look on when their premises are broken into and should they first call the Police every time it happens? After all these people have the right to guard their properties in the first instance. Our law is quite clear, namely that a person has the right to protect <span class="col_7091-7092" refersTo="page_0695"/>his person and his personal property. We have no right to use firearms or any other weapons in our country arbitrarily, and our legislation is very strict in this regard. The public also knows that weapons may not be used arbitrarily. To my mind it is therefore quite unfair to refer reproachfully to this person as &#x201C;trigger happy&#x201D; Sam, and to ask what the position is going to be in future as regards this person and what the hon. the Minister and the Commissioner of Police are going to do in this connection. Does the hon. member want to wait for this person to be robbed to the point of bankruptcy or does she first want to wait until he has been murdered? He is entitled to do what he has done so far as long as he does not contravene the law. [Interjection.] One must actually refrain from commenting in stronger terms on allegations of this nature. When listening to this type of nonsense, certain questions arise which make one wonder.</p>

<p>In fact, I want to come back to a more positive matter and I want to refer to paragraph 4, page 2, of the annual report of the Commissioner of Police which deals with recruiting. The hon. the Minister and his Department realize, of course, the importance of the image the Police Force presents to the outside world. However, I want to stress one aspect of this image, namely in the sphere of sport. On behalf of all the members of the Police Force who participate in target shooting. I want to express my gratitude to the hon. the Minister and the Commissioner for the improved weapons they made available to these people during the past year. What I find important in this respect, is the fact that over 600 of South Africa’s marksmen participated in the national bisley which was held in Bloemfontein recently. The Police participated in this bisley as well, as they have been doing for many years. In earlier years, immediately before the last war, the Police team was one of the strongest teams to participate. In subsequent years, after the war, they did not always perform so well and there were many reasons for this, but after improved weapons and some of the best rifle-barrels had been made available to members of the Police team in recent years, the team performed so well that one of the policemen was runner-up in the grand championship. The reason why I mention this, is because of the comments which have been made in general. These comments were made by people from all over the country, from South-West Africa and even from Zambia who participate in this bisley. They said, <i>inter alia,</i> &#x201C;One likes to see our policemen doing so well. We like to see that our policemen are capable of handling a weapon so well&#x201D;. This is the aspect that is important, that our policemen, too, should take note of these comments, particularly when one considers the comments we had as regards the first team and the other teams of the Police Rugby Club in Pretoria. I do not think the Commissioner and the hon. the Minister always hear public opinion as we do, and how the achievements and actions of this nature by policemen affect the public. This is just as important as all the attempts made by the Police as regards recruiting and for this reason I want to express my sincere thanks to the Commissioner and the hon. the Minister on behalf of those people, in whom I have a personal interest, for all that has been done for them. I should also be glad if the hon. the Minister as well as the Commissioner would provide these people with all they need during the next few years in view of the fact that considerable changes are being considered in this sphere.</p>

<p>I also want to mention another aspect which strikes one in this annual report, namely the large number of policemen who buy their discharge from the Police Force. Together with this I want to tell the Committee what happens to a person when he joins the Police Force. My information is that a person with a matriculation certificate receives one year’s training at the Police College and that, if everything goes well with him in his career and after he has completed three years’ service, he may become a sergeant if he passes the necessary examinations. After a further two years’ service he may qualify for promotion to adjutant-officer, provided he has passed the necessary examinations. After he has served as an adjutant-officer for one year, he may qualify again to write the examination for promotion to the rank of officer. If he passes this examination and if posts are available, he may be promoted in course of time in accordance with his position on the promotion lists. Considering all the factors, the progress he makes cannot be regarded as slow and quite a number of these men have certainly reached the rank of officer within a period of 10 years. I have wondered, however, particularly when one considers the large number of policemen, namely 1,248 Whites, who have bought their discharge from the Police Force, whether one of the things they do not feel quite happy about is not the very same thing that applies to everyone who earns a salary, namely that they do not feel happy about the fact that it takes them such a long time before they reach the maximum salary notch. I do not know what the position in the Police Force is, but is the fact that it takes a member of the Police Force too long before he reaches his maximum salary not an important reason? This is one of the factors. The other factor is the following. There are many matriculants. A figure is quoted here of 543 matriculants who have shown interest in one recruiting campaign; of this number 258 were English-speaking matriculants, something which is quite encouraging. However, the position is that the difference as regards conditions of service between that of the matriculant and the person with Std. 7 or Std. 9 is quite undesirable, and the difference in training is not desirable either. I wonder whether the Minister should not consider the possibility for matriculants and graduates to be trained and enrolled on quite a different basis? Should <span class="col_7093-7094" refersTo="page_0696"/>they not be appointed to the ranks on a different basis? People with degrees first have to receive one year’s basic training at the Police College and is then appointed a sergeant. According to the information I have he must complete two years’ service as a sergeant before he qualifies for promotion to adjutant-officer, provided he has passed the Police examinations. After that he has to complete one year’s service as adjutant-officer and has to pass his examinations again before he qualifies for promotion to rank of officer. I know of graduates who discussed this matter with me and who wanted to make the Police Force their career, but these conditions of service and the conditions of appointment were not quite suitable; these things do not make these people enthusiastic to join the Force. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister for consideration to make a change in that respect and that graduates and people with matriculation certificates should qualify sooner and on a different basis for appointment as officers.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>The S.A. Police consists at present of approximately 34,000 men in all. This figure of 34,000 comprises Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu, and if one has regard to the fact that in most cases police officials act individually, one is rather astonished to find that there are so few cases where the S.A. Police really deserve criticism. And having regard to the numerous outstanding and valuable services they render to South Africa, I must say that I am proud and grateful to be associated with the S.A. Police. Therefore I want to avail myself of this opportunity to express my personal appreciation, particularly to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) who extended to me his good wishes on the occasion of my appointment as Minister of this, I think very important Department. One is aware that amongst these 34,000 men in the S.A. Police there must definitely be many who are guilty of misdemeanours from time to time. From time to time there has to be cases of members of the Police Force making mistakes, but at the very outset I want to give the assurance that the S.A. Police do not hesitate to take steps against them. On the other hand, it is our duty to cause justice to be done and also credit to be given in cases where the S.A. Police are rendering good service to South Africa. A few weeks ago I received a letter which deals in general with the S.A. Police and which did my heart good. I think this is very applicable to the S.A. Police. Amongst other things this person wrote to me as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have been a legal practitioner for 34 years and have seen merit in the Police Force pass unnoticed. On the other hand, I have seen every criticism levelled at the Police Force for the slightest misdemeanour on the part of one or other of its members. I feel, therefore, that I should bring true merit to your notice.</block>

<p>Then he went on to mention a case in respect of which he really thought he had to give credit to the S.A. Police and wanted to do so through me as the Minister in charge. One appreciates such tributes to the S.A. Police, not because one thinks that everything they do is right, but because we know that the work done by the S.A. Police is important and often dangerous and that they also deserve a little credit from time to time.</p>

<p>Since this is the first discussion of the Police Vote for General Gous as Commissioner of the S.A. Police, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my appreciation for the pleasant co-operation I have received from him and his officers. We are aware that in actual fact General Gous ought to retire this year already, and that is why I made an announcement last year, shortly after he had been appointed as Commissioner subsequent to the appointment of General Van den Berg as the Security Adviser to the Prime Minister. I announced at the time that I had asked General Gous, since his period of office would actually have expired in June of this year, to stay on for another year, and even for another two years perhaps, in his capacity as Commissioner of Police. I just want to mention the fact that the Public Service Commission has for the current year at least agreed to the extension of his period of office, and we are privileged to be able to avail ourselves of the services of General Gous for at least another year and probably for longer.</p>

<p>Hon. members made a few references to the work done by the S.A. Police on our borders. You will recall, Sir, that last year and the year before our discussions often dealt with the activities of the S.A. Police on our borders. In the past I made it my task to inform the House as to what was being done, and to what extent the S.A. Police were keeping in check the terrorist activities there. The information I furnished in the past was to a large extent to the effect that infiltration of terrorists had occurred and that terrorists had either been killed or arrested. Since interest is being taken here in the work done by our police on the borders, I should like to furnish the Committee, to the best of my ability, with a glimpse into the circumstances under which the S.A. Police are serving there and the work they are doing on our borders.</p>

<p>At the very outset I want to state that our S.A. Police are not performing military functions on our borders. Nor are we making war and carrying out military operations. These are police stations and posts, and what we are performing there, is purely a police function, i.e. for the preservation of internal security as laid down in section 5 of the Police Act. I think that this has to be our point of departure, and the point on which we should understand one another very well, <span class="col_7095-7096" refersTo="page_0697"/>is that what we have there, is not military operations, but that the work of the police on the borders is police work and not military operations.</p>

<p>You will recall, Sir, that the infiltration of terrorists started more or less in August, 1966, and subsequent to that we decided to make greater use of our police in guarding our borders. These events in 1966 resulted in our northern borders having to be safeguarded and strictly guarded day and night. I want hon. members to bear in mind that these northern borders of ours extend over tremendously long distances. Returning terrorists could not be allowed to re-enter the country freely, and policemen were placed at strategic places all along the northern border. However, during 1967 the terrorist threat took a new turn when the Rhodesian Security Forces which had clashed with a group of terrorists, found that amongst those who had been caught and killed there were also members of the South African A.N.C. Movement. These African National Congress members were identified as South African Bantu who had unlawfully left the Republic during 1962 for military training abroad. In addition it soon became apparent that the A.N.C. and the Rhodesian ZAPU had joined forces for the purpose of making onslaughts primarily on Rhodesia but with South Africa as the ultimate target. These events resulted in our Prime Minister offering to Rhodesia the services of the S.A. Police Force in their territory, to assist in resisting the common enemy and in that way to ensure our own security as well.</p>

<p>To give an indication of the formidable task which rests upon the shoulders of those who guard our borders, it is necessary, first of all, to indicate the extensiveness of our borders which the police have to guard. For these purposes the Committee is being furnished with the following distances only. The South-West Africa&#x2014;Angola border is 866 miles long. The South-West Africa&#x2014;Zambia border is 146 miles long. The border between Botswana and South-West Africa is 870 miles long, and the Botswana&#x2014;Republic border is 1,006 miles long. The Republic&#x2014;Rhodesia border is 152 miles long. The Moçambique&#x2014;Republic border is 338 miles long, and the Republic&#x2014;Swaziland border is 280 miles long. In other words, the total length of our borders is 2,858 miles. Then there is still that part of the Zambezi in Rhodesia, where the S.A. Police are helping the Rhodesian Security Forces, and that is a distance of 385 miles. The total length of the borders of our country is, therefore, more than 3,000 miles. For obvious reasons the number of South African policemen and the number or the names of the various bases cannot be mentioned. You will therefore understand, Sir, that I cannot go into too much geographic detail, but I think it would be fitting if I nevertheless furnished certain information.</p>

<p>In the first instance, there is the question of training. It was asked what the nature of the training was which these men were receiving. Firstly, it is necessary to give a brief outline of the nature of the training. An intensive training course lasting three weeks is being provided at the S.A. Police College, subsequent to which they are provided with another week’s training in field exercises in order to prepare the members of the Force in all respects for the task which awaits them. I may just say that I have visited these training camps in the vicinity of Pretoria, where the Police are being trained in circumstances more or less similar to those they could expect to encounter when they go on duty on the northern borders. The training includes instruction in the handling and a thorough knowledge of a variety of weapons, including the two-inch mortar, light machine guns, the sub-machine carbine, heavy calibre automatic and semiautomatic rifles and automatic shotguns, hand grenades, explosives, booby traps as well as the use and characteristics of all the known terrorist weapons, radio communication, compass and map reading and navigation; the use and maintenance of vehicles, first-aid and precautions against tropical diseases. On the other hand, operational training includes, amongst other things, the following: Guerrilla strategy and tactics and counter-guerrilla methods, tracking, field-craft, bush survival, patrol formations, ambushes, tracking down and destroying enemy bases, collecting information, intelligence and sketching conditions.</p>

<p>Now, I think you may be interested in the accommodation made available to the police on the borders. The accommodation on the borders consists, as I myself found, mainly of tents which are pitched in separate camps and posts where the police are accommodated, and here and there grass and reed huts are put up as well. Mess facilities have been created and adequate supplies of food are being provided. Every base has at least one refrigerator. The hon. member for Durban (Point) referred to that. I do not think he can expect an electric refrigerator in the bush, but nevertheless every camp is provided with at least one refrigerator. Health facilities are good and medical doctors and limited hospital facilities are available at several bases. Dental treatment and injections are given at the S.A. Police College before these men depart for the borders. As regards the spiritual ministration, I may just say that police chaplains are sent up from time to time to visit the men in the north.</p>

<p>Then we come to their functions. How are the functions of the police carried out on the borders? To my mind this is rather important and interesting. Patrols are for the most part carried out on foot when searching for tracks left behind by terrorists. Virtually every inch of the border between Macusso and Western Caprivi and Kanyemba in North-Eastern Rhodesia, which is 670 miles long, has to be covered regularly in order to determine whether bands of terrorists might not have crossed that border. The major part of a member’s period of service on the border <span class="col_7097-7098" refersTo="page_0698"/>is spent on these patrols. A patrol is taken by vehicle to a certain point, where they have to start walking; subsequent to that the members walk the distance to the terminal point, on which they have previously agreed. Members of the patrol are armed with weapons of which I have the particulars here but which I should rather not disclose. In addition to the weapons and ammunition carried by a patrol member, he does of course take food along too, as well as snake bite serum and first-aid equipment, etc., because that area is infested with snakes. The weight every member has to carry, varies from 40 to 70 lbs. I should like hon. members to keep this in mind. In areas where the terrain is flat, they walk between 15 and 25 miles per day. However, in other areas it is hardly possible to cover 10 miles per day. There are many mountainous areas, especially in the eastern part, east of the waterfalls, past Kariba. In those parts, as I have said, it is hardly possible to cover 10 miles per day owing to the mountainous terrain. There are areas in which some foot patrols last for as long as five days. As a result of circumstances it sometimes happens that a patrol is absent from its camp for five days. But the usual thing is for them to be away for only one or two days, and that is what we are seeking to achieve, although in many cases it is essential for the patrol to be absent from its base for longer than two days. The procedure which is usually followed, is to walk non-stop for 50 minutes and then to rest for ten minutes every hour. When a patrol spends the night in the veld, a temporary base is erected and every possible defence measure is taken against unexpected attacks. Throughout the night the members of the patrol take turns to stand guard and to sleep. The roster for sleeping and standing guard is planned in advance so that they may be ready during the night in the event of an unexpected attack being launched on them. Normally these patrols are carried out under very unfavourable conditions. Hon. members who know that part of the world will appreciate how unfavourable these circumstances are which prevail there. As hon. members can appreciate, making use of a road or a footpath is of course extremely undesirable, in the first instance, because one would expect that, if an ambush were set up, it would probably be set up in the footpath or the road. But apart from that there is no point in looking for terrorists in roads or footpaths, since that is the last place one would expect to find them. In all probability they do not make use of footpaths or roads in their movements. Over and above the foot patrols which are carried out, there are operational vehicle patrols as well. These patrols are carried out mainly for the purpose of preserving good relationships with the local community. Hon. members are of course aware that there are very few roads in this vicinity, and these are very bad. Consequently the contact with the local communities which we regard as being so valuable, cannot be maintained by means of vehicle patrols only. In many cases this has to be done by means of foot patrols as well. In one area it has already happened that, as a result of climatic conditions, vehicles got bogged down for approximately six weeks and that the helicopters had to be used to convey food supplies to the various posts.</p>

<p>Over and above the patrols which are being sent out there are also observation duties and guard duties which have to be carried out from time to time. Certain strategic positions, such as bridges, have to be guarded; every base, no matter how small it is, has to be guarded. The men at every base are divided into groups and take turns at, firstly, carrying out patrols, secondly, manning observation posts, and thirdly, doing guard duty at the base, because it is essential that there should always be people on guard at the base. They work for seven days a week, not for five days a week, as do members of the Public Service or employees in the private sector or even the Police within the borders of South Africa; they work for seven days a week and when they return, they receive, as compensation, 14 consecutive days’ leave. That is what they receive for the full-time service they render while serving on the borders.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>For what period is that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The period to which we are trying to keep is approximately three months. In a moment I shall deal with the remuneration and the allowances these men receive, and from that hon. members will be able to deduce that, apart from the excitement of a visit to the wild country along the borders, the financial benefits they derive from such a visit are not to be scorned. Consequently there was a time when we found that some men who had served on the borders, were so keen to go back that they had hardly been home when they volunteered for another period of duty on the borders. You will appreciate, Sir, that these men have to be specially trained and equipped before being sent to the borders, and viewed from this angle it is actually more economical for the Police to send back to the borders those men who are keen to return. But we have arrived at the conclusion that it is not beneficial to the Police Force to allow them to stay there for too long a period. This is especially applicable to the married members of the Force. Members of the Force are being encouraged, by means of financial compensation and other circumstances, to do duty on the borders, but we have arrived at the conclusion that it is not advisable to allow them to stay there for too long a period. At the moment it is our policy to allow them to stay there for three or four months, and then they have to return for a long time before being afforded the opportunity of returning to the borders.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to give you a brief outline <span class="col_7099-7100" refersTo="page_0699"/>of the conditions prevailing there and the circumstances under which these people work. As hon. members probably know, our northern borders, the Caprivi and the Zambezi Valley, are a desolate, wild and inhospitable region; there is absolutely no doubt about that. It is a tremendously vast region; one finds miles and miles of vast, untamed country there. As regards Ovamboland and the Caprivi, the terrain is flat, sandy, densely forested and it gets extremely hot during the day. In the Eastern and Southern parts of the Eastern Caprivi there are extensive areas which consist of marshes only and which are virtually impenetrable. From the west to the Victoria Waterfalls the terrain is also reasonably flat and very busy, but the Zambezi Valley, below the waterfall, is mountainous with dense bushes, and east of the Kariba, a little lower down, in the low-lying areas, it is unbearably hot. Sir, a moment ago I said that it was hot in Ovamboland. You can take my word for that. However, it is infinitely hotter in the Eastern Zambezi Valley, quite some distance east of the Kariba, where the river emerges, so to speak, among the mountains and the hills and the ridges and it then forms the low-lying valley further east, which is only 1,800 feet above sea-level. I was there in July, last year, and at that time it was as hot there as it is here in our summer months. The heat there is oppressive and working under those conditions is unpleasant. Large parts of this area which I have mentioned are still infested with tsetse flies. One still finds mosquitoes and malaria there, and, as I have already said, many snakes. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) referred to the wild beasts, the scorpions, the fleas and the flies found there. What our men find extremely troublesome there, is elephant and buffalo. A South African and a Rhodesian have been seriously injured by an elephant and a buffalo, respectively. The elephants are becoming so troublesome that from time to time we are forced to frighten them away from the camps. The elephants are frightened away by means of a certain object that makes a noise; I am not sure what it is, but it causes an explosion in the vicinity of the camp and serves to drive the elephants away from the camps. During the summer months, as I have already said, the scorching heat is the greatest problem experienced by any patrol, and one of our men has already collapsed from heat exhaustion. Hon. members will probably recall that it was announced in the newspapers a few months ago that one of our men, whose parents live in the vicinity of Wynberg or near Kirsten-bosch, had collapsed as a result of heat exhaustion. Salt tablets are taken regularly, but in spite of that it still happens quite often that members have to be picked up by helicopter to be treated for heat exhaustion. In the summer the heat in the eastern part of the Zambezi Valley is a tremendous problem. The Commissioner of Police, other senior officers of the Force and I pay regular visits to these units of the South African Police. I was there last year and it is my intention to go there again this year. We visit them on the border from time to time and on every occasion we are impressed by the particularly high morale of the men, the fine state of fitness in which they find themselves, the health they enjoy and the training and the high standard of discipline maintained there. In the unpleasant circumstances in which these men have to work, it is even more essential than it would otherwise be for good discipline to be maintained there. In general these men are wide awake, and I as their Minister feel convinced and satisfied that, just as they have done in the past, they will in the future also do their duty in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>I should also like to tell hon. members that, apart from the terrorist hunters on our northern borders&#x2014;so far I have confined myself to the terrorist hunters on our northern borders &#x2014;numerous border posts are also being manned by the South African Police. They man posts on all the borders between the Republic and our neighbouring states. I do not know whether we always have regard to the fact that the Police are used for several tasks which cannot be carried out by any other Department. Apart from our northern borders, our police also man the posts on all our other borders. To do all this work, a very large number of men are of course required. Sir, to give you an indication of the magnitude of this task, I just want to state that roughly 800 Whites and 300 non-white members of the Force are being used on these services every day. I have not mentioned to you, Sir, the number of men used in Rhodesia or in the Caprivi, but the number I have just given you represents the total number of policemen used on all our borders, which of course include the borders of our immediate neighbouring states as well.</p>

<p>Are the non-Whites Coloureds or Bantu?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In most cases they are Bantu. However, what I also want to emphasize in this House to-day is that the police on the borders are not involved in a military operation. I said this at the beginning and I should like to repeat it. The police on our borders are implementing, in particular, section 5 (a) of the Police Act, and are in that way looking after the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this will more or less give you an indication of the work done for us by the South African Police on our northern borders. You will perhaps ask me what the prospects are in respect of this terrorist danger which has threatened us of late. We are aware of the fact that we are still going to experience difficulties in the future, but it would perhaps be better if I just read out to you an excerpt taken from the <i>Kenya Weekly News</i> of October, 1968. This will give you a rough indication of the position as it has been developing of late&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7101-7102" refersTo="page_0700"/>The recruiting sergeants of the Zimbabwe African National Union and the Zimbabwe African Peoples’ Union, the two rival Rhodesian exiled movements, have been having a thin time lately. It takes a brave man to be a freedom fighter and not everyone has that kind of courage, and amongst those that have, there are misgivings against sending insufficiently trained, ill-equipped infiltrators into Rhodesia and into the waiting hands of the South African-aided Rhodesian Security Forces. It is true that large numbers of troops have had to be concentrated on the border and that this in itself is the measure of the success of the guerrilla war, but with casualties running as at their present rate it will not be long before the African parties run out of volunteers. Both Zapu and Zanu have appealed to their countrymen and Africans of other states to join the freedom fighters. The response has not been too encouraging. If volunteers decline to come forward in sufficient numbers then the prospect of some kind of conscription cannot be avoided. It raises acutely serious issues.</block>

<p>This also gives a rough indication of what I think. This does not mean that we have come to the end of the problem with which we have been threatened over the past number of years. In recent times the water level in the Zambezi has been very high, much higher this year than it has ever been before. As a result, terrorist movements have been curbed to a very large extent. However, the water level in the river is already dropping&#x2014;in fact, it has already dropped considerably&#x2014;and it would be foolish for us to think that the terrorist danger is something of the past. On the contrary, it is still there, particularly the infiltration from the south-eastern corner of Angola, i.e. from that part of Zambia to the Caprivi.</p>

<p>I tried to give hon. members a glimpse into the activities of the men who are serving up there. I said that, before we send them there, we give them three weeks’ training. In fact, we have in this way already prepared and equipped 3,000 men to do service there on the border. I must say that one is grateful for the fact that these young men are rendering such services as they have recently rendered there. Unfortunately there are some of our men who have given their lives in the exercise of their duties in the interests of South Africa. Mention has already been made of Warrant Officer Grobler who was shot through the chest on a boat in the Zambezi a few years ago. I even met him afterwards. Well, to all intents and purposes he has completely recovered. Mention was also made of the action of constable Chaka, a Bantu who was with him on the boat and who was shot through the head. As the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) said, this Bantu is blind to such a degree that he can only distinguish between light and dark, and hardly that. As far as Warrant Officer Grobler is concerned, what the hon. member said is also correct, i.e. that it seemed at first as if this man had staged a complete recovery. However, he subsequently began to have trouble with his heart, and according to the information I have he died of that last week. He was buried last week in his hometown, Dordrecht. If hon. members would glance at the first page of the Report which was recently tabled they would see that reference is made there to constable Chaka. Now I should just like to mention on this occasion that General Gous and I intend paying another visit to the borders one of these days. We will probably return to the borders during July, visit all the various border posts and make the acquaintanceship of the men on the borders there. These will of course be only those men who will be there at the time, because they change from time to time. On this occasion we will also hand over a gift from the South African Police Amenities Fund to Chaka. I think it might be interesting for hon. members to learn that this Amenities Fund of the South African Police is not a Government fund. It is a fund which belongs to members of the South African Police only, and to nobody else. The South African Police decided to make an amount of R300 available out of this fund with which to buy Chaka a gift. He retired from the South African Police on his own request and settled in the Caprivi area. For the information of hon. members, his monthly pension is R38. When we go up in July we are going to make a whole ceremony of handing over this gift to him. But we are not going to give him the money; we are going to buy him five head of cattle. We are then going to arrange a major function. On the occasion of that function it will be my privilege to hand over those five head of cattle to him. Over and above those five head of cattle we are then going to present to Chaka as a gift from the South African Police Amenities Fund we will also buy another slaughter animal. This we will then slaughter and take along two bags of mealiemeal. After that we are going to hold a party.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to make it sound too attractive now; just now the hon. members will also want to come along.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say in respect of the men on the borders that mention has been made by hon. members of donations and gifts from various quarters which have been sent to the South African Police, and particularly to the men serving on the borders there. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) stated that these chaps should be compensated by the State. I admit that I have no fundamental objection to that. That is quite correct. But these men serving there are already being compensated to a reasonable extent. In the Caprivi area, that is the area which falls under South Africa and not Rhodesia, a married man receives an allowance of R5 per day over and <span class="col_7103-7104" refersTo="page_0701"/>above his salary while he is serving there. An unmarried man receives an allowance of R4 per day. In Rhodesia itself our men are receiving an allowance of R4 per day. Now hon. members will ask me, why the difference? Why does he receive R4 in Rhodesia, regardless of whether he is married or not? The reason for the difference is that in the Caprivi supplies are provided by the South African Police for which the men have to pay something. They must as it were pay board for what they receive there.</p>

<p>In Rhodesia however the food supplies are provided by the Rhodesian Government and they do not pay an allowance, or rather board. That is why a distinction is made and the men in Caprivi are being paid a higher allowance than those in Rhodesia. But over and above that I should like to say that it is nevertheless a good thing and a major encouragement for the chaps who are working there under extremely difficult, unpleasant and&#x2014;this I need not tell hon. members&#x2014;dangerous circumstances, to know that the public of South Africa takes an interest in them and that they are thinking of them, even if it is only by way of a gesture, for example at Christmas or any other time. Last year at the presentation parade in Pretoria, I mentioned the fact that the territorial authority of Bahurutshe had <i>inter alia</i> recorded the following in their minutes. This is a Bantu authority in the Western Transvaal, I think in the vicinity of Mafeking. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The chairman states that from Press reports we observe that all races and communities are contributing to funds that are awarded to the Security Police to assist them in fighting terrorists. It is proper and fitting that this authority consider a motion whereby members are asked to make contributions which would be offered to the Security Police as a gesture in appreciation and of indicating our support for the valuable services for our security that these police render by fighting terrorists.</block>

<p>They then conducted an entire debate on this matter, and concluded with this resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The meeting decides unanimously that each tribal authority contribute R10 towards the fund and reports be made at the next general meeting.</block>

<p>Sir, this is not the only reaction we have had. There was another reaction as well. For example, on 20th December, a letter from the Bantu Commissioner in Dundee was received. The letter read as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Combating of terrorists on our borders. Attached find Treasury Order No. 38996 for R139.75 which was collected by the chiefs of Dundee and their followers for above-mentioned purpose.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Above-mentioned purposes&#x201D; is the combating of terrorists on our borders. The letter goes on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The idea is that the money be utilized for little gifts for the Bantu constables serving there.</block>

<p>I am just mentioning these few examples so as to avail myself of the opportunity of saying on behalf of the Police&#x2014;for I am the mouthpiece who has to say this on behalf of the Police in this House&#x2014;how gestures of this nature are appreciated. It must be borne in mind that these two cases I have just mentioned are not contributions which were made by White persons or organizations but came in the one case from the territorial authority, who set no limits or qualifications on it, and in the other case from the chiefs of Dundee, who stated that it should be used for Bantu constables serving on the borders.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with this, I should like to mention to you another case which only this morning came into the office of the Commissioner of the South African Police, a letter to which R20 was attached. It moved me so much that I thought it would be a good thing if the Committee were informed of this when the Police Vote was being discussed. This is from a dentist here in Cape Town who writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear General Gous,</block>

<block name="quote">This morning’s Press carried a most moving report of almost unbelievable gallantry, courage, respect and love on the part of three of your officers, Warrant Officer Grobler, African Constable Chaka and Sergeant Jacobs. Let me not presume verbally to applaud the actions of these men, for the quality of their sacrifice and their devotion to duty are tragic and glorious beyond description. Permit me with humility and pride to offer you my deep sympathy in the great loss of forces suffered in the death of Warrant Officer Grobler and the tremendous affliction suffered by the lauded Constable Chaka, which affliction we hope will not be permanent. Although my wife and I express our gratitude in a practical manner, that is by making a regular contribution to the widows and orphans fund through Sergeant Visser, we ask you to accept the appended extraordinary tribute with the wish that it may in some way assist the families of the two officers, Warrant Officer Grobler and Constable Chaka.</block>

<p>Attached to this were two R10 notes. I am using this merely to indicate that there are people who appreciate to such a great extent in such fine words, the service of the South African Police, since they are serving on the borders under bad conditions in the interests of South Africa. I avail myself gladly of the opportunity of expressing on behalf of the South African Police, our greatest appreciation <span class="col_7105-7106" refersTo="page_0702"/>for this and so many hundreds and thousands of others who have since last year and prior to that as well made contributions in order to alleviate the lot of the policemen on the border.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I have taken up quite a good deal of time in giving hon. members a glimpse into the activities on the borders.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal briefly with the points raised here by hon. members. In the first place I want to reply to the points raised here by the hon. member for Durban (Point). I understand that the hon. member has to lend another colleague of this a hand to-night in keeping a few United Party supporters in the fold. I shall therefore begin with the hon. member first.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Chairman, I was referring to the hon. member for Durban (North). I made a mistake. They are all so close together. I am also pleased that we succeeded in having the Police Report available before the discussion of the Police Vote. The hon. member for Transkei will no doubt recall that the question of this report is a kind of hardy annual. It is extremely difficult to get all the details co-ordinated. The Bureau for Census and Statistics must process quite a good deal of this information for us. It is not such an easy task compiling a report like this within a specified time. During the past few years I have been dealing with the Police Vote we have, however, had a small measure of success. I think that if in future we make the previous year’s report available just before the discussion of the Police Vote then we would really have achieved an ideal position. I am pleased about that as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the numerical strength of the South African Police. I do not want to beat about the bush. I want to be honest with hon. members and with this Committee. I, too, am concerned about the numerical strength of the South African Police. It is hardly necessary for me to tell hon. members why it is difficult to recruit the necessary men for the South African Police. It is a question of the conditions of service. When necessary, policemen have to remain on duty for 24 hours a day. If necessary they have to work seven days a week. I have just given you a brief sketch of the conditions and activities of the police on the borders. Even in the interior exceptional demands are made on the South African Police. This is an important Department. The domestic security of South Africa is after all of extreme importance. We cannot emphasize this enough. That is why we are concerned. We are making every possible attempt from one year to another to recruit young men. Last year we had a particularly good year. I think, if I remember correctly, that we sent slightly more than 1,600 young men through the College, after which they were admitted to the South African Police Force. Since last year, and I am now anticipating next year’s report a little, we have not been so fortunate. This year we have not recruited as many men as in the previous year. Over and above that, I must admit that a great number buy themselves out of the service. There are quite a number of reasons for this. In the first place, it is our duty to ensure that enough men are recruited, and in the second place it is our duty to ensure that we keep those men. We will in fact make this our task. If members are able to make any constructive recommendations in this regard, I shall lend a willing ear to them. Hon. members are aware that we are experiencing a shortage of labour in all fields in South Africa. Since there is a shortage of labour, it is obvious that the South African Police will also suffer to a certain extent. We are not fully equipped at present as far as the number of staff is concerned. Our numerical strength is less than it ought to be. It is lower than the permissible number approved for the South African Police. We shall do everything in our power to rectify that position.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned murder charges which he thought were not receiving the necessary attention. I do not think that that is quite correct. I think the hon. member’s deductions were a little superficial. I do not think it can be deduced that because a large percentage of these people were found not guilty, investigations should inevitably be lacking in the necessary efficiency.</p>

<p>As far as influx control is concerned, I just want to emphasize what other hon. members have said. I think the hon. member for Odendaalsrus referred to that, i.e. that influx control is essential. Where influx control is relaxed, you can be sure that there will be an immediate increase in criminal offences. This is undeniably true. There is no doubt about it at all. Actually, these two phenomena go hand in hand. Influx control is closely related to criminal offences committed in urban areas.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned salaries. To a certain extent I want to agree with him that the time has come when the South African Police can in fact no longer be compared with other members of the Public Service. I have already mentioned the reasons. There are other reasons which I could also mention. To-day the salary scales of the Police, in the case of a person with the same qualification, for example matriculation, is the same as in the rest of the Public Service. Over and above salaries there are in addition certain allowances which are paid to the Police. At the same time I would like to reply to the point raised by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City). That hon. member stated that uniforms should be made available to the South African Police free of charge. The South African Police are being paid an allowance. This allowance is <span class="col_7107-7108" refersTo="page_0703"/>an all-inclusive allowance. It includes, <i>inter alia,</i> the purchase of uniforms. If uniforms were not to be included in the allowance, and uniforms were to be made available free of charge, as we are in fact doing in the case of reservists, our argument for this allowance will to a large extent fall away. I should like to point out to the hon. member that a uniform is not an expensive item. The two or three uniforms which a policeman uses during the course of a year form only a small part of the allowance which we make available to these young men. Now I should also like to announce that we have succeeded in increasing the allowance paid to policemen.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>How much is that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall furnish the details now. It has already been approved by the Public Service Commission and the Treasury. The new allowance will be paid with effect from 1st May. I have already explained previously that the allowance is paid in the form of an increasing amount. It begins when a person joins the Police Force who then progresses to the rank of full constable. Then the amount reaches its maximum, as the position was in the past, after which the amount of the allowance decreases again. In other words, the amount tapers off until it falls away completely when a salary scale of R2,640 is reached. That was the position in the past.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>He still has to buy uniforms.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he purchases a uniform out of this amount. The maximum amount which the Police received in the past was R300. The maximum has now been increased to R420. According to the new ratio he achieves the maximum a little sooner, and the allowance is valid for a longer period. In other words, it tapers off again until it falls away completely with a salary exceeding R3,000. The allowance is therefore payable for a longer period. I know that what I am discussing here are not large amounts. This difference in the allowance will entail an additional expenditure of R1.5 million. That is not very much. The salary scales of our Police to-day are the same as those of other Government officials. However, we are giving this matter our attention. If circumstances require and it is deemed advisable, the Cabinet will consider whether the salary scales will be adjusted in places.</p>

<p>The hon. member and hon. members on this side as well, referred to buildings. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) also referred to the loans which are being granted for housing for policemen. Now I should like to say that the Government has decided in principle to provide all members of the three services, i.e. the Police, the Defence Force and the Prisons Service with housing in future. This was decided recently, and has apparently not been announced yet, and so I should like to announce it here. This Government housing will of course be rented, but as hon. members themselves know, these houses will be rented at a reasonable and fair rental. I think I have stated before that we have already in the past concentrated on providing housing to all members of these services in rural areas. In the urban complexes we have tried to provide 50 per cent of these people with houses. But recently housing in the urban complexes has become a greater problem than housing in the rural areas, or at least as much of a problem. At certain places in the rural areas there is no housing whatsoever available for policemen. In the cities, on the other hand, the rent for houses which are in fact available is so tremendously high that police officials simply cannot pay it. That is why we feel in the first instance that we must supply housing to all members of the Police Force. Whether this consists of houses or flats, makes no difference. That is what the Government is now concentrating on. Hon. members may now ask with what expedition this housing will be supplied. The hon. member for Durban (North) said that the amount of R3 million is very little and would not be able to meet the housing needs of police officials. I can just say that the Government has further decided that public servants, which of course include police officials, must enjoy preference for housing purposes. Hon. members are of course aware that large housing schemes are being introduced everywhere. A tremendous amount of capital is necessary for that, but the Government feels that the public servant’s need for housing should be met more rapidly than has been the case in the past. That is why we want to concentrate our capital resources on the provision of housing for public servants, <i>inter alia,</i> the police as well. When a police official vacates a house and goes to stay in a Government house, he will after all make another house available, which someone else will be able to occupy. Our first task is to provide persons who are sent from place to place, where they might not want to be, with housing. In respect of these matters we hope that there will be a considerable improvement in future. Recently we announced a new Government-subsidized housing loan scheme for public servants. You will recall that this new scheme was announced approximately 14 days ago. This does not mean of course that a police official, a defence force man or an official in the prisons service will not be able to make use of that scheme. That State-subsidized housing loan scheme, in terms of which an official will pay interest of only 4 per cent if he earns less than R5,000 per year, and will pay 5 per cent up to a salary of R7,500 per year, will also be available to members of the South African Police.</p>

<p>I think that I have now replied to most of the points made by hon. members. In addition, I recently made a statement in regard to allowances to persons stationed on the borders.</p>

<p><span class="col_7109-7110" refersTo="page_0704"/>The hon. member for Odendaalsrus requested that more bursaries should be made available. Sir, I would welcome this with open arms. You must remember that these bursaries, in the same way as salary scales and conditions of service, must also be approved by the Public Service Commission. However, I want to work towards this end myself. We will in due course make more bursaries available to the South African Police in cases where officials want to improve their position and where they want to acquire better academic qualifications. I think it is essential that more be done. The 10 bursaries we make available are taken up so quickly, and our needs are in reality much greater. Particularly in present-day economic circumstances, where bursaries are made available to just about everyone, I would agree with the hon. member that we must try to make bursaries more easily available to such people. However, this is not all in my hands. I still have to co-operate with other Departments, particularly with the Treasury.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei referred to the statement, &#x201C;some of my best friends are Jews&#x201D;. I do not know what he wanted me to say. Would he rather I had said, &#x201C;some of my best friends are not Jews&#x201D;, or &#x201C;I have no Jews as good friends&#x201D;? I would preferably ask the hon. member for Houghton to raise this matter. If she chooses to do so we could have an interesting debate on the matter. What the hon. member for Transkei did in fact do was to refer to the way in which I had replied to the debate which was initiated by the hon. member for Durban (North). Now he is asking why I am so sensitive. However, I should like to put this question to the hon. member for Transkei: Why is he being so sensitive? After all, this is not a sissy game we are playing here. Why is the hon. member so sensitive when I hit back at him when I think it is necessary?</p>

<p>The hon. member stated that the committee had been appointed. He asked us whether we could submit a kind of progress report. The committee has been appointed, but I cannot at this stage give him any more information. I do not regard it as being necessary to elaborate further on this now. I think that I have, since this incident took place, kept the public fully informed of what we are doing. It is for that very reason that I thought that this discussion was to a certain extent unnecessary. I can in fact not add anything to what I said previously by way of statement. I want to ask the hon. member for Transkei not to be so sensitive in regard to the way in which I addressed him. It gives me reason to think that he has a guilty conscience.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But I was not the first to mention it.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am now talking about the way in which I addressed the hon. member for Durban (North). Sir, the committee is engaged on its task. We will report progress in due course. At the moment I am unable to submit any progress report. I can merely give the hon. member the assurance that a very thorough investigation will be instituted.</p>

<p>As regards the interview with Coloureds from political parties, I must admit that I have not yet received a report on that. I shall request the necessary report, and as soon as I have received it, I shall furnish him with information in regard to it. However, I think that the news report which he quoted, appeared very recently. I think it appeared only yesterday?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is correct.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Therefore I am not yet in a position to give him any information in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised the matter of allowances to police officials in the Transkei again. I have discussed this matter with the hon. member on a previous occasion. Now I just want to inform that hon. member of the Cabinet’s decision. They decided that an allowance was payable to White officials. I want the hon. member to listen very carefully. An allowance was payable to White officials in the service of a Bantu authority. That is the first point. Secondly, they must be in a recognized homeland, or thirdly, it must be an area where limited self-government has been introduced. Actually, this last point is merely a qualification. Actually, there are therefore two requirements. They must be in the employ of a Bantu authority, and they must be in a recognized homeland. That is why officials who are doing service in the Transkei, and who are in the employ of the South African Government, do not receive that allowance. The only persons who receive that allowance are persons who have been seconded to the Bantu authority in the Transkei, and who fall under the jurisdiction of the Bantu authority in the Transkei.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>That is not right.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, those Whites who are officials and who fall under the direct control of the Bantu authority in the Transkei receive the allowance. If the hon. member now wants to tell me that that is not right, he can argue the matter. But the position of the Police working in the Transkei under the command of the South African Commissioner of Police is no different to that of the ordinary policemen working outside the borders of the Transkei. Their chief is still the South African Commissioner of Police. The same applies to all other public servants working in the Transkei. It is only those people who have been seconded to the Transkei, and who are being paid by the Transkei Government, <span class="col_7111-7112" refersTo="page_0705"/>and who are under the command of the Transkeian Government. It is only those people who, according to the resolution adopted by the Cabinet, are being paid an allowance by the Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>They are receiving it in the other homelands as well, not only in the Transkei.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is quite correct. That is why we have now come to this overall decision. Perhaps the hon. member is correct in stating that a degree of dissatisfaction has arisen as a result of that. However, I want to assure him that any other arrangement we want to make would result in greatly increased dissatisfaction. It may perhaps give him satisfaction to know that all the people working in his area, the Transkei, might be satisfied because he is the member for Transkei. However, if we were to pay all the people working in the Transkei an allowance while we were not paying those who worked just beyond the border an allowance, there would be a tremendous degree of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) had something to say here about the amount which was being paid to the Police, amounts which did not compare as favourably with the amounts which were being paid to the Defence Force, i.e. where a member of the Police or the Defence Force died in the execution of his duties. What is happening here is that as far as the Police are concerned the case is either dealt with under the Workmen’s Compensation Act or alternatively under the Pensions Act, whichever is best. According to my information there is a great deal of doubt, or rather, we doubt whether they are in any way worse off than in the case of the Defence Force. I want to assure the hon. member that I shall institute an investigation. Our standpoint throughout is that the Police should be treated on the same basis in the same circumstances, as far as rank and services are concerned, as the Defence Force. I do not want the police to be worse off than the Defence Force, or vice versa. If that should be the case, I shall make it my task to see to the matter. My information at the moment is that it is doubtful whether this is in fact the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the pension scheme for retired policemen which has come into operation. This scheme only applies to pensioners who retired on 1st January, 1964 or subsequently, in other words, those who retired from service prior to January 1964 are excluded from this scheme. This is the case, and I am afraid I must inform the hon. member that this matter has been raised with me on numerous occasions already. We can in fact do nothing about it. In the first instance it is not a Government scheme. I should not even be discussing it. The Chairman can rule me out of order, because I have nothing to do with this scheme. It is purely and simply a scheme of the police and of the officials themselves. It is their scheme. It is their decision. The Minister has nothing whatsoever to do with that decision. The second reason, which is the reason they are citing as to why they decided on that date as the date according to which the elderly servants are excluded, is because the matter has economic implications. Any member of the Police who retired from service before that date would have to make such a major contribution to the scheme that joining the scheme would in any case be uneconomic for him. The hon. member proposed an easy solution, i.e. that the State should subsidize. We cannot subsidize in this case. I am afraid there is simply nothing that can be done about this matter. It is a private scheme of the South African Police for members of the Police Force only. It is a scheme which they introduced, in their wisdom, to take effect as from that date. No matter how much I would like to give sympathetic consideration to the representations of others, I cannot of course do so.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, I mean the medical scheme. But it is members of the South African Police Force who have retired who belong to it. It is however a medical scheme.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to Durban and the regional offices there. That is a large complex. There was quite a good deal of delay in regard to the acquisition of the premises. The premises are now situated in Somtseuweg. Originally the tender date was more or less set for 1970. According to information which I have recently obtained from the Department of Public Works, the tender date will apparently have to be moved further into the future, after approximately 1972. But the site is available now. I should like to draw hon. members’ attention to the fact that this will be a large complex. According to my information the construction of this building complex will cost R3 million.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member also asked what would become of the other police stations in that vicinity. As far as I know, no other police stations are being closed as a result of the establishment of this new complex in Durban.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about &#x201C;the bobby on the beat&#x201D;. I should like to inform the committee that we have recently, to a greater extent than before, brought the patrolling policemen back in places. I know that there are strong representations that this should be done so that the public can see that there is a policeman patrolling the streets. Owing to the numerical strength it is not always possible for us to do so, but we have to a certain extent returned the bobby to the beat. Where conditions make it possible, we will also in future make use of him to a greater extent.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the points raised by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) and I should like to thank him for the positive contribution he has made to this debate. The hon. member mentioned the fact that he was an ex-policeman and that he wanted to improve the position of the policemen.

<p>I am accustomed to the man being responsible for the accounts, even though he is not always responsible for the deeds.</p>

<p>I should also like to reply to a few points raised by the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member once more raised the question of the <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the next-of-kin of the Bantu who died in the unfortunate incident on the Rand. The hon. member also asked questions in this regard. She asked whether these <i>ex gratia</i> payments had been considered and paid already. In the past I have given the hon. member a negative reply to these questions. I would now like to explain to the hon. member why I said that. The South African Police cannot, nor can any public servant, adopt the attitude of Father Christmas. Hon. members will agree with me that it has always been the procedure in the past that these <i>ex gratia</i> payments are not financed by departments. The Department is not even aware of whether the Bantu who died in this accident has widows, children or dependants. I should now like to furnish the hon. member with the information, since in the past questions were put to me in such a way, and I was not really in a position to give the information. Perhaps it is an encouragement for certain people to go to those people now and tell them to lay a charge against the police, but when a charge is laid against the police, the police must consider whether there is a case against them. If there is a case against the police, they must consider whether they can settle the case, or whether they must come to an agreement. That is the way in which an <i>ex gratia</i> payment may possibly be made. An <i>ex gratia</i> payment does not originate on the initiative of the South African Police. There are many circumstances which have to be taken into consideration in this case and in many other cases as well. Because no claims have as yet been made in this regard, no <i>ex gratia</i> payment has in any way been considered in respect of these persons who died in the accident.</p>

<p>That may be the case, but this is simply the procedure which has to be followed, and I prefer that this procedure should be adhered to in the South African Police. The hon. member will probably encourage these people to lay a claim, but that is how this matter is being dealt with.</p>

<p>As regards &#x201C;Trigger-happy Sam&#x201D;, to whom the hon. member referred, I just want to mention that these cases are of course always investigated. A post-mortem examination, held by a magistrate, is always carried out, and if a criminal charge arises out of the circumstances, where there is cause to do so, the Attorney-General must decide whether he is going to institute legal proceedings. It does not belong under the Police Vote to bring up the case of &#x201C;Trigger-happy Sam&#x201D; here. It is the task of police to investigate contraventions, draw up a dossier and submit a report to the Attorney-General. After all, the final decision does not lie with the police.</p>

<p>Yes, we could make a recommendation. The Arms and Ammunition Act which has just been piloted through Parliament has not been promulgated yet, with the result that the administration of the new Act is not yet in the hands of the Police. The old Act, which still applies, is still in the hands of the Department of Justice and under the control of the Minister of Justice. All that the police can still do at the moment or were able to do in the past, is to recommend that the licence for the firearm be withdrawn, and in the consideration of that matter there are also many pros and cons, since this man lives away from a densely populated area and is to a large extent alone and isolated. That is why it is still under serious consideration whether his weapon should be taken away. That I am not discussing at the moment. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether I was satisfied that the students had been dealt with objectively. I am very happy to-day to hear that she also had a measure of praise for the police in Cape Town. I am quite satisfied that in Johannesburg the matter was dealt with objectively by the police. Surely the hon. member knows that the other students who arrived there and made trouble, which could have given rise to chaos, were also prosecuted, and not only those students who belonged to her Nusas organization. I do not have the time at the moment, but I welcome a discussion of Nusas under the Interior Vote and then I should like to reveal the role the hon. member is playing. I think it is time the country realized what role the hon. member is playing, and this Nusas organization and these demonstrations which have taken place, the bitter fruits of which other countries have already plucked, will not be tolerated by anyone in South Africa except that little group. If the hon. member prefers we can discuss this question of her role. I want to say at this stage that she acted irresponsibly and recklessly in respect of Nusas and her encouragement of Nusas, and on that note I shall leave her.</p>

<p>I should like to express appreciation for the constructive ideas which were voiced from this side.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to begin by supporting what the hon. the Minister said in regard to the appointment of our new Police Commissioner, Major-General Gous, and welcome him on behalf of this side of the House. I wish to say that we are very pleased that the Public Service Commission has agreed to his reappointment for another period of office and that we wish him the best of luck in a very responsible position indeed. But having said that, I am afraid I have to say something which is not quite so pleasant. It appears from information that has been given in this House that certain members of the Police Force are under instructions to carry out investigations relevant to the Group Areas Act and in connection with the holding of identity cards by members of the general public. Will the hon. the Minister be so kind as to tell us whether a special section of the ordinary Police Force or the Criminal Investigation Department has in fact been detailed off to deal with these matters and, if so, under what kind of instructions do they work? I raise this question now because far too many oases involving police action have come to my notice during the past few years, and it seems to demand some kind of explanation from the Minister. There must surely be some distinction made between police investigations in terms of the infringement of any statute, where the possibility exists of a charge being preferred against anyone, on the one hand, and ordinary investigations which the Secretary for the Interior and his officials are entitled to make with regard to race classifications under the Population Registration Act on the other. There must be a clear distinction here and I would like to know from the Minister whether the 1,388 people who were questioned in the Thomas Boydell Building over a period of a couple of years and more were considered to be potentially criminal cases, or at least the majority of those? You see, Sir, section 12 of the Population Registration Act empowers the Secretary, or any member of the Public Service whom he may appoint, to carry out all these investigations with regard to a person’s background for information that has to be recorded in the register. Now, can the Minister explain to us under what circumstances the police are used in investigations of this kind, and why are they used at all? I want to know what sort of cases the Department of the Interior hands over to the police. I want to know whether there is some permanent form of liaison, some communal office, such as the offices in the Thomas Boydell Building in Cape Town, where members of the Police Force and officials from the Department of the Interior in fact function together? I know this happens in regard to group areas, but does it apply to the population register also? I want to give the Minister one example of the sort of thing that has been happening recently to a European constituent of mine&#x2014;a European, a person of integrity. He complained that he and his wife and his sister-in-law, all of whom were in possession of white identity cards&#x2014;and may I say that they have had them for over 10 years&#x2014;had certain action taken against them by the police. The police had been sent an anonymous letter charging that the wife was really Coloured and not White. Instead of the police finding out who had written the letter, which I would have thought would have been their first course of action, and then when they found out who it was, referring the writer of the letter to the Department of the Interior, so that, if necessary a third-party objection could have been formally lodged&#x2014;there was provision in the law for that&#x2014;with the Department, together with the payment of R20 as proof of their <i>bona <span class="col_7117-7118" refersTo="page_0708"/>fides</i> in objecting to the wife’s classification, the police decided to take action on their own. I want to know what right they had to do that, and whether this sort of action is encouraged. These two women were interrogated at great length by two detective-sergeants, not in the Thomas Boydell Building, but at Caledon Square Police Station. One of them was brought there in a police car. The wife, when she was cross-questioned at Caledon Square, throughout the entire interview was never told what she was brought in for. Both sergeants asked her about her family background and her possession of a white identity card. They suggested that she had worked at some stage for an Indian and in a most unpleasant way&#x2014;I have all the sworn statements&#x2014;they asked her whether in fact there was anything connected with her having worked in an Indian store for a few months as a shop assistant, and they then asked what white girl works for an Indian. She explained that she had worked there for a few months only after she left school in order to raise some money, and that subsequently she had only worked in white institutions. Anyway, both policemen started questioning her about her whole family, her brothers and sisters, and whom they have married, and her entire background. Hours were wasted cross-questioning this poor woman. One of the sergeants said to her that it was very funny that she had not married when she was young, but that as soon as she met a white man she married him&#x2014;this was the type of insinuation made. Finally, they informed her that her statement would be sent to Pretoria with her card and that they would see to it that she was reclassified. In fact no further action was taken against her at all. I just wonder how many other people are treated in the same way. Now, all this was done on the strength of an anonymous letter. If the letter was really anonymous, what right did the police have to take any action? And if it was not anonymous, they should have referred it to the Department. This was surely the correct procedure. But the sister was cross-questioned as well. She was fetched at her place of work and was cross-questioned at Caledon Square for five solid hours, and then she was taken back in the police car and the homes of the family were inspected, and I want to know what right of entry the police had in this instance to those homes. Finally, they let her go and said that everything was quite all right.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>No. I brought this matter to the Minister’s attention and I must say that he had the case investigated. But when the sister-in-law was brought in for cross-questioning, she made a sworn statement saying that the sergeant concerned had threatened her with 180 days’ detention if she did not co-operate. I brought this case to the attention of the Minister and he had it investigated and he wrote to me about it. He said that the two sergeants denied categorically ever having threatened her with 180 days’ detention, and in fact that the two officers had been seriously warned that this was a very grave thing to do, and I accept that the Minister had these officers warned. But the Minister went on to say in his letter that the interrogation of the women concerned resulted from anonymous information received by the police, so that in fact he agreed that their information was anonymous. I want to know to what extent the police act on receipt of anonymous information regarding population registration cases. What has it got to do with the police? And then it transpired that the detective-sergeant involved was a member of the Security Police, who had been put on to these investigations by the C.I.D. Surely, skilled detectives could be more profitably employed than in interrogating bewildered members of the public about their racial background, when in fact they are not guilty of any crime whatsoever? I would say that in spite of the denial by the hon. the Minister that these two officers knew nothing about the threat of 180 days’ detention, it is highly unlikely that any working woman, such as a wage clerk in a factory, as this woman was, would know sufficient about the intricacies of South Africa’s criminal law to be able to cite the 180 days’ detention provision at all unless somebody had put it into her head. She would be most unlikely to know anything about it, and inevitably the doubt arises in the public mind as to how many other South Africans are being subjected to this type of treatment behind the scenes; because there are other cases which I have brought to the notice of the Minister. I will pay him this tribute that whenever a case is brought to his attention, he takes immediate action and attempts to put the matter right, but I am not satisfied with the Minister’s explanation in regard to these two matters. I would like to know by what right the police take action in these matters at all. It does not fall within their province as far as I can understand, or are they instructed along these tines, and if so, by whom? I only want the hon. the Minister to answer one more question. Will he tell us what link exists in ordinary normal circumstances between the officers of the Department of the Interior, who are responsible for making inquiries relevant to people’s background and family life in terms of the Population Registration Act, and the Police Force? Who takes the initiative? Do the police act on their own in the assessment of any situation, or do they await instructions from the Department before they carry out investigations which are carried out by the C.I.D.? I would also tike to know whether a check is kept on police activities in this field by the Department of the Interior. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg will forgive me if I do not react to the involved, anonymous matters she raised. <span class="col_7119-7120" refersTo="page_0709"/>We shall leave <i>it to</i> the hon. the Minister to reply to her. Another year has gone by since we discussed the Police Vote in Committee of Supply last year, a year in which the S.A. Police Force has once again made its contribution not only towards preserving the internal security of South Africa, but also towards combating crime. We are proud of the S.A. Police. We are proud of what they are doing, and of what they have achieved. In spite of the shortage of manpower, we are grateful for and proud of what they have done. This is the task of each individual in South Africa; we should not simply leave the task of combating crime to the South African policeman; it is the task of each one of us to combat crime, and therefore I just want to refer in brief here this afternoon to a matter which is not of a very pleasant nature. I am referring to a report which appeared in the <i>Daily Despatch</i> of 19th May, 1969, and which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>White Farmers accused of aiding Stock Thieves:</i></block>

<block name="quote">Umtata: White farmers in the Elliot and Maclear districts were working hand in glove with stock thieves and this made it impossible for these cattle rustlers to be tracked down, the Democratic Party member for Engcobo, Mr. Lewis Majija, said in the Transkei Legislative Assembly here yesterday.</block>

<p>Sir, that was an unfortunate speech, and it was also an unfortunate report. It was not only a rash speech, but also a very irresponsible one. I do not believe a greater crime can be committed in this multi-racial country of ours than the crime of making speeches such as this and of inciting people of different race groups against one another. Here we have a community on the borders of the Transkei, the members of which have been co-operating with the citizens of the Transkei all their lives, who have always been well-disposed towards them, who have always helped them under all circumstances, and now such allegations are made against them. If the allegation had been made that one or two of them had committed offences of this nature, it would have been a different matter, but this allegation was made against the entire white community living in those two districts. I have a letter on my person from the chairman of the North-Eastern Cape Agricultural Union, who reacted strongly to this statement. What the allegation amounts to is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That farmers in the Elliot and Maclear districts are friendly with the thieves. These farmers buy stolen stock from thieves. They first ask the thieves whether the stock has been stolen and when told so they rush the stock away for re-sale elsewhere. The police do watch certain border points but these farmers working on friendly terms with the thieves break down fences in certain places to allow stolen stock to go through, Mr. Majija said.</block>

<p>Sir, this allegation is devoid of 99.9 per cent of truth. The Whites in those areas are law-abiding people; the Police can testify to this, and this allegation is devoid of all truth. I take the strongest exception to this remark made by Mr. Majija in the Transkeian Parliament. I should like to take this matter a little further and urge the hon. the Minister to change our approach in respect of the reserves. Transport here has undergone a complete change during the past decade, as a result of the improvement of our roads and the fact that modern cars are much faster. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the time has not arrived for control posts to be established between the reserves and the white areas.</p>

<p>That is all very well, but has the state of affairs not changed during the past 40 years; do we not have tarred roads which link up with others all over the country to-day? It is possible for a criminal to leave Johannesburg by car in the morning, commit burglary in the Transkei that evening and be back in Johannesburg the following day. Was this possible in the old days? That is why I want to advocate the establishment of patrol posts between us and the reserves, but the Police Force need not necessarily be used for that purpose. The Police Force is in the neighbourhood, and people can be trained through the medium of short courses, and can be stationed on the borders. This system has been in operation between Lesotho and South Africa for many years. Why can this not be done in this case as well? The Police can then exercise supervision over the people guarding the borders. Sir, I think this matter is a very important one. If such control posts were to be established, that would eliminate many problems and would also protect many people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Aliwal mentioned a speech made in Another Place in the Transkei and said that this was an irresponsible speech. I agree with him; it was irresponsible, and it is apparent that irresponsible speeches are not only made in this House. He also took exception to the insinuations made there because they were made against a white community. What about the insinuations which were made by the hon. the Minister with regard to a certain community in South Africa? What about the insinuations made by the hon. member for Ermelo about a certain community in South Africa? Why has the hon. member not taken exception to those insinuations? No, he has only taken exception to this particular insinuation because it was made in the Transkeian Parliament. It is quite obvious from his closing comments about border posts that he is still stuck with the mentality of the arch-&#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D;. Does <span class="col_7121-7122" refersTo="page_0710"/>he regard the Transkei and the Bantu reserves as foreign countries? Sir, I do not think there is any need to discuss this matter any further.</p>

<p>I should like briefly to discuss with the hon. the Minister a report which appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> this morning under the headline &#x201C;Multi-racial service broken up&#x201D; and ask him whether it is not possible for him in some way to bring about some change in the relationship between the Police and the students in South Africa. Sir, this report which was received this morning has upset me and I want to ask the hon. the Minister this pertinent, direct question: Was it necessary to break up a religious service to arrest these students? I am quite prepared to accept that they had committed an offence. It appears that they were on land owned by the Bantu Trust without permits; that they had committed an offence which was a continuing offence, but, if this report is correct, surely the arrests could have been made before or after the service. Was it necessary to break up this service? Sir, we have heard a great deal here to-day about the Police Force, and let me say that what I am going to say now gives me pain as the son of an expoliceman on pension. But as the hon. the Minister said a little earlier, we are engaged in something which is not a &#x201C;sissy&#x201D; game and therefore, unfortunately, I have to take off the gloves.</p>

<p>On the 9th May I asked the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether members of the Security Branch of the South African Police searched the room of any office bearer of NUSAS in Pietermaritzburg during February, 1969.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister’s reply was &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. I further asked him &#x201C;whether this office bearer was subsequently questioned; if so, on what dates?&#x201D; The reply of the hon. the Minister was &#x201C;No&#x201D;. On the 16th May I asked the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether the chairman of the local branch of NUSAS in Pietermaritzburg was questioned by members of the South African Police during 1969?</block>

<p>The answer was &#x201C;No&#x201D;. Sir, I have in my possession an affidavit signed by a certain James Sabiston Corrigall, to this effect&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have been Chairman of the NUSAS local committee at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg since July, 1968.</block>

<p>The affidavit goes on to read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On 5 February, 1969, four members of the Security Police came to my mother’s house &#x2026; I was taken to the office of Warrant Officer Van Rensburg who interrogated me for about one and a half hours. He asked me about NUSAS and Students’ Representative Council matters, mainly in relation to student protests.</block>

<p>Sir, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister which of these statements is correct? Were the replies given to my questions correct, or is this affidavit correct?</p>

<p>Sir, on the 9th May I asked the hon. the Minister &#x201C;Whether he&#x201D;&#x2014;that is to say, a member of NUSAS&#x2014;&#x201C;was questioned in connection with a letter&#x201D;. The reply was that that falls away as under the previous question the Minister had said that no interrogation had taken place. On the 16th May I asked the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether any office bearer of NUSAS in Pietermaritzburg was questioned during 1969 by members of the South African Police in connection with a letter.</block>

<p>The reply was &#x201C;No&#x201D;. Sir, this affidavit goes on to read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They (the Police) produced a search warrant and said they believed I had written a threatening letter to the Prime Minister.</block>

<p>The student who was being interrogated was asked to write certain things. Amongst them were the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;If you get hit by a bullet during the uprising it will be entirely your own fault.&#x201D; &#x201C;The hon. B. J. Vorster is the Prime Minister of the Republic of South Africa.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Here is another example: &#x201C;Limehill is in Natal;&#x201D; &#x201C;I enjoyed my stay in Cape Town although I did not get to see the Houses of Parliament.&#x201D; The affidavit goes on to say that he was interrogated again on the 28th April, 1969; again by Warrant Officer Van Rensburg. [Interjections.] He was there for half an hour; it does not matter why he was there. I am dealing with the hon. the Minister and the questions put to him in this House. The affidavit says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I was there for half an hour during which I gave further handwriting examples.</block>

<p>He was asked again to write certain things and amongst them were such peculiar things as &#x201C;ann other&#x201D;, &#x201C;shoctover&#x201D;. Sir, does this not imply that some letter must have been under consideration, and particularly his express statement, &#x201C;they believed I had written a threatening letter to the Prime Minister&#x201D;. Sir, certain questions arise from this: Who has given the wrong information; was it the hon. the Minister; was it members of his staff? Has there been a mistake? Could this mistake have occurred three times? It goes further: Can the veracity of Ministerial replies to questions put <span class="col_7123-7124" refersTo="page_0711"/>in this House be relied upon? Sir, you are aware of the fact that the replies to these questions are quoted as authority outside as well as inside this House; and we, the members of the Opposition, very often find that this is the only means whereby we can obtain information on which we can build a speech. If the replies to questions asked in this House cannot be relied upon, the whole system of Parliament may as well be scrapped. Parliament itself falls into disrepute because of this sort of thing. Sir, why was this interrogation of this student by Warrant Officer Van Rensburg denied by the hon. the Minister and his department on three separate occasions? Why was reference to this letter alleged to have been addressed to the hon. the Prime Minister denied on two separate occasions?</p>

<p>Sir, in the questions which I put to the hon. the Minister I also raised certain other points: What was the nature of the letter; to whom was it addressed; is a charge envisaged? The only reply I received from the hon. the Minister was this: A possible charge of <i>crimen injuria</i> or of contravening the Post Office Act. He denied, however, that there was any question of a letter. Sir, I think this is a very serious matter. [Laughter.] Sir, I hope that the laughter of hon. members on the other side is being recorded. Here I am questioning the integrity of the hon. the Minister. I am sorry to do it. As I said at the beginning it pains me to have to question either the Minister’s integrity or that of his department, but this is something which has to be said and I have now said it. [Laughter.] Sir, hon. members opposite laugh; I hope that fact will be recorded in Hansard, because I will certainly use it outside.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the minute which is still at my disposal, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that for three years I have been asking his predecessor about a police station at Hcmmarsdale. I am sure that his officials will tell him that the highest officials in Natal have suggested that this is a matter of extreme urgency. They did so four or five years ago, and unfortunately we again find this year that there is merely a re-vote of R50 on the Estimates. I wonder if it is not possible in some way to expedite the establishment of this police station, which is a matter of urgency. The hon. the Minister has not only my word for that but also the word of his own officials in Natal.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should also like to bring a few points to the Minister’s attention. Firstly, I want to refer to the position at Ovis Tunnel, where a tunnel is being constructed to link up with the Orange River. Quite a large township was established at Oviston recently, in which quite a few hundred Whites and slightly more non-Whites are living. However, they have no police service there at all. A retired policeman, a certain Mr. Van der Vyver, served there a while ago, but he was taken ill recently and has not been reappointed there. There is a good deal of licentiousness at Ovis Tunnel at the moment. I have received various deputations from Venterstad and I have been asked to draw the Minister’s attention to the fact that parties at which Whites and non-Whites mix were being held in that vicinity at night and that laws passed by Parliament were being disregarded altogether. I am referring to the immorality laws.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, this is no laughing matter. I should like to draw the Minister’s attention to the fact that it is absolutely essential to have some kind of supervision. But supervision is not only needed at Ovis Tunnel, because a further two camps have been erected for the construction of the tunnel, namely at Midshaft and at Theebus, where more or less the same conditions prevail, because there are no policemen there either.</p>

<p>Another matter which is causing us a great deal of concern in those parts, is the fact that, where most farmers above the Vanderkloof Dam have been bought out, the owners have already moved away, with the result that there are thousands of morgen on which there are no white people living. Stock theft is taking place there on a large scale now. When I visited my constituency two weeks ago, various farmers sent deputations to me to draw my attention to the fact that some plan or other had to be devised as extremely large numbers of stock were being lost now. I asked them in what way they were losing their sheep, and they told me that they were disappearing from camps in groups of between 30 and 50 at a time. We have a reasonably large police establishment at Colesberg, but not such a large one at Petrusville, and it seems to me as though we will have to set about matters in quite a different way. I do not think it will be sufficient only to patrol the roads in that area. This work will have to be done by night and detectives will be required for it. The suggestion I want to make to the Minister and the Commissioner of Police is that we should make use of Bantu detectives. Since they know how to set about it, a Bantu should simply go to a farm in his usual old clothes and even with his bundle on his back and go into service with a farmer. We can get a number of them to do this. Ten to fifteen farms are lying unoccupied at the moment because they were leased to persons, but only Bantus are living on them at present. It may be that one Bantu will not give another away, but I do think that the Bantu police will be able to take action there and perhaps bring to book the guilty ones. This has caused a very great deal of unrest among the people, and I have been asked to draw the Minister’s attention to this matter urgently and to ask him whether those losses could not perhaps be eliminated in future. I want to emphasize once again that the only way in which the guilty persons can be brought to book is to place Bantu detectives <span class="col_7125-7126" refersTo="page_0712"/>in that area. Six Bantu detectives could perhpas be placed there if there are so many available.</p>

<p>For the rest I can only say that the police services we are receiving in those parts are excellent. It has been said in this House this afternoon that some of our policemen are sometimes a bit rough in the way they handle people, but you cannot blame a policeman for taking strong action sometimes. There are so many cases. I have seen such cases myself. I should like to say this to my friend the hon. member for Walmer. Say for instance a Coloured person or a Bantu attacks a white policeman with the intention of stabbing him. What is such a policeman to do? He cannot simply shoot him. All he can do is to knock him down. That is all. The attacker usually has a witness with him, but the poor policeman has none. Such a person could then lay a charge against the policeman for assaulting him, while that never was the case. I think it is the member for Durban (Point) who said that policemen act irresponsibly sometimes. A time comes when they have to act. When something has to be done, it simply has to be done. Many of these people are under the influence of liquor. The first thing they grab is a knife. The police cannot simply use their revolvers. They have to defend themselves with their hands, and this is a dangerous way of defending oneself.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that the services generally rendered to the public of South Africa by the Police are such that we can only speak of them with the highest praise.</p>

I have been sitting here from the time the discussions started. As far as I am concerned, this is one of the most pleasant debates we have had this year, although there were discordant notes here and there. I have listened to the Opposition, and they differed a little here and there with the hon. the Minister and the Commissioner in command of this great Force. It is a Force for which we should all have respect because the safety of all of us depends on them. We all appreciate the services rendered to our country by the Police. Some of the members of the United Party made suggestions here and there with a view to bringing about improvements. In former years we usually had a minor civil war being waged here. The spirit and the attitude are quite different this year and I want to congratulate the Minister and the Commissioner on it.</p>

<p>Then I should like to give my wholehearted support to the Minister’s appeal to us and to the country for contributions and funds for our people on the borders, who have to face many hardships. I do not want to boast against the hon. member for Kroonstad now, because he also spoke about this. I do not know what amount he has collected or intends collecting, but I may say to the House that we are going to send a cheque for R2,300 to the Commissioner of Police next week. That is Lichtenburg’s contribution. The appeal made by the hon. members for Kroonstad and Omaruru, as well as by the hon. the Minister, should be noted by this House. There is no doubt that these people are suffering many hardships, and for our freedom, for our interests and for our survival. We must show our appreciation in this way.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to associate myself with the hon. member who congratulated the Minister on the way he handled this Vote for the first time. It has been pleasant. We want to wish him every success in the years to come.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Lichtenburg mentioned the action that has been taken by members of the Police Force on the borders of South Africa. We on this side of the House certainly associate ourselves with the magnificent work which is being done by the men in those areas. We also believe that the State should perhaps grant more relief and assistance to these people, rather than that it should be left to charity to provide comforts for these men who are serving their country with such distinction.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I want to deal with certain matters concerning police reservists. The hon. the Minister, when replying to other speeches which have been made, gave some information in regard to police reservists, but I believe that greater attention should be given to this part of the Police Force. It is obvious from the reports of the Commissioner of Police that they are accepted as an integral part of the Police Force. The reply to a question which I put in the House last month, indicated the latest figures of the number of people serving in the Police Reserve. Here I believe that a greater effort must be made so as to attract more people into the service of the Police Reserve. It is obvious that, with numbers of the Police Force actively engaged in fighting terrorists, certain other work here on the home front, as one might term it, has to be undertaken by police reservists. Therefore it is a little disappointing that the figures in recent times have not shown any marked improvement as far as the numbers of police reservists are concerned. I believe that it is important that when the Department of Police undertakes its various recruiting campaigns for people to join the Police Force, they should also include in their propaganda and publicity, <span class="col_7127-7128" refersTo="page_0713"/>the activities of the Police Reserve, and so encourage these people to give their time to this very important task, particularly in our cities.</p>

<p>There is, however, one aspect which, I believe, is also important when it comes to attracting people to serve in the Police Reserve, and that is the question of compensation. The hon. member for Green Point mentioned this aspect and also indicated how police reservists have in the past lost their lives in the course of their duties. It is a pity that these police reservists appear to be covered only by compensation in terms of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. In one particular case where a police reservist lost his life in the execution of his duties, his widow was awarded only a R200 gratuity, a R36 per month pension and R18 per month for each of her two children. This gives her an income of R72 per month to support herself and her two minor children, and a gratuity of only R200 for the loss of a life.</p>

<p>Here, I believe, is a great shortcoming as far as the security of police reservists are concerned in the course of their duties. We realize that these people are exposed to the same dangers as a person serving as a full-time member of the Police Force. Therefore, it is imperative to give security to these people that they can realize that they will be compensated adequately should they lose their lives in the course of their duty.</p>

<p>Another aspect which I believe is important is the issue of free uniforms to police reservists so as to make them a more integral part of the Police Force. I believe that these people who are performing excellent duties, particularly in our cities, should receive full recognition as an important part of our Police Force in the policing of our cities in these present times.</p>

<p>There is another aspect in regard to the shortage of police which I should like to mention, namely the employment of temporary police whereby we have the re-employment of pensioners. These pensioners are re-employed on a basis which, of course, is different to the basis upon which full-time policemen are appointed. However, these people are also performing a very important task in maintaining an adequate Police Force in South Africa. When they serve as temporary policemen, many of them obviously are pensioners and have reached an advanced age in some cases and require a greater amount of sick leave. In terms of the provisions of the employment of these temporary police officers they only receive 30 days sick leave in a cycle of three years. Many of these temporary policemen are performing excellent service. Some of them are now even appointed as station commanders although they are only serving as temporary policemen.</p>

<p>Another aspect which I should like to draw the hon. the Minister’s attention to is the question of the Police Service in regard to prevention of crime particularly amongst the younger people. If one looks at the position in other parts of the world one sees the important part that is played by the Police Force in the prevention of crime and particularly as far as juvenile crime is concerned. Some years ago there was a force known as the Ghost Squad which was part of the Police Force. This squad performed excellent duties in the Durban area particularly concentrating on the younger people. It was a great pity when this force was disbanded, because particularly those people who are concerned with youth organizations were always pleased when they knew that they could call upon the Ghost Squad, as it was known, to assist them in the prevention of crime in many instances. Recently I read an article which appeared in &#x201C;International Criminal Police Review&#x201D; published by Interpol. This was an article setting out the part played by the police in the prevention of juvenile delinquency in various parts of the world. Here these special youth squads have been established in many countries with a great deal of success. As far as New Zealand is concerned, they found that the formation of a new branch of the Police Force known as the juvenile crime prevention branch resulted in a considerable drop in juvenile delinquency in that country. It was also found that it was possible in this squad to employ women police to attend to certain matters that sometimes arise where women police can be of great assistance to the police in the carrying out of their duties. We know that in South Africa it is difficult in the various circumstances that exist to often employ women as policewomen. However, it is found that in the question of dealing with particularly juveniles there are many instances where a woman can be used in the Police Force with a great deal of effect and a great deal of success. Therefore I believe that the hon. the Minister should give consideration to ways and means of supplementing the Police Force by greater recruitment and by extending the Police reservists particularly amongst the Bantu people. I understand it has been an experiment up to now as far as the Police reservists in the Bantu areas are concerned. The Bantu themselves can play an important part in maintaining law and order, particularly in Bantu townships. A greater effort should be made to recruit these Bantu for the Police Reserve. I believe it would be a great improvement to the activities of our Police Force particularly as regards the prevention of crime by a juvenile crime prevention branch of the Police Force. The necessary manpower could be derived from also using women police in certain instances where it is deemed necessary. Here I refer particularly to the question of children. We know that in various instances offences have been committed in terms of the Children’s Act. It is necessary for the welfare organizations to get the aid of the Police Force in carrying out certain removals that might be necessary as far as undesirable parents are concerned. It often leaves a very severe scar <span class="col_7129-7130" refersTo="page_0714"/>on the minds of the children when the Police are called in to remove the parents. This scar will remain in the minds of the children for many years. It is found in other parts of the world that women police can be used in connection with the implementation of the various provisions of the Children’s Act or where certain contraventions of the Children’s Act are taking place. We know too that South Africa can be proud of the record of its young people. However, it is always important to see that that proud record is maintained. I believe that the Police Force, by expanding its activities in regard to the prevention of crime, particularly as far as juveniles are concerned, have been doing a great service to South Africa and a great service to the future citizens of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before expressing a few thoughts in connection with our Police Force, I just want to bring a local matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister, namely the poor state of repair of the buildings of the police station at Groot Marico. I have mentioned this matter on various occasions in this House. The police officials at Groot Marico must be satisfied with buildings which are quite unsuitable and very old indeed. I hope and trust that these buildings will be replaced so that those people may also have pleasant accommodation and find their work more pleasant.</p>

<p>It also gives me pleasure to extend my personal congratulations to General Gous on the outstanding way in which he performed the duties attached to this most responsible position as chief of the South African Police since he was promoted last year. To be chief of the South African Police in times of unrest, such as we are experiencing at present, is to find oneself in a most unenviable position. I wish him success in carrying out this responsible task. We have full confidence in him and in the Police Force. If one looks at the statistics which are given in this informative annual report there are a few things which strike one. In the first place, one aspect that strikes one, is the small number, namely 31,753, policemen on the actual establishment. The authorized establishment was 33,628, but the actual establishment was only 31,753 last year. This figure represents 1.70 policemen per 1,000 of the population of South Africa. This small number of policemen had to deal with nearly three million cases which were brought to their attention. The police, who constitute only 1.70 per 1,000 of the population of the country, had to deal with 605,254 prosecutions. What really struck me was the fact that there was a downward trend in the number of persons per 1,000 who were prosecuted annually. The statistics furnished here date from the year 1912. The number of prosecutions per 1.000 of the population was 46 at that time. During the following 40 years there was an upward trend. In 1952 the number of prosecutions per 1,000 of the population was 99. After that year the number of prosecutions increased rapidly and during the next nine years it exceeded 100. It reached the maximum of 119 in 1956. The number of prosecutions per 1,000 of the population for the ten years ending 1961 was more than 100. In 1962 it was 80, and then it dropped immediately to 13 for the first half of 1963 and to 30, 29, 29 and 32 during the following years. In 1967-’68 there were 31 prosecutions. South Africa should take note of these figures, because it can only mean one of two things; it shows either a growing respect among potential criminals for the effectiveness of the organization and the actions of the Police Force or a general improvement which has taken place in our national way of life. I think the former rather than the latter is true. I think the downward trend is attributable to the fact that people have a greater respect for the long arm of the law. The services rendered by our Police Force in our country are tremendous. When reading these figures one must reflect for a moment to grasp fully what the Police Force really has to deal with. It has to render its services within cosmopolitan, urban areas with a high population density. Apart from that they also have to render service to the vast areas of our fatherland. In the urban areas they have to keep a watchful eye at all times. In the country areas mobility and the ability to move from one point to another owing to the long distances, is of great importance.</p>

<p>These services must be rendered in a multinational country where tension sometimes arises at the level of contact and relations among various races, which has to be handled in such a way that that tension will disappear and good relations will be effected and maintained. It requires the greatest sense of responsibility on the part of the Police Force which sometimes finds itself between these groups under difficult circumstances. I think tribute must be paid to the Police Force for the way in which they carry out their various tasks at this delicate level in our multinational country. If we analyse the duties and responsibilities of the Police, it becomes clear that their activities cover a tremendously wide field. Mention has already been made of this during the discussions. They form the buffer between the world of crime and society. The police are constantly finding themselves in a state of &gt;war. They are not subject to a declaration of war before they may start fighting. They are constantly in the front lines where they face the enemy day and night on a multitude of fronts. The fighting methods of the Police Force differ from the methods applied by defence forces in time of war. They do not operate in commandos or in units; they fight as individuals, as two-man teams or mostly as a handful of men where they have to face the enemy. One must have courage to confront the enemy by oneself, an enemy who is sometimes a hardened criminal. They have to hunt down the criminal who is <span class="col_7131-7132" refersTo="page_0715"/>the confirmed enemy of society, and if he does not want to surrender, he has to be overpowered. A police constable has to face death man to man and must force the enemy whether dead or alive to surrender. As I have said already, this requires courage. By virtue of their duties they are the protectors of house and home, and limb and life in our society, and they must sometimes pay with their lives for our safety. We want to say to them that we appreciate what they do. The Police Force also has to deal with the well-organized masterminds and gangs of the underworld. They must outwit these thugs of the underworld and bring them to book. The professional criminals plan their crimes with great skill. Sound training and great skill are required from the members of the Police Force to carry out the difficult task of dealing with skilled underworld organizations. They must be fine detectives and fine soldiers at the same time. They have to follow criminals at all levels in order to get them out of their lairs and hiding places. In this connection one has the greatest respect for our Police Force, and that is why the State should do all it possibly can to give these men the necessary training. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister a matter which is of the utmost importance to my constituency, namely that of stock theft. This matter has been touched on this afternoon, but I believe the people in my constituency are more exposed to this threat than the people anywhere else in the Republic in that we border on a foreign territory and that we also border on a country which is in the process of becoming independent. We also have Pantu reserves which criss-cross the entire constituency.</p>

<p>One of the points that worries me in the report of the Commissioner of the South African Police is the figures given for stock theft. The total number of cases reported was 35,110, of which 6,708 were found to be false upon investigation. The number of undetected cases amounted to 16.000, which makes a total of 22,774, out of 35,110 cases of stock theft which the Department was not able to solve, as I understand the figures given by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>It is one of the most difficult crimes to solve.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I agree one hundred per cent and I want to say that I am very grateful indeed for the work that is done in detecting and following up this kind of crime. As the hon. the Minister says it is one of the most difficult crimes to solve, especially where one has an area such as we have in the Underberg district. A special meeting was held in this district on the 19th December with senior Police officials in Natal to try to sort out some kind of answer to the raider who comes over the border from Lesotho at night.</p>

<p>The full-moon period is of particular importance, when people travelling at night have the assistance of the full moon to see where they are going. They can see the stock they intend rustling and can also see the place where the stock can be safely kept over the following day, should they be pursued so that the stock can then be taken over the border on the following night during the period of the full moon. One of the suggestions which was made at the meeting with the officials of the hon. the Minister’s Department, was that mounted patrols should be instituted. The piece of ground under discussion is an area which falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Forestry and which is uninhabited. Obviously this area offers itself as an ideal base for operations of this sort where people from over our borders may seek a place to settle down for the night, scout the country and then carry on their practice of rustling stock during the moonlit periods. A suggestion was made at this meeting upon which I would like the hon. the Minister to comment.</p>
