<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned last night I was drawing the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fantastic advances that have been made since we last discussed the question of the design of Richard&#x2019;s Bay harbour and the plans for our harbours in South Africa generally. I had mentioned to the hon. the Minister that since 1966, when we regarded large tankers as being tankers between 86,000 and 100,000 tonners, these figures had advanced considerably until we were now thinking in terms of 312,000 to 500,000 tonners. I want to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice one point which I think stands out very clearly and that is that these huge tankers must use the Cape route. Even if Suez is re-opened they will not return to the Suez Canal route. When we come to the 500,000 tonners I believe that even empty they will be unable to negotiate the Suez Canal. What I want to do is to ensure that the hon. the Minister is updating the planning of Richard&#x2019;s Bay harbour, which is designed to cope with these big tankers and bulk carriers, sufficiently to enable the harbour to cope with what is available by the time it is ready for service and also to ensure that it will be adequate, with adaptations, to cope with future requirements. That is the first aspect I want to put to the Minister. Then, as you know, Sir, I said in an earlier stage of this debate that the harbour at Durban, I believe, should be developed along modern lines for the handling of cargo other than bulk cargoes. I believe that Durban Harbour can become one of the most highly specialized harbours in the world, and I believe it should be. It should be specialized along what I believe is the modern trend in harbour development not only in South Africa but throughout the world. I stress containerization and I speak about containerization instead of containers, because containerization consists of more than just putting goods in big boxes and putting them on ships and transporting them where you want to transport them. I want to deal, firstly, with unitization and what is going to be required in our harbours for unitization.</p>

<p>Now, unitization seems to be sorting itself out as being particularly suitable to the coasting trade where goods are palletized and in fact they are bonded on to pallets, so that the future requirement of this type of trade is possibly going to be a shed which has no ramp. It will be some type of wharf which can serve drive-on and drive-off traffic, because these ships are going to be loaded in many cases in the future by side ports, where fork-lift trucks will take the goods on to the ship through one port and they will take it off at the other port.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the question of containers and what they are going to require at our ports. My time is limited, but I want to deal with as much as I can in the time available. What is needed for containers? First of all, I think the Minister will agree that you need stacking space where the cargo for a ship which is due is assembled so that that ship can be handled without any delay. The Minister knows that to-day a full container is taken off the ship and a full one is loaded in its place because of the cell system which is employed. Such ships can turn around far more quickly. Then I think the Minister should provide for suitable cranes. These are specialized jobs to handle containers and the Minister is not unaware of the type of crane or gantry crane I am talking about. But containers are most common and it is rather interesting to note that in a report by Dr. Kleinbloesem, who is Rotterdam&#x2019;s director of trade, transport and industry, his survey shows that ships now in service have a capacity for 25,000 containers. Ships on order will accommodate 65,000 containers. Old type ships which are converting will make provision for another 6,000 containers and ships under study will provide for another 22,000 containers, a total of 118,000 containers by 1970. This means that he envisages that the container trade will have trebled itself by 1970, in one year from now. I believe this is the speed with which containerization is overtaking us, and that is why I am bringing these matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I should also like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that big companies are going in for a specialized type of container ship, which I think is evidence of their confidence in the future of containers. They do not believe that we will ever go back to the old methods of transporting goods by ship. Let us take a look at Moore-McCormack for example, a big American company of whom the Minister is aware. They believe in what they call &#x201C;ro-ro&#x201D;. They say. &#x201C;Ro-ro rules the waves&#x201D;&#x2014;roll on, roll off. They believe that in due course everything is going to be carried on a roll on, roll off basis. Let me give an example to the Minister of their faith in this type of trade. They are building four new ships each of which will take 51 40-foot trailers and make provision for 290 containers, plus liquid in bulk roll on, roll off containers. This is quite fantastic for these are going to be very specialized ships and they are going to cost a lot of money. They believe in due course the container of which we are talking now, which is a box in units measuring 40 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet, will be put on wheels by mounting those containers on a set of wheels on a chassis. Those will be rolled on and off the ship. Already this type of traffic, as the Minister knows, is very fashionable between Britain and the Continent and so forth.</p>

<p>Then we come to the Lukes Lines who are spending 100 million dollars on three very specialized ships. They are referred to in the December issue of Ports and Terminals as &#x201C;not so much a new ship, more a revolution&#x201D;. They <span class="col_2445-2446" refersTo="page_1245"/>are in fact a revolution. The report goes on as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;These ships are going to be of approximately 44,000 tons each. They are going to have the capacity to carry 38 barges containing 17,500 tons of cargo, or available cargo space for more than 1,600 containers of standard size (40 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet), or the facility to handle roll on, roll off vehicles in unitized loads, plus deep tanks capable of accepting 15,000 tons of liquid cargo, plus a heavy lift capacity of 2,000 tons, far greater than any other ship or crane in the world.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I quote these points just to show to the Minister the fact that the shipping community throughout the world have placed their faith in the future of containerization.</p>

<p>What of South Africa? Is this going to apply to us here? Let me quote a South African on this briefly, Mr. Henri Timmerman, who is the president of McGregor Comaran, South Africa. What does he say briefly? He talks about ship owners, and this is what he says:</p>

<block name="quote">For those owners who hesitate to take part in this revolution the prospects of long-term survival are poor.</block>

<p>I do not believe South Africa can escape from or remain outside this revolution, because this revolution in shipping is something which is going to mean the survival or the disappearance of the shipping industry throughout the world. This is going to apply to South Africa as it is going to apply to every continent in the world.</p>

<p>My object in putting this matter to the Minister is this. I want to ask him to tell us, and I believe that he can, what his views are concerning the future of containerization. In which ports is he going to provide facilities? I believe he is going to provide it in Durban and Cape Town because he has already given such indications. I want to ask him if sufficient provision has been made, in his opinion, for the introduction of containerization in the new planning for Cane Town harbour. I believe it has because the committee report has dealt with this particular aspect. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the &#x201C;Two-man Mutual Admiration Society&#x201D; which has been functioning, has been most entertaining, but I think the dialogue should be brought back to what it was when we discussed matters in this House a year ago. I want to refer to certain criticism that was levelled at the hon. the Minister by the hon. member for Umlazi which the Minister now rates as being &#x201C;highly intelligent&#x201D;.</p>

<p>A year ago the hon. the Minister was constrained to refer to the hon. member for Umlazi in this manner. He said to the hon. member, &#x201C;One would think that our harbours are totally inadequate&#x201D;. The reply from the hon. member, according to Hansard, is as follows: &#x201C;I am going to ask him (the hon. the Minister) to pay more attention to planning so that we do not have to repeat this criticism every year&#x201D;. It is quite interesting to hear the hon. member for Umlazi, if I might use the expression, &#x201C;jacking up&#x201D; the Minister with slightly different words. When what is now &#x201C;highly intelligent criticism&#x201D; was levelled at the Minister last year, he made this interesting retort to the hon. member for Umlazi, He said: &#x201C;You overestimate your importance&#x201D;. The charming retort from the hon. member for Umlazi was that the hon. the Minister did not know his Saldanha from his Rietvlei. May I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he takes particular care to distinguish his Harry of today from the &#x201C;rooi haring&#x201D; he also has to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi last year said that &#x201C;here in Cape Town alone the planning is chaotic. I use the word &#x2018;chaotic&#x2019; advisedly&#x201D;. Those were the words used by the hon. member for Umlazi. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that the position in Cape Town remains chaotic to-day as well. I think that what is indicative is the fact mentioned by the hon. member for Umlazi himself to-day, namely that containerization will be on us by 1970, and nothing has been done in Table Bay to be able to cope with the problem. I want to say immediately to the hon. the Minister that I have no criticism of the persons actively employed in the job of running our docks. I have no criticism of the personnel and what they are doing in Table Bay harbour; but they are frustrated and handicapped by the Minister&#x2019;s continuing inactivity so far as Table Bay is concerned. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, and I do this with the greatest of respect to him, whether the time has not come for him to descend from his shooting box and to come and visit the Table Bay docks himself and see what is going on there. I hope the time will be found now that he has put away his gun. He should not leave it to the Management and the local officers in charge, but he should take a direct interest in Table Bay, in the matters that affect the members of his staff and the public in so far as Table Bay docks is concerned. There are delays in Table Bay docks at the moment which are causing concern. I want to say that I accept the explanation which was given by the authorities and that this delay in clearance is partly due to the dilatoriness of the consignees themselves.</p>

<p>But there is another cause for the delay in the Cape Town docks, namely the chaotic state of traffic in the docks area. That is due to a criss-cross of roads and rails that I believe is unequalled in any other dock area. There are delays of movement of trucks and trains, because of this criss-cross of transport facilities which should have been modernized many, many years ago. I put a question to the hon. the Minister about a plan for road over rail bridges in the docks area, and also with regard to access. He said that the matter was being investigated. The hon. the Minister should <span class="col_2447-2448" refersTo="page_1246"/>know that one of his former harbour engineers, who is now off on pension, submitted such a scheme years ago, which would have alleviated the chaotic position as it is in the docks area. But we hear that the matter is now to be considered. I do want to ask the hon. the Minister please to give his personal attention to this matter, because it is urgent. It is vital, and with the expansion of Table Bay docks, one does not know quite what will happen in that area, unless the road over rail facilities are provided.</p>

<p>The second point I want to mention to the hon. the Minister is the question of the tug service in Table Bay docks. Last night the hon. the Minister interjected to refute the idea that shipping was held up and that berths were empty at the Table Bay docks because of the slow handling of incoming ships. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to check whether during the last fortnight occasions have not arisen more than once in which a tug has remained idle in the docks because of lack of crew while ships were waiting to be berthed in Table Bay docks. It is because of the fact that the hon. the Minister will not take steps to see that those tugs are adequately crewed if necessary by non-Europeans in certain of the functions to be performed on those tugs. The crews are not there. The hon. the Minister in reply to a question indicates that, as far as our harbours are concerned, there are a shortage of 152 stokers on tugs and dredgers alone and that there is a shortage of 240 deck hands. According to the annual report the total fleet is 17 tugs, 14 pilot tugs and 9 dredgers. There is a shortage of 152 stokers as far as the service is concerned in regard to tugs and dredges. This is happening because the necessary white personnel cannot be found to fulfil many of the jobs which have to be done on these tugs. I understand that at other harbours the hon. the Minister is employing non-Whites as stokers on tugs. Why can this not be done to expedite matters in Cape Town? It can be done with full protection to the white personnel of the Railways and Harbours Administration. The hon. the Minister has found it possible to have jobs formerly done by Whites taken over by non-Whites in 8,000 cases, without a detrimental effect on the employment of Whites. The time has come that this should be done in respect of Cape Town docks. Then there is also the incredible story of the &#x201C;Loerie&#x201D;, which was purchased for Cape Town docks. It is an incredibe story of the expenditure of taxpayers&#x2019; money on a vessel which is hardly being used. To the hon. the Minister this may seem nothing&#x2014;he talks about his billion-rand Budget&#x2014;but it is R50.000 of taxpayers&#x2019; money in this one particular instance which has been unwisely spent. I think these are matters which indicate the necessity for the hon. the Minister to look into the position so far as the tug service in the docks is concerned.</p>

<p>I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister to take a personal interest in another matter. I emphasize the personal interest, because persons from the Mayor of Cape Town downwards have not been able to gain access to the hon. the Minister personally on a matter which is vitally important to the citizens of Cape Town, namely the question of public access to the docks over week-ends. Mr. Chairman, this might be regarded as a very small matter in a billion-rand Budget, but it is a very real facility to the ordinary man in Cape Town who wants to take his kids there over week-ends. This question of it being a security matter and that it is inconvenient will not be the case in a properly organized docks. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I find it flattering that at least two members of the Opposition have had to burn the midnight oil going through my Hansard to find something to talk about in this debate. That, combined with the balance of the information which comes from my very good friend George Young, shows that the Opposition is a little bit bankrupt in material for the conduct of a debate on this matter. But let me go on with what I was saying, because I want to be a little more constructive.</p>

<p>To finish off this question of containerization, I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to one more factor. This is a factor I should like to see him bear in mind because it is going to be very important in future. According to the experts, there is a tendency for the expansion of containerization to render certain ports redundant. This we find, for instance, with Elizabeth Harbour in New York, probably the most intensively developed harbour for containerization in the world. The threat exists that this harbour is going to render three nearby ports completely redundant, letting them lie unused in the years to come. This, I say, is a factor which must be taken into consideration in evaluating the effects of containerization on ships and shipping.</p>

<p>Having said this, I should like to return to a matter which is for me a local matter, i.e. the Durban harbour. I have already referred to Durban harbour previously in this debate. Now, however, I should like to deal point by point with the issues raised by the Durban Chamber of Commerce in relation to the Durban harbour. Any comments I should add, shall be purely personal. I want to say that at this stage. Before dealing with the report on the memorandum prepared by the Durban Chamber of Commerce on the Durban harbour, I should like to deal with the comment of Mr. T. A. Ellison, of the Natal University Department of Economics, who recently helped complete another survey on the harbour. According to this report, he pointed out&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Chamber had, however, neglected to note the need for a proper planning committee which could assess and anticipate future demands, establish priorities and examine financial implications of developments to the harbour.</block>

<p><span class="col_2449-2450" refersTo="page_1247"/>Is this not a very realistic approach? It will become even more realistic as we deal with these recommendations of the Chamber of Commerce, recommendations which have been tabulated very well by Jack Keir, the shipping correspondent of the <i>Natal Mercury.</i> The recommendations of the Durban Chamber of Commerce are that Durban harbour should be improved by means of the following.</p>

<p>Firstly, an early start should be made on the construction of a dry dock capable of taking ships up to 200,000 tons. But, surely, this is asking for a duplication of Richard&#x2019;s Bay. I know the hon. the Minister has, in fact, made provision for ships up to 200,000 tons to be docked in Richard&#x2019;s Bay. All I wanted to know from the Minister was whether this would be sufficient. The Minister still has to answer me on that. In any event, provision is going to be made for ships of up to 200,000 tons to be handled in Richard&#x2019;s Bay.</p>

<p>Another recommendation of the Chamber is that the Administration should buy, or build locally, two floating docks with a lifting capacity of 10,000 short tons and 20,000 short tons. Maybe that will help; maybe not. I think there may be a clear demand for another floating dock of a higher capacity in Durban. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can give us more information on this.</p>

<p>Another recommendation is that the port should be provided with further repair and fitting-out quays, including one capable of taking ships up to 1,000 feet long. Sir, the shipbuilding companies there are making good provision for repair facilities. But I believe a little more from the part of the Administration might help to solve the problem which faces them.</p>

<p>Their next recommendation is that work should proceed at once on the construction of No. 2 pier at Salisbury Island. This pier is planned for a site to the west of the new No. 1 pier. But provision has already been made for this. As a matter of fact, the link between the two piers is almost completed. The work is going very well.</p>

<p>The next recommendation is that a harbour berth be set aside for experimental purposes to test the advantages of loading or unloading ships fitted with side ports. But I believe that the coasting people. Unicorn for example, have already made provision for this. They have made provision for side loading ports in their new coaster which has just come into service, the Tugela. They have facilities at Congella which will prove or disprove the advantages of side port loading. I have already referred to this in my previous speech on containerization, or unitization rather.</p>

<p>Another recommendation is that an additional pilot boat and two tugs be purchased for Durban harbour. But, Sir, I think provision has already been made for an additional pilot boat. In addition to that a launch service is being provided to the new pier across the bay. Furthermore, new tugs are being built which will go along the seaboard of the country.</p>

<p>Another recommendation is that a harbour passenger service be provided between all points in the port for harbour staff, ships&#x2019; contractors and ships&#x2019; crews. In this connection, the only question which arises is the question of a service to the new No. 1 pier. And in the Brown Book provision is made for such a boat.</p>

<p>Another recommendation is that loading facilities be improved at the grain elevator and maize shed. The hon. the Minister can tell us what provision there is for improvement in this respect. I know that the scales used for weighing the maize is purported to be rather antiquated and, hence, not doing their job as well as they should. But this is a comparatively minor issue.</p>

<p>Another recommendation is that sheds at the Point should be remodelled without ramps. Well, to remodel these sheds is a big undertaking and should only be undertaken when the proof has come that fork lift trucks are to be used, because the main advantage of sheds without ramps is that you can drive fork lift trucks in and out. So, unless you are going to use side port loading, unitization or containerization, there is no necessity for that to be done.</p>

<p>A further recommendation is that consideration be given to the reintroduction of lighters for working cargo. Sir, this went out many years ago and I fail to see why they want it brought back. Personally I believe that it would add to port congestion. However, the hon. the Minister may perhaps have other ideas.</p>

<p>The last recommendation is that facilities for the fishing industry be improved by extending the fishing wharf eastwards along its present line. I should like to add my own plea to this. Present facilities for fishing boats there are quite inadequate and extra facilities could well be provided. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has anything of this nature in mind. Added facilities could bring about a great improvement there.</p>

<p>Before I close there is one more point I should like to talk about. This concerns buoy discharge points. When I raised this matter with the hon. the Minister in 1966, he told me I was already five years behind the times. It appeared then that the matter had been investigated five years previously. Now the hon. member for Umbilo has again raised this in this debate. He was afraid of the pollution aspect. I do not know whether he has read recent publications on this question. If he had, he would have seen that great strides had been made in the prevention of pollution in the case of these buov discharge points. Generally speaking, a floating dam which is placed around the ship and around the discharge point, seems to be the best. This has certain advantages. It not only stops the pollution, but also recovers for the company concerned any spillage that might take place. Having <span class="col_2451-2452" refersTo="page_1248"/>carted oil for thousands of miles one does not, if one can avoid it, want to see it being tipped into the sea.</p>

<p>Another point on which I should like to hear the hon. the Minister is the question which has been raised whether the discharge points should go off Durban, Isipingo in other words, or whether it should go off Richard&#x2019;s Bay. It could go either way and I believe the man who wants to construct these buoy points is opposing the one at Durban and supporting the one at Richard&#x2019;s Bay on the grounds, I take it, that there is already an oil pipeline serving Richard&#x2019;s Bay. He believes that if you discharge there now on a temporary basis, that oil could be pumped back through the pipeline to Durban and that, eventually, when Richard&#x2019;s Bay has been properly developed, the pipeline could take over from the direct discharge from the tankers alongside the quay.</p>

<p>These are points which I think the hon. the Minister could deal with with the object of putting the minds of people interested in this, at rest.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I was mentioning to the hon. the Minister the question of access to Cape Town docks as a matter in which I thought he could take a personal interest. Then I want to deal with two matters of staff affairs so far as the Cape Town harbour in particular is concerned and ask the hon. the Minister to be good enough to deal with them. Sir, I have already mentioned the shortage of stokers on tugs and dredgers in our harbours, a shortage which is particularly felt in Cape Town. According to an answer given by the hon. the Minister on the 12th August, 1966, there was then a shortage of 171 stokers but he was employing 165 non-Whites temporarily to fill those vacancies, so there was no break-down in the tug or dredger service. But his answer on the 11th March of this year was that although there are 152 vacancies, only 29 non-Whites are employed at the present time towards the filling of those vacancies. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this is a policy step which he is taking, in other words, is his policy that these stoker positions should remain vacant rather than be filled by non-White employees? Whereas he was able to cover up the shortage of permanent staff in 1966 with a deficit of only some six vacancies as between temporary and permanent posts, we now have the position in 1969 that of the 152 he leaves something like 123 positions unfilled on a temporary basis.</p>

<p>The other point regarding staff at Cape Town that I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister is what planning has been done as regards the housing of the additional staff that will be required as and when the harbour extensions are completed. It is obvious that there will be a large increase in the staff employed in Table Bay Docks, and I wonder whether the Minister can tell us whether he has given his attention to the planning of housing for these additional staff members, where that housing is to be provided, especially for persons who are on night and other duty, whether the housing is to be provided for Whites and non-Whites and on what basis it is likely that those facilities will be made available. There is a difficulty in Cape Town at the moment in the case of some of the key personnel of the Docks who have to find accommodation in various parts of the Peninsula which is not always conveniently near to their place of duty. I wonder if the hon. the Minister can give us an assurance that the question of housing of the additional personnel who will be required with the expansion of the Docks is being adequately planned by his Department.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal again raised the hardy annual that the Harbours and the Airways must be separated from the Railways. Let me say that it does not concern me personally, because even if the Harbours are separated from the Railways I will still be Minister of Transport and control both the Harbours and the Railways, so it is not a personal matter. It is alleged that I am afraid of losing some of my power or of losing different branches of the service which I am controlling at the moment. Sir, it is merely a question of whether that will be in the interests of the country or not. I am convinced in my own mind that it will not be in the interests of the country and that it will not be in the interests of the harbours to have a separate harbour authority. It has not even worked very successfully overseas. First of all, if this is done, it means that all the harbour revenue will be reserved for the harbours and will not be put into the pool; in other words, the losses on the Railways as such will not be recovered from Harbour revenue or from Airways revenue. The hon. member for Yeoville said that there was a loss of R35 million on the Railways alone. There is a loss of R45 million on passenger services. In other words, if that revenue is not obtained from the harbours, the Airways and the pipeline, then rates and passenger fares will have to be increased substantially to break even. I am quite convinced in my own mind that it will not be in the interests of the country to try to recover a loss of R45 million on passenger services, the loss on goods services, the loss on agricultural products and many other commodities by increasing tariffs. It would be detrimental to the whole of the economy to raise the tariffs. That is why the policy is that what you lose on the swings you make up on the roundabouts. If you lose on the Railways, you make up on the Harbours, the Airways and the pipelines, and I think that is in the interest of the country. But apart from that, the main reason why they want the Harbours separate from the Railways is that all the profits of the Harbours should be ploughed back into the harbours, but that will not be sufficient for harbour development. The new pier at Durban cost almost R40 million and the additional pier will probably cost another R30 million. You cannot get R70 million in a few <span class="col_2453-2454" refersTo="page_1249"/>years from Harbour revenue. This new harbour that is being built in Table Bay on the other side of the Duncan Dock will eventually cost over R100 million, and Harbour revenue will be quite insufficient to cover those costs. Loans will have to be negotiated. Funds will have to be obtained from Treasury and the harbour authority will have to stand in a queue together with all other departments, and it is extremely doubtful whether the Harbours will get sufficient funds for harbour expansion. I cannot see any advantage. At the present time the harbours are administered by specialists. You do not want to believe the stories about the Johannesburg station and the Railway mentality. There is a separate section administering the harbours, people who know their jobs and who know what they are doing. Our harbour engineers are the best in the whole of South Africa; you cannot get better, and if there is a separate harbour authority you will not get better engineers or more knowledgeable engineers or better equipped engineers than we have at present. Apart from that, you must have co-ordination between the Railways and the Harbours. It is no use expanding the harbours unlimitedly when you do not have the rail take-off. There must be the necessary co-ordination. I can elaborate on this matter for quite a time, but I do not think it will be in the interests of the country or of the harbours or of the railways to have separate Harbours, Airways and Railways.</p>

<p>Now, this hon. member made the charge that berths remained idle for 15 hours in Cape Town Harbour because of the shortage of tugs. The hon. member for Green Point, who is apparently replacing the hon. member for Umlazi as the spokesman on harbours, not very successfully at the moment, also made certain charges against the Administration in regard to the running of the harbours.</p>

<p>He talked about the delays caused by the tug service in Cape Town Harbour. I had that matter investigated and this is the position. The allegation made by the hon. member for Port Natal is that berths in Table Bay Harbour are vacant for periods of up to 15 hours due to a shortage of tugs to bring in vessels. That statement is completely unfounded. Since 1st November, 1968, only eight berthing delays occurred. Of these, two were in respect of ships awaiting berths, four were in respect of oil tankers awaiting high tide to enter the harbour, owing to their deep draught, and two were in respect of ships which could not be berthed owing to the strong south-easter. Athough records prior to 1st November, 1968, have not been kept the System Manager, Cape Town, gives the assurance that no delays of the alleged magnitude due to shortage of tug power have occurred. I do not know where the hon. member got that information from, whether he got it from <i>The Cape Times</i> shipping correspondent or not. He should not believe everything he writes.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member said it was due to insufficient tug power. It was not due to the tug crews. The tugs are running. I think these hon. members should be more appreciative of what these people are doing in Cape Town. With this diversion of hundreds of ships as a result of the closing of the Suez Canal and the handling of those ships with the minimum of delay, I think they should receive tributes instead of this type of criticism. In regard to the tug crews, I am not prepared to allow White and Black to work together on the same tugs. I am not prepared to do that, but if I have no Whites as stokers or deck-hands on the tugs I will use non-Whites. But I am not prepared to allow them to work together. I do not know whether the hon. member is prepared to allow that or if that is what he is suggesting.</p>

<p>I quite agree with the hon. member for Umlazi when he says the huge tankers will, even when Suez is open again, still use the Cape route. He wants to know whether the planning of Richard&#x2019;s Bay is being updated to cope with these tankers. I think it was last year that I said the planning of Richard&#x2019;s Bay not only provides for the very deep sea ships, in other words a depth where ships of 200,000 and 300,000 tons can be accommodated, but that the planning also includes the building of a dry dock, also to accommodate these huge ships of 200,000 and 300,000 tons. I read the following in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of the 21st February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bethlehem Steel Co. of the United States is building a &#x00A3;60 million sterling deep-sea harbour and repair yard in the Persian Gulf for the biggest tankers.</block>

<p>They will be able to handle the biggest tankers in the Persian Gulf. It is suggested that at that terminal point the work will be able to be done while the ships are empty. In other words, if such a repair yard and a deep-sea harbour are built, I do not think any of these tankers will call at any of our harbours for repairs, because it is much better if they are repaired at the terminal point and, as the article says, while they are empty. Apart from that, I am still planning&#x2014;it is not to be built immediately&#x2014;that at Richard&#x2019;s Bay there will be a dry dock which can accommodate these very large ships.</p>

<p><span class="col_2455-2456" refersTo="page_1250"/>The hon. member spoke about containerization. As he is probably aware, a committee has been appointed by my colleague under the chairmanship of Professor Steenkamp to inquire into this whole matter. I have also given a considerable amount of thought to it. I have instructed the department to proceed with the planning for a container berth and also the equipment that will be required. The main equipment will be a crane that can lift at least 40 to 50 tons, and moreover it must be a mobile crane. Then you must have stacking space. There must be suitable trucks to take away the containers when they are loaded. But that is not the end of the story. When they reach their destination you must have the facilities there to unload them. Siding owners will have to have the facilities to unload these containers at their sidings when they are sent there. I am prepared to provide the facilities directly I receive the green light. The initiative must be taken by the importers and the exporters. I told a deputation from the Chamber of Commerce the other day that directly they have come to a decision to make use of containers, and directly they are in a position to use containers for two-way traffic, I will act. They admit that one-way traffic as far as containers are concerned, will be quite uneconomical. Directly they are prepared to make use of containers I will prepare the necessary facilities. Only at Durban harbour do we have the necessary space. Containers cannot be handled at Cape Town harbour or at Port Elizabeth or at East London because there is insufficient stacking space. We are making provision for this, however, at the new harbour being built in Table Bay.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>In the new portion?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the new portion, yes. Provision will be made there for the handling of containers. Richard&#x2019;s Bay, of course, will be a bulk traffic harbour, as the hon. member said, and I do not think it will be necessary to make provision there, but if necessary the arrangements will be made. At the present time the only harbour where containers will be handled will be Durban, and when the new harbour has been built, also in Table Bay harbour. We are fully aware of all the requirements that must be provided there. I might tell the hon. member that the size of containers has not been standardized yet. The width and the height are eight feet by eight feet, but some are 40 feet long, some are 20 feet, and there are some 30 feet long. The shipping companies are still waiting for standardization. I saw a very interesting documentary film last week about the handling of containers at different ports. It is not a very complicated matter. The ships have to be built to be able to carry containers. They have to be built for that purpose. If the ships are provided, all that is required along the wharf-side, is a mobile crane of sufficient power to handle these containers, as well as sufficient stacking place. We will also provide the necessary trucks. As a matter of fact, most of our trucks now, the dropside trucks, can convey containers. But what we cannot do, is to put wheels on the containers, which is being done with regard to some containers, and then to load them with the wheels onto a truck. Unfortunately, our heights are insufficient to allow that to be done on the South African railways, due to the narrow gauge tracks we have. It will disturb the centre of gravity, and we will not be able to do that.</p>

<p>In regard to the sea oil terminal being built at Durban, I have been informed that it is only over the last year or two that there has been developed the new rotating platform at the buoy, which is used to allow the ships when they offload oil, always to keep head on to the wind in bad seas. That is why it can be built outside Durban, where the seas at certain times of the year are rough. I believe that the oil companies and my engineers have investigated the matter as to whether it should rather be built at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. They came to the conclusion that, mainly as a result of the weather conditions, outside Durban is a more suitable place. But the oil companies have given guarantees to the Durban Corporation, I believe, against oil pollution. I do not think there is any real danger of oil pollution off Durban.</p>

<p>With regard to the other matters the hon. member raised in regard to further improvements in Durban harbour, for example additional repair facilities, I want to say to him that we have the ground available. We can lease the ground in the reclaimed area to any company that wants additional ground. What I do suggest, is that they should form a consortium. Instead of these different ship repair companies, for example, Barendz, James Harmer and Brown, etc., they should form one consortium. Then they will have a company which will be able to meet all competition. I think they should become much more efficient and much more effective.</p>

<p>In regard to the clearance of goods, that is mainly the responsibility of the firms concerned. They do not clear the goods and they are stacked up in the sheds. We cannot get rid of them.

<p>I have looked into the matter personally, and I have still come to the same decision. I think the harbour authorities have taken the right decision.</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted to know the circumstances as regards the Loerie, the police tug. The Deputy Minister gave him part of the information. All I want to tell the hon. member, is that this launch was designed and built by Messrs. L. J. Wilson (Pty.), Ltd., shipwrights and shipping contractors in Durban in accordance with outline drawings and specifications provided by the Administration. This firm has also built a number of other launches, which are rendering excellent service. The barge, which is being used at Durban, was built by them and has given no trouble. The launch is fitted with Cummings diesel engines&#x2014;a well-proven make. The launch was delivered on the 24th July, 1967. During the 12-month guarantee period the contractors accepted responsibility for repairs arising from maker&#x2019;s defects, and for the period when it was out of commission, namely from the 1st October, 1967, to the 12th March, 1968. Since the expiration of the 12-month period the builders have refused to undertake any repairs and these have been undertaken at the Department&#x2019;s expense. This is a well-proven firm and a well-proven engine was put into the launch, but this is what happened. It often happens that half a dozen models of the same motor car are trouble-free, but that the next motor car is absolutely rubbish and that continuous repairs have to be undertaken. This is what happened here.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<p>Could the launch not have been returned after it was found to be defective?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it cannot be returned, because it was bought under contract. There is the question of the guarantee and the hon. member, as a businessman, should know this. After it is paid for it cannot be sent back. The launch was bought under contract and the firm gave a guarantee of 12 months. During the period that the launch was under guarantee they were responsible for all the repairs and the cost thereof. Business is just not done in that way. If the hon. member should buy a car which has a guarantee of six months and the car should give lots of trouble, does he think that the sellers will take it back again?</p>

<p>Yes, I think we have towed it to its berth with a tug. The hon. member wanted to know whether I have provided for housing for the staff when the new harbour is completed. The Railway Administration is under no obligation to provide housing for its staff. We do, however, provide housing because we find it is in the interest of the Administration to have a stable staff. This is the reason we do it. By the time the new harbour is completed sufficient housing will probably be available for the staff and the Municipality of Cape Town will also probably see to it that sufficient housing is provided for the non-European staff.

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal firstly with the question of flying staff. I particularly want to deal with this matter in the light of a question which I asked the hon. the Minister on the 7th March and which stood over and which was replied to this week. In that question I asked the hon. the Minister what the establishment of the South African Airways was in the various aircraft pools and the various other groups of flying personnel and what the vacancies were in regard to those groups. In his reply, dealing with pilots, he gave no specific figures. He said that there were enough pilots and that captains were allocated according to the routes flown, the number of services, etc. In regard to the number of captains and senior captains he replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2459-2460" refersTo="page_1252"/>But the number of captains and senior captains in the various pools is sufficient to man the services operated with convenience and safety.</block>

<p>Firstly. Mr. Chairman, I want to question whether this is in fact the correct position. I do not question the aspect of safety at all. I believe that our pilots to-day are amongst the finest pilots in the world. I had experience only this morning when the reverse thrust cowling blew off from the Boeing in which I was travelling and I experienced the care with which the Airways dealt with this particular incident, namely the checking with Headquarters before we continued and the manner in which the pilot continued the flight without that engine being used for reversed thrust. This is typical of the sort of pilots we have. These are people who know their jobs and it is through the pilots that the South African Airways have achieved, with the two tragic exceptions, such a magnificent safety record.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Chairman, my complaint is that we are not planning our personnel numbers to meet the requirements of the Airways. The Minister himself has avoided giving any specific answer as to how many shortages there are in the various pools. He has answered the questions as to what the establishment is, but not as to what the shortages are except in regard to first officers and senior first officers, who he has said are up to strength. I want to compare this with the Budget which we are being asked at this moment to vote upon. Firstly, I want to point out that according to the Brown Book, we have 16 aircraft on order. We have, as I have gathered, four or five which are due to be delivered over the next year or so. This year money is being voted for aircraft due to be delivered shortly, either out of Loan Funds or out of Renewal Funds. On the Brown Book there are a total of 16 aircraft on order. Now, that is the material planning, the planning for the machines which are to be flown. When we look at the human angle, at the summary of staff for whom we are being asked to vote funds in this Budget, we find that there is only a planned gross increase of 11 pilots over the next year. This is out of all relationship to the increase in flights which we are putting on: the extra flight to America via South America and the additional internal flights in South Africa. And yet, we as Parliament are being asked to vote only 11 additional pilot posts in the South African Airways. Now, let me compare the figures which the hon. the Minister gave me this week in reply to a question, with the figures which we are being asked to vote upon in this House. Let us take the position of a first officer. In his reply the hon. the Minister says that there are no vacancies for first officers. The establishment is up to full strength. He gives that establishment as 111 people in the various pools. In the Budget we are being asked to vote for 119 first officers. What is the correct number? Has the hon. the Minister told me the truth in his reply to my question when he said that there are no vacancies for first officers? Or are we being asked to vote for a higher establishment than is in fact envisaged&#x2014;in other words, 8 more. When we look at other groups of flying personnel, in his reply, the Minister states there are 118 flight stewards on the establishment. The Budget has asked us to vote funds for 96. Out of which funds are the remaining 22 to be paid? We are not being asked to vote the money, and yet the Minister says that it is the establishment. In regard to air hostesses, the establishment is 123, whereas Parliament is being asked to vote money for only 102. Now, Mr. Chairman, this is not good enough! Is this Parliament a parliament which has the authority and the power to vote money or is this Parliament a group of people whom the Minister can fob off with any figures he likes? He answers an hon. member in this House by giving certain figures but we are now dealing with a budget which does not reflect the same picture. But what is more important than the discrepancy in figures, is the fact that we are being asked to vote only 11 new posts for pilots despite the vast increase in craft and flights which is contemplated? At the moment we have Rhodesian pilots flying for S.A.A. The hon. the Minister can tell me if I am incorrect in this statement. They are earning not only a very much higher basic salary&#x2014;Something like R1,500 more per year&#x2014;but in addition they get a daily allowance of some R13 per day. Those figures may not be the exact figures, but they are, as I am told, the approximate figures. In other words, flying in our own airline, flying our planes alongside our own pilots in the same pool, are people who are being paid a very much higher remuneration. Is this fair on our pilots? If we need additional pilots should we not rather see that we can draw people by at least offering them an equivalent salary scale as is being paid to those whom we get from neighbouring countries? I do not believe that you are going to have a good morale if you have this discrepancy within our own flying staff. I also understand, and I ask the hon. the Minister to deny this, that he has had representations about providing additional pilots, in other words, representations about the strain and the heavy requirements which are being placed on our existing pilots. Or is the hon. the Minister satisfied that none of these pilots are being asked to fly more than a reasonable amount of flying time? I ask the hon. the Minister to make a clear statement that he is satisfied that we have enough pilots to fly our planes not only with safety, which the pilots will care for, but with the convenience to which he refers in his reply to me.</p>

<p>I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister to please give the House some information on the deal with Trek Airways. We have taken oyer a plane from them and they are to fly a flight for South African Airways. Could the hon. the Minister explain how this deal, apart from the fact that we needed a plane urgently to replace the lost Boeing, of the flight being flown for us by Trek Airways came about? Could the hon. the Minister tell us whether <span class="col_2461-2462" refersTo="page_1253"/>they are now going to take South African Airways passengers for their profit or whether a pool arrangement has been entered into or on what basis this deal has been concluded? As it appears at the moment, it appears to be a strange sort of arrangement to make. I can understand the take over of the plane and we appreciate that this has assisted us greatly, but the question of the reciprocal flight is the one that puzzles me.</p>

<p>The other aspect of flying is that of maintenance staff. The hon. the Minister has said that there is no shortage and no excessive overtime. He has denied that it is necessary to take short-cuts. Why then is it that the law had to be amended in order to make working to rule one of the offences similar to striking? Is it not because if maintenance staff work to rule, it brings the running of the Airways to either a slow or dead slow or stop speed? [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come to another point of criticism which is often expressed against the South African Airways, and I should like to put this matter in its right perspective and for that purpose I should like, to project it against the background of the pattern of development of the South African Airways. I have here the latest report of the S.A. Airways. During the past financial year passenger flights increased by 10.09 per cent, from 877,000 in the previous year to 976,000 last year. If we look at the working results of the S.A. Airways, we find that the profit amounted to R7&#x00BD; million last year, in other words, more than twice as much as in the previous financial year. All this was achieved&#x2014;and I think we should give them credit for this&#x2014;by a staff consisting of 3,831 Whites and 671 non-Whites, a total establishment of 4,502, which enabled the Airways to produce these wonderful results on its 35th anniversary.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to make specific reference to the criticism we hear from time to time in regard to the reservation systems of the South African Airways. Once again I want to refer you to the annual report. During the past financial year, 1967-&#x2019;68, there were 1,862,000 applications, sales and cancellations in respect of the internal as well as the international services of South Africa. These reservation figures were processed electronically. The telex retransmitting centre of the central reservation office in Johannesburg dispatched 1.7 million messages during that same period and received 1.6 million messages. This is a massive volume of reservation traffic which was handled by these reservation offices. Mr. Chairman, it may be necessary for one to examine the reservation system as it is being controlled by the S.A. Airways at present.</p>

<p>Messages containing the reservation requirements of passengers are collected at data processing units from all points of origin from where they are transmitted by teleprinter. The messages received are then set up at a central point according to recognized international patterns. There is an internationally agreed upon system according to which this is done. These reservation messages are then fed to a computer. First they are tested and then they are fed to a computer for certain particulars to be extracted, but before that is done certain facts are established; first the correctness of such messages are tested, especially in respect of the flight concerned, the sectors on which flights are going to be undertaken, the date, the classes, the number of passengers, etc. It is important to note that while the computer is being fed the data, a constant check is being kept from moment to moment so as to check whether the incoming figures are in agreement with the flight concerned, or the route concerned, and an additional check on the computer&#x2019;s calculations is kept throughout the operation. Scores are kept of the number of reservations and the number of cancellations and the final figures are correlated with each other throughout the operation. This is very important so as to make it possible to determine the reservation-cancellation position at any time. From the nature of the case, numerous changes have to be fed to these computers. People reserve seats and cancel them as fast as they reserve them. At present there are procedures for expanding and supplementing and making additions to the system <span class="col_2463-2464" refersTo="page_1254"/>all the time. In the past years technicians of the S.A. Airways have constantly been engaged in perfecting this system, making additions to it as well as improving it. But, Sir, it should also be mentioned that a large percentage of the reservations of the S.A. Airways is done by agents throughout South Africa. There is a system of checking these reservations. Lists of reservations are referred back to the agents for checking, and if they do not receive lists of the reservations, they are contacted telephonically. The public of South Africa has an idea that if there are empty seats on an aircraft, the cause of that is so-called block reservations by agents. This is a misunderstanding which must be cleared up. Thirty days prior to the departure of a specific flight the travel agents are informed of the particulars, and the names of the passengers, the ticket numbers, etc., are forwarded to the reservation office for checking, and if the agents do not confirm their reservations, they are cancelled. Consequently the possibility does not exist that a travel agent can book a block of seats on a flight of the South African Airways and that this will be kept open until the departure of the flight, with the possible result that the flight may depart with empty seats. From 75 to 80 per cent of the reservations on the internal services of the S.A. Airways which are made, cancelled and made again, have their origin with agents of the Airways. Therefore an extremely large number of the reservations on the S.A. Airways originates from agents. Sir, it is important for the Airways to keep this relationship as fine as possible and therefore to ensure that the reservations are properly co-ordinated. I notice on page 103 of the Brown Book which is enjoying the attention of this Committee at the moment, item 1182, that provision is being made for an amount of R100 for this financial year for &#x201C;fully automated and integrated message switching and real time reservations system (stage 1)&#x201D;. Sir, this is quite a mouth full. I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister can inform us as to what exactly is being envisaged here The estimated amount for this equipment is R3&#x00BD; million odd, and I assume that this is in connection with improved reservation systems, and that to a large extent we shall be able to eliminate the shortcomings which exist at the moment, in spite of all the attempts which are being made, and that we shall be able to make considerable improvements.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised this matter in regard to the so-called shortage of flying staff in his speech during the Second Reading of this Bill. I said I would reply to him when I replied to the Third Reading. I did not reply to the points he made yesterday, but as he has raised it now I think I had better put the record straight. I think the hon. member is a bit mixed up when it comes to the figures, and he places an interpretation upon figures which is quite unfounded. He should really go more carefully into the matter. If the hon. member had also referred to the White Paper for 1968-&#x2019;69, he would have noticed that provision was made last year for an increase of 78 first officers for training in order to strengthen the different pools. As a result it was possible to increase the pool for senior first officers by 10 units, senior captains by 37, compared with the position in 1967-&#x2019;68.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>How many senior captains?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Senior captains, not training captains. Senior captains were increased by 37. Compared with the position in 1967-&#x2019;68, the number of pilots has increased by 88. Additional pilots are engaged in good time to finalize training by the time new aircraft are taken into service. First officer is, of course, the entry grade and it is logical that the number of pilots in this pool will fluctuate in accordance with additional engagements and promotions to higher-graded posts. The nine captains from Air Rhodesia were loaned to speed up training programmes to ensure that sufficient crews would be available for the additional services contemplated for 1970. The Rhodesian pilots are on loan from Rhodesian Airways to enable us to take our men off the Viscounts for training on the Boeings. It is only a temporary measure. They have been loaned for a period of 12 months. In regard to the personnel, as the hon. member is probably aware, we recruit from the Air Force. Whenever there is a shortage of Airways air crews on S.A. Airways, we recruit officers from the S.A.A.F. They are usually anxious to come over to S.A. Airways, because the emoluments are very much higher. We have no trouble at all in getting them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But your first officers are down by 31.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is probably due to promotion, but it will increase again. Another thing in that regard is this. Formerly we used to make provision for the establishment, disregarding vacancies in a particular grade. I am not specifically referring to Airways now. But since last year we decided not to make financial provision for the establishment or, in other words, to make provision for posts which are not filled. That is why the hon. member will find big changes in the figures from what they were last year. But I can give the hon. member the assurance that I hope and expect to have quite sufficient flying crews to man the new aircraft that have been <span class="col_2465-2466" refersTo="page_1255"/>ordered. As I say, we recruit from the Air Force.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Without strain?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Another thing, our flying crews do not fly under strain, because the regulations lay down what rest periods they must have after certain flights and what the length of a continuous flight must be. We observe that very meticulously. We cannot possibly allow our air crews to become overstrained through working excessive hours because that will not only endanger themselves but it will endanger the plane and all the passengers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Have you had any representations from the public?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have had no representations in that regard. The hon. member wanted to know what the deal is with Trek Airways. This is also a temporary matter. We have arranged with Trek Airways to hire their Boeing that they got from S.A. Airways in exchange for the new one that is on order, to do one flight a week, and we pay them for that. But there is no pool arrangement or anything like that. It is just an arrangement between Trek Airways and S.A. Airways. And this is no new thing. For quite a long time one of our crews flew to Australia with their Constellation. So, it is no new thing at all. We are only doing this because we are short of Boeings at present as the result of the Windhoek disaster.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Do they get the fares?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we pay them a certain hire, but we get all the fares and we do all the rest of the work.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about working to rule, and he said that that was proof of the letter of the law not being observed. But that is not so. Working to rule is quite a different matter altogether. In other words, it is a kind of &#x201C;go slow&#x201D; strike. That is what it amounts to. The artisans in the workshops did it once many years ago. They worked to rule. In actual fact it is a &#x201C;go slow&#x201D; strike. In other words, instead of taking five minutes for a particular job, they take 15 minutes or an hour, and as the result of the delays the backlog of work builds up. But it does not mean that if you work to the rule you do not observe the letter of the law. I gave the reply to the hon. member for Yeoville in the hon. member&#x2019;s absence, to show that all the regulations laid down by the aircraft manufacturers are meticulously observed. Surely the hon. member does not think that we will allow slipshod work to be done to endanger the public and our planes? The technicians are the most important part of the whole organization. [Interjection.] I am not worried, because I know these men are doing a very good job of work. They are keeping the planes in the air.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What about overtime?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They are not working excessive overtime. I will give the hon. member the position. The technical personnel of Airways from 1st April, 1967, to 31st December, 1967, worked an average number of hours of 39.5 overtime per month. For 1st April, 1968, to 31st December, 1968, the average was 42 hours per month. That is the overtime, over the normal hours, and most of the men who do overtime are those doing servicing. Those are not excessive hours. These men work overtime, as the overwhelming majority of the railway staff do, to increase their earnings. In fact, they eventually base their standard of living on the earnings they receive, which includes overtime. So, there is no strain and no excessive overtime whatsoever. As far as my flying crews are concerned, they are certainly not under any strain because the regulations are strictly and meticulously observed. The hon. member may rest assured that the pilots will be the first to complain if they are put under any undue strain.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Middelburg spoke of the new apparatus which is going to be introduced for handling reservations. As he said, it is quite a mouthful to pronounce this thing&#x2019;s name. It is &#x201E;die ge-outimatiseerde geintegreerde boodskapskakeling-en plekbesprekingstelsel&#x201D; (the fully automated and integrated message switching and real time reservations system), which has been approved. This system, which we expect to be completed by the end of 1970, will connect reservation offices of the S.A. Airways in the Republic and South-West Africa with the central control in Johannesburg and will enable them to determine without delay by means of direct switching (on the so-called agents sets) whether a seat on the flight requested by the passenger is in fact available and to confirm the reservation summarily, or, if not, to be offered a seat on an alternative flight. The cancellation of reserved seats will be handled in the same way and will ensure the immediate release of seats to other passengers. This system will not only expedite reservations considerably, but it will also produce more reliable records and it is expected that over-reservations and other shortcomings which the present system has will be eliminated to a very large extent. This will increase the efficiency of the reservation organization of the Airways considerably, and will be equal to those of other international airlines.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The English for this thing, for the information of the hon. member for Transkei, is the fully automated and integrated message switching and real time reservation system.</p>

<speech by="#heystek">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. HEYSTEK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I understand that I only have four minutes at my disposal, and if it is not an inadmissible threat, I just want to warn everyone who is fond of living to make way ahead! When the debate was interrupted yesterday I was pointing out how the University Colleges had been &#x201C;de&#x201D;-colleged. In passing I just want to point out that the Rand Afrikaans University and the University of Port Elizabeth never went through a college stage. There is one last quotation I want to make from what Dr. Ross said in the <i>Bantu Education Journal</i> of 1967. He stated: &#x201C;The university colleges are on the march &#x2026;&#x201D; Allow me to point out, Mr. Speaker, that this is not a Natal march. He went on, &#x201C;&#x2026; and nothing and nobody can stop their development and progress&#x201D;. &#x201C;Nothing and nobody&#x201D;, as we know, is very little. Nevertheless the hon. the Opposition appears to be of the opinion that they will be able to stem this progress. If that is the case, they would have proved to themselves that they are something less than &#x201C;nothing and nobody&#x201D;. But Dr. Ross goes on to write, &#x201C;they are destined to play an ever-increasing role in the development not only of the Bantu homelands, but also of the Republic of South Africa.&#x201D; This is what the esteemed professor has decided, this is how I second it, and this is as the history of Fort Hare has proved it to be true. We are all aware that 4 &#x00BD;million Whites in this country have to bear approximately 18 million people both administratively and academically. This is good neither for the Whites nor the non-Whites. That is why I regarded the establishment of these University Colleges as a positive and fundamental extension of the policy of separate development. In this way it is being made possible for every section, each in his own homeland, to become self-supporting both academically and administratively. As the position is at the moment, we have many Whites on loan to the non-white homelands, Whites who have to be there because that is what is best for the non-Whites at the moment. In the long run, however, it cannot pay. When they are eventually in a position, with the people who are being trained at those colleges, where they are self-supporting academically and administratively, they will be cultivating for themselves a self-esteem and pride. In this way these university colleges are benefiting these non-white residential areas. But they also benefit the white homelands because we will then get the Whites who are now on loan in the non-white homelands back in order to supplement our own manpower shortage. For that reason I am able to agree wholeheartedly with what the esteemed professor said here, i.e. that the establishment and ultimate effect of these university colleges will be solely to the good of both the non-Whites and the Whites.</p>

<p>On 9th April, 1959, I made my maiden speech in this esteemed House on these very matters. For that reason I regard it as an exceptional privilege that I have now been afforded an opportunity of speaking on these matters again. On that occasion it fell to a certain Dr. D. L. Smit on the Opposition side to thank and congratulate me, as is the custom, but the hon. member could only get as far as thanking me. He could not bring himself to congratulating me. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that he was amazed that I, after I had been in a position to listen to the debate in this House for a month, had not yet joined the United Party. I wonder, viewed in the light of what has happened in the meantime, whether the homes of the Odells and the Lewises are not haunted. In any case, the hon. member went on to say that it was a pity that I should have chosen such a contentious matter for my maiden speech. In conclusion he expressed the hope that I would before long find myself in the Opposition benches. Let us leave it at that. Let us review the position as it is to-day, ten years after the legislation by means of which these colleges were established was passed. Let us do so with reference to an article in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 7th March, 1959. There the following phrase occurs, &#x201C;A simple little Bill in a minor country&#x201D;. Is this not a terrible thing to say about one&#x2019;s country and about legislation which is being piloted through this the highest council chamber in the country. Sir, surely it is an impertinence to say a thing like that. It is true that this country of ours is small, but it is big in that thing which alone can make a small nation big, i.e. our spiritual defensibility. We are now engaged in one aspect of that. In this regard our Government is not indebted to anybody, neither to the Whites nor to the non-Whites. On the contrary, we can feel proud of having a favourable balance. On 23rd April, 1959, I concluded by saying that I had participated in the discussion and had placed myself before the tribunal of my conscience and the nation. I am doing so again now, with this difference however, that at that time I participated in that debate in the hope, without the knowledge. To-day, however, we have the experience of ten years behind us. Now I can participate in this debate with the knowledge born of facts. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 2 of this Bill provides that with effect from a specific date the University College of Fort Hare will be a university; secondly, that its seat will be at Alice in the Cape Province; and, thirdly, that the university will serve the Xhosa ethnic unit. Three interesting facts appear from this clause. Firstly, that a new and full-fledged university is being established; secondly, that the university will have its seat in the Eastern Cape and will, as such, be the third university in that vicinity; and, thirdly, that this university is specifically intended to serve the Xhosa ethnic unit. I now want to express a few ideas, briefly, on each of these three aspects.</p>

<p>Firstly, then, the establishment of a new, full-fledged and independent university in the Western Cape. For myself and my colleagues <span class="col_2469-2470" refersTo="page_1257"/>who represent that area this is undoubtedly a very important event. I am speaking here as a person who had to work very hard for the establishment of the university at Port Elizabeth, and who is to-day serving on the council and the senate of that university. Under these circumstances it is for me an exceptional privilege to be able to convey my most sincere congratulations to this new university of the Eastern Cape. The University College at Fort Hare has a long and interesting history behind it. In many respects this has also been an eventful history. To-day, only 10 years after a new course had been mapped out for the university college by this Government, and in spite of numerous prophesies of doom which were uttered from the opposite side of the House, this new step speaks volumes for the authorities of the university college. I also want to express my sincere congratulations to the new university on behalf of the University of Port Elizabeth. At the same time then I want to offer the new university our academic co-operation. Our hope is that this university will over the years develop into a tower of strength for the dissemination of light and truth to its environment.</p>

<p>I come now to the third provision of the clause, namely that this university will serve the Xhosa ethnic group. Perhaps the Xhosa nation to-day does not realize the phenomenal extent of the significance of this event. For any nation, but particularly for a developing nation, there is no greater gift they can receive than a university. This is the finest gift a nation could ever receive. One qualification must be mentioned, and this is the following: A university which is not ready to render service to the nation and the community where it has its seat, a university which stands aloof from the nation and the community it has to serve, a university which is removed from the national life and the national culture, can also constitute a danger to the community it has to serve. History tells us that the Bantu nations in this country have paid very dearly in this respect. They also suffered great losses. This was the position until this Government mapped out a new course for Bantu education&#x2014;primary, secondary and higher&#x2014;in the service of the Bantu nations and their own culture. Up to that stage the training of the best brainpower of the Bantu youth was aimed at putting their own people, their home language, national culture and way of life in an inferior light. Attempts were made to cause the ideals of Western culture, way of life and traditions to take root among the Bantu youth.</p>

<p>I can speak feelingly about this because there was a period in the history of my own people when we had to go through the same phase. An individual who despises what is his own, who has become detached from his own language, culture and national traditions, who strives to attain the values of another nation without ever being able to really possess them, becomes an uprooted, frustrated being who cannot make any contribution anywhere. For years the Bantu nations of South Africa had to endure this erosion process of their best brainpower, and if it had not been for that the Bantu nations to-day would have been much further advanced along the road to civilization. I want to hope and trust that the students who are going to study at this university will always realize that it will be their task to return and place themselves in the service of their own nation, in order to better their own nation in the social, economic and cultural fields. May this university succeed in placing large numbers of their young people on the production line which they will be able, after a few years, to send back to the area from whence they came.</p>

<p>In one respect the students at this university are definitely fortunate. This university will serve principally the Xhosa ethnic group. This community has progressed quite far along the road to nationhood, it is a community where peace and order prevails, where there is a stable and democratically-elected Government, the only black stable and democratically-elected Government in the whole of Africa. In addition that community is fortunate in having a guardian, namely the Government of the Republic of South Africa, Which really has their interests at heart. The establishment of this independent university is in fact a further proof of the interest and the efforts of the white guardian to help and to uplift.</p>

<p>Five years ago when we asked for a university for the Port Elizabeth area, and after we had proved that the need existed there, we first had to return and obtain a guarantee of R750,000 from the local community before the Government would consider establishing a university there. The fact that there was no question of a local effort of their own here, and that this institution was established with the help of this white Government emphasizes once again the well-meaning goodwill of the white nation towards the non-white people.</p>

<p>The influence and the calling of a university goes much further than its primary task, namely of rendering a service to the community in which it has its seat. It is the highest calling of every academician and also of every university to seek the truth in the light of reason and with the help of the research facilities at their disposal. This search for facts, for truth, for clarity and understanding brings people to common problems. Each one possibly sees a different facet of the problem and each one offers a positive solution in accordance with his findings. These findings can then jointly lead to greater clarity to better mutual understanding and possibly to the solution of actual problems. That is why there is also the constant exchange of knowledge in the academic sphere among the various universities in South Africa and also abroad. In this respect this institution will also be able to make an important contribution towards throwing more light on our numerous and complicated problems in Southern Africa and bringing us closer to a solution. In this way I also trust that this university will be able to make its contributions <span class="col_2471-2472" refersTo="page_1258"/>towards throwing more light on our difficult problem of peaceful co-existence in this multi-national southern-most tip of Africa and towards bringing us nearer to a solution. Recognition of and respect for the individual usually leads to improved human relations. It also applies to the relations among communities. Through its lecturers and students the university is very closely associated with the ideals and objectives of the nation it has to serve. But it stands to reason that through their acquired knowledge and wider experience they can also gain an insight into the other man&#x2019;s point of view, and on the level of reason the idea of good neighbourship and peaceful co-existence must always triumph. That is why I have every confidence that in this respect as well, in regard to our problems of peaceful co-existence in Southern Africa, the university will make a valuable contribution because it is only through education that knowledge, reason and balance can be achieved.</p>

<p>But it will not help merely to idealize in regard to this institution, one must also be realistic and face up to possible problems and any growing pains which the new institution might experience. Unfortunately the university in our day is no longer known only as a centre of learning and knowledge. In our day some of our universities have also, regrettably, become breeding places of unrest and revolt. The student is no longer only a seeker after knowledge, but he has also in many respects become agitator, an inciter, a seeker after political power in order to overthrow the existing order. During the past 12 months students have caused chaos and led violent revolts on a large scale in many different countries of the world. Everywhere the pattern was virtually the same. There were clear indications that communistic agitators were in fact behind the unrest. Owing to timeous and firm action by our hon. Prime Minister and our Government. South Africa has been soared this disaster. Most students at South African universities, with their traditional attitude of respect for authority, will not easily allow themselves to be led astray into such unrestrained behaviour. But unfortunately we also have at some of our universities the anchorless, profligate cosmopolitans who can spread this disease to our universities. Because we in South Africa are very jealous of our peace and quiet, we must take thorough cognizance of this growing menace. Many students studying at teaching institutions here, who lean heavily for their financial support, on the State and the taxpayer, should never be allowed to create an upheaval here!</p>

<p>This brings me then to two matters about which a great deal has been said in this debate by members on the opposite side, namely the autonomy and the academic freedom of the university. These are terms which have been hawked about quite a good deal in the past, and which have been liberally used in this debate as well. These are usually fine-sounding terms to which prospective inciters try to attach excessive value, in order to raise an outraged, hypocritical hue and cry and to try to work up public opinion here and abroad against the Government if they do not succeed in their purpose. When I speak of the autonomy of a university I include two requirements. Firstly there must be a council which has been appointed in terms of the Act pertaining to that university, and which will be at liberty to take decisions in terms of that Act as regards the academic, financial and administrative matters of the university and in that way exercise proper control. In the second place there must be a senate which is appointed in terms of that Act and the Statutes, and which will be free to compile syllabi, set examination papers, hold examinations and tests, and confer degrees and diplomas which will enjoy recognition in the academic world, all according to the needs of its students. That is the second requirement which I lay down for the autonomy of a university. A university which complies with these two requirements is an autonomous university. The autonomy of this new university of Fort Hare is in my opinion also vested in the fact that it is becoming separated on an academic level from the university of South Africa. But now hon. members on the opposite side are laving down totally different requirements when they talk about the autonomy of a university. The hon. member for Orange Grove, for example, laid down the following requirements when he discussed the Extension of University Training Bill 10 years ago. The hon. member said (Hansard, Volume 100. column 3228) that his requirement was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council must be free, to admit, subject to the absolute minimum amount of restrictions, whoever they think fit to enter the portals of a university &#x2026; Restrictions which are based on the grounds of political beliefs, of freely-held convictions and of religious persuasions are to be condemned out of hand &#x2026; My personal view, however, if I may state it, is that I believe a university gains immeasurably if it does not have any restrictions in regard to race on the admission of students.</block>

<p>In addition the hon. member stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the appointment of members of the academic staff, a university must not be subject to restrictions, imposed from out side, which are based on sex, or race, or belief, or religion.</block>

<p>This is what the hon. member had to say about the autonomy of a university. On academic freedom the hon. member had the following to say (column 3228)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The academic staff of the university should have complete and unfettered freedom of speech and expression &#x2026; The student must be free to seek knowledge in his chosen subjects where and how he wishes &#x2026; The student must be free to state his <span class="col_2473-2474" refersTo="page_1259"/>views and form his opinions, whatever those opinions may be, and to discuss them in an academic spirit, without hindrance, with his fellow students, even if those fellow students be of another race or of another colour.</block>

<p>I do not know whether hon. members on the opposite side still lay down these requirements for academic freedom and autonomy of a university. I do not want to dispute this matter with them, except that I want to say that it is precisely these terms which organizations such as Nusas use to formulate their concept of academic freedom and autonomy. We know what great problems we had to contend with in regard to Nusas and similar organizations. I also want to state that these concepts were formulated in a similar way by liberalists, under the influence of communism, the result of which has been that a shameful lack of control, authority and discipline is being experienced in the universities of the world, where so much chaos, affliction and disorder is prevailing to-day.</p>

<p>In his speech the hon. member for Kensington had quite a number of cutting remarks to make about the constitution of the council and the establishment of an advisory council at this new university. According to his views this university is not an autonomous university as long as the majority of the members of that council are appointed by the hon. the Minister. But does the hon. member not realize that such nominations are based solely on ability and interest, and that political convictions play no role whatsoever? Does the hon. member not realize that, in view of the fact that by far and away the largest amount of money for the financing of this university will come out of the pockets of the taxpayers, the Minister has a great responsibility in respect of the control of the university? Does he not realize that a university has an extremely responsible and complicated task, and that one cannot appoint any type of person to such a council? It is in fact imperative, in the interests of these people for whom that university is being established, that the very best and most capable people should be found to serve on such a council. Does the hon. member not realize that there are endless numbers of bloodsuckers and parasites who are sitting waiting with eagle eyes for any possible opportunity which is offered them to make mischief, to incite people to undermine the Whites and to sow hatred and envy? I want to tell the hon. member for Kensington precisely what the former hon. member for Witbank said in this debate 10 years ago. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Give me the assurance that you will remove all the mischief-makers, liberalists and intriguers who have during the past 300 years caused so much distress to my nation 6.000 miles from South Africa, and then I will be prepared to concede to your claims for full academic freedom and full autonomy.</block>

<p>No, Sir, the Whites, as guardian over our nonwhite nations, can never allow their young brainpower to be thrown to the wolves before they have reached the stage of development in which they are able to defend themselves.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of the advisory council I just want to say that I think it is an excellent idea. I find it difficult to understand the derogatory opinions which hon. members on the opposite side have expressed in regard to this advisory council. Hon. members must realize that we are dealing here with a developing situation, with a continuous process of evolution, progress, development and growth. The university, as has already been said, is an extremely complicated institution, and the control of such a body requires knowledge, insight, integrity and balance. Nobody would like to see the present state of affairs continue, and the hon. member will probably be more grateful than anybody else when the day arrives when he no longer has to nominate people and it is no longer necessary that Whites should serve on that council. But, Mr. Speaker, in the times in which we are living at present this time has not yet arrived, and in the meantime the members of this advisory council have an excellent opportunity of acquiring knowledge and experience in regard to the control of such a university. I am of the opinion that this is an excellent plan. As recently as 1958 Prof. Thomas Hodgskin of the University of Oxford said that&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to get involved in a free-for-all with the hon. member for Algoa about the causes of student unrest, because I have too much to say about this Bill to be distracted. I want to say, however, that he makes glib statements here about student unrest with no proof whatsoever. He does the usual slap-happy lumping together of Liberals and Communists and he, of course, is convinced that there can be no genuine grievances amongst students. What is more, Mr. Speaker, he does not approve of students having views or opinions on matters that are outside the strict curricula that they are supposed to be following. Quite obviously his ideas and mine are not going to meet at all. There will be other opportunities for me to go into the whole issue of student unrest in South Africa. The rest of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech consisted largely of his telling us about his lofty sentiments about service to the community, with which one cannot quarrel, and he then went on to give us his ideas of academic autonomy with which I have a great quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="col_2475-2476" refersTo="page_1260"/>I would like to ask the hon. member for Algoa who tells us that he had a lot to do with the setting up of the University of Port Elizabeth just how he would have reacted to the University of Port Elizabeth obtaining a constitution such as is being obtained by the so-called University of Fort Hare, and whether he would have considered that that was autonomy in the full sense even of his interpretation of university autonomy. Of course the answer is &#x201C;no&#x201D;. The answer is that he would have fought such a Bill tooth and nail. He would have been insulted on behalf of the University of Port Elizabeth to have a university being presented with a constitution such as is being presented to the University of Fort Hare, which we are considering here to-day. I want to say that whenever I use the word &#x201C;university&#x201D; now in relation to this particular Bill, I use it in inverted commas. Now, of course, the hon. members&#x2019; views on the autonomy of a university differ completely from mine. I might say that the views expressed by the hon. member for Waterberg are also different from my own, but he did not go quite as far as the hon. member for Algoa. The hon. member for Waterberg was very interested in Dr. Ross&#x2019; opinions and he quoted liberally&#x2014;and when I use this word I trust I do not offend him&#x2014;from the journal of the Department of Bantu Education. He ended up by saying that the time has come for the ethnic university colleges which have now achieved academic maturity, to be granted full academic autonomy and to be free from any of the shackles of the University of South Africa. I disagree with this contention and I will deal with this matter shortly. But if the hon. member thinks that the time has now come for the university colleges, such as Fort Hare and the other colleges that we will be considering, to be released from Unisa and to be given full academic autonomy, he should be voting against this Bill. I say this because the Bill we are considering to-day does not remotely present any form of university autonomy to those colleges. If the hon. member is quite sincere&#x2014;as I am certain he is, because he is always a very sincere member&#x2014;he should be voting against this Bill, i.e. if he really feels that autonomy is now due to those university colleges.</p>

<p>The other members on this side of the House, and more particularly the hon. member for Kensington, who made an excellent analysis of the clauses of this Bill, have pointed out the obvious shortcomings of this Bill as far as autonomy is concerned. I want to ask what possible claims to autonomy a university can have when tight ministerial control is, in fact, kept over every single facet of these new free institutions which we are supposed to create here to-day. There is a ministerial grip on the council and the senate. These bodies are largely appointed and there are very few elected members. There is also a ministerial grip on these important bodies which should be managing the internal affairs of the university like the appointment of staff, the dismissal of staff, the deciding of conditions of service, the admission of students, fixing of fees, giving of grants, determining what new faculties and what new courses should be initiated and even the accepting of donations. Even the appointment of a rector, as has been pointed out by other members, is in the hands of the hon. the Minister. They have to approve of practically every facet of life of these new &#x201C;free&#x201D; institutions. The normal powers that are held by our really autonomous universities (autonomous in these respects), our big white universities, are expressly excluded.</p>

<p>If one takes the long title of this Bill one sees that it is introduced to grant recognition as a university to the University College of Fort Hare. If we were to take this seriously I think that practically every clause of this Bill will have to be scrapped. In every aspect of internal affairs, other than the mere fixing of syllabuses, the examinations and the awarding of degrees and diplomas the so-called university will be a creature of the Minister, not even the Minister of National Education, may I point out, but the Minister controlling the particular ethnic group which this university has been created to serve. That the Bill makes absolute the divorce between university education for white students and university education for non-White students is quite obvious from an amending Bill which will shortly be introduced in the Other Place and which I therefore cannot discuss in any detail but to which I must refer because it has enormous implications for the Bill which we are discussing to-day. This amending Bill is going to exclude from the definition of &#x201C;university&#x201D; in the great umbrella Act, the Universities Act of 1955, the Fort Hare University and all the other universities which are being created by the Bills which we are considering in the House to-day. This makes absolute the divorce between white and non-White universities and, of course, this immediately means that these new non-White universities are degraded to a lower status because they are excluded from several important bodies, such as the Committee of University Principals and all the decisions which have bearing on the universities by the Committee of University Principals; they will have appointees to the Joint Matriculation Board under different conditions from the white universities and, of course, they are excluded from all the joint statutes and the joint representations to the Government on all the matters directly affecting the universities which the University Act of 1955 conferred on all our white universities. These new &#x201C;universities&#x201D; which we are purporting to create to-day, are excluded from all those aspects of the Universities Act of 1955 which are jealously guarded by all the white universities and which, as I have said, provide the umbrella Statute for all the white universities.</p>

<p>The universities of Swaziland and Lesotho do not belong to the Republic of South Africa. Does the hon. member for Algoa think that Zululand is no longer part of the Republic of South Africa? Is the Transkei no longer part of South Africa? Is the Transvaal no longer part of South Africa? Because that, may I point out to the hon. member, is where these universities are situated. Does he not know that the Western Province is part of South Africa, that Natal is part of South Africa, where the University of Westville is situated? What a nonsensical comparison. The hon. member knows that it is a nonsensical comparison and he should think twice before he talks like that. Sir, the Government is past master, of course, at framing titles for Bills, titles which are completely contrary to the contents of the Bill, and this Bill is no exception. Let me mention a few examples: The Extension of University Education Act is one; then there is the Abolition of Passes Act; there is the Bantu Self-Government Act. All these were Acts where the titles conflicted with the contents, and here we have the University of Fort Hare Bill which, of course, is a complete contradiction of the contents of the Bill. The title is completely misleading if one studies the contents of the Bill clause by clause. Sir, I do not know whom the Government thinks they are fooling. They are possibly fooling themselves. They come along with all these illusory titles. It is quite obvious that some Government members are fooled. The hon. member for Zululand, for instance, was quite swept away by this illusion of fine happy communities, by the illusion that the Africans want things to be just as they are, that they like being at these separate universities, and so on. Well, if this is so, all we have to do is to give them the option, and if they are so happy and contented at these separate universities, then you do not need to close the open universities because no non-White would elect to go there. Sir, these are illusions, from beginning to end. All the speeches from the Government side are full of illusions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I will show in a minute how far I believe they can develop. Sir, my definition of academic autonomy differs completely from that of the hon. member for Algoa, the hon. member for Waterberg and other members on the Government side. By the way, I want to say at once that I do not for a minute think that the hon. the Minister has deceived himself. I think he knows exactly what he is doing&#x2014;not the Deputy Minister over there. He need not look so pleased with himself: I am not paving him any compliments. I am talking about the Minister who through circumstances beyond his control is not here to-day. I am quite sure that he has not deceived himself. I believe he just talks with his tongue in his cheek. He knows perfectly well that there is no autonomy whatsoever, not even according to the broadest interpretation of autonomy, being conferred on the University of Fort Hare. My definition of university autonomy goes much further than just deciding what syllabuses should be introduced and the granting of degrees and controlling examinations. My definition of university autonomy, of course, includes the right to decide who shall teach, what shall be taught and who shall be taught. I would say that these are three elementary concepts which are closely integrated with the whole idea of university autonomy. Let us examine each of these concepts. Let us first examine what shall be taught; let us take that broad concept first. Both directly and indirectly this type of autonomy is grossly undermined by the Bill that we are considering to-day. The very fact, for instance, that the powers of the council and the senate are by no means untrammelled, to put it at its lowest, by ministerial control, by virtue of their nominated status, means that the Minister maintains an indirect control over the internal affairs of the university as far as the interna of education are concerned, that is to say, the syllabuses and the examinations and so on. If the university council does things which the hon. the Minister does not like, he can kick them out.</p>

<p>Well, after four years he can kick them out. Four years in the life of a university is not a very long time. The very fact that the hon. the Minister has to approve of all donations and bequests before the ethnic universities can accept such donations and bequests, is a limiting factor on what shall be taught, because under the normal regulations governing the other universities, which, of course, are not fully autonomous in other respects, the university is free to decide on any course which it can finance itself. It is only courses which cannot be fully financed by the university itself that require ministerial approval, and the Minister&#x2019;s approval is not required for any donations or grants; so, if a university is offered a donation to set up a Chair of Race Relations at the Natal University, for instance, that university does not have to go meekly to the hon. the Minister and say, &#x201C;Please, can we accept this donation?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Oh yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no, it does not have to do so. Let the hon. member show me the section in the Universities Act which makes that necessary. It is only when a university cannot subsidize a course entirely by itself that the ministerial approval may indirectly affect the setting up of the faculty or the course. The hon. member should know what he is talking about when he interjects. [Interjections.] It would make debate easier if <span class="col_2479-2480" refersTo="page_1262"/>people knew what they were talking about. I might say that such limitations apply also as far as the raising of loans is concerned. These new &#x201C;free&#x201D; institutions of happy communities may not even decide whether they want to raise any loans or not. They cannot even accept grants of land or other donations from the local authority in whose area they fall, without ministerial authority. What sort of autonomy is that? How far, therefore, is not the freedom to decide what shall be taught undermined by these controls? As to the right to decide who shall be taught, this is nonexistent. This right does not exist at all. First of all, the ethnic concept, as it is clearly defined in the clauses of this Bill, completely knocks out any idea of freedom to decide who shall be taught. Here, of course, the white universities are under the same restriction. They too may not accept students who are not white without ministerial authority, and this is the whole basis of the argument about academic freedom in South Africa. In this case, however, the Minister may give his permission where the White universities are concerned. He may allow non-white students of other ethnic groups to attend the universities under certain circumstances, and he in fact does this. All that the hon. the Minister can do here is to allow students of other African ethnic groups to attend the universities of Fort Hare and Zululand and Turfloop, but he is expressly forbidden to allow any white students to attend any of those nonwhite universities.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think he really understands what academic anything means; so I will not argue that with him. As I say, there is an absolute prohibition on allowing any white students to attend any of the nonwhite universities, so that is completely out. I might say that regulations lay down conditions governing the admission of students, conditions which have to be complied with, and the council which makes those regulations is completely under the domination of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>As to the third tenet of academic freedom or academic autonomy, that is to say who shall teach, this is also quite non-existent. I might say that the one limitation which I think should be in these university Bills, and that is the conscience clause, is significantly absent. That limitation which does not allow a university the right to refuse admission to a student on grounds other than academic qualifications&#x2014;that is to say, it excludes the right of religious discrimination&#x2014;is not included in this Bill; so anybody may be prohibited from teaching or may be refused admission to the university on religious grounds; there is no conscience clause. As far as the ordinary autonomy to decide who shall teach is concerned, we have no clause covering that at all. Clause 14&#x2014;and I want to pause for a moment to deal with this important clause&#x2014;creates the extraordinary situation of two kinds of staff posts. There are posts under the Minister and there are posts under the council, and as regards posts under the Minister&#x2019;s control, he can decide which posts they will be, and he can convert one of the other kinds of posts to a ministerial post at any time he likes. Those posts are completely subject to the Minister&#x2019;s approval, in every possible respect. Well, we can imagine what sort of posts will be designated as ministerial posts; we can imagine what sort of subjects the Minister will think of controlling, subjects such as History, Sociology and all those subjects which deal with contentious racial matters, such as the industrial colour bar for instance. In the case of posts such as mathematical posts not even the hon. the Minister could fear any sort of adverse indoctrination of students by the staff. The council has no say whatsoever in these ministerial posts, nor does the senate which, of course, should be the body most concerned with appointments to the staff. The Minister can order an inquiry into the action of any staff members, not only the incumbents of posts that he creates for himself, and if he does not believe that the council is taking sufficient action, that the council is not dealing in the proper way with people who he thinks are guilty of misconduct, he can take action over and above any action that the council decides to take. He can second or transfer staff. There is no security of tenure for anybody under this Bill. I want to know just what sort of university this will be. I wonder if the hon. member for Algoa would tell me whether the staff at the Port Elizabeth University would accept such conditions? Would they accept this insecurity of tenure; would they accept ministerial discipline; would they accept secondment and transfer by the Minister, without any appeal and without the matter being referred back to the council and the senate which govern that university? He knows perfectly well that the staff associations of any self-respecting white university would fight provisions of this kind tooth and nail. They would have nothing whatsoever to do with them; they would be in rebellion immediately.</p>

<p>Sir, I might mention that there is one particular clause in this Bill, clause 17, which is really quite remarkable. The provisions which <span class="col_2481-2482" refersTo="page_1263"/>are embodied in clause 17 are not to be found in any other University Act that applies to the universities in South Africa. Clause 17, however, is to be found, almost verbatim&#x2014;and this is of great interest to me&#x2014;in the Coloured Persons Education Act, the Act that governs Coloured school children. That is where we find the provisions of a clause which, if you please, is now inserted in a Bill which covers the education of university students, even including the wording of one interesting little clause which provides that a member of the staff, in the case of a female, may be dismissed on account of her marriage. If a female member of the staff &#x201C;commits marriage&#x201D;&#x2014;and I use the word advisedly&#x2014;she may be dismissed from the university. Has anybody ever heard of such a ludicrous position? As I say, a clause such as clause 17 is not to be found in any of our other university Statutes; but it is to be found in the Coloured Persons Education Act, which completely proves my contention that this Bill is not dealing with a university; this is dealing with a glorified school. The way in which the staff is treated and the way in which the students are treated suggests that they are to be treated like glorified school children and school teachers. Sir, I do not want to go into much more detail on the question of what I think of the existing university colleges. I say that the students there are treated like school children now. The fact that the white staff and the non-white staff hardly mix at all, the fact that they do not even share a common staff room, the fact that the non-white students have hardly any contact with white staff members outside of the actual lecture rooms, bears out my statement that these university students are treated like school children, and that might be one of the reasons for the student unrest at the University of Fort Hare some time ago.</p>

<p>Now I want to put the 64-dollar question to the hon. the Deputy Minister, which I hope he will convey to the Minister, and that is: Why the haste? Why this lumping together of all the university colleges for this instant promotion? Why is it necessary? Are there no differences between the state of development of Ngoya, of Turfloop, of Fort Hare, of the University College for Indians, of the University College of the Western Cape? They are all at different stages of development. Some have many more students than others. For instance, the Indian College is very much more developed than the others, but not any of them in my opinion is ready for this instant promotion before we have had a searching inquiry in depth by independent experts as to whether or not these university colleges have reached the necessary stage of development. I am going to oppose this Bill absolutely, because I do not believe we know nearly enough about the matter. I am going to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington where he asks that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee before the Second Reading, and I am going to do it for this reason. It is because the Select Committee can reject the Bill entirely. It need come back with no Bill at all. I do not for one moment believe that a Select Committee of M.P.s, most of whom are unqualified to deal with this subject anyway &#x2026; [Interjections.] That is so; there may be one or two who are. I am not against the principle of possibly putting these university colleges on a higher status at some future time, but I am dead against it now before we have had a proper inquiry&#x2014;and that is what the Minister should consider rather than a Select Committee. We should have an independent inquiry by experts, and I could give him three names right off of three retired principals. I can give him Professor Malherbe, Professor Thom, and Professor MacCrone, three recently retired principals of our great white universities, who should examine by absolutely independent criteria whether or not these university colleges are fit to be promoted to the status of full universities. And I will give him one or two of the criteria which I think they should inquire into: The qualifications of the teaching staff, the achievements in research by staff and students, the achievements of students as post-graduates, and the comprehensiveness and diversification of courses. There is nothing new in these criteria. They were adopted for our white universities, or most of them, in the past before they were converted to the full status of universities. I say that this certainly should be applied to these non-White universities with their small student bodies and their isolated campuses in the case of the African colleges, with not even part-time students to draw on because they are situated far from the urban centres where many more students would come if these universities were situated in the cities. These are not universities like RAU, which has unlimited potentialities for development, which is situated in Johannesburg and which is enormously well-endowed. These are universities which <i>sui generis</i> have limitations because they are so isolated and because there is such an enormous drop-out of the school-going population among the African children, so that such a small percentage ever reaches the matriculation class.</p>

<p>These are the terms of reference I would recommend to a proper Select Committee and I believe that unless we do this, we are not enhancing the status of these university colleges but are lowering it; we might very well be lowering it, because there is the greatest danger that the degrees that these instant universities may confer will not be recognized as the degrees of the existing tribal colleges are recognized, simply because standards are maintained by Unisa. There is the greatest danger that their university degrees will not be recognized overseas for post-graduate studies. That this will jeopardize entirely the status not only of the non-white universities, but also in the end of our white universities is also possible, because there is a tendency for a country&#x2019;s university standards to be judged as a whole. I say this is a reckless step. It is a step which might deceive the Government, but it does <span class="col_2483-2484" refersTo="page_1264"/>not deceive anybody who knows anything about academic standards or anybody who is able to take an objective view of the existing university colleges.</p>

She was not advocating a university in the sense in which we know universities in this country, universities which have to comply with the requirements of that to which they are bound, universities which are directed towards the people, towards the nation and even towards the ethnic groups which they serve.

<p>That is precisely what she is advocating. We are used to her giving vent to her feelings on certain matters in the most irresponsible terms. We did not expect her to support this Bill. We did not even expect her to see something good in it. I want to state that if the hon. member for Houghton had risen here this afternoon and welcomed this Bill, my recommendation to the hon. the Minister would have been that we should seriously reconsider our views on it, because there would have to be a mistake with the Bill. She also put forward the argument that this is the final step in severing the bond between the white and the non-white universities&#x2014;but that break occurred 10 years ago. There is nothing strange about it. It is after all the policy of this Government that we are not going to allow integration at that level either. But to spend my time replying to her speech now would really be to waste precious time, because she and I are not on the same wave-length. We do not even speak the same language. I do not view those matters in the same light, and that is why I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p>The problem of the Opposition and the hon. member for Houghton is that they always want to define concepts such as the autonomy of a university in absolute terms. I want to state now that there is no university in South Africa which is absolutely autonomous: but if we want to accept the concept which the hon. member for Houghton gave us, then we would be reaching out for a situation of anarchy and not of autonomy. In the final analysis the measure of autonomy of any university is determined by economic factors. The more independent an institution is, the greater its autonomy. But because the State in this country contributes plus-minus 70 per cent to 75 per cent of the cost of a student at the university, it is obvious that the university&#x2019;s autonomy is, to a degree, subject to certain restrictions. The hon. member for Kensington told us the other day that the unit costs of a student at Fort Hare amounted to approximately R1,500 per head, of which the student himself contributed a very slight fraction. Now can it be expected of the Minister, who after all is responsible to this House for the expenditure which is incurred by such a university, to spend public money on a university such as Fort Hare in such a way that he cannot exercise control over it; can he be expected to grant any university so much autonomy that he has no control over the spending of such an institution? The Opposition would be the first people to protest very vociferously if that were the case, and if the hon. the Minister were to come here and state that he had no say over the money which he had given to Fort Hare.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a few arguments of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). He stated: &#x201C;The only new principle in this Bill is that the apron-strings are being cut.&#x201D; That is precisely what the Minister said. Did the hon. Minister suggest anything else in his Second Reading speech? He stated very emphatically that the Government was now granting Fort Hare provincial academic freedom; he was granting them university status. In this Bill we are giving Fort Hare nothing more and nothing less. They are simply obtaining academic independence, in other words, university status. This is true to the principle that we are, in respect of the Bantu, giving them their facilities step by step. We cannot all at once exempt them from all restrictions and from all ministerial intervention. These institutions are being sent in a specific direction for a specific purpose. That is why they were established. That is why the State took them over, It would be foolish if the Minister did not consequently retain his control over such institutions so that he could see to it that the institution did in fact develop in the direction in which he envisaged it should move. I can also mention that provisional academic freedom does not even apply to all the faculties, but only to some. The Bill also makes provision for the abolition of these so-called assessor members in the various faculties.</p>

<p>The hon. member made another statement as well. He said: &#x201C;The University of Fort Hare is turned into another State Department. There is actually a clause in the Bill empowering the Minister to transfer personnel to other departments.&#x201D; The hon. member really took leave of the truth in this respect. He created an impression here of something which does not exist in this Bill. Let me read to you what is stated in clause 9, to which he was apparently referring&#x2014;</p>

<p>Where do you read that in this clause? I can just say, for the information of the hon. member, that this clause was inserted into the Bill to make provision for lecturers at the university college of Fort Hare, as has already happened in the past, to be seconded even to other governments. Last year a lecturer at one of these colleges was seconded to the Government of Lesotho in order to assist them and to furnish them with advice. [Interjections.] We can argue about that in the Committee Stage. The fact of the matter is that when these lecturers are employed by the Department they are simply taken off the pay-sheet of Fort Hare and placed on the establishment of the Department. It is very necessary that this should happen because many of these lecturers go to undertake research in State Departments. What is sinister or wrong about this?</p>

<p>The United Party has a habit of seeing everything through the eyes of a white person, and do not realize that when we are dealing with the Bantu we are dealing with people who have only been in contact with universities for a few decades. They must still be trained and brought to maturity for university training. We are engaged in that process. I am mentioning this particularly with reference to their vehement protest at the <i>per capita</i> costs of a student there. From the nature of the case the costs at a Bantu university will be much higher than those at a white university, because these people are not yet ripe for university training. Does the Opposition expect us to get the student at the university first, and then the faculty? Surely it would be foolish to try and attract the students to the university first and then to see to it that the necessary faculties are there. In any institution just the reverse applies. That is, after all, the sensible way of doing things, and if it is in fact done in this way, it must push up the unit costs. But although the Opposition protest so vehemently against the <i>per capita</i> costs at the non-white universities, they complain, through the hon. member for Durban (Berea) about the lack of faculties and courses at these nonwhite universities. Sir, how must we reconcile these two standpoints? The one wants more faculties there, and the other wants a reduction in the unit costs.</p>

<p>As council member of the University College of Fort Hare it is to-day an exceptional pleasure for me to stand up here and to accord my wholehearted support to this measure, which is at present before the House. I believe that I am not only doing so on my own behalf, but also on behalf of my colleagues on the council of the University College. I believe that I am speaking on their behalf when I say that we are grateful for the fact that in this short space of time of 10 years after the take-over of Fort Hare by the State, the quality of the training, the academic skill of the lecturing staff, and the way in which the institution is being controlled and managed, is of such a quality that it justifies the present step by the Government. Not only is it a well-earned status which is being accorded the institution. It is also a tribute to the two rectors who have already served there, namely Professor Ross, who has already retired, and Professor De Wet, the present rector. It is also a tribute to all lecturers and administrative staff who have over a period of years performed academic and administrative work of the highest order there, and have in reality expanded the institution into something which is a credit to the Xhosa nation and a lasting monument to the National Party Government, which took over Fort Hare as an act of faith. To-day we are plucking the fruits of that far-sighted policy which the Government applied at that time.</p>

<p>Sir, you will recall how vehemently the present Opposition opposed the take-over of Fort Hare in 1959. Every means was employed to thwart this well-intended and honest attempt and to cause it to fail. But, thanks to the faith of a small group of enthusiastic, purposeful and dutiful lecturers, they have not allowed themselves to be put off. They performed their task and they are to-day plucking the fruits in that full academic status is being granted to them.</p>

<p>Let us lift the veil slightly, in order to see what the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude in respect of Fort Hare was in 1959. So vehement was the opposition of the Opposition that they even opposed the notice of motion of the Bill in language and terms which, to say the least, were unbridled. I want to read what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had to say at the time (Hansard, volume 99, column 1553):</p>

<block name="quote">It is quite clear that what is envisaged in this Bill is the demotion of an existing <span class="col_2487-2488" refersTo="page_1266"/>university or university college to something which will not approach in any sense at all the concept of a university in the Western world &#x2026; In fact, what is envisaged here, is not a university, hut a Government-controlled school for some type of higher education, of what exact type it is difficult to envisage. It is also quite clear that it is not worthy of the name of a university in any country of the Western world.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington even admitted during the present debate that he spoke at the time of &#x201C;the rape of Fort Hare&#x201D;. But, Sir, he (the hon. Leader), went even further. He said (Hansard, volume 99, column 1565):</p>

<block name="quote">There is not the slightest doubt that this new Bill will relegate Fort Hare to a position inferior to what it occupies to-day. It is being relegated from the position of a university college, which has attained a high status, to the position of a tribal college which is just about to commence.</block>

<p>In the light of what we are experiencing here to-day, I think it is fair to ask whether those two hon. members still adhere to the statements they made at the time. In the light of what has been accomplished at Fort Hare, I think that those two hon. members &#x2026;</p>

<p>Academically Fort Hare has progressed to such an extent that academic freedom can be granted to it, with the co-operation of the University of South Africa. Now that hon. member is asking the foolish question: &#x201C;Where has Fort Hare progressed?&#x201D; I want to make the statement that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Kensington owe it to this House to stand up and apologize for the attitude they adopted in 1959. That the Opposition realizes that it made a grave error at the time, and adopted an unpleasant and indefensible standpoint, are proved by the fact that all resistance has disappeared to-day. The best they can do at the moment is to ask for a Select Committee. From the speech by the hon. member for Kensington, who was in fact the main speaker on this matter, one cannot deduce whether they are for or against the principle of the Bill. Not one of those hon. members has as yet given us a well-motivated statement as to why this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. During 1959 a Select Committee was appointed to go into the University College of Fort Hare Transfer Bill. At that time already this matter was gone into very thoroughly. Nothing has happened since which should now make it necessary that this matter should be referred to a Select Committee again. Which principles do the Opposition want thoroughly investigated before this Bill can be passed? This Bill which is at present before the House is merely the manifestation of a natural process of evolution. It is namely the natural consequence of what was established in 1959, and what has since been developed and stabilized with dedication and purpose. I am therefore asking the Opposition what more they want to find out by asking for a Select Committee.</p>

<p>We have heard quite a good deal about the senate and the advisory council and the powers which are being granted them. In terms of existing legislation the non-white lecturers at the University College of Fort Hare do not form part of the senate, but let me add at once that those lecturers co-operate very closely with the rector and the other members of the senate. They are consulted on the highest level. There is continual close liaison with these people. They are consulted in regard to everything affecting the welfare and the academic aspect of the students of Fort Hare. The fact that this co-operation does exist there must be seen as one of the factors which contributed to the successful development of the University College of Fort Hare, as we know it to-day. The Government&#x2019;s standpoint is or has always been&#x2014;and we make no secret of this&#x2014;that integrated authoritative bodies cannot be allowed to be established, at any level whatsoever. That is the policy of the Government which runs like a golden thread through its legislation and all its actions. I make so bold as to say that nothing has happened up to now to compel the Government to reconsider this principal standpoint. In fact, experience has shown that this formula is the only one which can be applied successfully where there has to be contact between Whites and non-Whites. Therefore there is no reason for an exception to be made in the case of Fort Hare. All concerned accept it as a sound and sensible arrangement, and even the Bantu members of the staff favour the arrangement. As far as the advisory council is concerned, I must honestly admit that I am very sorry that the hon. member for Kensington spoke about this council the other day in terms which were definitely not flattering. Referring to these people he used the word &#x201C;humiliating&#x201D;. I am very sorry that he describes the position in which they find themselves as &#x201C;humiliating&#x201D;, because it is anything but that seen from their point of view. I do not think the hon. member was doing these people a favour when he said that. In addition I believe that they will take it very much amiss of him for making this remark if they have an opportunity to do so. The advisory council of Fort Hare consists of a group of Bantu who have the interests of that institution very much at heart. They are in fact making a very valuable contribution to the control and the administration of that institution. I can testify from my own experience that these people are relied on very heavily, not only by the rector, but also by the council. We take very definite cognizance of what happens on the advisory council. Their advice is frequently requested, and many matters are referred to them for comment. I can testify to <span class="col_2489-2490" refersTo="page_1267"/>the fact that we are receiving only the best and most wholehearted co-operation from those people. They appreciate their position and recognize it as a schooling where they can acquire experience in their own time and in their own way of the control and management of institutions of this nature. When it comes to the discipline of students this advisory council plays a very important role. If it had not been for the members of the advisory council who supplied us with competent and mature advice during the recent strikes, there would probably have been far more disturbances on the campus. The advisory council is really affording the Bantu who are interested an opportunity of acquiring experience in his own way and in his own time of the administrative control which such an institution naturally requires.</p>

<speech by="#morrison">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>I want to know whether those hon. members are opposed to this. If one acquires experience, whether it is separate or integrated, it still remains experience. I cannot see why that hon. member now wants to imply that integrated experience should necessarily be a better article than separate experience. The only experience which is lacking in quality is United Party experience (Sapondervinding). It would be an impossible task at this early stage to afford the advisory council full powers of control over the University of Fort Hare. The ultimate ideal is of course&#x2014;and this Government makes no secret of this either&#x2014;that this institution will ultimately be governed by a non-white council, by Bantu who are elected from their own ethnic group. But the time is not yet ripe for that. We are doing these things step by step and when they are ripe for that, the final step will undoubtedly be taken. This standpoint is principally correct and is the only valid standpoint which can lead the Bantu to self-determination in this specialized field as well.</p>

<p>I want to discuss another little matter which was made much of here, namely the number of students at Fort Hare. The statement was made here that these numbers have recently, or since the take-over by the State, decreased to an alarming extent. It is correct that at the take-over there were approximately 450 students registered at Fort Hare. Thirty-five per cent of those students were non-Xhosa. During 1966 this figure decreased as far as 239. But this year a record number of students have been registered, namely 540. This is the largest number of students that have ever been registered at Fort Hare, and this took place in spite of the unsavoury and unpleasant happenings towards the end of last year and the disturbances which took place. This is irrefutable proof that this institution is already being accepted by the Xhosa to an increasing extent as something which is their own, and that they are cultivating a love for it because they realize that the establishment of the facilities is a well-intended and honest attempt on the part of the State to help them to acquire those means which will equip them for the future as well.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to the question of academic independence in regard to which a great deal was said here. The hon. Minister admitted that the academic freedom being granted to this institution was provisional. This is clearly provided in clause 10 (2) (a), (b), (c) and (d). But it is not a principle which is applicable in respect of Fort Hare only. It is in fact applicable to the University of Port Elizabeth and the Rand Afrikaans University as well. It has only been inserted there to see to it that the high academic standards are maintained, and that there is uniformity as far as these academic standards are concerned. And, these assessor members on the senate, these people who are brought over from other faculties and institutions in order to serve on the senate of Fort Hare are only there in order to express an opinion on these specific academic matters. Their duties are very clearly defined in the Bill. This does not apply to all faculties either. Only some of the faculties will have to include some of these assessor members in their faculty. The Bill also provides that they can be abolished at any time.</p>

<p>In spite of the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude, and in spite of the attitude of the hon. member for Houghton, I believe that what we are developing here to-day will be a credit to and a fine edifice for the Xhosa nation, and that it will serve as a monument to indicate to the Xhosa of the future that the National Party Government of the Republic of South Africa was honest and sincere in its intentions towards them.</p>

<speech by="#delport">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise, firstly, to extend to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat my hearty congratulations not only on the excellent speech he has just made, but also to congratulate him personally on being a member of the council of the University of Fort Hare. I congratulate him, together with his other colleagues on that council, on the tremendous contribution they have rendered in the interests of the Xhosa community, and in the interests of South Africa, over the past years. I think that this is appreciated by all the members on this side of the House. I shall not comment on the fact that the hon. members on the other side of the House do not appreciate it. I was really under the impression, after the hon. the Minister had made his Second Reading speech in this hon. House a few days ago, that this Bill would be passed and enacted by this hon. House without any opposition and without more ado. But this did not happen. What did we find? We found tremendous opposition, almost as much as we did ten years ago, except that over the years the pungent language had been toned down to a certain extent. Of course, one is grateful for this.</p>

<p>But if we take the sum-total of the objections raised here by hon. members on the <span class="col_2491-2492" refersTo="page_1268"/>other side of the House, including the hon. member for Houghton, all of it amounts to this, i.e. that these objections are based on points of departure which are not quite correct, and this afternoon I should like to refer to four of those points of departure. The first incorrect point of departure amounts to the fact that, without any grounds for doing so, hon. members are comparing the institutions for which provision is being made in the Bill before the hon. House with similar institutions which exist at our three older universities in South Africa, which have been in existence for more than a century. I am referring to the universities of the Witwatersrand, Cape Town and Stellenbosch. If these hon. members who are objecting to this legislation, had compared these institutions with similar institutions which came into being in the initial years of these older universities, we would at least have been able to say that they had taken a great deal of trouble, even if we would not have agreed with them. Hon. members are going so far as not to compare these institutions with similar institutions of recently established white universities in South Africa either. But they are even going further than that. One of these hon. members made the blunder of saying that in terms of clause 5 the chancellor is elected by the university council, and that the chancellor ought to be elected by the convocation. I am now issuing a challenge to hon. members on the other side of the House. The majority of them were here when this House placed on the Statute Book Act No. 1 of 1964, in terms of which a new university was established in South Africa. In terms of that Act a similar provision was placed on the Statute Book, i.e. that the chancellor be elected by the university council of that university. And now I ask those hon. members whether any of them objected when that Bill was before this House. That Act dealt with the establishment of a white university in our country. No, there they are. They did not raise the slightest objection. It is our intention here to grant a non-white ethnic group the necessary university facilities. In terms of clause 5 we are making provision for the chancellor to be elected by the university council, and according to those hon. members this is supposedly a terribly wrong thing to do.</p>

<p>I say, in the first instance, that the point of departure is wrong because, without having any ground for doing so, they want to compare these important university institutions, as embodied in this university legislation, with and test them against existing institutions at our older white universities in South Africa. Hon. members are also making a second blunder, i.e. that it has never penetrated to them that we are now dealing with the provision of university facilities for an under-developed community. My colleague the hon. member for Cradock said that there was no university in the world which had absolute autonomy. Whereas it is our duty to make available, by way of granting facilities, to an underdeveloped community this precious thing which in colloquial language we call learning and which is referred to as the academic fruit of many years in university language, there must of course be control. If we have a great deal of control at the recently established white universities, there must of course be certain reservations as regards control at this young university for an under-developed community. Hon. members also adopt a third incorrect standpoint. Hon. members are actually advocating directly&#x2014;but I shall give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they are advocating by implication&#x2014;for the hand of the Government and consequently the hand of the white man, really, to be withdrawn immediately from the control of these universities, except&#x2014;and once again I shall give them the benefit of the doubt because they did not say so, but I accept it&#x2014;that they can find no fault with those representatives who have to serve on the university council and be appointed by the State President. Whose interests do we serve if we advocate something of that nature? Are we serving anybody&#x2019;s interests? Are we serving the interests of the community for whom this institution is being established, or, whose interests are we serving? I think that if we lend an ear to that, we shall perhaps be serving the interests of three groups, i.e. the Black Sash, the Liberalists and the poor hon. United Party.</p>

<p>They are also adopting a fourth incorrect standpoint. I mention these incorrect standpoints because we shall be arguing and debating with one another in this hon. House until we are blue in the face. As long as the arguments raised by hon. members opposite are based on these incorrect standpoints, we shall get nowhere, surely. As a matter of fact, we are actually dealing here with an ethnic university, and this is no foreign or new institution. In this regard I as an Afrikaner can probably refer with the greatest measure of pride to what Stellenbosch has done for the Afrikaans-speaking community over the years, or to what the Rhodes University meant to our English-speaking frontier farmers in the olden days, in the formative years, or to what the University of Cardiff did for the Welsh, or to what the University of Edinburgh meant to the Scots, or to what Cambridge and Oxford meant to the English in the previous century in making a mighty nation out of them. [Interjection.] If the hon. member over there would listen for a while, he might also be inspired with idealism and then one would perhaps be able to get somewhere with him.</p>

<p>Here we want to grant an under-developed community the privilege of an independent university of its own. We want to do so with certain reservations; none of us deny that. What a major share such an institution could have in bringing about community development in that under-developed ethnic group! Last year the hon. member for Wynberg made a fine speech here on the advantages of community development in our non-White residential areas, and on that occasion I cordially <span class="col_2493-2494" refersTo="page_1269"/>asked her also to convey the ideas she had expressed here more in particular to her fellow caucus members. I believe that she did so, but, really, it has had no effect. Through the creation and establishment of this separate university exclusively for that non-White ethnic group, we have a powerful factor which may contribute to the enhancement of community development in the true sense and the true scope of the word. But this is not noticed, this is not mentioned. The institutions which are being created in terms of the legislation before the House, are simply and blatantly being compared with similar institutions at the three older universities which have been in existence here in South Africa for more than a century.</p>

<p>I regard it as a privilege to be able to support this measure, because in the main principle we see recorded&#x2014;and I want to put it modestly&#x2014;the reconfirmation of a university exclusively for a non-white ethnic group. Admittedly, this will be the first of its kind in South Africa. If a person were to ask me why I attach so much importance to the reconfirmation of this main principle in particular, I would say that I have three good reasons for doing so. In the first instance, the Xhosa people do not only have a need for higher education, but also for a university of their own. One will find that any nation and any community has such a major need. It is a fact that in terms of our policy of separate development we require that the necessary facilities and opportunities be granted to our non-white ethnic groups, not only to develop themselves individually, but also to enable them to develop their community. If we do not create those opportunities for them, they will not be in a position to produce their own teachers, their own leaders, their own technicians, their own economists and their own philosophers. If they are not in a position to produce leaders and other people, it will, in addition, not be possible for them to have balanced development in the nation itself in the spheres of agriculture, economics, education and technology.</p>

<p>There is also a second reason why I regard this reconfirmation of this main principle as having so much significance. It has been proved conclusively that amongst underdeveloped nations not only higher education, but also university education can best be provided in separate institutions. In this regard I want to refer to a report which appeared in <i>Die Transvaler</i> on 27.1.1968. This report was in connection with a report by Dr. H. J. van Zyl, the Deputy Secretary for Bantu Education, and reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The five Bantu high schools which obtained a 100 per cent pass rate in the recent matriculation examinations, are all situated in or near homeland areas.</block>

<p>I think this is a tremendous achievement, and it proves what I have just said.</p>

<p>There is also a third very important reason why I regard the reconfirmation this main principle as having so much significance. This side of the House is convinced that, as circumstances permit, the continued admission of non-Whites to our white universities should be terminated. It is true that this fine fruit for our non-Whites, i.e. to have a university institution of their own, really did not drop from the skies as far as they are concerned. There were, if I may use the metaphor, political natural elements which sought to smother this little fruit before its blossom could really develop. In this debate there have been frequent references to Hansard reports of debates held in 1959 as well as to newspaper reports of those times, and now I think it is a quite reasonable conclusion for us to summarize these political natural elements which sought to destroy this fruit, by saying that they really consist of a triumvirate under the leadership of the United Party. The other two partners were the leftist university graduates and the United Party Press. Their <i>modus operandi</i> was exactly the same as the one followed by hon. members opposite, and this is the same <i>modus operandi</i> which has been followed for the past 20 years whenever we dealt with creative and constructive things in this fine southern country of ours. These three were as follows. [Interjection.] If the hon. member for Simonstown would just keep quiet for a moment we would be able to discuss this presently. Their actions actually had three facets. The first was that they did not only want to make us believe here in the House of Assembly, but also the public outside, including the Bantu population, that this separate university institution was not only unnecessary, but also superfluous. In the second place, in these speeches they made here, they tried to brand these institutions as being inferior. I do not want to repeat it. For instance, they referred to &#x201C;tribal colleges&#x201D;. In the third place, they could not really see any good intentions on the part of the Government as regards the establishment of a university college for our non-white ethnic group in the Transkei.</p>

<p>Now the following question arises and I think this is a question which arises in the minds of all hon. members on this side of the House: Is it possible for people who were born and bred in this southern country to be opposed to the establishment of separate university institutions for a non-white ethnic group? Is it possible that there are people who can have such vehement objections to it? Should there not be underlying ideas, should there not be underlying motives if people can go so far as to speak of such a fine institution in such a manner? Surely, this cannot be possible in modern times. Hon. members opposite must not take this amiss of me, but I should say that to a certain extent one has to attribute their actions to political motives. At that time, just as is the case to-day, hon. members opposite actually wanted to advocate academic integration under the cloak of academic freedom. I do not think they should take it amiss of me if I put it this way. The hon. member <span class="col_2495-2496" refersTo="page_1270"/>who is sitting right at the back over there confirmed that here by implication a moment ago. In the second place, ten years ago, just as is the case to-day, hon. members of the United Party were still inspired with the idea of political integration. I do not think that we are moved to anger when we refer to that. Surely, that is the case. After all, hon. members do accept that. After all, it is they who want representatives of certain non-white groups in this white Parliament. How can hon. members support us when we want to establish a separate university for a non-white ethnic group, if they adopt that point of view? These things cannot be reconciled. In the third place&#x2014;I do not think hon. members should take it amiss of me, because this is the truth&#x2014;these hon. members have, after all, never lifted a finger to promote social separation in South Africa. On the contrary, they cannot deny that they have hampered every step the Government has taken under difficult circumstances to bring about social separation. I am very sorry that I must refer to that; but now one can understand why they have for ten years consistently proceeded on incorrect assumptions and opposed essential institutions, such as a separate university for the Xhosa nation. This has been the case simply because there are political motives behind it. The course the confirmation of this principle has followed over the years, has not only been a difficult one, but actually a tragic one as well; because under the guidance of hon. members opposite and their partners not only confusion, but also frustration was aroused in the minds of Bantu students and prospective students. Fortunately for our relations problem some of those partners have now disassociated themselves from this point of view and one no longer hears of them. They actually stand alone in this regard, except that whenever we deal with matters of this nature, &#x201C;old faithful&#x201D;, the hon. member for Houghton, faithfully stands by them.</p>

<p>Then she is in her element for then she has once again found spiritual and political stable-companions. Confusion and frustration were not only aroused in the minds of students, but also in the minds and in the hearts of the parents of those students. But, what is more, the enemies of South Africa were also unnecessarily and groundlessly supplied with political ammunition. Hon. members opposite have now asked my colleague from Cradock what progress has been shown. That is why it was a privilege to me to thank him. In spite of the United Party, in spite of all this incorrect political ammunition that was made available to the world, in spite of the frustration that was aroused in the hearts of students and parents, that hon. member, his colleagues, the hon. the Minister and the Government saw to it that the University College of Fort Hare developed, prospered and grew. In terms of this Bill we are to-day establishing the first independent university for a non-white ethnic group.</p>

<p>To me the legislation before the House also embodies a second very important main principle. Actually, I can say this was already envisaged in terms of sections 21 and 22 of the Act of 1959, i.e. the fact that Fort Hare is also gaining its academic independence now. The matter was debated at great length. Many requirements were laid down for academic independence. But it does, after all, amount to this, i.e. that there are two important reasons why this step can be taken. In 1960, for instance, there were 360 students, including Indians, Coloureds and Bantu. Last year there were 451 Bantu students. Compared to the numbers of the older universities of the world, this university is probably not a very large one; but if one looks at this in the light of the history of our own white universities, it is a considerable number. Many of our older white universities had small enrolments in their lean years. As far as staff is concerned, this university can insist on academic independence, because the staff have proved that they can comply with academic requirements.</p>

<p>The legislation before the House also embodies a third important principle. In respect of each faculty one or more persons of a corresponding faculty at another university will be appointed as members of the senate, with academic duties only. As it was also put by the hon. member for Cradock, this is the customary formula which has recently been devised in respect of the establishment of young universities in South Africa; because this implies the guarantee that a high standard will be maintained.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this university is merely another of the fruits we reap along the difficult course we have to follow in order to provide separate development for our people. But just as we did not pay any notice to the obstacles that were placed in the way of the Government, so the hon. the Minister, the Government and the council of that university proceeded with their task, and this independent university will be established shortly.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to listen to the two consecutive speeches by the hon. members for Cradock and Port Elizabeth (Central). The hon. member for Cradock went to great lengths and spent a considerable amount of time, explaining why this academic freedom had now been earned by the University College of Fort Hare. He spoke with great feeling of his own experience on the council. Without going into the merits as to whether or not this academic freedom in fact is contained in the Bill before us, he felt that the college was entitled to academic freedom. But he was immediately followed by his colleague, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central), who even moved a motion of thanks and congratulations <span class="col_2497-2498" refersTo="page_1271"/>to his colleague sitting on that side of the House. Then he proceeded at great length to explain why the autonomy had to be curtailed, why it was not real and complete, because we are establishing a university for an underdeveloped people. Now which is the argument? Does this complete academic autonomy exist, or is it a controlled, restricted autonomy, because we are dealing, as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) said, with an underdeveloped section of the population? But that is the type of argument we hear. Then we have diversion upon diversion far away from the question of education, which is before us at the present time. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) seems to suggest that all other factors and all other considerations, educational, practical and financial, must go by the board. We must now as a House agree to the establishment of a separate university for the Xhosa people, just because it is in keeping with the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. Let me concede immediately that the idea of a separate university for the Xhosa people might be an ideal, but it is as real an ideal as was admitted by the hon. the Prime Minister, when he said that total separation is merely an ideal, a direction, and not a policy, because it is unattainable.</p>

<p>I want to suggest to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) that we need to take another look at the whole concept of education which is basic to this Bill which is before us this afternoon. I think this Bill gives an opportunity to the House to have another look at non-white education leading up to the necessity for the establishment of this particular university. There are many facets to this problem&#x2014;and, Sir, let us not mince words; it is a problem with which we in South Africa are faced, namely the extension of civilization through education to our non-white people&#x2014;facets which have been considered before but which are worthy of reconsideration after a lapse of time, as we are doing in this Bill; we are virtually reconsidering what was debated and discussed here ten years ago. This Bill also presents the opportunity to deal with the facets on which decisions are required in so far as they pose new problems. I think we have an opportunity here to look at the whole problem on the basis first of all, of considering priorities; secondly, we have the opportunity of evaluating the cost of any planning which this House approves; thirdly, of evaluating the achievements in the line of nonwhite education up to university level and, fourthly, to do some planning for the future. Sir, I want to suggest that there is no urgency in this matter; that there is no reason why an urgent decision should be taken to-day ox to-morrow as to whether the constitution of the University College of Fort Hare is to be changed. There is no urgency. There are many white universities that have had to exist and develop over a period of 30 years, and they have not suffered as a result. We come here to-day to discuss Bantu university colleges which have existed for a mere ten years and which have had to be constructed from rock bottom. Now suddenly there is a great urgency to get this legislation through the House and to make these decisions. Sir, I stress the fact that I believe that there is no urgency and I stress the reasonableness of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington, an amendment which asks that a Select Committee should be appointed, a committee which will give us the opportunity of gathering the facts, of consulting others, of obtaining opinions and of planning and looking at the many facets of university education which need to be considered. Sir, I have mentioned the question of priorities and the necessity to consider these priorities. There are many matters which require consideration and reconsideration, and the mere establishment of a university certainly requires that we must look at the infra-structure of education at the lower levels to see first of all whether there is a need for the university, what the demand is going to be on that university from students or available students and in what time and over what period of time that is going to happen. Sir, I wonder whether any member in this House knows exactly how many Xhosa children there are in the different standards at the present time in Bantu schools; how many Zulu children there are at school; how many Venda children there are; how many Tswana children there are and how many children of other ethnic groups are at school today. I do not think that information is available. I do not think it is available in respect of any group.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That is a different matter. The point I am trying to make is that if a university is to be established for the Xhosa people, then I think it is essential to know what number of Xhosa children are at school, how many are reaching secondary education and what the facilities there are for expansion so that we will then know what sort of university is going to be required. Sir, then there is also this important aspect, and perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister will be good enough to pass this on to the Minister so that we can hear more about this: In setting up the infra-structure for the education for the Bantu people, is the Government&#x2019;s attitude aimed at extending elementary literacy to the greatest number, in other words, to see how many children can get basic literacy, or is it directed <span class="col_2499-2500" refersTo="page_1272"/>towards conventional education with secondary and higher education being provided for selected persons. The answers to these questions must influence one&#x2019;s approach to this Bill. When one looks at the position of primary education amongst the Bantu people&#x2014;and I say again that I do not know how many of the various ethnic groups fall into this category&#x2014;one finds that the numbers of Bantu children receiving primary education in South Africa has increased and we are all grateful for that. The figure as at the 1st of June, 1967, was 1,889,046 children. Let us assume that at the present time there are 2,000,000 in schools. But, Sir, one must then analyse to what extent they remain at school; one must see what the wastage is. That basic figure is a fairly satisfactory one but when one analyses the standards at which the children leave school, one finds that there is a considerable wastage and that there seems to be a pattern. One finds that of the Bantu children attending school approximately 70 per cent do not go beyond St. II.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>What about the human factor?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am not arguing about that. We have to face this fact. This has happened in the case of our white children. We had this problem with white children and it is a problem which still faces us and that is to keep children at school to the maximum of their ability to benefit by schooling. They leave too soon; they go into the labour market and there are all sorts of reasons. This is happening amongst the Bantu children. We find that .1 per cent of Bantu attending school are in Form V, the equivalent of matriculation standard. If that is so, where do we give our priorities: To extending the universities or looking into the building up of education at this particular school level? Where do we spend the money that is available&#x2014;on extending the universities or finding ways and means whereby we can uplift the general standard of education of the Black people? I believe we must be realistic. Sir, how many matriculants are there, for instance, amongst all the Bantu ethnic groups? One thinks of matriculants as being the source of university students. In 1967 there were 485 matriculants in the whole of the Republic and of those 485 a mere 125 had mathematics qualifications. When I talk about matriculants, I mean matriculants or people who have passed the Senior Certificate with university exemption. There are others who pass Std. X but they do not qualify for admission to university. Surely these figures which I have indicated show a position which needs reconsideration.</p>

<p>Sir, I think at this stage I must be clear and refer back to the speech of the hon. member for Waterberg. There have been certain other remarks as well as to the attitude of this side of the House. The hon. member for Cradock quoted portions of the debate which took place here; the hon. member for Waterberg quoted extracts at various times in the course of his speech but, Sir, I want to make our position clear because it is our attitude to-day on this side of the House. The amendment which was moved by my hon. Leader on the 26th February, 1959, read as follows (col. 1553)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute: &#x201C;this House declines to grant leave for the introduction of the Bill because it is part of a pattern of legislation incompatible with the concept of academic freedom and university autonomy obtaining in the Western world and hitherto also generally accepted as part of the South African way of life.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Sir, we did not want to have Fort Hare demoted, and what is the purpose of the Bill before us to-day? To restore, according to hon. members on the other side of the House, academic freedom to Fort Hare. That is what we asked them to retain in 1959 but which they took away, and now they tell us that they are putting it back. Then I want to go on to quote what my hon. Leader said. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">May I say at once that we on this side of the House are not taking the unusual course of opposing the Bill at this stage because we are against the establishment of separate universities for non-Europeans. I have categorically stated on more than one occasion in this House that we are not against the establishment of such universities provided they are universities and provided there is a need for them.</block>

<p>Sir, that is our position to-day and that is why we say that these matters must be discussed. There is no great urgency in this matter, and that is why we feel that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee. I want to go further. I think we appreciate in this country and in this House that the cost of education is a heavy burden, and because of the economic conditions in this country the cost of civilizing and educating our non-white people is a burden which must fall on the white South Africans who are in a position to finance that education. But, Sir, that does not mean that money must be spent extravagantly because it is being spent in the cause of education. What is the position at the moment? We are being asked now to support a Bill to establish one university for the Xhosa people&#x2014;we know that the other Bills are still coming&#x2014;when we find that the total enrolment in the university colleges at the end of 1967 was 1,305. Sir, that is not one-sixth <span class="col_2501-2502" refersTo="page_1273"/>of the number of students at one white university, and we are now faced with the proposal to create three separate universities. I accept that the Minister&#x2019;s intention is to allow these university colleges to go right up the whole scale of independence and autonomy eventually, if they are not there now, but, Sir, is it right that we should do this?</p>

<p>Let us look at the amount of money spent on these three universities. The amount of money spent in 1967-&#x2019;68 on these three university colleges totalled R3,075,158; that is both from the Bantu Education Account and from Loan Account. The cost&#x2014;and this is the average&#x2014;on Loan Account and the Education Account was R2,356 per student, for one year. And how many graduates were there? There were 114 with degrees and 100 with diplomas. Take Fort Hare alone. In 1967-&#x2019;68 there was spent on Fort Hare from the Bantu Education Account, R784,642, and from Loan Account R340,739, making a total of R1,125,381 for an enrolment of what? Four hundred and thirty-six students. Sir, are we being unrealistic, are we being unreasonable when we say that this is something in which we must not be hasty; that we must look to see how we can best discharge our responsibility to the non-white people, and that we must not be wasteful. My point is simply this: The Government has got to the stage that at this moment there are three Bantu university colleges, and this is the cost. If the hon. the Deputy Minister takes time to think over this, is it not possible&#x2014;I am not here to give the answer and that is why we feel that this matter should be investigated&#x2014;that one of these institutions can be retained as a university, in the proper sense, for the Bantu people, and that the other two might well be used to bolster and to assist and to develop the lower standards and the lower grades of education and technical education?</p>

<p>If that education is not being provided, then there is no development. 465 Matriculants cannot provide professional classes for the millions of Bantu, and until you have that matriculant class among the Bantu it is nonsense to talk about setting them on the road to separate development. I say that if the Government is sincere, that is where it should look to the development of education. We must build up a mass from whom the brighter ones can come to the top and become the leaders. It is necessary whether we have separate development leading to total separation or not, because the white population cannot for all time provide the know-how and the knowledge and the professional classes for the whole of the population. We already find that in various walks of life the non-Whites have to take more and more responsibility. They are taking over jobs which were previously done by white people. Our responsibility is to find out what are the priorities. Is the priority to say that we have created a marvellous university for the Xhosa people, when below there is a great void between Std. 2 and the matriculant? Those are the matters which make me urge hon. members opposite to consider again even at this late stage. The hon. the Deputy Minister must concede that there is no urgency about this change. There will still be five students to one member of the teaching staff, whether they are turned into universities this year, next year or the year after.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>There is surely an urgency on the road to development.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is an urgency to give attention to the development of the education of the non-white people, but not as regards putting up an edifice or an institution whereby there is a wastage of money which can better be spent in other spheres of education. I stand by what was said by my leader in 1959. Education is important, but I say to-day that there is no need to rush through legislation of this sort without a proper investigation and a proper re-assessment of the priorities within the field of nonwhite education. I believe we must do what is practicable. As I say, we do not wish on this side of the House to deny to the Bantu, who is capable of absorbing the education, real and sufficient facilities for university education. We need them. One only has to look at the health services. The Deputy Minister knows how far health planning and hospital services can go in the Transkei&#x2014;exactly nowhere, because there are fewer Bantu doctors being educated to-day than there were 10 years ago. Until we have built that infra-structure of education, we will never be able, either under the Government&#x2019;s plan of separate development or under the system of communal councils, to hand over responsibility of this nature to the Bantu. It is for that reason that I believe we need time and we should take time to consider an important matter like this; if this Bill is passed and this House agrees that there is to be a university for the Xhosa nation, then even if the wastage of money is enormous the Government will be bound to carry on and create two more universities and there will be no turning back, whatever the cost to the taxpayers. When once this Bill is accepted, there will be no turning back and the further two universities will have to be established. For those reasons I trust that the Minister, during the time that is still available to him for deliberation, will see the wisdom of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington and will see to it that this Bill goes to a Select Committee before Second Reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Here we have now once more heard the real old United Party mentality, the real old United Party arguments. When I was a young boy, I was always told that the old political tactics of their previous leader Gen. Smuts, were always to &#x201C;let things develop&#x201D;, and here we have heard it again to-day. They said, &#x201C;there is no urgency&#x201D;. And that is how it has been with every step <span class="col_2503-2504" refersTo="page_1274"/>taken by this National Government to ensure the survival of the Whites here and to give the non-Whites a rightful place in South Africa. There has always been the argument: &#x201C;There is no urgency; let things develop.&#x201D; When we had the Group Areas Act and the Physical Planning Act before the House, in order that the non-Whites might take their rightful places, and to safeguard the survival of the Whites, we heard those arguments from them. We do not know when the day will come when they will also want to see advance planning being done by means of legislation in order to make conditions safe for us here.</p>

<p>The hon. member came along with arguments that the numbers at the non-white universities did not justify it. We should now first take care of primary and secondary education, and when there are sufficient numbers, we can establish universities. What a foolish argument! Now I wonder: He probably wants the stage to be reached where we have a few thousand matriculants&#x2014;he did not say whether it should be 50,000 or 100,000&#x2014;and then provision must be made for university training. Is that what the hon. member wanted? I can understand their feelings on the Opposition side because they have never had a feeling for that which is their own. They have never had a feeling of nationalism; they have not even felt pro-South African. If one does not have that feeling, or one has no national sentiments, one cannot understand the sentiments of another population group either. Therefore, neither do they understand that feeling of pride, that self-respect, which the non-white has for himself. Neither do they want to understand that by this legislation a feeling of national pride and self-respect will be cultivated in the Bantu. I can understand their feelings, because with the introduction of the Extension of University Education Act in 1959 it was proposed and promised that the non-white colleges, which were originally to be State institutions, would gradually develop to greater independence, and eventually into fully-fledged universities. With the introduction of this Bill to afford independence for Fort Hare, we once more have proof of the sincerity of this Government in keeping its promises.</p>

<p>As the National Party has placed the various non-white groups on the road to self-determination, it is now also doing so in the field of education and higher education. Through the history of each nation there runs a golden thread of development based on the facilities which are created to develop each nation, and the need has also arisen among our non-white people. With its honest application of the policy of separate development, the National Government has kept its word and is providing for the needs of those non-Whites. I say that therefore I can understand their feelings. They realize, and they also know that the proof is there, that the policy of separate development is succeeding in all aspects. They realize that what they talk about such a lot is not an illusion, since the National Government proposed fully-fledged universities for the Bantu and it is now becoming a reality. I can understand their feelings, because this is only sour grapes for them. They are disheartened people because every day they see the policy of the National Party being carried out and succeeding and over against that they see themselves being broken down and exposed and wasting away. We can understand their feelings, because they are sourmouths (<i>bitterbekke).</i></p>

<p>I withdraw it, but I want to say they have a bitter taste in their mouths because they realize that the Whites and the non-Whites are realizing more and more that their future and their welfare lie with the policy of this Government.</p>

<p>As their chief speaker, the hon. member for Kensington ushered in this debate from their side. He is quite an old man whom I respect, and I listen to him quite gladly, but I want to tell him that he is really doing the Bantu a disservice by the mocking and ridiculing manner in which he spoke here of the institution which is the beginning of fine and great things for the Bantu. He reeled off clause after clause here without any real arguments, and throughout he was merely engaged in ridiculing this legislation. I regret that the hon. member is not here, but I want to tell him that in carrying on in that way no good relationships will be cultivated between the Whites and non-Whites in South Africa. He referred here to clauses 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, which deal with the appointment of the chancellor, the vice-chancellor, with the composition of the senate, the council and the advisory council of a university, and he even made the remark that the Minister now had a hold on this university as never before. He even made the reprehensible insinuation that the Minister of Bantu Administration was aspiring to the chancellorship of that university. I do not know who the hon. the Minister is going to appoint on that council, but I do know that who ever he is going to appoint, the appointment will be made with a view to development, not to domination.</p>

<p>Every University which has thusfar been established in South Africa has come into being as a result of certain circumstances and needs. We think of the University of Potchefstroom, where a need existed with the Dutch Reformed Church for such a university, and we think of the geographic circumstances responsible for the establishment of the University of the Free State, and of the needs of the Afrikaner which lead to the establishment of the RAU in Johannesburg. But I also know this, that each of those institutions began on a <span class="col_2505-2506" refersTo="page_1275"/>small scale, and each time the State must make laws and intervene to assist those universities. And since the Bantu community is not yet at that stage of development as to be mature enough to provide their own development, initiative and guidance, the Government is now coming along with this Bill. Here the State is now coming along as guardian of the Black man and seeing to it that an institution is established for them where they can be placed on a higher level than ever before, so that this university can begin on a much more comprehensive level than many of our own institutions. I know what I am talking about. My own son attends the Rand Afrikaans University, and I know how they made a start last year with very few facilities. But it demanded perseverance, and that is what we have in the Bantu. The need is there. If we now put a spoke in their wheel, how can we expect those universities ever to develop further. When the State begins with an institution under these circumstances, it must also guide it in the right direction. Such an institution must initially be strictly controlled. But when the time is ripe I believe that the white council and senate will no longer be necessary and that the non-whites themselves will be able to take over that council and senate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the Opposition realizes how few non-white professors and lecturers are available. That is the reason why Whites are being depended upon initially for the council and also for the senate. It is stupidity to claim that we do not find the same circumstances in any other university in South Africa. It is only because white professors and lecturers are available that the councils and senates of the white universities consist of Whites. However, I believe that as the white professors and lecturers are replaced by non-whites, the non-Whites will also gradually take over the senate. Therefore it is necessary to realize that this Bill is aimed at development, not at a poor type of institution as the Opposition wants to claim.</p>

<p>The decline in respect of numbers was spoken of disparagingly. This is again typical United Party arithmetic. One of the Opposition members who spoke recently said that there was now a total of 1,305 non-white students attending universities. I think it a very fine achievement. It is tremendous progress. Or did they want the numbers to be the same as those in respect of our white universities?</p>

<p>Complaints were made about the composition of the council, the appointment of the rector and the election of the chancellor, I now want to ask the Opposition whether they would have had any objection if the hon. the Minister appointed Mandela to that council. Would they have had any objection if Bram Fischer were to have been rector of that university? If that were the case, they would not have had objections to a State-controlled institution, where the State President or the hon. the Minister makes the appointments. They would not have had any objection if one of them had been chosen. If I now run my eye over those hon. members, I do not know whom I would choose. I do not know whether I would elect the hon. member for Transkei, Port Natal or Durban (Point). Why does the hon. member for Transkei look at me now as if he really has aspirations in that direction? Sir, that is what they want. They want institutions which they can use for political ends. They want persons there who can incite people against the Government and who will impair the good relationships between non-Whites and Whites here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then mention was also made of what it costs to run Fort Hare. I agree that it costs a great deal to run that institution. Now I want to ask him a question in connection with what it cost to get the Rand Afrikaans University going last year. Was that expenditure justified, with a view to the number of students they had initially? Or ought that project also to have been shelved? They are now silent. The need existed for the Rand Afrikaans University, just as there is a need for the non-white universities. That is why these facilities are now being created for the non-Whites. It is said that Fort Hare does not provide for all fields of study and that the full range of courses are not offered there. What a ridiculous argument! I know that there are many courses which the Rand Afrikaans University and the University of Port Elizabeth do not offer yet. I wonder if those hon. members know that some of our oldest universities in South Africa, for example the University of Gape Town, the University of Stellenbosch and the University of the Witwaterstand do not even offer courses in pharmacy. The University of the Orange Free State does not even have a course in medicine yet. Now mention is made of the fact that Fort Hare cannot offer the full range of courses. Why do hon. members not complain about the fact that the University of Gape Town does not offer a course in pharmacy, or that the University of the Orange Free State does not offer a course in medicine? Surely that is a foolish argument. But we know that in the years to come, as progress and development take place, provision will in fact be made for more courses. Or do those hon. members want provision to be made now for all fields of study? Must provision now be made at Fort Hare for a course in engineering and in medicine? Let us hear from them. They must please merely say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Do they now want courses in all fields of study? You see, Sir, now they just sit. They do not want to reply. They now have forebodings. They do not want to reply and one can never understand their method of reasoning. On the one hand they complain about the tremendous costs and on the other hand they want more courses. Then again they want to spend too much money there.</p>

The hon. member was then already a United Party member. He was already on the wrong track then. At that time he said (Hansard, vol. 100, col. 3233)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our plea is that a door should be kept open for European students who wish to study at those universities &#x2026;</block>

<p>Last year, with the student demonstrations in Johannesburg, the hon. member for Houghton was the general who commanded them there. One afternoon I went to have a look at how things were going and saw how the hon. member for Houghton walked up and down between them there. The United Party members were once more in the background and too afraid to make any comment. When the danger was passed, the hon. member for Hillbrow&#x2014;we know, do we not, that the hon member aspires to the leadership of his party&#x2014;forestalled the official leader of the United Party and said to the students that it was a good thing that they had not taken part in the procession, because it would only have caused trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by congratulating the hon. the Minister on the introduction of this Bill whereby the hon. the Minister not only gives proof of the Government&#x2019;s sincerity and good intentions, but is also creating an institution which the Bantu can be proud of. It is an institution which the Bantu can regard as their own and in which the Bantu can train individuals from their own ranks, thinkers, educationists, professional and technical people, thereby making them of service to their own community.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have been listening to this debate for a long time and the United Party has had ample time to advance valid reasons for their not wanting to support this Bill. I say &#x201C;ample time&#x201D;, particularly when I also consider the many hours taken up by hon. members on that side of the House in 1959 when the basic principle on which we are now developing this Bill, was discussed here. When we reach the end of this debate and the hon. members of the United Party have had their say, there will be a large number of hon. members on this side of the House who would have liked to have participated in this debate. However, this discussion will come to an end and then hon. members of the United Party will still not have told us exactly what the basic problem is which they have in regard to this Bill.</p>

<p>A great many grounds and arguments were advanced by the United Party in 1959, and the question with which I am faced, is whether those arguments are as valid to-day as they were in that debate. If this is the case, it is up to the United Party to come forward and debate those points. In the course of the discussion at the time the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, <i>inter alia</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is envisaged in this Bill, is the lowering of an existing university college to something which is nowhere near the concept of a university in the Western world.</block>

<p>We must remember what the hon. the Leader said on that occasion. At a later stage he also said that these universities would only be a State-controlled school for higher education of some sort or other. I want us to bear these thoughts in mind when we think of the arguments advanced by hon. members in the course of this debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula said that university apartheid would lead to a lower <span class="col_2509-2510" refersTo="page_1277"/>standard of education. Now I want to ask, Mr. Speaker, whether it was not to be expected, after all these and many other instances of suspicion-mongering amidst which the principal Act was passed and the university colleges had to be established, that they would struggle initially? After all, right from the beginning there was a deliberate attempt on the part of that side of the House to prevent these university colleges from getting into their stride.</p>

<p>In that debate, and also in this afternoon&#x2019;s debate, a great deal was said about needs. According to the Opposition it had first to be proved that there was a need for such universities or university colleges. But what is the criterion employed by hon. members opposite for determining those needs? Who has to determine these needs? The hon. member for Green Point called attention to the small number of pupils enrolled at these schools. Other members called attention to the small numbers of students enrolled at university colleges, and the hon. member for Green Point also asked, &#x201C;What is the hurry with such a university?&#x201D; The hurry with this is that we have to make up a backlog which was created by the United Party before 1948. [Interjections.] Yes, you are told this repeatedly and it hurts. Now, 21 years later, they are prepared to remain where they were in 1948, i.e. to say that there is no need for such a university as there are too few matriculated non-Whites.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. MCLACHLAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can make his speech on his own time. A number of direct questions have already been put to the hon. member for Transkei. My argument is that hon. members opposite want to make us believe that there is no gravity in regard to this matter. When we look at the numbers by which the students at those colleges have already increased, I want to ask those hon. members whether they do not think that this is a good start. The non-Whites of the various ethnic groups must eventually be given those people who will be able to lead them when they eventually need leaders. Mention is made here of border area development and everything that is coupled with it. Where are the qualified and academically-equipped people to come from to lead the non-white groups, and here the Bantu in particular, if the hon. member for Green Point contents himself with his claim that there is no hurry with it? What is involved here, is also the quality and content of the courses. The hon. member for Orange Grove made a speech here in 1959&#x2014;I was not in the House at the time, but I can imagine how he flung his arms about when he asked for this&#x2014;about the content of the courses, what was to be taught and what was not to be taught. In this debate we have not heard a single remark from one single hon. member opposite in regard to the content of these courses. Not one of them told us that there was something in one of those courses which ought not to be taught. The hon. member for Houghton was the only one to refer to the content of courses, but I assume that she did not speak on behalf of the United Party. She asked that something should at least be taught in regard to &#x201C;race relations&#x201D;. We know what she thinks and we can understand it, but the United Party did not tell us what they considered was actually lacking in the courses that are offered.</p>

<p>We see that these university colleges have grown consistently. We know that this growth is not rapid, for there are few matriculants. The idea that they have to look after themselves, that they also have to sacrifice their own people to study and consequently to be able to carry out specific functions and to be academically qualified, should steadily be fostered amongst the non-Whites, amongst the Bantu in particular. We are also engaged in this process. Those hon. members say that there is no hurry with it. What could we expect from the other side of the House? At that time they did not only mention the nine points which the hon. member for Kensington held before us a few days ago. The hon. member for Kensington mentioned to us nine points which were taken from the minority report at the time, but he neglected to mention to us all the points which hon. members opposite, of whom some are still left, mentioned to this House as reasons why this whole matter was doomed to failure. Not one of those points was brought to our notice, and nobody pointed out to us the nature of the failures which would, allegedly, already have been apparent at these university colleges. It is not the function of the National Party or of the Government to emphasize these successes that have been achieved. We spell success with one word and that is with this Bill which is before this House at the moment. To us this is proof of the faith we have in this university college and of the successes we have already achieved there. Mr. Speaker, we expect the United Party to furnish us with a reply in regard to each of these aspects, but this is not being done. I should like to ask them whether they are prepared at least to give us this undertaking that they will rectify these aspects if they should come into power&#x2014;I do not know when that would be. I am aware that in respect of certain other matters the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that there were things which one simply could not throw into reverse gear. But, after all, they think that they are going to come into power soon; let us challenge them by saying, &#x201C;Suppose you do come into power very soon&#x2014;let us assume that this would be within the next 80 years&#x2014;would you send these non-white students back to white universities? Would you do that?&#x201D; Apparently they prefer not to listen; they are doing what they usually do when the hon. member for Umlazi speaks, for they do not like listening to him either. They turn their backs on him.</p>

<p><span class="col_2511-2512" refersTo="page_1278"/>The main emphasis in the speech made by the hon. member for Kensington was placed on the idea of the ineffectiveness of the control, the organization and the constitution of this university college. The hon. member concentrated on the question of the autonomous power of the university councils, the advisory councils, and so forth. Because the Government must accept the sole responsibility for making something of the non-Whites, I must tell the hon. Opposition that we do not intend applying methods here which will afford the Opposition the opportunity of misappropriating the money which is being made available by the Government for this development. It is the Government&#x2019;s intention to implement separate development. Since the development of these university colleges forms part of that policy, we are not ashamed to admit this. The hon. members opposite are afraid to admit openly here that they do not want integration, or they are afraid to admit that here at an inopportune moment. Perhaps they are also afraid to admit that they are also accepting a measure of separate development now, because, as you see Mr. Speaker, they will soon have to use these standpoints at elections again, as they did at Newcastle recently. They do not know exactly what to say at the moment, and that is why they are trying to divert attention from it. They are speaking here about organization and administration, about academic freedom and about the curricula which will allegedly be upset because there will not be sufficient autonomy in the hands of the university council and the advisory council of the university. I should like to put this question to the hon. members opposite: What would they like this university council, as it is to be constituted in terms of this Act, to do which it cannot do in terms of this proposal as it is embodied in legislation? Do they propose to change curricula? Does the U.P. propose to effect deliberate changes in regard to the staff and all sorts of other aspects and so to hamper the entire development of these independent universities? Or do they, by doing that, merely want to create the impression that they have achieved a slight breakthrough into the policy of the Government? No, Mr. Speaker, I think the United Party is merely using this legislation to play a game. They dare not say anything, for they do not know what the repercussions would be in regard to another matter.</p>

<p>What does the Government envisage with this development of independent universities? We are definitely not afraid to say that the Government believes that these universities must produce people who will be able to benefit and be of use to the ethnic community or the group whose interests they must serve. The product of the university must fertilize and enrich that community. What we envisage, is not that the product of that university should come to white areas in order to bear some sort of fruit here. We want this to happen in their own area. That is why we believe that the university will have to develop in accordance with modern requirements so as to serve that community. As we see the matter, the university must become a cultural centre for the people in that particular community in which it is situated. Because we put it this way and because we are honest enough to say it and to admit it, the United Party finds it difficult to accept it, as these things which we are advocating are not conducive to integration, and this is the policy of the United Party. If the United Party&#x2019;s policy were implemented, we would be allowing them, by means of this method by which they would do it, to drive in the thin end of the wedge as far as integration is concerned. The National Party has no intention whatever of affording them that opportunity. When we vote funds for the development of these universities, we are responsible to the electorate. The idea expressed by the hon. member for Green Point, i.e. that we are wasting money since the time is not ripe, does not deter us at all; nor does it deter the electorate outside.</p>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington, i.e. to refer this matter to a Select Committee, is nothing but an attempt to gain a little time for themselves. They hope that at a later stage they shall once again be able to debate this matter. They want to gain time because at this stage they have nothing more to say in this regard. If I think of what the hon. member for Green Point in particular had to say in this regard, I want to tell the United Party that we, the Government, seriously doubt whether they are really in earnest about equipping the Bantu academically. Is your real concern the fact that a university may develop which will perhaps not attain the standard of an Oxford, a Stellenbosch or a Wits? Or are you perhaps concerned about the fact that the effect of this university will hamper your integration policy?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>You see, Sir, there we have a Deputy Minister agreeing with him. He echoes these words. The hon. member for Green Point wanted to know why this hurry, why cannot we have a select committee, why cannot we in fact examine this matter properly, why cannot we examine it with thoughts a little more sober and a little nearer than the ground than the thoughts expressed by hon. members on that side of the House. The answer of the hon. member for Westdene was that &#x201C;we have to make up the leeway&#x201D;. But there are ways in which we can make up the leeway and there are ways in which we should not make up that leeway. The way this Government <span class="col_2513-2514" refersTo="page_1279"/>in this Bill proposes to make up the leeway is just to say suddenly that this is now a university&#x2014;and then we have made up the leeway. You pass a law, you call the institution concerned a university so that by force of law it is called a university, therefore you have made up the leeway, it is now a university Q.E.D.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I believe it, I would not say this if I did not believe it. First of all there is the admission that there is a leeway. The hon. member for Berea gave us the figures as to the number of Bantu who go to school and matriculate. The hon. member for Green Point mentioned this again. .1 per cent of those who go to school matriculate. Then you have the situation that there are so few of them there that you have a ratio of teachers at Fort Hare of 4.15 to one student, at the University College of the North the ratio is 6.8 to one, and in Zululand 4.7 to one. This emphasizes the very point that has been made by hon. members on this side, and that is to say: Why is there all this hurry if that is all you have to deal with at this stage? Surely there are better ways of dealing with a situation like this, but this is absolutely typical of the Government. The hon. member said I do not believe what I said, but let me tell him I do. In the time that I have been here, I have seen more often than not the Government try to resolve its difficulties by giving something a name. Call a place a university and then it is a university, call people citizens and then they are citizens, call places homelands and then they are homelands. This is the whole process, this is what they always do, but this resolves absolutely nothing at all.</p>

Of course not, and had he listened to his colleagues he would have heard all the various things they said about why they have not given it full status. Then he talks about academic freedom. What do these hon. gentlemen know about academic freedom? Look at their history, look at the history of the Government in relation to academic freedom. What academic freedom is there than can be envisaged or allowed by this Government that is not this Government&#x2019;s concept of what your particular education should be. Do you remember the Education Act, Sir? The provinces could not be trusted with our education, only this Government. Only in the hands of the Executive responsible to this House could this ever be done. [Interjections.] All right, let me then ask the hon. member, if there is really this sort of freedom, how this council will exercise its powers under this Bill. The hon. member said the council in this Bill will have the same powers as a council that he might want to propose. That is true. But how will they exercise those powers? What sort of thoughts will they have, and how enlightened or otherwise are they going to be?

<p>That is most interesting. What does this Bill in effect do? It removes from every Bantu student when all three Bills have been passed under the umbrella, the protection, and the academic cohesion of the University of South Africa. That is what it does. It removes that from them. Why do the Bills remove that from them? When we are dealing with higher education then we are dealing with higher education, and the more association you can have with other institutions of higher education, then the better is your higher education. Now the umbrella is being removed and they are being cut adrift. Worse than being cut adrift is the fact that each one of these universities is going to be in the hands in the end of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>Now, what is the best thing: To be under the umbrella of the University of South Africa, to be associated with white universities, or to be under the thumb of the Minister and have him determine what should be done, because he in fact is going to nominate the whole council.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<block name="quote">Whether exports to or imports from Communist China are permitted; if so, what was the value of such exports and/or imports during each of the last five years.</block>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#raw">

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<block name="quote">The import permits issued to importers do not stipulate the countries from which the goods should be imported. Importers are left completely free to decide for themselves from which countries they would like to purchase the authorized imports, and it is not the Government&#x2019;s policy to interfere with this choice of the importers. If, therefore, importers wish to use their valid import permits for the importation of goods from Communist countries it is entirely their business.</block>

<block name="quote">As far as exports are concerned it is likewise the Government&#x2019;s policy to leave exporters free to decide for themselves in which countries they would like to sell the goods which they have available for export. The Government places no restrictions on the freedom of exporters to export their goods to any country of their own choice, except that the export from the Republic of strategic goods and materials is being controlled.</block>

<block name="quote">The policy followed by the Government in regard to the Republic&#x2019;s import and export trade is closely related to its basic principle in terms of which it is strongly opposed to all forms of trade boycotts regardless of the purposes for which such boycotts are being applied.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I would like to inform the House with what business the House will be occupied next week. On Monday the Third-Reading debate on the Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill will be completed. Thereafter the House will continue with the University of Fort Hare Bill. Then all the University Bills will be taken. On Wednesday the Post Office Budget will be introduced and this debate will occupy the House on Wednesday and Thursday. As I explained when I introduced the motion in regard to the times allocated to the different Appropriation Bills at the beginning of the Session, debate will commence immediately after the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech. Thereafter we will continue with the University Bills until Friday, and on Friday private members&#x2019; motions will come on immediately after questions to enable members to attend the State President&#x2019;s garden party in the afternoon. I will probably adjourn the House at about 3.30 p.m. to enable members to attend the garden party.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister for understanding the circumstances which made it impossible for me to be here when he replied to the Second-Reading debate. As a result the hon. the Minister will have the last word, but nevertheless, I am going to stick my neck out without having had a reply to the various points which I raised during the Second Reading.</p>

<p>I want to continue with examples of the problems which I believe are leading to discontent in the South African Railways. We have had a debate spreading over the week, in which the crux of the issue has been whether the railway personnel are being overworked and are being asked to do more than it is possible for them to do. We have had criticisms of the budgeting. We leave that to the figures to answer and we will see how the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s guesstimates for this year are going to work out. One reply which I had from the hon. the Minister yesterday in regard to Airways indicated that he does not seem to pay much attention to figures but I do not, at <span class="col_2551-2552" refersTo="page_1298"/>this stage, intend to follow it up, other than to say that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply did not balance with the facts as set out in the Estimates of Expenditure. I will be interested to see next year how he is going to fly some four or five new aeroplanes without getting additional staff. He hid behind an increase of 75 first officers last year. Incidentally, it was not in the document to which he referred, but in the Estimates themselves. Either these people are idle at the moment or he is going to be short when the new aeroplanes come. I put it to the hon. the Minister that he is going to be short and we will see what the facts are going to be.</p>

<p>I want to return to the question of discontent among the railway personnel. The hon. the Minister asked me to give him two names of cases I quoted of persons who were fined. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I have taken steps to ask permission to use those names. They were given to me in confidence, but I have taken the necessary steps to have these people approached personally, and I hope that I will be able to get that permission. I can tell him, however, that the persons concerned are in Glencoe, that I visited them personally and that it is just a question of getting their authority to use their names. There is a fear amongst railwaymen and all Government servants of giving information and I believe it is a tragic state of affairs that, in a democratic country, there should be this fear of victimization. The hon. the Minister gives assurances. I accept those assurances, but I want to say that they are valueless because it is not the hon. the Minister who victimizes people, it is not the Minister who transfers people. It is not the Minister who does not promote people, but the fact is that these people are not promoted because they are not efficient or, for some other reason they are not considered suitable. These are grounds which cannot be disproved or argued about, but there is no doubt that there is this fear. It is a fact, and I hope that the hon. the Minister, in his reply, will make it quite clear that where there is something wrong, and where persons have that knowledge and they give it to Members of Parliament there will be no victimization at any level and that he will see to it that nobody gets posted to the &#x201C;gramadoelas&#x201D; or in any way suffers as a result of giving information. What I am going to do is to give the hon. the Minister three names, which have come to me from another source, of persons who are alleged to have been fined for refusing to work overtime after the expiry of their maximum period of 12 hours work, after which they are entitled to ask for a break. In other words, after having worked overtime up to 12 hours they were asked to continue but refused. I have three names here of persons who are alleged to have been fined, two of them R15 and the other R12, for refusing to continue to work and for demanding their compulsory relief at the end of the 12 hours. These names I will send across to the hon. the Minister and I hope he will have the cases investigated. I assume that they work in the Cape Province, but he will be able to check from their full initials and names. Those names have come to me through a source of general knowledge and that is the information given to me. The other two cases I mentioned of persons fined for being late were personally interviewed by me, as was the case with all the other cases that I mentioned during the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Klip River will probably be able to tell the hon. the Minister that this dissatisfaction has reached the stage that in the predominantly railway centre of Glencoe over 600 railwaymen and their families refused to vote in the by-election last month.</p>

<p>I state this as a fact to indicate the dissatisfaction. The hon. member for Klip River, the new Leader of the Nationalist Party in Natal, is as worried about it as the rest of his party. This was the reaction to the dissatisfaction. Why, in an area which always has a high percentage of voting and in a basically Railway area, was there such a high figure of abstentions?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am trying to think of the name of the man who always used to break up our meetings in Glencoe. In any event, the hon. member for Klip River will know him. This person was a specialist in breaking up United Party meetings, but his father voted for the United Party. That family was a wild Nationalist family and they were well known. The hon. member knows perfectly well that this is true. I do not want to waste more time on this and I want to come back to the hard facts of the discontent. I will give the hon. the Minister those three names, and I have here as well the original document in regard to an infringement of discipline dated 22nd August, 1968, which is a charge against a person for refusing at 4.30 a.m. to accept an instruction to continue work. The fine was R5. This is the original document of the case, as the hon. the Minister will recognize. I have seen others, <span class="col_2553-2554" refersTo="page_1299"/>which I do not have in my possession, of a similar nature. Regarding this document the person said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek kon nou van verlof af en ek sien dat die aanklagvorms reeds die 25ste moes in gewees het, maar hier is myne. Ek het egter besluit om die saak maar so te laat.</block>

<p>This is the attitude, namely &#x201C;what is the use of fighting?&#x201D; I want to ask the hon. the Minister why it is that we get this information and whether he does not receive such information from his unions. Are his unions absolutely satisfied? The hon. the Minister keeps quiet. I submit that the hon. the Minister has had complaints from these organizations. He indicated that he had had no complaints and that the unions were perfectly satisfied and had not complained. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that this is not so. I have here the minutes of various meetings which have been held by the South African Footplate Staff Association.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the staff concerned and the very people who work this overtime. I have here the &#x201C;opsomming van die jaarlikse samespreking tussen die Minister en die SuidAfrikaanse Voetplaatpersoneelvereniging&#x201D; of 28th June, 1968. Here the hon. the Minister accepts that this is wrong and he agreed that nobody should be forced to work overtime over the maximum period of 12 hours. He said that no one must be forced to work overtime, but they must only be asked nicely to do it. This report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Minister het onderneem om die Bestuur opdrag te gee om instruksies uit te reik dat aansoeke om aflos met die grootste takt behandel moet word.

<p>There is nothing wrong with this, but the hon. the Minister has said here that no excessive overtime is worked. Here he said that he is not going to force people to work excessive overtime but they will be gently persuaded to work longer than 12 hours. I challenge the Minister to deny that there have been convictions since the 28th June. The case I had was the 27th August, subsequent to this date. I have here the minutes of discussions which took place and it says&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, but the Minister has replied to the allegations that there was dissatisfaction. The Minister said there was not wide-spread dissatisfaction. By way of interjection and in direct reply to the hon. member for Yeoville the Minister said there is no forced excessive overtime.</p>

<p>I know what the reply was. I heard the Minister interjecting that there was no excessive overtime, that overtime was not excessive.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>No, I said it is not a general practice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But the Association says &#x201C;daagliks&#x201D;. If &#x201C;daily&#x201D; is not a general practice, then what is? Hourly? His own association says there are daily demands for overtime over the maximum of 12 hours when staff ask for their compulsory rest period.</p>

<p>I want to bring another case of dissatisfaction. I have here the full record of an approach made to the Minister on behalf of assistant foremen, works foremen, and chargemen, Group A of Salstaff. On the 22.3.1968 the first approach was made to the Minister and on the 27.8.1968 the Minister indicated that there seemed justification for their complaint. Only on 26.2.1969 did they get a final answer when they started sending telegrams and asking for deputations to see the Minister. It took them a full year to get a reply, and what was the reply? &#x201C;No&#x201D;. Their representations were turned down. The case is they are supervisors over people who are earning more than they are; the supervisor is being paid less than the man he is supervising. The Minister says he is not going to accept their recommendations because it will cost R&#x00BE; million. I have all the facts here and the Minister knows they are correct. I have given the dates. Why did it take a whole year for the Minister to make up his mind? I have a telegram here indicating that in August <span class="col_2555-2556" refersTo="page_1300"/>the Minister accepted in principle what was asked. The telegram reads: &#x201C;Meeting Minister August 26th, Minister acknowledges anomaly in salaries, has instructed General Manager to investigate&#x2014;expect early decision.&#x201D; This was on 27.8.1968. It talks of an &#x201C;early decision&#x201D;, and the &#x201C;early decision&#x201D; was given on 26.2.1969 when pressure was applied.</p>

<p>I have here a petition to which I referred dated 16th January over the same problem, namely people will not accept supervisory acting positions because it means a drop in pay. How are you going to get proper control if your supervisory staff are dissatisfied. They are discontented to the point that I forecast that this issue will still go to arbitration. I forecast that this discontent has not ended with the Minister&#x2019;s refusal. This is going on all the time. The Minister says there is no dissatisfaction. I have a letter here dated 11.3.1969. What it says may not be true, I do not know. The letter deals with a person who was killed in an accident on duty. I quote from the letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die wyse van sy dood is aan ons onbekend. Ons weet net dat hy gestook het en uit die bewegende trein by die Tweelingsbruggies naby Mtubatuba geval het. Hierdie man was ooreis, ja, oorwerk, hy is nou dood.</block>

<p>That is from a member of the family. It may not be correct but it is what the family feels is the position; it is what the relatives believe is the position; they believe that he was overworked, that too much demand was placed on him, and he fell off the footplate whilst stoking. That is not the end of this story. This person died on a Saturday. The family asked that after the autopsy the body be sent back by road to the family home in George where he had joined the Railways. The Administration refused; they said it had to go by train. There were only two trains a week which meant it would be ten days before the funeral could be held. The family then approached the Railways, the Railways offered R150 towards the cost of transporting the body by road, and the family had the body brought by road which cost them R315. When they went to the Railways they got R100.60 instead of R150, as promised. If in the Police or the Army, for instance, a person is killed on duty, that department goes to endless trouble to get the parents up immediately by any quick means of transport and to fly the body home for burial. It happens in the Police, it happens in the Army, but when it happens to a railwayman, why should the family be treated in this way? One of the parents had a series of heart attacks as a result of the whole business of trying to get the body home. I will give the hon. the Minister this letter when I have had a copy made of it; I only received it yesterday afternoon. This is the sort of thing which is going on.</p>

<p>I have another letter received yesterday in connection with intermittent casual tally clerks. I have raised this year after year with the Minister and I really feel the time has come for something to be done for this group who earn R5 per day, which is 62c per hour on a 48-hour week. In many respects these men are carrying the work of the department. They are not really intermittent casuals; they are regulars, but they are classified as intermittent casuals. The Minister has tried to get full-time people but it has not worked. The people he obtained were just not suitable, so he relies on this group of identifiable regular workers. All I have asked the Minister is that those who have worked say for five years in that job, who are in practice regular workers, should get some share of the Railway increases that have been given. Casual clerks have been given an increase. It is a small one, R12.50 this year and R12.50 next year. This group of intermittent casual tally clerks are acting in numerous responsible positions, for instance, on the Durban market they act as checkers. They are doing a job which would normally require a higher pay. I have asked that they either be paid acting in grade pay or that they be given some basic increase in their salaries. I hope that after all these years the Minister will in fact now do something about this small group of people.</p>

<p>There is one way to test the situation and that is the way I suggested during the Second Reading debate, namely the appointment of an impartial commission of inquiry to establish the extent of the dissatisfaction, to establish just how far it has gone, so that the Minister does not have inquiries such as the one for Airways ground staff which is on the go at the moment, so that the Minister does not have to have arbitration with all the dissatisfaction that it causes, and so that we do not have a year of negotiations before we get an answer to a straightforward and reasonable request. These are all things which cannot lead to efficiency in the Railway service. They cannot lead to efficiency when people are dissatisfied, when your whole supervisory staff is dissatisfied. Let me say this in passing. I did not get these documents from members of the executives of these associations. They have come to me through contacts and I want to make it clear that no member of the executive of either of the associations was concerned in disclosing any information to me or giving me these documents. It came from another source altogether, so I hope there will be no witchhunt in this connection.</p>

<p>Well, when I used information a couple of years ago, you should have seen the witch-hunt which went on to try and find out who had given me that information. You should have heard of the witch-hunt, Mr. Speaker, and that is why I am making this point now, to avoid a witch-hunt amongst the executive. Some of these people do resign from the service, some of them do die and leave documents to their estates, and some of them do show documents to other members of the Railways personnel. They also do discuss these matters amongst themselves. That is why when I have a document like this I make it clear I got it perfectly legitimately but not from a member of the executive.</p>

<p>I come back to the point that what we ask for is an impartial investigation. It is high time that we were able to get this clear once and for all so we can get our railwaymen working in the spirit in which so many of them do, the spirit of dedication to the service. Many of them are dedicated workers. Even those who are to-day dissatisfied are on the whole dedicated workers who, despite the dissatisfaction, are going on making tremendous sacrifices. Men with 20 and 30 years service, men who have helped to build the Railways are carrying on, and despite their discontent they are working long and we say excessive hours. They are giving everything they have got, they are sacrificing their home life, they are sacrificing their time with their children and with their family. They are working but they are working with discontent. There is a grumbling background to this work and we want to avoid the breaking point that will surely come when their dedication is extinguished by their discontent.</p>

<p>I trust I have said enough to prove the statement I made during the Second Reading debate, that there is in fact a wide field in the Railways in which there is dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Point) wants to imply that there is a great deal of unrest among the workers on the South African Railways. I have the privilege of representing one of the largest railway constituencies in the Peninsula and I cannot imagine a constituency which is easier to represent in this House. In the past three years I have not had a single complaint, from that large railway population, in which any man has stated that he is expected to work an excessive amount of overtime. A few days ago, when the hon. member for Durban (Point) made his Second Reading Speech, he had a folder which was at least 7&#x00BD;inches thick, and all that he could extract from that this morning were three cases, which did not even come from Natal but, as he claims, from the Peninsula, from people who claim that it is expected of them to work excessive overtime. The best test to which one can subject the Minister&#x2019;s record and this Estimate, is to listen to the comments of the railwaymen themselves, the railwaymen as individuals and in their collective capacity in the trade unions. Immediately after the Minister delivered this year&#x2019;s Estimates, I had the privilege of drinking coffee in the coffee-room of this building with various trade union people. Their one and only opinion of the Estimates was one of praise. Their attitude was that the name of Ben Schoeman would one day be inscribed in gold letters in the annals of the history of the South African Railways. I now want to extend an invitation to the hon. member for Durban (Point), in fact to any hon. member on that side of the House to come and address a meeting in my constituency when an election takes place again. I want them to come along and do sc in order to be able to determine what the reaction of the railway worker here in the Cape Peninsula is. This invitation is valid for the next three years. The Minister has now already introduced his fifteenth Budget here and for the first time it now enters the billionaire class Therefore one could have expected the United Party to have seized upon this as a milestone in the history of the South African Railways and to have come to light with new ideas and positive criticism. One would have expected them to have tried to indicate the lines along which the S.A. Railways, in their opinion, ought to develop in the future, in order to meet the requirements which are now being made of it. But they have failed in that duty as an Opposition on so great occasion as this.</p>

<p>In December of last year Dr. Kuschke of the I.D.C. made an interesting speech before the Federated Chambers of Industries in Johannesburg. On that occasion he tried to predetermine what the role of industry in the next 30 years would be. On the basis of a relatively low estimate of the population increase, he <span class="col_2559-2560" refersTo="page_1302"/>calculated that the population in South Africa by the end of the present century could be 37 million people. The Statistics Office calculated, on the basis of a slightly higher rate of increase, that there could be 42 million people in South Africa by the end of the century. I think that we can accept with reasonable certainty that by the end of the century there will be about 40 million people in South Africa. In addition Dr. Kuschke indicated that the volume of our gross domestic product over the next 30 years would increase from R9,000 million at present to R50,000 million&#x2014;at a growth rate of 5.2 per cent. If we accept a growth rate of 5.7 per cent, we may expect the gross domestic product to increase to R58,000 million. Against this background he indicated to the industrialists of South Africa what may be expected of them. At the end of this century, so he informed them, the contribution of the manufacturing sector of our economy will have to be R21,000 million&#x2014;in other words, six to seven times more has to be produced than is the case to-day. This means that the manufacturing industry alone will have to produce double the volume of the present national domestic product. In addition it will mean that at the end of the century they will not have to supply work to only 1.3 million people, but to about 4 million. He added that if gold has played out its part as an earner of foreign exchange by the end of this century, the mining sector will by that time only be producing 2.5 per cent of our national income and agriculture 8.5 per cent, as against 36 per cent by the industries, i.e. the manufacturing sector.</p>

<p>Against this background we must now ask, where must the future growth points be? Where must the manufacturing sector establish itself? And what must the role of transportation be, in this framework in particular? It goes without saying that, in the first place, there is going to be a tremendous increase in production. Equally important is the fact that we shall have to adjust ourselves to exporting. Because gold will no longer be able to play its part as an earner of foreign exchange this will have to be taken over by our manufacturing sector. During 1967 industries exported goods to the value of R690 million. This is equal to about 34 per cent of their total production. It is expected that this figure will in the course of time be increased to R2,000 million. This means of necessity that our industries will have to become more and more export conscious.</p>

<p>If we now look around at places where such industries may possibly be established, it becomes clear to us that the tremendous concentration of manufacturing industries in the Southern Transvaal&#x2014;in 1962 that area supplied about 45 per cent of our country&#x2019;s factory production as against 15.4 per cent by the Western Cape and 15.4 per cent by Durban-Pinetown&#x2014;leads us to only one conclusion, i.e. that we cannot allow the concentration of industries in the Southern Transvaal to maintain their influence as a factor up to the end of the century. It goes without saying that there must be extensive development in the interior, in the field of industry as well. But if our industries want to serve their rightful purpose, they will have to establish themselves to a greater extent in our coastal areas. My plea to the Minister and his Planning Council is to have a look at the establishment of our manufacturing sector over a long period and, to determine on that basis what the role of the S.A. Railways must be in allowing decentralization of our manufacturing industry to take place in such a way that additional large coastal cities can develop. Mr. Speaker, I am at present not speaking as someone who comes from the Cape, but of someone who wants to sketch the picture in its entirety. The Cape covers about 80 per cent of the coastal area of the Republic. There are still places where large harbour cities can develop in the future. Places which have been named in this connection in the past are places such as Boegoeberg Bay, Saldanha Bay and Mossel Bay. However I believe that it was right to establish a large new harbour at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. I believe that it is right for the Government to have decided to develop this area to accomodate 800,000 people eventually. Only by indicating in advance the direction in which an area is going to develop will the industrialist know where he stands. When he has to risk his capital, his future and his reputation, he wants to know what South Africa&#x2019;s future plans are. Therefore I think that we must not contemplate decentralization to a number of places in South Africa; we must rather think in terms of decentralization to a few very well chosen places. Because industry will have to become more and more export conscious in the future, I believe that the emphasis will to a very large extent have to fall on the development of new coastal cities. Mr. Speaker, I underline the words &#x201C;coastal cities&#x201D;, because coastal towns will have no attraction for the industrialist. Taking the idea further that it is difficult for the industrialist to establish himself in the interior of South Africa because he will then immediately have to compete with the industries in the large market of the Southern Transvaal, I think we can give new hope to those who are prepared to establish industries if we tell them: Here in South Africa we are planning at least two or three additional large coastal cities over the next 30 years.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make the statement here that industrialists who want to establish themselves in such coastal cities, will have not only the markets in their own vicinity, but that we shall then have a series of large cities along the coasts of Southern Africa, from Luanda on the west to Beira on the east. If we further extend our coastal shipping, which is at present flourishing, and if the South African Railways is prepared to accept the idea that the doors are not closed to the development of further harbours, because these coastal cities must of necessity be based on the development of further harbours, I believe that such a pattern of decentralization, which we are advocating and in connection with which Dr. Kuschke made an appeal to the industrialists of South Africa, will in fact be possible. We want to congratulate the hon. the Minister in having the Railways keep pace with the development of South Africa over the past 15 years. Since the Railways is now exceeding the billion notch mark in its Estimates, we want to congratulate the Railways Administration for having always administered the South African Railways on commercial principles. However, I think that in the future we must not lose sight of the fact that section 103 (1) of the Constitution provides not only that the Railways must be administered on business principles, but also that due regard must be had to inland development in the fields of agriculture and industry in all the provinces. I do not expect a reply from the hon. the Minister to-day. I am only asking that, since he and the Railway Administration have entered a new phase, they should give attention to this idea.</p>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>In commencing I just want to mention that in the Postmasburg area of my constituency I have only 480 white Railway workers. I also have quite a few Railway people in the remainder of my constituency and I want to thank the hon. the Minister most sincerely and express my appreciation for the allowances granted to the Railway officials. Throughout the years the Railway people have enjoyed the privilege of having opportunities for promotion, financial assistance and periodic increases in salary. One thinks of those Railway people who have devoted their lives to the service of the Railways, the surviving members of whose families today have the privilege of being well cared for. Sir, no Railway man has the chance to become a millionaire, but by thrift and good judgment all our Railway pensioners are to-day in a position to live reasonably well. I am convinced that almost 100 per cent of them are to-day so independent that they are the most fortunate people in the Republic of South Africa. They are in this fortunate position because each of them, in my constituency as well, has lived so thriftily that to-day they have their own houses with their own small vegetable gardens. The families of these Railway people are all happy. It always strikes one in visiting the houses of Railway people how happy the family is, and the question arises as to why this should be so. The people do not have the prospect of one day being millionaires or of becoming very wealthy, but in the Railways Department there is so much security and certainty for them to-day that you can read the happiness on the faces of Railway families. The whole atmosphere in the home indicates that these people are happy and that their future is assured. The Railwayman to-day regards himself as a share-holder in the undertaking in which he is employed. If there are profits, he shares in them and his progress is assured. Mr. Speaker, the United Party Opposition has also ruled in South Africa, has it not; it is not only the National Party that has ruled the country. The United Party also had the privilege of doing something for the Railwayman when it was in power, if it had wanted to. But I do not believe that they made use of that opportunity because during those years they had so many supporters that they never thought that they would one day need a Railwayman&#x2019;s vote. But now that they are in the Opposition benches they are trying everything possible to gain the support of the Railwayman. During the war years National Party candidates were elected with large majorities in constituencies such as De Aar and Kimberley. The reason why our candidates were elected with large majorities was not only because they were good Railway representatives but because the Railwaymen saw a good future for themselves under a National Party Government. I still remember how United Party supporters ascribed these large majorities to the fact that many of the constituents were Railwaymen&#x2014;&#x201C;a lot of old Railway people&#x201D; as they described them&#x2014;but to-day they are the important people as far as the United Party is concerned. Sir, both Parties have had the privilege of ruling the country and both have records which we may consult. It does not surprise me that to-day the Opposition wants to play the part here of championing the Railwayman, because they need his vote. In this debate they had a great deal to say about overtime and the manpower shortage on the Railways. But what are they themselves doing in this House? I sat here this morning and listened to the answers to questions put by Opposition members. Sir, I want to claim that they were questions without actual content; they were a lot of unnecessary questions unnecessarily taking up the time of this House and wasting hours and days of Railways officials&#x2019; time. They must work hard and they must work overtime to answer these questions. Does this not aggravate the manpower shortage if the officials&#x2019; time is wasted by unnecessary questions?</p>

<p>I am speaking about the manpower shortage on the Railways. The Opposition does not make the task of the Railway officials easier; they are making it more difficult. I want to ask the Opposition: What place did the Railwayman occupy in the community during their period of office? The Railwayman was not even noticed during those years; no one knew him. To-day, by quoting a few letters here from Railwaymen, they are trying to create the impression that they are supported by Railwaymen, and I often wonder whether they did not perhaps ask the people to write the letters to them. Sir, I am inundated by letters in which Railwaymen express their appreciation towards the Minister for what is being done for them. The sun is shining for the Railway worker under the National Party Government; the National Party Government ensures the Railwayman&#x2019;s future. But we took cognisance of the Railwayman from the first and we shall still do so in the years ahead. The Railway people are our people and they shall remain our people. We know their needs. When individual Railwaymen have problems, the Minister is prepared to listen to each of them and to try to solve their problems, and to accommodate each of them. The Railwaymen know that they have a Minister whose ear and whose heart are attuned to them, and who is prepared to sacrifice himself in their interests because they are doing a great job of work in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Sea Point laid a charge here the other night which cannot go unanswered. He mentioned certain farming representatives on this side by name and asked where they were and why they were not stepping into the breach for the farmer in the Railway debate. I want to tell the hon. member where he can look for the farmers on this side. He can look for them in this House and in the offices of all departments where the interests of the farmers are pleaded for and dealt with. He can go and look for them at the meetings of the agricultural group, where we gather every day to promote the farmers&#x2019; interests. He can look for them everywhere where the farmers&#x2019; problems are submitted to the authorities. We know that under present circumstances there is no person who does not have problems. He can look for them in all places where the farmers&#x2019; interests are being promoted, in Parliament and elsewhere, but he need not look for them in places where they do not belong.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>In the Second-Reading debate I spoke on the <i>Pretoria</i> disaster, and I want to say that I did so only after giving the matter a great deal of thought. I did not do so irresponsibly, as the Minister accused me. I realized that it could possibly give pain to a great number of people, but I felt that it was my duty to bring to the notice of this House and particularly of the hon. the Minister, the fact that there was a defect in the system which he employed in choosing the teams to fly these machines. I came to this conclusion after a most careful study of the report of the committee of inquiry, and, with the sole exception of my reference to pills, I did not, in arriving at my conclusions, make use of one item which was not contained in that report and known in his offices prior to the flight. All the items are there and the conclusions which people may arrive at may be different from mine, but I think a careful study will show, at least, that I have good grounds for the statement I made, namely that there was either incompetence or negligence on the part of the higher officials of S.A. Airways. I had looked at the instrument panel of the Boeing and I also discussed the matter with a South African Airways pilot before I spoke. I discussed it with my colleague, the hon. member for Albany, and I read the latest publication of the <i>S.A. Pilot,</i> the journal of the S.A. Airways pilots, not the defence journal. I omitted some of the evidence which was not available to that officer, although it was elicited later by the Committee. I omitted, for instance, the remarks of a senior pilot who had known Captain Smith. I came to the conclusion, and I think the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s officials should also have come to the conclusion, that the inquiry ceased to investigate anything beyond the actual actions of the two pilots who flew this plane outthey did not try in any way to find an explanation of how it was that two highly experienced flying officers both&#x2014;that is what they say&#x2014;failed to be on the <i>qui vive,</i> failed to monitor their instruments&#x2014;that is what they say&#x2014;when they flew out into a black hole. They failed to the extent that when they thought they were climbing, they were actually descending. To my simple, non-technical mind, it seems that when you are climbing you should at least pay attention to that fact. It is probably the primary fact that the pilot should take notice of, and they had no outside lights to monitor them.</p>

<p>Now, what did I receive in return? What was the attitude of the hon. the Minister? He merely tried to prove me wrong. I do not want him to prove me right or wrong. I only want him to instruct his officials to give consideration to the statement I made and to see whether conditions inside the Airways&#x2019; offices need reorganization and reconsideration. I had to draw his attention to the fact that 10 years ago I warned him that this sort of thing could <span class="col_2565-2566" refersTo="page_1305"/>happen, with his then suggested arrangements for the pilots in the Airways he controls. His reply at the Second Reading was that I was talking nonsense. I want to make it quite clear that when I spoke 10 years ago I spoke after a great deal of investigation. I had the matter investigated through the best medical library in Great Britain and they flew out to me micro-films of what was the considered opinion of medical doctors doing air work in Great Britain. Their opinion was that the elderly pilots should be kept off the new, faster planes, to leave the older pilots on the planes to which they were habituated and on the routes with which they were familiar and to operate from the airports to which they were accustomed. But to the hon. the Minister this is nonsense. I know that the hon. the Minister is a great authority on transport, but he is not an authority on medical conditions. He went so far as to accuse me of differing from my colleagues, but doctors always may differ. I did not differ from my colleagues; I read more into their certificates than his officials read. That is what I did. I read what was said in the doctors&#x2019; certificates. The doctors who wrote those certificates will be pleased to think that I did so, because those men who are responsible for those certificates will think back and wonder and say to themselves: &#x201C;I gave this man a certificate to fly for another six months; was I right or was I wrong?&#x201D; Doctors are responsible people and the men employed on this work are responsible people. I think if the hon. the Minister could rise above his intolerance of criticism and occasionally forget his political polemics, this Parliament and the organization which he controls would benefit.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) who has just resumed his seat must pardon me if I do not follow him up in what he has just said, but I should nevertheless like to compliment him by saying that in the years in which I have sat in this House and listened to his speeches, I have gained the impression that he is one of the Opposition speakers who commands one&#x2019;s respect. One is interested in what he says and he attracts one&#x2019;s attention. However, in this case, where he spoke of the report of the commission of inquiry into this unforgettable air disaster which has blotted the fine and clean record of our Airways, I do not want to agree with him. I have made no study of this investigation, but in the same breath I want to say that I have the fullest confidence in the actions of the Minister and in the persons appointed to investigate the causes of the disaster to the best of their ability. We know that it is a very mysterious occurrence. One has no public evidence and one simply has to work on certain information and draw one&#x2019;s own conclusions, which may also be wrong. In any case, it is an occurrence which has blotted the clean record of our Airways and its reputation, and one feels unhappy about that.</p>

<p>We have now come to the closing hour of this debate. We have had a whole week&#x2019;s opportunity to listen and a great deal has been said here. Many words were spoken, words and again words. But if upon reflection one asks oneself what the meaning of all these words has been and what contribution they have made to this great national service in our country, our transport service, the Opposition must pardon me if I sum it up as follows. Late last year we read from day to day in their newspapers about the terrible storm that would take place here this year; the National Party would be driven into two camps, the verkramptes on the one side and the verligtes on the other, and there would be internecine conflict in our ranks. Their newspapers conjured up that feeling for them and many people were interested in it. Months before the Session they spoke of the no-confidence motion where the great battle would be fought.</p>

<p>I am talking about the Railways. If we now think back to what happened in the no-confidence debate and we now come to this Railways debate, it all boils down to the same thing. I do not believe that the United Party will ask the Speaker for an extra day next year, as they did in the case of the no-confidence motion, and not in the case of the railway debate either, they will ask for a day or two less. I sat here and listened very objectively, and the position is that each time an attack was launched here, especially by the political propagandist there, the hon. member for Yeoville, he tried to rouse his people to action, but then they crashed themselves up against the convincing replies from this side of the House, especially when the Minister replied to them.</p>

<p>We have now listened here to the grievances of the hon. member for Durban (Point). He had some five or six of them. We listened to them and we are not contemptuous of a railwayman&#x2019;s complaint. I have also represented a considerable number of railway workers for the past 17 years and I can probably also speak with some knowledge of this situation. If we take into consideration that there are over 100,000 Whites alone employed in our transport services, it merely boils down to the fact that the number of grievances which the hon. member mentioned is a record. It redounds to the credit of the management of our transport services in general that there are so few complaints. One will always receive complaints. It will happen from time to time that one finds people in one&#x2019;s own party whom one cannot satisfy.</p>

<p>Do not now assume that I speak scornfully of people&#x2019;s grievances. I am speaking about stark human reality. One will always have dissatisfied people whom one cannot satisfy. For example, if one <span class="col_2567-2568" refersTo="page_1306"/>has a high percentage of complaints one can give attention to them, but out of a total of 100,000 Whites we have only had these few complaints to which we listened this morning. Surely that is no argument. It does the Minister and his Management credit that only a few complaints have been brought to light this morning out of a total of 100,000 people. That is the honest summing up that one ought to make of such an accusation as was made here. This terrible onslaught which the Opposition was to have made amounted to nothing and they lost the battle hopelessly. In my constituency I have good United Party friends, who are just as close friends as are my National Party friends. These stories which we have to listen to here, from men who should help us run our economy and govern the country, are childish, and to try to bring the Government to a fall and to place it in an unfavourable light with the constituents by those means, is an impossible task, and nothing can be achieved by it. When the United Party speaks of grievances I want to ask them if they still remember Marshall Clark. We had to kick him out in order to get rid of him so that we could continue with the extension of the Railways. We had to appoint grievances commissions and in addition do a great deal more to put matters right. As far as I am concerned it has nothing to do with my approach to our economy; we must confine ourselves to the present conditions. We must speak about this and see how we can contribute to its improvement. That is all I want to say in connection with the United Party and I just want to mention that their criticism once more consisted merely of words.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his General Manager warmly for what they have done. I want to wish the new General Manager prosperity in the years ahead and I may just say that we expect a great deal from him. When we cover terrain such as this to-day and speak about the interests of our country, we think back with great appreciation to his predecessor and what he did for the Railways. The people in my constituency will long remember Mr. Hugo and we wish only the best for the new General Manager. The Secretary for Transport is an experienced man who has been with us for years and he together with the officials who support him, have brought us where we are today as far as Railway matters are concerned. Who can deny, if he wants to be honest and is speaking in the interests of our country, that we have made tremendous progress during the past number of years as far as our Railway development and extension is concerned? We need merely take the important barometer of tonnage which was then transported as against that which is now transported by the Railways to see what has been achieved.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me&#x2014;and I am also doing it on behalf of my constituency and my country&#x2014;to say here this morning that we owe a large debt of gratitude to the hon. the Minister and the staff who support him. I am now thinking of the many services which the Railways furnishes to our country, but apparently this does not count with the Opposition. I am thinking of the pipeline which was established by the hon. the Minister and the prospects for obtaining a second one. This is evidence of the massive Railway development which is taking place, but this is not mentioned or considered. The new deep-sea harbour which is proposed for Richard&#x2019;s Bay, is also a tremendous development which means a lot for our country.</p>

<p>There is also another matter which I should like to mention. In my own constituency Ventersdorp received a fine new station after a struggle of many years. We co-operate with our people and we are aware of their needs. We do not read newspapers and other periodicals and then blow off steam here. We are concerned here with stark reality as far as representation is concerned, and how the representatives must support the Ministers concerned and their Departments. For many years we had a serious water shortage at Coligny and water had to be brought to the town. We later rented boreholes from farmers who lived near the town in order to supply the Railway community with water. Fortunately there is a stream which runs past very close to the town and the hon. the Minister built us a beautiful dam there. I may thus report that our water scarcity is a thing of the past. We are now selling water to the town and the ladies can now care for their gardens with Railway water. As far as the interests of the farmers are concerned. I may say that our transport has improved a few hundred per cent by comparison with a few years ago. At that time we could not get our livestock to the markets because there were not sufficient trucks available. We also experienced constant problems with the transportation of our grain. All these questions were solved, and by none other than the hon. the Minister and his officials. I should like to tell the Minister that at Lichtenburg. Coligny and Ventersdorp we also have a scarcity of housing and that the construction of a few houses there is essential and would be very welcome. From time to time we have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister and each time we have obtained a few additional houses, but the situation is now such that something must once more be done about the matter.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by mentioning that for many years it has been the feeling that there should be a link between Lichtenburg and Mafeking. About 15 years ago all the public bodies concerned in this matter made earnest representations to the hon. the Minister. Representatives of the Railways visited us, but it was felt that our transportation potential did not justify such a service, but we are convinced of the fact that the time is now ripe to provide <span class="col_2569-2570" refersTo="page_1307"/>such a service. We once more made representations to the hon. the Minister and I have here a memorandum from the Town Council of Lichtenburg and also one from the Western Transvaal Regional Development Association. More representations will still be made, but I now want to ask the hon. the Minister to give serious attention to this matter on behalf of all these bodies.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, whenever I want to get at the hon. member for Durban (Central) he is saved by the gong. The hon. member for Durban (Central) tried to get out of his difficulty a moment ago by attacking the hon. the Minister and saying that he was politically vicious in this debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member said here that he had obtained the opinions of pilots on how an aeroplane should be flown and about what had happened at Windhoek. But what about the opinion of this Commission of Inquiry? The members of this commission are very highly qualified and respected persons and I think that they carried out an exceedingly thorough investigation and brought out an excellent report in connection with this air disaster. The hon. member for Durban (Central) expressed himself very clearly on the report of the commission of inquiry and their findings, and made certain dangerous statements during the Second Reading debate. The hon. member for Albany was much more circumspect and confined his remarks to the data recorder. The reason for the hon. member&#x2019;s circumspection is that he is an experienced pilot himself and that he was aware of the fact that the hon. member for Durban (Central) talked a lot of nonsense. I want to support the hon. the Minister strongly in his standpoint and to emphasize the fact that a very seriously wrong impression was created by the unfortunate words of the hon. member for Durban (Central) with his unfair allegations against the Management of South African Airways. These senior officials cannot defend themselves here, and although the commission of inquiry exonerated them from all blame the hon. member for Durban (Central) is still taking their findings as a basis for his attack. The evidence which was given he then uses to level the accusation that the Management had made a mistake by permitting Captain Smith to fly. The hon. member says that the Management should not have permitted him to fly, but what are the real facts? The facts are that Captain Smith had been medically examined by a very strict medical panel on 22nd March and that he had passed the examination. These persons are all colleagues of the hon. member and they passed Captain Smith, but the hon. member says no, the Management should have been wiser and should not have allowed him to fly. A further fact is that from 22nd March to the fatal day of 20th April Captain Smith had had 65&#x00BD; flying hours on Boeing 707s. He had completed these flying hours without any incidents and had carried out his duties well. His flying ability was as good as always, but the hon. member maintains that the Management should not have allowed him to fly. If we accept that Captain Smith was in control of the aircraft the next fact is that he had flown from Jan Smuts Airport to Windhoek without anything having impaired his ability to fly that far. The next fact is that the aeroplane took off perfectly from Windhoek Airport, that the wheels were retracted in the normal way, that engine power was cut back to normal climbing power and that a height of between 600 and 700 ft. was reached. These facts testify to first-class flying ability. The hon. member for Durban (Central) also made insinuations here to the effect that Captain Smith may have been suffering from certain ailments and he referred to certain pills found in the wreckage. The report, however, says that it cannot be proved that these pills were used by Captain Smith. The most precious thing to any person is his own life, and I flatly refuse to accept that a person such as Captain Smith&#x2014;and this is true in respect of other pilots as well&#x2014;with his background, a man of his calibre and responsibility, who had more than 18,000 flying hours to his name, would have risked his life and the lives of his passengers by flying if he had known that he could not do it. If he had known that there was something wrong with his health or his vision he would have had the integrity to admit it. He would not have taken that chance. I have a very high regard for all the professional pilots in our country, because I believe that they are among the best in the world. Everyone knows that the most dangerous and most critical moment in the take-off of an aeroplane is when the engines are developing their full power and nothing can be done before a safe height has been reached. These critical moments were already past and the aeroplane had climbed to a safe height of 600 ft. But what happened after that? Thirty dramatic seconds later the aeroplane hit the ground and the nagging secret of what happened during that time went to the grave with all the unfortunate ones in the aircraft.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the following motion as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a commission to inquire into the desirability of abolishing capital punishment.</block>

<p>I have tabled this motion for two main reasons. Firstly, it seems to me extraordinary that this subject has never been debated before in our Parliament, although it has been <span class="col_2571-2572" refersTo="page_1308"/>the cause of much heated controversy in other parliaments all over the world. I myself am in favour of abolition for reasons which I will give shortly, and I am very interested indeed to know whether other hon. members of this House share my views and if not, why not. It is my sincere hope, I might say at this juncture, that this motion will be discussed on a non-party political basis. I am hoping that the Whips of both parties have allowed their members a free say on this matter, and that if it comes to a vote, they will be allowed to vote according to their own consciences and not according to strict party lines.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to state the reason why I have asked for this inquiry. Not only has this House never debated the matter of abolition of capital punishment, but South Africa has never even had a proper inquiry into the question of capital punishment. The Lansdown Commission of Inquiry into Penal and Prison Reform of 1947 had as one of its terms of reference &#x201C;the general objects of punishment and the methods available to the courts of justice for the punishment of offenders, and the applicability of such methods to particular classes of offenders&#x201D;. That is the closest that we have ever come to a commission of inquiry into the death penalty. I want to say that the commission which issued a lengthy report covering some 159 pages, devoted only six pages of its report to a consideration of the death penalty, and it made it very clear that it was offering an opinion only. The commission said too that it hesitated &#x201C;to offer any view as authoritative, as to do so will be presumptuous unless the matter had been the subject of separate inquiry extending over the whole field of controversy&#x201D;. Well, it is my contention that it is high time that we had such an inquiry, more particularly as our execution rate is one of the highest, if not the highest, in the Western world to-day.</p>

<p>In a recent article which appeared in the latest issue of the <i>Annual Survey of South African Law,</i> Dr. B. van D. van Niekerk of the Law Faculty of the Witwatersrand University gives the startling statistic that South Africa is responsible for carrying out 47 per cent of the world&#x2019;s executions, and he bases his conclusion on the 1968 Report of the United Nations on Capital Punishment. I want to say at once that this report was independently prepared for the U.N., it was not prepared by the U.N. itself. It was prepared by one of the experts on criminology at the University of Chicago. I must also say at once that the report itself, which is based on a very wide survey of member and non-member countries of U.N., stresses that there are limitations which should be noted as bearing upon the report&#x2019;s accuracy and its completeness. There are difficulties as far as varying terminology is concerned, and there are difficulties as far as categorization of capital offences and executions are concerned. Of course, the report also stresses that it had no information about executions resulting from military court trials. I want to put all those obvious shortcomings first. I want to say, too, that one might hesitate to accept at face value, therefore, this figure of 47 per cent. But there is no doubt whatever, both from the U.N. survey and from authoritative works all over the world by noted criminologists, that the overall tendency in the world is towards fewer executions. This is as a result, firstly, of the less frequent use of the death penalty in those countries that retain <i>de jure</i> capital punishment, and secondly, because of the fact that there is a constant tendency throughout the world&#x2014;this tendency has existed for the past 50, 60 years&#x2014;towards abolition of capital offences, either <i>in toto</i> or in certain respects. South Africa, however, has moved in the opposite direction in two respects.</p>

<p>Firstly, we have added to the list of capital offences over the years, and secondly, we are reprieving fewer people than we did 20 years ago. Originally, as hon. members no doubt know, the death penalty in South Africa applied only to treason, murder and rape. Those were the only three capital offences in South Africa, and the death sentence was mandatory upon a conviction for murder until the 1930s, when the &#x201C;extenuating circumstances&#x201D; provision was introduced and the death sentence left to the Judge&#x2019;s discretion. I might say that the percentage of death sentences imposed for murder dropped dramatically thereafter. But since the 1930s South Africa has steadily added to the list of capital offences and since those days we have had armed robbery, housebreaking with aggravating circumstances, sabotage, child-stealing, kidnapping and terrorism added to the list of capital crimes.</p>

<p>Actually I want to abolish all capital offences&#x2014;at least I want an inquiry certainly to cover the abolition of all capital offences although I am prepared to say we might have to do it by stages. [Interjection.] Anyway, I am not going to be diverted by interjections because I have too much territory to cover this morning.</p>

<p>Murder remains responsible for something like 90 per cent of the death sentences imposed. Murder is the capital offence responsible. South Africa has reprieved fewer people over the years, unlike other countries where reprieves are mounting in most countries that do retain capital punishment. But in South Africa the percentage of people reprieved is dropping. For instance, between 1947 and 1956, 37 per cent of the Whites who were sentenced to death were reprieved, but in the period between 1959 and 1964 only 11 per cent of Whites sentenced to death were reprieved. Thirty-one per cent of non-Whites sentenced to death between 1947 and 1956 were reprieved but only 28 per cent were reprieved between 1959 and 1964.</p>

<p>The rising homicide rate in South Africa, and it is rising steadily all the time, is also <span class="col_2573-2574" refersTo="page_1309"/>disturbing. Another U.N. survey shows that we have probably the fourth-highest homicide rate in the world. Let me point out that, despite retention of capital punishment, we have a very steeply rising homicide rate. This rising homicide rate, together with the combination of the two factors I have already mentioned, i.e. the increase in the number of capital offences in South Africa and the decrease in the number of reprieves, have resulted in a steady increase in the number of executions in South Africa. Let me give the House the relevant figures which, of course, are taken from officials figures given to me over the years by Ministers of Justice.</p>

<p>In 1945, 14 people were hanged, in 1947, 27, in 1957, 104, in 1966, it reached an all-high figure with 124 people being hanged. In 1967 the number dropped to 97, and last year 119 people were hanged. If we contrast this position with other countries in the world, we find that to-day in Europe only Spain, France, Eire, Turkey and Greece retain the death penalty. Portugal abolished the death penalty for murder as long ago as 1867, Belgium abolished the death penalty for murder as long ago as 1863, and I might add these were both countries with colonial dependencies with multi-racial populations. In Britain, after a long campaign and following upon the most exhaustive inquiry into the whole subject&#x2014;and this, of course, is the most authoritative inquiry that has ever been made&#x2014;by the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment which sat from 1949 until 1953, the death penalty for murder was suspended in 1965 for a trial period of five years, except for treason. The death penalty is presently in abeyance for all crimes except treason and one or two other things like piracy of Her Majesty&#x2019;s ships. But for murder, rape, etc., the death sentence has been suspended for a period of five years. Canada abolished capital punishment at the end of 1967 for all murders except those of policemen and prison guards, also for a trial period of five years. It is interesting to note that most Latin-American countries, ten in all, including Argentina and Brazil, have abolished the death penalty. Israel, New Zealand, New South Wales in Australia have abandoned the death penalty, either totally or at least for murder. Israel I may say retains it only for Nazi war crimes and genocide, and only one man has been executed since the creation of the state of Israel, namely Eichmann. In the U.S.A., a country where violence is ever-present, 13 states have abolished capital punishment, and it is interesting to note that in those states which retained capital punishment there is a growing reluctance to execute condemned men. In 1935, 199 people were executed in the U.S.A., by 1967 the number had dwindled to two, and last year, 1968, not a single person was executed in the U.S.A. I believe there are at the moment something like 400 men and women in what is known as &#x201C;Death Row&#x201D; in America, and legal experts are doubtful whether a single one of them will in fact go to the Chair. I might say the same <i>de facto</i> abolition of capital punishment can be found in other countries.</p>

<p>Let us look at the reasons for South Africa&#x2019;s rooted adherence to the death penalty. I want to point out this is an adherence shared not with Western countries but it is an adherence shared with the communist countries. It is an adherence shared also with many of the Middle East and Far East countries, and some only of the African states. As I say, this is not an adherence shared by Western countries. Some of the arguments given in favour of our retaining the death penalty are arguments used by retentionists all over the world, but other arguments, of course, apply to the &#x201C;special circumstances pertaining to South Africa&#x201D;. The argument first used by retentionists is, of course, that the death penalty is a unique deterrent. This is the one which is most commonly used. People who hold this view believe that the abolition of the death penalty will indubitably lead to an increase in capital offences, particularly murder. In other words, as someone once put it, there are innumerable would-be murderers just straining at the leash to commit murder if the death penalty were abolished. I think people who think that have lost sight of two important factors. The first important thing is that most murders, by far the majority of them, are not premeditated. Criminologists who have made proper scientific studies of this subject estimate that 95 per cent of murders are unpremeditated. Therefore the existence or otherwise of the death penalty plays no part. The murders are not premeditated, they are committed in a rage, in a moment of passion, in a drunken brawl, at a time when nobody ever anticipated that murder would be committed. In other words, it is unpremeditated murder. Therefore, the calm weighing-up of the consequences does not enter into 95 per cent of murders that are committed anyway.</p>

<p>The chances that capital punishment might deter a person who intends committing a premedidated murder are also remote, for the simple reason that the majority of such persons do not believe they will be caught. That possibility does not enter their minds. They think they are going to commit the &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; murder, and therefore the thought that the hangman&#x2019;s noose might be awaiting them does not in any way deter them.</p>

<p>I might say there is a high suicide rate among people charged with murder, and this I think also shows that the fear of death as such does not play much part in their reasoning.</p>

<p>Now I want to say something else about uniquely deterrent value of the death penalty. I must admit at once that nobody can ever say for certain how many murders and other capital offences were not committed because of the existence of the death penalty. We do not know. But what we do know, is how many detected murders and other capital offences have been committed despite the existence of <span class="col_2575-2576" refersTo="page_1310"/>the death penalty. I want to grant that right away.</p>

<p>A great deal of in-depth scientific inquiry has been made in fact into this aspect, the most important argument of retentionists, namely the uniquely deterrent aspect of the death penalty. One of the world&#x2019;s authorities on the subject is Professor Sellin, who is the president of the International Society of Criminology. He is also the head of the Centre of Criminological Research at the University of Pennsylvania. At the request of the British Royal Commission he undertook a lengthy scientific study about this so-called uniquely deterrent effect of the death penalty. He compared various states in the U.S.A. with similar populations and similar social conditions. He came to the conclusion that according to the statistics there is no evidence whatever, comparing retentionist states with abolitionist states, that the death penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect. And I might say that with the evidence of Professor Sellin at their disposal, as well as the evidence of other experts, and after studying 60 judicial systems throughout the world, the Royal Commission came to the conclusion that on the statistics available there was no evidence that the death penalty was a deterrent superior to imprisonment. It is the certainty of conviction, rather than the degree of punishment, which is the real deterrent. Dr. A. W. Hoernl&#x00E9;, who was a noted sociologist and a member of the Lansdown Commission, expressed the following opinion in her minority report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The assumed deterrent value of capital punishment has been abundantly disproved, so that the penalty stands out starkly for what it is&#x2014;the relic of a system of vindictive punishment which is no longer tolerated in a civilized state.</block>

<p>She recommended that the death penalty be abolished in our civil courts in times of peace. I now turn to the important, perhaps the all important, question of whether the death penalty is required for the protection of society. To me this is the crux of the whole question. Other factors, such as the punitive factor and the factor of retribution, certainly play their part, and I shall return to them in a moment. To me, however, the crux of the whole question, the real crux, is whether the death penalty is in fact required for the protection of society. Considering all the available evidence before it and after having expertly scrutinized the figures available in Europe, the United States and the Commonwealth, the Royal Commission reached the important, albeit negative, conclusion that there was no clear evidence that the abolition of the death penalty has ever led to an increase in the rate of homicide, or that its reintroduction has ever led to a fall. Now. I know that the retentionists will eagerly seize on an article which appeared in the <i>Argus</i> not long ago. It appeared under the somewhat startling heading. &#x201C;Massive rise in British murders&#x201D;. I am sure everybody in this House who is going to speak against my motion, is going to flourish this in my face. I see the hon. member for Durban (North) has that very intention. I would have thought that a civilized man like him &#x2026; [Interjections.] Oh yes, I see it on your face. You would not have flourished that article otherwise. In any event, Sir, the point is &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No. Perhaps eighteenth century but not quite uncivilized. By the way, I notice that hon. member is also a retentionist. But to return to this article. First of all, it is not an in-depth scientific study and thus cannot, in any way, disprove the findings of the Royal Commission which sat from 1949 to 1953. Secondly, it confuses the rate with the number of murders. In other words, it compares two incomparable sets of figures. Therefore, perhaps we would find a different figure altogether if we were to make a proper analysis. Certainly, we would find a different figure as far as the rate of murder is concerned just after the end of World War II. That is comparable with the figure this article mentions. But definitely not as far as the number of murders is concerned. As I was saying, I think one needs to inquire much deeper. 1968 is the only year mentioned in this article, whereas abolition has been implemented in England now for four years. The question now is whether 1968 was significant for a rise in the crime rate, because one would have to go into the question of rising crime rates. These are things which expert criminologists should examine before conclusions are reached, such as those expressed in this article.</p>

<p>I want to mention, and stress, that one important fact is often forgotten by retentionists. I am quite sure that most hon. members who intend supporting retention have this very thing at the back of their heads. This is that they think there is no alternative method for punishing the maldoer&#x2014;in other words, it is hanging or nothing. Well, I cannot stress too strongly that this is nonsense. There are, in fact, alternative means of punishing the maldoer&#x2014;life imprisonment for instance. It is, therefore, not a question of choosing only between capital punishment and no punishment at all. This I cannot stress too strongly. Life imprisonment is, of course, often not literally implemented. If it is, therefore, felt that this form of punishment offers no protection to society, because people who have murdered and have been sentenced to life imprisonment are released and may rush off and murder more people. I must point out that inquiries have been made into this and it has been found to be groundless. In fact, during the period the Royal Commission covered it found that only one case occurred where an imprisoned murderer had been released and who had committed another murder. But even that case was in doubt. It has since been the subject of considerable controversy. But, let <span class="col_2577-2578" refersTo="page_1311"/>me say this at once, there are people who ought to be locked up for life&#x2014;vicious people, people beyond redemption, people who are a danger to society. Such people must be kept locked up forever if necessary.</p>

<p>What about extenuating circumstances?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That must be taken into consideration by the authorities in each case. But where you have a vicious and absolutely intractable criminal, society obviously deserves to be protected against such. But let me point out that the most dangerous of all murderers, the insane murderer, is never executed, or should not be, according to our law. Therefore, this argument as well can be refuted.</p>

<p>Abolitionists are often accused of being &#x201C;soft on&#x201D; criminals, of being &#x201C;sickly humanists&#x201D;, &#x201C;crackpots&#x201D;&#x2014;people who sympathize more with the murderer than they do with the victim. In this respect, I need only refer to Canada. Great Britain, 13 States of the United States. Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, West Germany&#x2014;are the people there &#x201C;crackpots&#x201D; and &#x201C;sickly humanists&#x201D;? And what about the many eminent persons, such as clergymen and others, who have supported the movement towards abolition? Can they be so categorized? Can Judge Hiemstra and Judge Cloete, for instance, be considered as irresponsible? Because they too have made statements in support of the abolition of the death sentence.</p>

<p>The real point is that concepts of justice change with the times. There was a time when there were 200 capital offences in England&#x2014;from minor theft such as the theft of a sheep &#x2026; Well, of course, stealing a sheep would not be considered to be minor theft in this House! In any event, there were about 200 capital offences in England. What is more, public hangings were considered the norm, as was drawing, quartering and torture. All countries which have abolished capital punishment at one time had capital punishment. But their concept of justice and punishment has changed. Rehabilitation has taken precedence over retribution. It is, therefore, not a case of being sympathetic towards murderers and not towards the victims. That is nonsense. Of course, one has every sympathy with the victim, but killing another person will not bring the victim back to life. All it does is to bring more misery, to the hanged person&#x2019;s family.</p>

<p>I see my time is running out and therefore, I should swiftly like to tough on retribution. There are people who seem to think that retribution (a) gives comfort to the victim&#x2019;s family, and (b) that it is a necessary element in society. In this connection they quote the old Mosaic law&#x2014;incorrectly, at that, because to &#x201C;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&#x201D; they add &#x201C;a life for a life&#x201D;. This does not exist in the old Mosaic law. At one stage the old Mosaic law included 33 capital punishments&#x2014;all sorts of things, like adultery, witchcraft, striking one&#x2019;s parents. All these things came within the concept of Mosaic law, of the <i>lex talionis,</i> but I have not yet heard that even the most fervid retentionists want to bring back the death penalty of these crimes. So, it is easy enough to pick out what one wants and to leave out what one does not want. Furthermore, one can always quote an opposite text from the Bible, to any biblical quotation one may want to counter. It must also be remembered that Israel, which is the country most wedded to Mosaic law, has abandoned the death penalty except for Nazi war crimes. The Knesset, when it abolished the death penalty, was heartily supported even by the most religious members of orthodox Jewry in the Knesset.</p>

<p>There are lots of other arguments which I could use, such as the brutalizing effects of hanging on society, and the revolting sensationalism of a murder trial, which is very often enjoyed by the accused, in the case of a person who likes the idea of being in the public eye, as much as it is enjoyed by the public. This has been advanced by many psychologists as the reason for murder. The imposing of the death penalty&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;for certain crimes like rape, kidnapping, armed robbery or housebreaking, etc., can lead to murder by the very fact that it will obviate the likelihood of the victim identifying the criminal. One must remember that too. I do not want to expand on that any further.</p>

<p>I want to mention only one final argument in favour of abolition. That is that mistakes do occur. No judicial system is infallible. I do not say that our courts have made many mistakes in this regard, but I am quite sure that, like other courts, they have made some. Not everybody was as lucky as the convicted murderer who was reprieved at the last moment because a mistake was discovered, which the hon. member for Durban (North) mentioned only the other day when he was speaking against the abolition of juries. I only want to say that once a man has been hanged, that is that. It is irrevocable and the mistake cannot be rectified.</p>

<p>Now I want to turn to the arguments that are supposed to take South Africa&#x2019;s special circumstances, the multi-racial population and the primitive state of the development of many of our non-Whites, into consideration. The opinion of the Lansdown Commission, and it was admitted as being only an opinion, was that it could not recommend abolition. This was in 1947. <i>Inter alia</i> it stated that 80 per cent of the population have not yet emerged from a state of barbarism. The Commission said that public opinion in South Africa was not ripe for the abolition of capital punishment. In that regard it also said that in a matter of vital social reform, the reformer must be in advance of public opinion and that it must educate and lead public opinion. I might say that I heartily concur with this. I would say that this is especially so when public opinion is uninformed and when it is based on emotional attitudes as public opinion in South Africa very often is. The idea that abolition is not <span class="col_2579-2580" refersTo="page_1312"/>possible because of our non-white population, the so-called &#x201C;barbarous&#x201D; 80 per cent, is widely held in South Africa. People fear that the abolition of the death penality will result in thousands of non-Whites, overcome by their primitive instincts, murdering us in our beds, incidentally, I want to say that prosecution figures over a 10-year period show that Whites commit murder and rape on non-Whites at a rate four times greater than non-Whites on Whites. That is just one figure from official statistics.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to those. Do be quiet. In absolute terms, the figures are approximately equal. There was a very interesting article in the last <i>Sunday Times</i> by Mr. David Welsh, senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town, who is an ardent abolitionist. He points out the fallacy in the concept that primitive tribal Africans are given to murder on a large scale. According to his article this is just not true. In times of war, during the Chaka era, which was not a typical time, there was a great deal of bloodshed but in normal times this is not so. Even medicine murders which are, incidentally, the classic case of premeditated murder, are rare. I might say that in Lesotho it has been shown that hanging people for medicine murders has not made the slightest difference to the murder rate in that respect. What undoubtedly is true is that there is a great deal of violence to-day, particularly among urban non-Whites. Nobody can possibly deny that. I think there are over nine murders per day in South Africa. But as Mrs Hoernl&#x00E9; has stated in the Lansdown Report, the reasons for the higher homicide rate among non-Whites are to be found in the whole circumstances of their lives, and not in any differences in racial constitution. I submit that the crux of the matter lies not in the retention of the death penalty, but in the removal of conditions that are the root cause of violence and crime, of social dislocation, of poverty, low wages, hopelessness, bad living conditions, and migratory labour&#x2014;that cancer in our society. I would say that terrorism would largely be reduced if these factors &#x2026; [Interjections.] Remedy these factors and watch the frighteningly high crime rates decrease in our urban townships, and elsewhere too. The Elliot Commission which inquired into causes of crime in South Africa in 1942 was quite specific on this point. It stated:</p>

<block name="quote">Savage punishments are never an effective method of combating crime. It will be reduced only when the social maladjustments that produce it are remedied.</block>

<p>I echo those sentiments as they were echoed also by Judge Steyn speaking at the Annual Congress of Community Services only last year. I believe it is time that we should have a top level inquiry into this matter, because we have not had such an inquiry since the Elliot Commission of 1942. It is high time that we should have a top level inquiry by an independent commission of inquiry into the causes of crimes of violence in South Africa. The commission should consist of well-trained criminologists. Surely, it is extraordinary that there has not been a proper inquiry for over 25 years into the causes of crimes of violence in South Africa, which, as I have said, to-day has one of the highest homicide rates in the entire world. And I say that the time is ripe now too, for an inquiry into the abolition of capital punishment. It is over 20 years since the Lansdown Commission reported. This Commission reported, by no means in depth; it only gave an opinion, so I am asking the House to consider the advisability of appointing a proper commission of inquiry on this matter. That is all I am asking for. I am not asking for anything else at this juncture because I know that such matters require time; they require the reeducation of public opinion and they require proper study. I am asking the House to appoint a commission which should re-examine our attitude to capital punishment, to demonstrate at least our willingness to consider joining those civilized countries that have abolished the death penalty, if not for all capital offences, then at least for some, and for a trial period. Again I want to mention that murder is responsible for 95 per cent of the capital offences in this country. We are not inundated with terrorists despite the obvious fear of the hon. member for Turffontein.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased if the hon. member for Houghton would also listen to me as quietly as I did to her.</p>

<p>This is a matter which we should treat with the greatest measure of responsibility, for it does not only concern the lives of people, but also the life and the safety of the community.</p>

<p>There are three requirements with which a discussion of or an approach to this matter should comply. Firstly, it is essential that this matter should not be dragged into politics. It is important that it should not be dragged into the arena of agitations, for this was the unpleasant and costly experience of Britain. The hon. member referred to the British example. In fact, a commission was appointed there, i.e. the Royal Commission to which the hon. member also referred. In Britain we find that, especially from the middle forties up to the present, the question of capital punishment has been a political issue. This was so severe that the Homicide Act was passed in 1957 as a result of a commission report, in regard to which there was agitation, in regard to which pressure groups took action, in regard to which there was political dissension and in regard to which a compromise was entered into, the most impossible compromise which has ever been entered into in criminal law, in terms of which six categories of murder were made punishable by death but not the rest. As a result of that state of affairs the British Parliament had to proceed, in 1965, to the passing of the Murder (Abolition of the Death Penalty) Act, 1965, in terms of which provision was made for a probationary period of five years, i.e. up to 31st July, 1970. When they voted on the abolition of the death penalty for five years, some members in both Houses of Parliament said that they were not in favour of the abolition of the death penalty but that, as a result of the impossible anomalies which resulted because of the 1957 legislation, they were now obliged to do so. I just want to refer here to one or two of them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bishop of Chester said that by the differentiation between the various forms of murder &#x2026;</block>

<p>And this is what the hon. member is asking us, i.e. that, if we do not want to abolish capital punishment for all crimes which are punishable by death at present, we should abolish it in respect of certain crimes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and the punishment applicable to it, the Homicide Act had reduced the element of retribution to a grisly farce.</block>

<p>Then I shall quote what was said in the House of Lords when the Second Reading of the Bill was introduced&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lady Wootton said that the compromise adopted in the Homicide Act had been a disastrous failure and had produced not justice but anomalies.</block>

<p>On this occasion in 1965 the Chief Justice of England said that he was not in favour of the abolition, but that the legal position in England was so impossible that he would vote for the Second Reading&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He was in favour of the abolition, not on any great moral issue, but merely because of the working of the Homicide Act, &#x2026; &#x201C;and I think I can say that all the Judges are quite disgusted with the results produced by the Homicide Act&#x201D;.</block>

<p>He then made the special request that something should at least be done in the Committee Stage so as to make the position more clear. Sir, this is what has happened in Britain.</p>

<p>Secondly, we must approach this matter soberly and not emotionally; that is very essential.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we must view this matter against the background of the country in question. The hon. member said that there are not very many differences, and she simply shrugged off what the Lansdown Commission had said. Sir, the Lansdown Commission did not only express an opinion; it also heard evidence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Commission itself said it was only giving an opinion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#havemann">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>A moment ago I made a polite request to the hon. member.</p>

<p>We cannot judge the South African circumstances in the light of the experience other countries have had. The paragraph to which she referred makes this very point, for the Lansdown Commission tells us this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission does not presume to suggest that the countries where the death penalty has been abolished are so different from ours in their racial, social and economic conditions as to make their experience of no value to us, but there are probably few of those countries whose populations are so heterogeneous as that of the Union.</block>

<p>Sir, we are concerned here with the background against which capital punishment has to be judged. We can learn a great deal from other countries, but their experience is not a decisive factor. We can, in fact, profitably take cognizance of it. The hon. member told us, &#x201C;There is a rising homicide rate in South Africa&#x201D;. Sir, this must, of course, be correlated with the tremendous increase in population over the years in respect of which she has furnished us with figures here. But that is something she disregards completely.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to summarize the position in South Africa in a brief and terse manner. What is the position in respect of capital punishment? <span class="col_2583-2584" refersTo="page_1314"/>Let us look at the crimes for which capital punishment must not be imposed but may be imposed. The Judge is under an obligation in one case only. The crimes are as follows: Treason, sabotage, acts of terrorism&#x2014;I am grouping them together&#x2014;kidnapping, child-stealing, rape, robbery and attempted robbery if there are aggravating circumstances, housebreaking if there are aggravating circumstances, and murder. We are now dealing with two sets of crimes: the one group is aimed at the life and safety of the individual and the other is aimed at the life and safety of the community. This is the position in South Africa; these are the categories of crimes in respect of which capital punishment may be imposed. This position is being regulated by sections 330, 331 and 332 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Criminal Procedure Act, 1959, as amended, also makes provision for reprieve by the Executive, by the State President. All the crimes I have mentioned here, are crimes in respect of which the Judge may, and not must, pass the death sentence upon conviction. There is only one case where he is obliged to do so, and that is for murder without extenuating circumstances. That is the only one.</p>

<p>But we have a very large number of safety valves in our law. In the first place, we should always bear in mind that, in spite of these U.N. reports to which the hon. member referred and all the other liberalist criticism we may find, the State must always prove the guilt of the accused. The death sentence can only be passed by a higher court. There is ample opportunity for appeal to the Appeal Court. There is the principle of extenuating circumstances which the Royal Commission did not want to accept, in spite of the evidence. This is a very wide concept, very widely formulated in our law, and the same applies to the principle of imputability, or, in other words, provision for those suffering from mental defects, etc. Those safety valves have been provided. The hon. member referred here to an &#x201C;insane murderer&#x201D;, but there is no such thing. A person who is insane, cannot commit murder; he is not accountable. Then there is special provision in respect of a person under the age of 18 and a woman who is guilty of infanticide.</p>

<p>When the death sentence is in fact passed, the Judge who has passed that sentence must immediately submit, through the Secretary for Justice, a report to the State President, who has to decide whether the sentence will be confirmed. No death sentence is executed until the Minister of Justice has given written notice to the effect that the State President has decided not to use his powers of reprieve. Even up to the last moment before the execution of the sentence, the condemned person may be granted an interdict if new facts come to light which have a bearing on the sentence. Every person who is accused of a capital crime in South Africa has legal representation, and if such a person does not arrange it for himself, the State arranges it free of charge: he is defended <i>pro Deo.</i> And even if a person were to plead guilty to a charge of murder in a South African court of law, our law stipulates that the plea should be changed to &#x201C;not guilty&#x201D; and that the court of law should follow the normal procedure and try him properly. Even if he is charged with murder and the evidence indicates otherwise, the court of law may find him guilty of a much lesser crime, even of the crime of assault. This is the position in South Africa, i.e. a very scientific approach.</p>

<p>Now we come to the next aspect. What is the object of punishment? The hon. member touched upon this. Punishment can have a three-fold object: retribution, deterrence or reform. In any modern penological system the retribution aspect does not occupy a prominent place. As regards murder and crimes such as treason, the possibility of the death sentence&#x2014;I say possibility because it is not compulsory&#x2014;is a very strong deterrent. Therefore, if the hon. member tells us, &#x201C;It is not a uniquely effective deterrent&#x201D;, then I ask her this: if the supreme penalty that can be imposed, the death sentence, were not a deterrent, would any other penalty act as a deterrent? If any other penalty were not a deterrent either, then I want to suggest that the deterrent in our penal code would fall away and then only reform would remain. In that case many of the Acts we pass in this House would become a farce and the penal code would collapse.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#havemann">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was suspended, I was dealing with the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s assertion to the effect that capital punishment as such was no effective deterrent to murder and crimes of that nature. If capital punishment, the most severe penalty were no deterrent, then we must inevitably arrive at the conclusion that all milder penalties would have even less deterrent value. In that case all punishment would become pointless. Then the reform aspect would be the only remaining aspect in the treatment of crime. We would then arrive at the absurd position that our whole penal code would collapse. But then the hon. member once again backed out to a certain extent by saying that they had to get a prison sentence. In that case we would arrive at this impossible position that one would be encouraging the murderer to think of his victim in these terms: &#x201C;You are going to the cemetery for ever, but I am merely going to prison for a while.&#x201D; This would give rise to the situation where the terrorist, who knows that he dare not turn back, for then his comrades would destroy him, would tell himself that he might as well apply the diabolical skills he has been taught in Tanzania and Algeria, that he might massacre the hon. member for Houghton and her family, because he would know that what is in store for him in South Africa is not death but a well cared for life in prison.</p>

<p><span class="col_2585-2586" refersTo="page_1315"/>That is the situation we would arrive at. No effective alternative was stated.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred very contemptuously to a report which appeared in the <i>Argus</i> of 11th March. The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Massive rise in British murders. There was a massive increase in murders reported to the police in England and Wales last year, which made 1968 by far the worst year for killings since the end of World War II. Since hanging was temporarily abolished just over four years ago the murder rate has been rising rapidly. And the facts which have now emerged will come as a shock&#x2014;and a blow&#x2014;to the opponents of capital punishment.</block>

<p>I could read out the whole report to you, Sir, but the time is lacking. Amongst other things the following is said in this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Linked with the upsurge in killing is a startling increase in the carrying of guns by criminals. Under the 1957 Homicide Act, murder by shooting was a hanging offence. In 1964&#x2014;the year hanging ceased&#x2014;the number of serious crimes involving firearms was 731. Last year this figure had soared to 2,500.</block>

<p>The following is significant&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This was no freak total. Use of guns has gone up every year since hanging ended as follows: 1954, 1,141; 1966, 1,511; 1967, 2,337.</block>

<p>The figure for the past year is 2,500. This was not unforeseen. When the debate on the abolition of capital punishment in England took place, Sir Peter Rawlinson, a former Solicitor-General, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do believe that you can deter the professional criminal who goes and fires his pistol, who goes out to rob as his occupation, weighing risk against risk. I believe we are witnessing an increase in professional crime and the extension of operations by organized gangs. I fear that the removal of capital punishment will introduce a risk of greater violence, of more use of guns, and of greater danger to the public.</block>

<p>The report on this debate goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Earl of Kilmuir, a former Conservative Home Secretary and Lord Chancellor, said that the number of violent crimes had gone up by 2&#x00BD; times in just over 10 years.</block>

<p>That is, since the abolition of the Homicide Act, which only laid down capital punishment in respect of certain categories. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hanging was a deterrent to the professional criminal against arming himself and being prepared to kill the policeman whose duty it was to arrest him. Lord Kilmuir therefore opposed the Bill &#x2026; as it did not set forth an alternative deterrent.</block>

<p>These things are proved by facts; not theories and views to which the hon. member referred, but statistics. She said that we had to look to England. She quoted to us the Royal Commission and its recommendations. Now she wants to lead us to the impossible situation which prevailed while the Homocide Act was being implemented. She said, &#x201C;Abolish capital punishment; if not in all cases, then in some&#x201D;. This would result in the same absurd position as the one into which Britain has now fallen. Quite casually the hon. member also said that this question of capital punishment was immoral and that it was not based on scriptural grounds either. If that is the case, Sir, the Christian Church has been erring for 2000 years! But the Church has not been erring. I also want to quote to hon. members a church leader, who cannot be accused of not being liberal enough. I quote from a report on what the Archbishop of Canterbury said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Archbishop of Canterbury, rejecting the view that capital punishment was immoral, declared that &#x201C;it is not against the law of God or the doctrines of the Christian Church&#x201D;. The choice for or against abolition did not rest on any absolute principles, but was a matter of weighing the total moral effect on the country.</block>

<p>Therefore, the argument falls away, also as far as the ecclesiastical aspect of the matter is concerned.</p>

<p>But what does the hon. member tell us in the findings of the &#x201C;Suzman Commission&#x201D;? She says that if one has to deal with such a terribly impossible criminal &#x201C;then lock him up for ever&#x201D;. Do hon. members know what the abolitionists in England said when that very same argument was advanced in the House of Lords and the House of Commons? They said that it was immoral: &#x201C;You cannot allow men to rot in prison.&#x201D; Now the hon. member uses this illogical kind of argument so as to get past the impossible. If we are dealing with the illogical, it is no longer a case of &#x201C;Forever Amber&#x201D;, but of &#x201C;Forever Helen&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In her ardent &#x201C;patriotism&#x201D; the hon. member thought it fit, when she was struggling along with U.N. figures here, to compare her fatherland with the communist systems as far as this matter is concerned. But when she dealt with the figures and mentioned a &#x201C;rising homicide rate&#x201D;, she omitted to mention that in the vast majority of those murder cases both murderers and victims were Bantu, that we have to cope with ethnic groupings in this country, that we even have to cope with such things as faction fights in this country. She rather casually kept quiet about these facts, but she very expertly held up to us the picture of the U.N. figures and took them as her model.</p>

<p>If one comes to the advisability of appointing a commission, it must, after all, be based on a request from authoritative and representative <span class="col_2587-2588" refersTo="page_1316"/>opinion. I make bold to suggest that such a request has never been made by the Judiciary as such, the Bar Council, the South African Law Societies, the Department of Justice, the Attorneys-General or the Department of Prisons. But I shall go further than that. As far as I am aware, such a draught resolution has never been introduced at any congress of the National Party, nor of the United Party.</p>

<p>I doubt whether the Progressive Party has ever had such a draught resolution at its congresses. But, after all, to-day they appointed a one-man commission; I suppose they also have one-man congresses at present! I do not know. There has never been such a request. The next point is very important. No Bantu authority or representative non-White organization in South Africa, i.e. those people about whom she has had so much to say, has ever come forward with such a request. We are dealing here with a very important subject, which, as I said at the beginning, does not only concern the life and the safety of the individual, but also the life and continued existence of the State, the community and the nation. Since we want to discuss this matter in a sober and responsible manner, we should consider the question of the advisability of the appointment of such a commission against the background of our public opinion. The hon. member said that the Lansdown Commission was only giving an opinion. It was not, Sir; it went further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After careful consideration of the arguments presented and the legal machinery which exists to safeguard an innocent man, the view of this commission is that the abolitionists have not made out a case which would justify a recommendation for an amendment of the law of this country.</block>

<p>In the light of this and if one has regard to the composition of this population, as I briefly put it to hon. members; if we bear in mind that we are dealing with threats on our borders by terrorists, who have been taught their diabolical skills in Tanzania and Algeria, and who would, if we were to abolish capital punishment, come here with the knowledge that a milder punishment awaits them here than would be meted out to them if they were to turn back to their comrades; if we have regard to the fact that this is not being requested by the general public, I must say that the hon. member for Houghton has not made out a case, and that there is no proof for the advisability of appointing such a commission.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Odendaalsrus has given the House a very interesting and, I think, a very necessary background to what the law in fact provides at this stage, and in relation to the differences which exist in broad outline between the views that were expressed by the hon. member for Houghton and the views being expressed in our country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton expressed the view that she had hoped that this might be a free vote. If this were a debating society, perhaps that might have been a point well made. But this is not a debating society. We have to make decisions here which must be acted upon, if necessary, by those responsible for the administration of justice. The motion of the hon. member, namely that a commission should investigate the matter, is not a motion which we feel should be passed by this House if we have any positive feeling, as the representatives of society (which we are here in Parliament assembled) on the question as to whether the death sentence should be abolished. I suppose one could say that there is in this country a commission sitting all the time in the form of the Judges of the Supreme Court who have to deal with this question from day to day in many more cases than most Judges of the world. But, it is for society itself to determine. I do not think that we in this House, as the representatives of society, are entitled to pass the buck to a commission. In fact, one wonders whether we should not have on our desks here what Harry Truman, the former President of the United States had on his desk, namely a notice saying, &#x201C;The buck stops here&#x201D;. We have to take a positive attitude in determining what, in fact, our attitude is towards this matter. I am sure we are all pleased that we have had the opportunity, by the introduction of this motion, to determine where we stand in relation to this matter. I am sure that here, imperfect though we may be, we (if anyone does) represent society.</p>

<p>There is another field in which society brought its opinion to bear very directly, as regards the question of the imposition of the death sentence, namely the jury system. That, sadly and against our wishes on this side of the House, has now been removed from our legal system. There are examples, not only in Great Britain where the system originated, but also in our own country, as the hon. the Minister will know from the Lansdown Report. In Natal, for example, juries found difficulty in finding people guilty of rape, because they knew the death sentence would in those days follow automatically. Here was society itself interposing itself and indicating what it felt about the death penalty in certain cases. We are sorry the jury system has been abandoned, but it has been. We are the only arbiters at this stage.</p>

<p>Abolition is a very easy way out if one is dealing with one&#x2019;s own conscience. But we are not fulfilling our obligation to society or to ourselves if we do not positively determine this issue that is before us to-day. One is in no different a position than one is in when one acts as an assessor, as hon. members in this House have had to do, in a murder trial. One has to take part in reaching the decision of determining whether someone should, in fact, be sentenced to death or not. Neither is this position any more pleasant than that of anyone who has to defend the accused. We all, <span class="col_2589-2590" refersTo="page_1317"/>in such positions, have a duty to perform to society and ourselves, and to the prisoner. It is a very ugly business but it is a very necessary business.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton very kindly said she regarded me as a civilized person.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I might change my mind.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, she might change her mind. That is her privilege as a lady. Therefore it was expected that I should support her. She expressed obliquely the view that is abroad amongst abolitionists; that is that if you are a member of the intelligentsia or an academic or someone of that sort, if you are civilized in that sense, then you must support abolition. Well, I think this really begs the question.</p>

<p>What in fact is the death sentence? It is a matter of punishment. Punishment must be sufficient to deter others and sufficient to be accepted by public opinion&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;as an adequate vindication of the law. It ought not to suggest that the crime of murder, treason, rape, terrorism, sabotage, and all the other capital crimes should be regarded lightly, either by the State or the public, or should be put on the same level as any other crime. I think Lord Justice Denning of Great Britain expressed this better than I could ever express it. I am quoting from Sir Ernest Gowers&#x2019; book, &#x201C;A Life for a Life&#x201D;. He was the chairman of the Royal Commission. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lord Justice Denning held that to test the efficacy of punishment solely by its value as a deterrent was too narrow a view. Punishment was the way in which society expressed its denunciation of wrongdoing, and in order to maintain respect for the law it was essential that the punishment inflicted for grave crimes should adequately reflect the revulsion felt by the great majority of citizens for it. It was a mistake to consider the object of punishment as being deterrent or reformative or preventative, and nothing more. He would therefore not abolish capital punishment but would confine it to the cases that really deserved it. Some cases are so outrageous that, irrespective of the value of the death penalty as a deterrent, the great bulk of the community consider that the only fitting penalty is death.</block>

<p>I am sure hon. members have read about this really quite incredible Moors murder case in Great Britain. It induced an abolitionist in the form of Pamela Johnson, the wife of C. B. Snow, who reported this case in her book &#x201C;On Iniquity&#x201D; to conclude that (although she was an abolitionist) the prisoners should have hanged. You will remember this case, Mr. Speaker. It was the case of the murder of the children. The murderers actually recorded for their pleasure the dying noises of the children that they tortured. She, as a member of the intelligentsia, who reported this case and who sat in on it, felt that, although she was an abolitionist, a sentence of imprisonment was quite inadequate. That is the feeling.</p>

<p>What are the other results of maintaining the death sentence? The Royal Commission itself said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We think it is reasonable to suppose that the deterrent force of capital punishment operates not only by affecting the conscious thoughts of individuals tempted to commit murder, but also by building up in the community over a long period of time, a deepfeeling of peculiar abhorrence for the crime of murder. The fact that men are hanged for murder is one great reason why murder is considered so dreadful a crime.</block>

<p>We can add to that other crimes in our own country.</p>

<p>There are other aspects which might induce one to think that the death penalty should be retained. There is the retribution or vindication element. I leave that to the hon. member for Mooi River to deal with more eloquently than I could deal with it. But we are not a vindictive society. Think of all the figures quoted here. But figures that have <i>not</i> been quoted are the numbers of people who have been indicted for and found guilty of crimes which carry the death penalty and the number of those persons who are in fact executed later on. A very small percentage. These figures have not been mentioned, and those of us who practise in the courts know that there are in every city in this country two, three, sometimes four courts sitting every day trying capital offences from the beginning to the end of that day. This is the indication that we are not a vindictive society. The fact that more sentences of death are pronounced here than in other countries indicates nothing.</p>

<p>All the literature, and it is myriad, which deals with abolition, deals with the concern for the accused person, for the condemned person. Society is concerned with this. But there is also the other side of the coin, and the other side of the coin is his victim and the victim&#x2019;s family and society itself, and the protection of society. Hanging is a grim and ugly business, but so is murder, so is rape, so is treason, so is terrorism, so is sabotage, so is going outside the country to train to subvert our country, so is housebreaking with aggravating circumstances, so is robbery with aggravating circumstances, so is child-stealing and so is kidnapping. All these crimes are a grim and ugly business for the victims and for society itself.</p>

<p>This question of whether or not it is a deterrent is obviously a question which we will have to consider. One cannot by producing statistics, quite obviously in the nature of things say how much it is a deterrent. You cannot prove it. All that the figures indicate is that there are a number of people who have put themselves outside the pale of society, and that in respect Of them it was not a deterrent. So it <span class="col_2591-2592" refersTo="page_1318"/>is a matter of one&#x2019;s own impressions. I think it is our duty here as the representatives of our society to indicate what is our collective impression about this thing which cannot be proved by any statistical evidence.</p>

<p>We have a duty in our society to protect the police. Remember that Sir Robert Peel could never, when he established the first police force, have maintained that police force had the public, had society not been with him in that respect, and that is why he would not arm them at that stage. Consider those other guardians of society. If the abolitionists were to have their way, if no one were to be sentenced to death, then let us consider our warders of the prisons in which they have to spend their lives. A prisoner serving a life sentence for murder could escape and kill the warder in the process, knowing that all that could happen to him is that he would continue where he was before, namely continue to serve a life sentence. The Mountbatten Report of 1967 on prisons in Great Britain pointed out that of the 138 men in category A, that is to say people who normally would be hanged, 53 had tried to escape and that a further 83 were suspected of making escape plans. But I do not have to go to Britain for an example. One has only to look at the Lansdown Report where a hypothetical example is given in this very respect. It says:</p>

<block name="quote">A murderer, sentenced to life-long imprisonment, being a man of vicious tendency whom all efforts to reform have failed, incurs a dislike for a particular prison warder, and thinking that nothing more fearful than the present life imprisonment can happen to him, kills the warder. Such a man might have been deterred had he known that his violence would be paid for by his own death.</block>

<p>Sir, what about the police? What about people who are arrested for murder and then resist arrest and murder in resisting arrest? What about persons who try to escape from custody, committing murder in doing so having been arrested on suspicion of murder. What about second time murderers? These are all matters for which there is no alternative. The hon. member for Houghton suggested that the alternative is imprisonment. There is no alternative for these persons but the imposition of the death sentence. I have said that one has a revulsion for the proceedings. One has to take part in it obviously, because one has a duty; but one has a great horror of the events themselves which cause the proceedings.</p>

<p>The character of human nature, I believe, is that the capital penalty is the most dreaded thing of all. The question which we have to ask ourselves here to-day is, what is the most dreaded thing of all, what would one want more or what would one want less? I do not think there is any doubt whatsoever. One reads all the books that have been written by prison governors in Great Britain. We do not have such literature in our own country for obvious reasons. One finds that every one of them writes about the moment of reprieve of a condemned prisoner and the great relief that there is always by the prisoner when he learns he has been reprieved. Let me again refer to Lord Justice Denning and what he says about the gangster type people. You get gangsters, groups of people, who are not deterred by imprisonment. We have this recent example in Great Britain of the Kray and train robbery gangs and others, which showed us the extent to which they will go not only in supporting each other but in helping each other because they know that life goes on and that they as master-criminals can find a way to get round any difficulties the State may put in their way. I wonder whether they would have acted that way had the death penalty been in existence in Great Britain at the time?</p>

<p>Because we feel that this is not a debating society and because we feel that we have to have an attitude as responsible elected people, I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House favours the retention of capital punishment in existing cases and calls upon the Government to consider the advisability, <i>inter alia,</i> of providing for an automatic right of appeal in all cases where the death sentence is imposed and for the speeding up of the procedures of appeal in such cases&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I have said that our task, our responsibility, here to-day is to determine our own instincts as members and the representatives of our society here in this House assembled. This is our view based on the collective knowledge of human nature of my party.</p>

<p>You know, Mr. Speaker, all that has been said by the hon. member for Houghton, all that has been written about abolition, all the arguments which have been produced, have been produced in respect of the law as it exists (or existed) in Great Britain. The situation is absolutely different in South Africa. All that has been said and written in Great Britain in this regard, was about murder. About 90 per cent of the people hanged in this country are hanged in respect of an offence relating to murder. But there is no comparison whatsoever. The abolitionists in Great Britain had a case. If there was a mandatory death penalty for a person found guilty of murder, regardless of how the murder was committed, regardless whether the man was a crank or whether he had an aberration or whether he was moved by something or whether he had been provoked, or whatever, the law said that he had to be hanged.</p>

<p>What about diminished responsibility?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there was the doctrine of diminished responsibility, but the McNaughton Rules did not take the matter <span class="col_2593-2594" refersTo="page_1319"/>very much further except in extreme cases of insanity and it certainly had no effect. Of all the people who received a mandatory death sentence in Great Britain I would say that something like&#x2014;I am going to be conservative&#x2014;80 per cent of them would not have been sentenced to death in South Africa. This is the whole point and this is what is missing in all the experience of Great Britain, this is what is missing in all the writings of these people, that is what is missing in the writings of the intellectual, Arthur Koestler. He wrote a magnificent treatize on the subject provided you confine it to the law of Great Britain. If you go into the question, you will find that the Royal Commission actually took evidence from our Dr. Lansdown, the former judge who was the chairman of our commission. In respect of what he has said, they summarize his evidence thus:</p>

<block name="quote">The doctrine of extenuating circumstances has proved very successful in South Africa. The Judges have not found their responsibilities unduly onerous. Dr. Lansdown&#x2019;s personal view is that he would deplore the withdrawal of the provision which has much lightened his labour by enabling him to be an agent in proper oases for giving just and reasonable scope to mercy and sound sense, without doing violence to any principle of law or logic. He thought that this view would be shared by all the South African Judges, now on the bench.</block>

<p>You know, Mr. Speaker, this is what makes our system different from any other system in the world. Only the very worst cases are hanged. Except where there are no extenuating circumstances in murder, where there is a mandatory death sentence, the discretion is vested in the Judge to determine whether it should be applied. This matter was considered by the Royal Commission and it was found that all the Judges in fact felt that if they were given the discretion, they would Obviously not shrink from it. Then they say:</p>

<block name="quote">Neither he (the Lord Chief Justice) nor any other judicial witness left us in doubt that he would regard such a responsibility as a very grave and unwelcome burden which he would be most reluctant to assume.</block>

<p>This is a very grave burden which rests upon our Judges, but they have carried this burden and they have carried it with distinction. When one deals with the differences and there are in this regard great differences between the law of Great Britain and our country, or any other country, I think one must appreciate, in the first place, as the hon. member for Odendaalsrus has pointed out, that our system in this respect has no peer in the world so far as this sieving process is concerned, between the time the man is arrested and the time that he is hanged, including the procedure between court sentence and execution.</p>

<p>Prof. Herman Venter, a member of the Penal Reform League and the head of the Criminology Department at Pretoria University, when he was asked to comment about New Zealand&#x2019;s abolishing the death sentence, said that he thought that the death sentence was senseless and served no useful purpose. Then he went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unfortunately, however, certain sections of South Africa&#x2019;s population were not sufficiently advanced culturally to understand the motives behind its abolishment and would interpret abolishment as a weakness. It would be an encouragement to an increase in violence. <i>(Cape Argus</i>: 4.11.61.)</block>

<p>Sir, I think this is a factor and a feature that we must take into account viz. that in this country there are those features, those different groups at different stages of development, and that we would abolish the death penalty at our peril.</p>

<p>So far as the Royal Commission was concerned, it did provide, in respect of one matter, something for which we should be grateful, and that is their investigation into all the methods of execution. There is no doubt whatever from their report that of all the methods of execution that exist hanging, in the manner in which it is carried out in South Africa, is certainly the most humane and the quickest&#x2014;between nine to ten seconds from the time that the condemned person leaves his cell until the time he is dead.</p>

<p>Sir, in the short time available to me I must briefly deal with the remainder of my amendment. During the debate on the Abolition of Juries Bill, the hon. the Minister indicated, in response to a plea from this side of the House, that he would favourably consider and that if he could get the consent of the Judges he would put on the Statute Book a provision that Judges sitting in capital cases shall have two assessors with them, in other words, the principle that one man should not decide the matter. It is further suggested in my amendment to-day that an investigation should be made by the Government into the advisability of providing an automatic right of appeal in a death sentence case. A Judge is placed in an impossible position when he has to decide, after deciding, in a case beyond a reasonable doubt and in all conscience and with two assessors agreeing with him, whether on appeal another court might take a different view. And you cannot appeal unless he decides this&#x2014;except on petition. It is a difficult task for him. If is really an impossible decision for a Judge to have to make, and I think there should be an automatic right of appeal. In other words, you should not have to ask the Judge to determine in effect that although he is certain of your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, it is not In practice a lot of people who ask for leave to appeal are refused permission by the trial Judge, and the classic case here is the case which I quoted when the Abolition of Juries Bill was before the House, namely the case of Nzimandi in the Bergville dagga murder trial. In this case the condemned person asked for leave to appeal; his application was refused. He petitioned the Appellate Division for leave to appeal; the application was refused by the Judge on duty. He then got a stay of execution the day before he was due to be executed, and when the matter went to the Appellate Division, they found him not guilty and discharged him. I can assure the hon. the Prime Minister that very often in practice applications for leave to appeal are refused, and I do not think that a Judge should be put in that position.</p>

<p>The other aspect with which I want to deal in the minute left to me is the question as to whether the procedure of appeal in these cases&#x2014;this is a matter to be inquired into&#x2014;could not be speeded up. I am sure that we are all revolted in our society by the sort of thing that can happen in other countries, where a man like Chessman can stay in the death cell for ten years and more, and then be executed. That does not happen in our country, and I mention it just as something which revolts one; it is so awful. This does not happen in our country but nevertheless, seeking perfection, I think the procedure could be speeded up and I think in those cases is should be speeded up.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the amendment is not aimed at reducing the value of the reference of such a case to the Executive Council in any way, because I am convinced that irrespective of there being an automatic right of appeal or not, it is extremely valuable to refer the case to the Executive Council for a possible reprieve. I have here a book written by Prof. H. L. A. Hart, <i>Punishment and Responsibility</i>&#x2014;it is a new publication&#x2014;in which he points out, on page 61, that in spite of the disadvantages of the so-called &#x201C;Royal prerogative of mercy&#x201D;, most lawyers in Great Britain to-day are in favour of the position remaining unchanged. Sir, the motion presupposes that there must be doubt in the mind of the legislature as to whether capital punishment is still desirable and/or necessary and/or effective. My humble opinion is that no such doubt exists and that the appointment of such a commission should not be considered at all. On the contrary, to put it positively, I think that capital punishment still serves a vitally important purpose in this country and that it should be allowed to remain unchanged on our Statute Book. The first reason which I want to mention, and which has already been mentioned here, is that our legal system is elastic enough, much more elastic than the English legal system was up to the passing of the Homicide Act in 1957, and much more elastic than the English legal system is to-day. We have only two cases in which the death penalty is mandatory. The first is murder where the jury finds no extenuating circumstances&#x2014;this will now have to be adapted to the new amendment to the Act&#x2014;and the second is murder where the Judge sits with assessors and the majority of the court finds that there are no extenuating circumstances. Then we have three oases of murder at the moment in which a discretion is left as to whether the death penalty should be applied or not. The first case is where extenuating circumstances have been found to exist; the second is where a woman murders her new-born child and the third is where the accused is under 18 years of age. This gives us five categories of murder, in only two categories of which it is mandatory for the death sentence to be applied. In other words, our system is elastic. In addition there are eight cases which vary from high treason to terrorism in which a discretion is also left as to whether the death penalty should be applied or not and which have been established for the protection of the safety of the State and of the person and of life. Moreover, as I have said, we have the right of appeal in certain circumstances, as well as the automatic reference to the Executive Council, which has particular advantages in that circumstantial evidence which cannot be adduced in court may be adduced before the Executive Council. Our system therefore has the necessary elasticity, and I maintain that in the last resort only the person who really deserves the death penalty is hanged in our country. As far as the question of punishment is concerned, in <i>Rex</i> vs. <i>Swanepoel,</i> 1945 A.D., the Appeal Court gave a series of five reasons which must serve as the objects of punishment, and these are the following: Firstly, to ensure that the person concerned will not contravene the law again; secondly, to cause others to learn from the example and in that way to deter them from <span class="col_2597-2598" refersTo="page_1321"/>committing crimes; thirdly, to give expression to society&#x2019;s feeling of indignation; fourthly, to rehabilitate the criminal by means of discipline and industry; and, fifthly, to isolate him from the community in cases in which it seems as though he cannot be rehabilitated. So you see, Sir, that our law no longer has the old-fashioned idea of an eye for an eye. By far the most important of the objects mentioned here, particularly in the case of murder, is that the punishment must serve as a deterrent to others. In the case of murder capital punishment is a deterrent. Even the Royal Commission, who were very humanistically and liberalistically indoctrinated, arrived at the following conclusion in regard to the death penalty&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Prima facie</i> the death sentence is likely to have a stronger effect as a deterrent to normal human beings than any other form of punishment. There is some evidence, though no convincing statistical evidence, that this is in fact so and also that abolition may be followed for a short time by an increase in homicides and crimes of violence, but there is no clear evidence of any lasting increase, and there are many offenders on whom the deterrent effect is limited and may often be negligible.</block>

<p>Even they found that in fact there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the death sentence was a deterrent in certain cases.</p>

<p>In February, 1955, a debate was held in the House of Commons on a motion to the effect that the death sentence be suspended for five years as an experiment. Major Lloyd George, the then Home Secretary, said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following about the death sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They were not disposed to reject the evidence of many experienced persons that it was a uniquely effective deterrent to professional criminals &#x2026;</block>

<p>During a debate in March, 1965, Sir Patrick Spens said in the first place that he had been Chief Justice in India for four years and that many appeals against death sentences had come before him during that time. Then he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am convinced that fear of violent death is a deterrent. No statistics will convince me that it is not. You will do a grave injury to society if you suspend or abolish the death penalty.</block>

<p>What is important about this finding of Sir Patrick Spens is that although he was the Chief Justice of a country that was homogeneous as far as population was concerned, he was the Chief Justice of a country that was heterogeneous as far as its class structure and the degrees of civilization of those classes were concerned. I therefore regard his observations as very much applicable to our own circumstances in this country. But even in the Homicide Act of 1957 the British acknowledge the deterrent effect of the death sentence. Professor Hart, whom I quoted a few moments ago, says on page 60 of his book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Only in 1957 was a breach made in this tradition by the Homicide Act, which reserved the death penalty for five classes of murder. The particular classes chosen may appear somewhat curious to American lawyers, but it is to be remembered that they do not represent an attempt to distinguish between murders according to heinousness or moral gravity, but to select for capital punishment those types of murder in which the deterrent effect is likely to be most powerful.</block>

<p>It is history that the House of Commons passed an Act in 1964 abolishing the death penalty for a trial period of five years, and it further provided that for persons under the age of 18 years there would only be detention at Her Majesty&#x2019;s pleasure. And where does Great Britain find itself to-day? Reference has been made to the report in the <i>Cape Argus.</i> I want to agree with the hon. member for Houghton that this is not a scientific report, but I think we would be closing our eyes to reality if we were not prepared to admit that England is in a much more precarious position to-day than she was prior to the passing of the 1964 Act. And I want to say that in retrospect the words expressed by Sir Patrick Spens, the realist, in respect of England in 1956. &#x201C;You will do a grave injury to society if you suspend or abolish the death penalty&#x201D;, had a prophetic ring about them.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that important evidence was submitted to the Royal Commission in England on two aspects as far as detention is concerned. The first is the tremendous problem that will be caused by having to detain dangerous prisoners, who will continue to increase in number, under conditions of maximum security, which will also be a real problem in this country, in view of the fact that we have a large prison population figure. Furthermore, the Prison Officers&#x2019; Association also submitted very strong evidence to the Royal Commission to the effect that they were opposed to the abolition of the death penalty for the reasons mentioned here by the hon. member for Durban (North), <i>inter alia,</i> that if it were abolished it would be easier for a dangerous prisoner to kill a warder and then simply to return to the same prison.</p>

<p>Now I want to say this here to-day. For my part every convicted murderer in this country who has not been reprieved&#x2014;even though there may be hundreds or even thousands of them&#x2014;can be hanged rather than that one single warden or one single policeman or one single child in this country be killed in a senseless way. For this reason, and after making this statement I shall resume my seat. I am of the opinion that there is no need at all to consider at this stage the possibility or the desirability of appointing a commission of inquiry as requested.</p>

<from><span class="col_2599-2600" refersTo="page_1322"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I think what has become fairly clear during this discussion is that this House is virtually unanimously of the opinion that the existing position should be retained, and seeing that this House will have the final say, no matter what commissions may be appointed, I wonder whether the hon. member for Houghton too does not also agree in her heart of hearts that asking for a commission at this stage is something for which there is absolutely no need. It seems to me that when we request the appointment of commissions, that is sometimes done so as to soothe our own consciences when we do not have the courage of our convictions and want to put the blame and the responsibility on the commissions.</p>

<p>But there are a few matters which are fairly clear to me. The first is that in South Africa&#x2014;I do not want to talk about other countries&#x2014;it is very essential to have a deterrent as far as certain crimes are concerned. The hon. member for Houghton said that she was not so sure that the death penalty was a deterrent, but I think it is, because if we are opposed to this principle we must be consistent. The death penalty has not even been abolished altogether in England. They have retained the death penalty for treason and for certain other offences, as it acts as a deterrent against the commission of those crimes. Certain people in England were obviously of the opinion that those crimes were more contrary to the national interests than murder, and that is why they have retained the death penalty as a deterrent.</p>

<p>But there is another reason for punishment, and that is retribution. For example, I now have in mind a case I know about, where a long-term prisoner escaped from prison and murdered a man, a Mr. Rabie, here in the Western Province&#x2014;I should not like to talk about other cases as they are still being investigated&#x2014;in a most gruesome way in Worcester two years ago. Now, does the hon. member honestly want to believe that the public will allow such things to happen, namely to give a life prisoner the right to escape and murder Mr. Rabie in the brutal and gruesome way in which he did so, whereupon he should only be sentenced to imprisonment once again?</p>

<p>I think a fine thing which the hon. member for Houghton may do is this. She said this afternoon that we should improve social conditions in South Africa and that we should no longer have migratory labour. Incidentally, I agree with her in this respect; I should like social conditions to be improved and I am not in favour of migratory labour, but I wonder whether the hon. member for Houghton will get up for once and stale emphatically that criminals who commit murder, criminals who plant bombs and criminals who come over our borders to kill other people will be punished for committing murder and whether that will not serve as a stronger deterrent. But I have never, not on a single occasion, heard the hon. member for Houghton telling wrongdoers, saboteurs and people trained overseas that they will get their just desserts in South Africa if they continue to do these things.</p>

<p>I admire the humanity and the motives of the hon. member for Houghton. Nobody likes the death penalty. I will definitely have made a bad Judge, because it will tear me virtually in two to condemn somebody to the gallows. But fortunately we have Judges who are probably more courageous than I am in the execution of their duties, and in South Africa nobody is lightly sentenced to death and hanged. I should like to refer the hon. member for Houghton to the report of the commission from which she herself quoted, i.e. the Report of the Penal and Prison Reforms Commission of 1947, the Lansdown Commission. In this Report an exposition is given of the entire procedure, including the procedure which is followed after a person has been convicted and has been sentenced to death. Nobody is lightly taken to the gallows without there being any procedures for still giving him a last chance. I do not want to go into this as I happen to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North). I think most people support it and I think the hon. the Minister will also support it, because it can do no harm and, of course, things may always improve. This whole argument hinges on the death penalty for murder, but I think the best argument that I can use in favour of the retention of the death penalty&#x2014;and I want the hon. member for Houghton to listen, because I know she is interested in those people&#x2014;is to protect the Coloureds from other <span class="col_2601-2602" refersTo="page_1323"/>Coloureds, and the Bantu from other Bantu. I do not know how well she knows these people, but if to-night I were to go to the Coloureds and the Bantu I know, after I had voted in this House this afternoon for the abolition of the death penalty for murderers, I would not be very popular with my own Coloureds and Bantu. I will take her to fine, respectable, decent Bantu before whom I grew up and who told me not so long ago, &#x201C;Sir, you must tell the people up there that in the olden days before the white man held his hand of justice over the Transkei the life of a Bantu was not worth as much as that of a little bird&#x201D;. I know the motives of the hon. member for Houghton are fine ones, but I do not think she knows the everyday life of these people as I do. The few intellectuals with whom she comes into contact, do not constitute the masses of the Bantu. She does not realize how little it means for one Bantu to kill another Bantu and there is only one deterrent for him and that is death. He knows no other.</p>

<p>Is that why nine murders are committed per day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No. I do not want to be as dogmatic as the hon. member for Houghton and say that I know everything but I just want to ask her this question. Has she ever given it any thought whether all these things, such as extenuating circumstances, do any good? These people go as far as saying amongst themselves that it is easy for one man to kill another, because you simply say you were drunk or had smoked dagga. I wonder whether we should not give some consideration to the other side of the picture as well, and that is that drunkenness should not be regarded as constituting extenuating circumstances but as constituting aggravating circumstances. I think we must be realistic. We have a responsibility towards ourselves as members of this House. I think that the average white person can look after himself fairly well and there are not daily onslaughts on his life. The number of murders committed by Coloureds on Whites are few and the number committed by Whites on Coloureds even fewer, but the murders committed by Coloureds on Coloureds are large in number. We would not be doing those people a service if we were to do anything which would cause the number of murders committed by those people among themselves to increase. I do think the hon. member for Houghton has given this matter deep thought. I think she was advised by others. They are people who mean well. We know who they are. They are decent, Christian people. [Interjections.] With the word &#x201C;Christian&#x201D; I am not referring to a religious sect. I mean that these people are inherently decent and well-meaning people, but people who do not have sufficient knowledge of the nature, the way of life, the way of thinking and the philosophy of all the peoples who inhabit this country. Therefore I see no need for even discussing this matter. I think it is fairly clear from the arguments and figures and the evidence quoted here this afternoon that there is absolutely no need for this motion. I may just point out to the hon. member that this evening&#x2019;s paper&#x2014;unfortunately I do not have it here at the moment&#x2014;contains a short article published in pursuance of the figures which were published last Wednesday and which, although she does not deny them, are of no value according to her. This article also deals with capital punishment. This article states that the debate on capital punishment may be postponed because of political pressure and the political implications of this question. The article was written in England. That is why I say that it is a pity that the hon. member introduced this motion. She said this afternoon that we should abolish the death penalty because if we did not do so we would give the outside world a weapon to use against us. Sir, the outside world does not have so much responsibility as regards law and order and law-abidingness in this country. We are carrying the full responsibility. If the outside world is to criticize us and to prescribe to us what we have to do in order to protect our own people in South Africa, that will be a late day in the history of this country. I regret having to say this, but there are certain people in the outside world who are wanton enough to want to see chaos and trouble in this country, as it will be to their advantage if peace and quiet and order were not to prevail in this country, as they are prevailing in my opinion.</p>

<p>I do not think I need say anything more in this regard. I do not want to go any deeper into the theory. I cannot go into that. Perhaps I do not know as much about that as the hon. member for Houghton does. But I, who come into contact with the less privileged people every day, know to what extent they are in need of the protection and the assistance of the hon. member for Houghton as well as of this House. These are the people whose social upliftment she wants to help bring about, and if I am able I shall assist her in doing so. I hope the hon. member for Houghton will not even ask for her motion to be put.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank hon. members very sincerely for conducting this debate at a very high level, and also for the contributions they made. Some speakers, such as the last one, adopted a practical approach, other speakers, again, quoted from reports, but in general the debating was of a very high duality, and I am grateful for that. I want to begin by asking the hon. member for Houghton what really prompted her motion of this afternoon. I tried to trace that. I have studied this matter over the past two or three years. I shall try to indicate what prompted the motion. I refer to a speech made by the Hon. Mr. Justice Cloete. According to a report in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> of 16th June, 1966, Mr. Justice Cloete made a speech before the Temple Israel. On that occasion he delivered a plea for the abolition of capital punishment. <span class="col_2603-2604" refersTo="page_1324"/>He mentioned the usual arguments. He referred to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice occurring. He also said he did not believe that it was really a deterrent. I was not aware that Mr. Justice Hiemstra had also referred to this matter. This is news to me. Furthermore I believe that an article by a certain David Welsh in 1966 also contributed to this matter coming to the fore. He is a senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town. He also expressed the same ideas. He said that capital punishment was no super-deterrent. He also pointed out the possibility of a miscarriage of justice occurring. He also repeated the old story that the living conditions of these people should be improved. According to him, this would solve everything. So far we have now heard from Mr. Justice Cloete and Mr. Welsh. Last year Dr. Van Niekerk of the University of the Witwatersrand also delivered a plea in this connection. He pointed out that nearly half of all the executions in the world occurred in this country. I just want to say in passing that this is the same Dr. Van Niekerk who is reported to have said the following the other day&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many of South Africa&#x2019;s Sunday Observance Laws, which tend to enforce a particular brand of puritanical morality on the whole population, are harsh, ludicrous, oppressive and out of touch with the spirit of the times, and should be revoked&#x2014;says Mr. B. van Niekerk (I notice that he is now being called &#x201C;Mr.&#x201D;), a Johannesburg advocate and senior lecturer in law at the University of the Witwatersrand. In a hard-hitting article in the latest issue of the South African Law Journal, Mr. Van Niekerk urges &#x201C;a legislative spring-cleaning among the anachronistic cobwebs of our Sabbath legislation&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This shows you the mentality of this particular person. Now, this was the hon. member&#x2019;s starting-point. In this she saw an opportunity to gain publicity for herself. She then announced that she would move this motion during this Session. In the meantime, I must say, the <i>Star</i> also encouraged her to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Yes, but I am just mentioning it to the hon. member. Then we had the following report: &#x201C;Helen Suzman wants inquiry into abolition of executions&#x201D;. After that the fat was in the fire. The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> had the following headline: &#x201C;Judicial killings&#x201D;. Then a very honest man, for whom I have great respect, said: &#x201C;The hangman has never solved any problem&#x201D;. This was written by a certain Mr. Robert Olufsen and it is a very good article. I attached great value to it. The next report in support of this was the article by Mrs. Madeleine van Biljon. She again used the usual arguments. That is all. However, I found it very interesting that these arguments were advanced by newspaper correspondents only. In addition the lecturers from the University of Cape Town and the University of the Witwatersrand also wrote articles. But there was also an honest man who felt very strongly about the matter, a certain Mr. Kronenberg. When he noticed that there was no public reaction in this connection, he wrote the following in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 22nd January, 1969&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You reported that an M.P. intends to introduce in Parliament a motion for an inquiry into the abolition of the death penalty. This move has my wholehearted support. I have looked in vain for letters of approval from your readers, and therefore I voice my opinion.</block>

<p>He is still looking &#x201C;in vain&#x201D;. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If often vocal clergymen remain silent when the question of the death penalty is again pushed to the front, then it is certainly no wonder vested interests try to kill the idea through silence.</block>

<p>This is not a question of &#x201C;vested interests&#x201D;. The fact of the matter is simply that the public feels no urge for this. Public opinion is not asking for this.</p>

<p>Now, what do we have on the other side? In the first place I have here the reaction of Professor Venter of the University of Pretoria. He said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The administration of justice in South Africa is objective and sympathetic and there is no justification for an inquiry into the desirability of the abolition of the death penalty.</block>

<p>That is his comment. Then a serving Judge wrote me a letter in which he stated, &#x201C;I do not think public opinion in South Africa would tolerate the abolition of the death penalty&#x201D;. Ex-Judge Leslie Blackwell is reported to have written&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the death sentence was abolished in South Africa, violence would increase, the Hon. Leslie Blackwell, a former Supreme Court Judge, said to-day.</block>

<p>This is what a former Judge said. Now I just want to quote to hon. members from a document that was submitted to the Executive Council. I want to refer hon. members to a certain case. The report submitted to the Executive Council was prepared in English. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>This was only a short while ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; by a Judge and assessors of the murder of John McKay Johnson, a white male of 71 years, and was sentenced to death. The prisoner was charged in the alternative with robbery.</block>

<p>This is just in passing. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The facts of the case fall within a very narrow compass. The deceased was alone in his home at 39, Strathearn Road, Greenwood Park, Durban, on the evening of 7th April, 1968. His wife and son were visiting friends. The prisoner gained access to the house through the bathroom window after he had smashed the pane in the window and had opened it. His apparent object was theft. The deceased was in his bedroom and the time was about 7 o&#x2019;clock. There in his bedroom the deceased was stabbed to death by the prisoner. He inflicted seven wounds in all. Two of these wounds were of a superficial nature, but five were penetrating stab wounds of the left chest, which involved the heart, the left lung and the carotid artery. The instrument used was, in all probability, an object referred to in the evidence as a &#x201C;spike&#x201D; or a stiletto. This instrument, which resembled a screwdriver, was found outside the house on the premises with blood on it during the course of the investigations which followed.</block>

<p>Now hon. members must remember that this was an old man of 71 years who was living peacefully in his house and who was alone at home the evening it happened. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Presiding Judge, in passing the sentence, said that this was &#x201C;a callous and brutal murder of a man in the evening of his life, a murder committed after his home had been forcibly broken into. Speaking for myself, it is a case of this kind which demonstrates how necessary it is to have a death sentence in this country.&#x201D;</block>

<p>These are the words of a serving Judge. I have another case here of a young Coloured man of 23 years who was convicted of the murder of an eighty-year-old white woman by a Judge and assessors on 7th June, 1967, here in Cape Town, and was sentenced to death. I want the hon. member to listen to this. This document reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It appears from the evidence that the deceased was living alone in a caravan at Stanford Bay, approximately 1&#x00BD; miles from Gansbaai, near Hermanus. Apparently she was in the habit of going from Stanford Bay to Gansbaai on foot in order to do her business there. On 10th March, 1967, she again went to Gansbaai on foot, apparently in order to do her shopping, and she was returning to Stanford Bay at approximately half-past seven the same evening. She was again on foot. At some place or other along the road the condemned person, who was proceeding in the same direction as the deceased, came across the deceased and killed her in a brutal and merciless way. He kicked her; he hit her with his fists; he strangled her; he assaulted her so violently that some of her lower teeth were knocked out. He either struck or kicked in the bridge of her nose. He caused her neck to be dislocated; he either struck or kicked in a rib. In addition he inflicted multiple abrasions and lacerations on her. Her death was in fact caused by the multiple injuries that were inflicted upon her.</block>

<p>The court found that the motive was financial gain. The Judge found him guilty of the crime or murder, and said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">May I add, not murder in any technical sense of the word, but a brutal, cruel, inhuman murder. It virtually forms part of anyone&#x2019;s make-up to adopt a protective attitude towards old people. One would have expected, even of this accused, that he would have respected a person of the age of the deceased, even if for no other reason than for her age. But this did not deter him from committing his horrible act.</block>

<p>The Judge goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Morally speaking, his action is as reprehensible as can be, and if ever there was a case where, in my opinion, the death penalty not only should be imposed but ought to be imposed, then it is the case with which I am now dealing.</block>

<p><span class="col_2607-2608" refersTo="page_1326"/>These views were expressed by Judges who are serving on the Bench and have to deal with cases of this nature. I mentioned to hon. members those who have expressed themselves in favour of the retention of the death penalty. I have here a letter from one of our Attor-neys-General. He wrote to me (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not have the slightest doubt that, should the death penalty be abolished, there would be an enormous increase in the number of serious crimes for which the death penalty may be imposed at the moment, and that defenceless persons in particular, such as women and also old people who are living alone, will suffer most as a result. At present criminals in most cases do not take the lives of women who are raped and persons who are robbed, precisely because their experience of what happens in the courts has taught them that they stand a very good chance of escaping the death penalty if they do not kill their victims. If the death penalty should be abolished it would be an incentive to them to kill their victims in order permanently to remove evidence against them, because they would then know that even if the State should obtain other evidence on which they can be convicted, they would not be hanged in any case.</block>

<p>This comes from an Attorney-General. I received the following very well-reasoned document in which statistics appear from the Commissioner of Prisons. He writes (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Considering the above-mentioned particulars it is recommended: (1) that the existing legislation which provides for the imposition of the death penalty, whether mandatory or discretionary, remain unchanged.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The alternative to the death penalty is a life sentence, and the question arises whether such a sentence is not more cruel than the death penalty itself; for if a youth of 21, 22 years is imprisoned for the rest of his life, his body may continue to live, but all hope and all prospects are taken away from him, which must kill his spirit.</block>

<p>I have received letters from the public as well. I want to read this one to you. It comes from an English-speaking person, who wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir,</block>

<block name="quote"><i>Abolishment of Capital Punishment</i></block>

<block name="quote">On reading a report in the <i>Argus</i> on 30th January on issues which will be raised in Parliament during the coming session, I came across one titled &#x201C;Mrs. Helen Suzman&#x2019;s move to have the death penalty in South Africa eliminated&#x201D;. As a believer in the Lord Jesus, I cannot refrain from making representations as to the evil of this move. One of the first laws in the Scripture after the Flood was &#x201C;Whoso sheddeth mans&#x2019; blood, by man shall his blood be shed&#x201D;.</block>

<p>He then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I trust my representations will receive your earnest consideration.</block>

<p>He pleads for that. I also want to tell the hon. member that the <i>Cape Times</i> did not hold out much hope for her, because this paper wrote the following in an editorial, with reference to what happened in America at one time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All this would probably not have come about if it had not been for long agitation by abolitionist organizations and opposition to capital punishment by an estimated half of the American people. Mrs. Suzman and those who share her views will not have the advantage of similar moral support. They can expect only apathy where they do not find actual opposition.</block>

<p>Here is an item from the <i>Cape Argus</i> as well. The report apparently refers to letters received by the hon. member. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Something of the intensity of the feeling against the move may be gauged from anonymous letters received by Mrs. Suzman accusing her of siding with murderers and rapers as well as kaffirs.</block>

<p>I do not know whether she received these letters. I take it she showed these letters to the Press.</p>

<p>Before coming to the other documents, I am merely mentioning these things to show that on the part of the public there has been absolutely no demand for the abolition of this, In fact, people would take it amiss of us if we abolished it. I appreciate the words expressed by the hon. member for Durban (North) when he said we were not a debating society; that we should realize what we are doing here and should not just take decisions lightly. We must take the circumstances in this country into account, we must take into account what the people of this country are asking for. The hon. member said we had to take the lead, and that is so, but we cannot go completely against public opinion in taking the lead, particularly not in a case such as this.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the Royal Commission. I do not want to refer to all the findings of the Commission, but evidence was submitted to the Commission to the effect that capital punishment was indeed an effective deterrent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There was also an opposite opinion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but there was this definite evidence. I can quote it to the hon. member if she wants me to. Various persons <span class="col_2609-2610" refersTo="page_1327"/>gave evidence to the effect that they definitely considered it to be a deterrent. Sir Harold Scott, Commissioner of Police in Britain, gave evidence to this effect. Similar evidence was given in New Zealand. The evidence referred to a person who had committed two murders in 1948 and who said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You do not get hanged for murder nowadays; even if you commit murder nowadays you only get eight years for it. That is a good Government we have!</block>

<p>Another person said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is eight years anyway? You do not get hanged for murder nowadays anyway.</block>

<p>In a third case a certain person decided to murder seven people. He made no secret of it, and declared that seven years&#x2019; imprisonment was a light sentence. In this way various persons gave evidence of this nature. What is of more importance to me is the fact that we can learn from the experience of other countries. This Royal Commission found that capital punishment was abolished in various countries at some stage, but subsequently reintroduced. It found, for example, that in New Zealand capital punishment was abolished in 1941 and reintroduced in 1951. The Commissioner of Police gave the following evidence before the Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my opinion the abolition of capital punishment is a reduction of the penalty and thus the deterrent is reduced and the gravity of the crime also reduced. The majority of persons charged with murder are of below average mentality.</block>

<p>What happened in the U.S.A.? In Washington capital punishment was abolished in 1913 but reintroduced in 1919. Let me quote from a document on what happened there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Legislature evidently regarded capital punishment as a deterrent force, for it was restored after a trial of six years of life imprisonment as the maximum penalty.</block>

<p>In Oregon capital punishment was abolished in 1941 and reintroduced in 1920. In Tennessee it was abolished in 1915 and reintroduced in 1919. The Attorney-General there said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After the repeal of the Capital Punishment Act of 1915, we had a reign of crime of the most heinous nature in this State, which brought about a complete reversal of public sentiment upon the subject and therefore resulted in the repeal of this Act in 1919.</block>

<p>In Missouri it was abolished in 1917 and reintroduced in 1919. There the Attorney-General said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the period immediately following abolition capital crimes occurred with such frequency that the public sentiment of the State demanded the restoration of the death penalty.</block>

<p>In Kansas it was abolished in 1887 and reintroduced in 1935. In a certain document the following appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the contributing factors leading to the re-enactment of the death penalty for first degree murder, was the fact that shortly prior thereto numerous deliberate murders were committed in Kansas by persons who had previously committed murder in States surrounding Kansas, where their punishment, if captured, could have been the death penalty.</block>

<p>In Dakota it was abolished in 1915 and reintroduced in 1939. In Switzerland it was abolished at one stage, and later 10 of 25 cantons reintroduced it. To return to the U.S.A.&#x2014;in Maryland it was abolished, but subsequently reintroduced. All these facts are given in the report of the Royal Commission.</p>

<p>I mentioned a few cases to hon. members where Judges expressed their views on this matter. I want to mention a few more cases so that hon. members may see what sort of thing is happening in our country. I want to refer to a particularly gruesome case, and I want the hon. member to imagine herself in the shoes of the lady concerned. The hon. member for Durban (North) will notice that in all the cases I am going to mention there were a Judge and two assessors on the bench. On 5th September, 1968, a certain prisoner, a 21-year-old Coloured man, was found guilty by the Judge and two assessors in the Uitenhage Local Circuit Division of the Supreme Court of having on 18th May, 1968, raped and killed a 73-year-old white woman at Kabeljous River in the Humansdorp district. The circumstances were as follows. On 16th May, 1968, the murderer suggested to a fellow farm worker that they should break into the house on the farm on which they were employed at the time, and in which the 73-year-old Hermina Katarina Ferreira was living by herself. Early the evening of 18th May, 1968, the prisoner went to Mrs. Ferreira&#x2019;s house and attacked her in the garden in front of the house while she was busy watering her plants with a hose-pipe.</p>

<p>I can picture the scene so well. There the old lady is standing, she is 73 years old, and she is watering her plants in the evening. [Interjection.] No, the hon. member should listen now. While she was busy in this way, this is what happened to her. The prisoner and, according to a confession made by him, an accomplice threw Mrs. Ferreira to the ground on her back, ripped her underclothes off her body, and raped her. Remember this was a 73-year-old lady. Then he hit her over the eyes, nose and face with a stone of 8&#x00BD; lbs. with such violence that two holes were made in the skull near the eye sockets, damaging the brain and causing her <span class="col_2611-2612" refersTo="page_1328"/>death. This is the sort of person for whom the hon. member is pleading here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point pointed out that the Coloureds have to be protected against one another as well. I want to mention to the hon. member the case of a group of Coloureds, and what happened in Bishop Lavis. The parents of a decent Coloured family sent their fifteen-year-old daughter to a nearby shop to buy something there. The Scheepers girl was walking across the school grounds when the prisoner seized her and, pressing a knife to her throat, ordered her not to shout for help. She was only 15 years old. He gagged her with a handkerchief, and kicked her legs from under her. One of the prisoner&#x2019;s cronies ripped off her briefs and had sexual intercourse with her and then the prisoner also raped her. While each of the other six members of the gang raped her in turn, the prisoner went to his abode nearby, and on his return to the place where the rapes had occurred, he asked the others whether they had finished with their victim. Then the prisoner carried her to another place next to the school building and raped her again. This was the ninth time. He suggested to the other members of the gang that they should kill her in order to prevent her from laying a charge against them. She then appealed to one of the prisoner&#x2019;s cronies and promised to go with that person if he should prevent the prisoner from killing her. The person she had appealed to started to walk her away from the others, when the prisoner ran up to them and with the words &#x201C;dead men tell no tales&#x201D; snatched her away and stabbed her repeatedly in the head, neck and body with a knife. She tried to ward off these stabs with her hands and one of the stabs penetrated her right hand. One of the approximately 29 stab wounds that caused her death penetrated her liver. The father of the deceased discovered her blood-stained body the next morning near the school building where she had been murdered. She was killed after she had been raped nine times. This is the sort of case one has to deal with, and which one has to take into account.</p>

<p>It is a fact that our execution rate is extremely high, but our crime rate is extremely high too. The increase in the crime rate is naturally causing concern. Crime is of course a world wide phenomenon, because people want to get rich quickly and so forth. I should like to mention a few figures to the House which cause me concern, and in respect of which I at this stage really do not know what to do. I am certain of one thing, however, and that is that this motion of the hon. member is not the solution. In 1950 the number of deaths as a result of murder was 827. and in 1966 it was 3.119. In 1950. 1.341 persons were charged with murder and in 1966, 4.531. In 1950 357 persons were convicted, and in 1966, 1.456. I can also classify the convictions according to population groups and I think I should mention those figures here as well. The largest increase was in respect of Coloured men, next in respect of Bantu men, thirdly in respect of Coloured women, fourthly in the case of Bantu women, then in respect of white men, and then male Asiatics, while the figures in respect of white women and female Asiatics remained constant. I also want to mention the convictions per 100.000 of the various population groups. In 1950 3.6 Bantu per 100.000 were convicted, and in 1960, 10.06 per 100,000. I want the hon. member to take particular note of this figure of 10.06. In 1950 3.2 Coloureds per 100.000 were convicted, and in 1966 9.39 per 100 000. The figures per 100.000 in respect of Asiatics decreased, because in 1950 the figure was 2 and in 1966 it was 1.82. In 1950 .5 Whites per 100,000 were convicted, and in 1966 the figure was .6 per 100,000. I want to underline this figure of 10.06 in respect of the Bantu population and to compare it to that in respect of the Whites.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its gratitude to the Government for the many measures adopted during the past two decades in order to promote the socio-economic welfare of the Coloured population, and, in view of the rapid increase of the Coloured population of the Peninsula and the phenomenal rise in land prices in this area, requests the Government to consider the advisability of taking steps for reserving and, if need be, buying sufficient land in addition to the earmarked area on the Cape Flats, for the future settlement and development of the Coloured population of the Peninsula.</block>

<p>In discussing this motion I should like to focus attention on the Coloured population of South Africa, and I want to indicate in broad outline what the Government has accomplished during the past two decades for this population group. In addition I want to focus attention on the distribution of the Coloured population throughout the Republic of South Africa and on their exceptionally high rate of increase. I should also like to ask that we take cognizance of the particular place they occupy in the Peninsula and the urgent need for a reasonable degree of far-sightedness on the part of our authorities to make timeous provision for future community development in the light of the growing numbers of our Coloured population in the Peninsula. According to available figures the Coloured population numbered 1,829,521 at the beginning of 1967. According to estimates the number of Coloureds at the beginning of 1969 was approximately 2 million, fully half of the white population of South Africa and one-tenth of the total population of the Republic <span class="col_2613-2614" refersTo="page_1329"/>of South Africa. We are therefore dealing here with a considerable minority group which occupies a very important place in the socioeconomic set-up of the Western Cape. Since it came into power in 1948 this Government has definitely devoted a great deal of attention to the needs of the Coloured population. We are aware of the fact that by no means all the Coloureds appreciate what the Government has done for them; that by no means all the Coloureds support or accept the policy of separate development which the Government advocates and implements, and that by no means all of them are satisfied with the position of the Coloured population in South Africa. However, there are few Coloureds who would not concede that a great deal has been done to further the socio-economic welfare of the Coloured population. When we consider the establishment of group areas and review the position 20 to 30 years ago, we realize and are forced to admit that slum conditions were the order of the day. The residential areas of the Coloured community, with the exception of a small number of better residential areas, were for the most part the backward areas and the slums of the white cities or towns. That is why slum clearance and the allocation of new group areas, which were reserved for the Coloured population, has been a primary task of the Government since it came into power in 1948. Mr. Speaker, what opportunity was there for an unorganized, underdeveloped, less well-to-do or indigent Coloured population to acquire sizeable residential areas? If the Government had not intervened, established group areas and reserved and purchased land for the settlement of Coloured communities, there was no chance at all that such areas would have been established. There is in fact room for criticism, but if one has to ask oneself the question to-day: &#x201C;What would Cape Town and its environs have looked like to-day, after 20 to 30 years development as we have experienced, if a start had not been made with the establishment of group areas?&#x201D; then this is a question to which it is difficult to supply an answer. We still remember the familiar, unsightly Windermere which was situated right on the doorstep of Cape Town here, and the question is: What great measure of exploitation of Coloureds by owners of slum buildings would not still have existed to-day if the Government had not taken those steps? If one sees what race friction exists in a highly developed country such as the United States, then the question is: Would we have been spared the friction of mixed residential areas, where Whites and non-Whites live next to one another? Would Cape Town, if it had developed according to the old integrationistic pattern, still have been spared race riots to-day? Mr. Speaker, I definitely do not think that it would have been spared these things. If we consider housing, then I think we can state that the housing programme which has been carried out during the past two decades by this Government for the Coloured population is without doubt an exceptionally noteworthy achievement. One can travel the length and breadth of the Western Cape platteland and find that there is almost no town where a reasonably neat, decent, Coloured housing scheme has not been introduced; and if one considers the Peninsula, then it is simply spectacular that we have been able, in so short a time, to build so many houses&#x2014;simple houses, but so many of them&#x2014;for this community which really faced an emergency housing situation. During the five years between 1962 and 1967 no fewer than 33,812 residential units for Coloureds were built in the Republic of South Africa at a cost of R33 million. It is repeatedly being said that the standard of this housing is too low; that the lay-out of these residential areas is too monotonous and colourless. I am inclined to say that I hope we will be able to improve on this in future, but I am certain that it is the ideal of the Departments of Coloured Affairs and Community Development to improve the situation. But we must view the provision which has been made here in the light of the circumstances in which it took place. It is a matter in regard to which there was far too much prevarication in the past, i.e. before the National Party Government came into power. There was no planning, no order, no vision, and it was necessary to start from scratch. It was therefore, to a high degree an emergency provision; it had to be done rapidly, and it had to be done on a large scale, and the fact that it was possible to establish it in such a relatively short time, merits only praise, and this praiseworthy work is continuing year by year because the demand for housing on the part of our Coloured community is a growing demand and because this is a growing and rapidly growing population group.</p>

<p>So much in brief, Mr. Speaker, in regard to housing and the establishment of group areas. Time does not allow me to elaborate on educational matters, but I just want to state that according to the available figures for the second semester of 1967 there were at that stage already 1,810 schools for Coloureds in the Republic of South Africa, and I may add, there were also high schools for the Coloured population situated at the most strategic points, in the large towns; there were 13,138 teachers and 48,562 Coloured children at these schools. Of this 429,562, 373,000 were attending school in the Cape Province. There were 129,000 here in the Peninsula within ten to fifteen miles from the heart of Cape Town. When we consider more advanced training facilities, we see that there are 13 training colleges with 1,799 students and 14 vocational schools with 3,126 students, a university college with a staff of 68 and 655 students, and on this level the development is continuing. As we know, and as we expect, this institution will shortly acquire university status. That, Sir, was not brought about in a day; it was not merely <span class="col_2615-2616" refersTo="page_1330"/>a question of saying the word; this is a task which has with effort been tackled and accomplished by the Department of Coloured Affairs during the past few years, with the aid of church bodies as well. I feel myself quite at liberty to say that this great task, particularly in respect of the educational facilities for our Coloured population, redounds to the credit of South Africa and our Government.</p>

<p>I should just like to mention a few things in regard to the development on the economic level. Our Coloured population, as you know, is enjoying the benefit of wage increases at the present stage of progress and development. A considerable percentage of our Coloured population to-day no longer fall under the lower income group but are well-remunerated people. They live on a reasonably high standard, many of them in houses for which they are paying sub-economic rentals. They themselves admit, when you ask them about this, that the house rent they are paying is in many cases a nominal amount. Even where their rental has been adjusted and they have to pay rental on an economic basis, they still pay very little. Separate residential areas have opened new doors to the Coloured businessman. As businessmen they to-day have preference and protection in their own group areas, and they realize this and appreciate it. The establishment of the Coloured Development Corporation was a step taken by the Government to lend positive financial assistance to prospective Coloured businessmen. Already large amounts have been made available and a considerable number of these people have been placed in a position where they were able to become employers, entrepreneurs, owing to the capital which was placed at their disposal.</p>

<p>Looking at the platteland we see that development of the Coloured population on a rural level has also taken place. We hear so often that the responsible Coloureds who are active there in the interests of their people, who take the lead there, who are helping to support the Department of Coloured Affairs there, admit that here for the first time in the history of their people something substantial is being done.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with this I want to end my argument in regard to what the Government has been doing for the Coloured population at this juncture. I now want to focus attention on the distribution and the growth of the Coloured population. The bulk of the Coloured population is living in the Cape Province. Of the figure of 1,829,000 more than 1&#x00BD; million are living in the Cape Province. Of that number 856,000 are living in the nucleus area of the Western Cape, i.e. the relatively small area west of a line drawn through Swellendam, Ceres, Piketberg, i.e. the lesser Western Cape, and of those 856,000 more than 500,000 are living in the Peninsula. This could probably, owing to the movements to the cities and the rapid increase in the Coloured population, be closer to 600,000 to-day than to 500,000, but at this juncture we can safely put it at approximately 550,000 Coloureds here in the Peninsula, approximately one-third of the Coloured population of the Cape. You will allow me, Sir, by way of a conclusion to my argument, to make a projection of the growth of the Coloured population of the Cape Province during the ensuing three decades. According to available data the Coloured population of the Cape Province at the beginning of 1967 totalled 1,554,000. According to estimates the Coloured population of the Cape alone will be 2.383.000 by the year 1980, and will be 3.584.000 by the year 2000. In other words, the rate of growth of the Coloured population is an exceptionally high one, and if we accept on the basis of past experience the growth tendency as it existed and as it is revealing itself at present, then we can state that the Coloured population more or less doubles itself in a period of 30 years. Then I want to focus attention on the fact that by the year 2030 the Coloured population of the Cape will number approximately 7 million, i.e. within two generations. I see hon. members are looking at me with a measure of surprise. I do not pretend to be a good prophet, but this is a figure which we arrive at on the basis of the present rate of growth of the Coloured population, and this emphasizes for us the need for far-sightedness, particularly with a view to the provision of accommodation, the settlement of the Peninsular portion of the Coloured population, because our Cape platteland is extensive; it is still possible for a great deal of development to take place there; more large towns and cities can be laid out at a distance if the circumstances of the time require this. But I foresee that the Peninsular Coloured population will number between 2 to 3 million by the dates I mentioned, i.e. within 30, 50 and 60 years. I want to state that I do not regard it as a Coloured problem. I do not think it is necessary for us to view it in this light. All I want is that we should view this matter soberly and calmly and make provision for it. In addition we must bear in mind that there is still the continual tendency of a migration to the city with its higher wages and better opportunities for employment and greater facilities. Living to-day in the triangle between Woodstock, Bellville South and Wynberg are half a million Coloureds. By the year 2000 they could easily number one million, and the probability is that they would have increased from 1.2 million to 1.5 million. And if we look one generation ahead it is 3 million. That is why I find it essential that we should recognize this as our responsibility and make provision for it. If we allow this to continue unplanned we will experience a population pressure, particularly in the Peninsula and in the Cape Flats, which may create special problems for us. I just want to point out that land prices have in the meantime increased tremendously in the Cape <span class="col_2617-2618" refersTo="page_1331"/>Peninsula and surrounding areas. Twenty miles from Cape Town to-day people are paying from R500 to R700 per morgen for worthless land on the mere rumour that there is a possibility that a township may be established. [Interjection.] Somebody here is mentioning the figure of R2,000 per morgen. For the sake of my argument, let us take it to be R500 per morgen. Then I want to emphasize the fact that we must bear this in mind, because we are dealing here with a phenomenal increase in land prices. Vacant plots in White areas to-day in quite modest urban areas cost up to R10,000, for a building site. The Whites in the lower income group cannot afford them. The Coloured population as a whole cannot afford them. The Coloureds are excluded from that market. Among them there is no body which has the capital at its disposal to say: Here we are purchasing 2,000 or 3,000 morgen in order to make provision for the future. In other words, it is the State&#x2019;s responsibility. It is the duty of the State. Nobody would lift a hand if South Africa found itself in a dilemma in a half century&#x2019;s time. Precisely because the State has in the past done this in such a praiseworthy manner and made this provision, I want to put in a plea to-day to the effect that the Minister and the Government consider this matter with the necessary far-sightedness. That is why I should like consideration to be given to the purchasing of an area which lends itself to this purpose. To that I want to add that we must get away from the idea of a local Coloured residential area adjoining each White town or urban area. Since we have a large, growing population group which is making an important contribution to our Western Cape economy, we must make provision on a high level and with vision. We must think in terms of the planning and development of a new Coloured city in a district which in future will be able to absorb at least a few million people, and the question is where?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>I am thinking of an area in addition to the Cape Flats, as I suggested in my motion. I do not regard the Cape Flats as being provision enough because specified problems will be created in this area as well. That is why I want to focus attention on an area which I do not want to define any closer. I want to say that we must take into account the fact that the good agricultural land must be reserved for agriculture. This must be left intact. We cannot use the good agricultural land of Stellenbosch, Kuils River and the Koeberg for this purpose. We must look to other areas which are inferior as agricultural land, but are at the same time situated relatively close to the city. That is why I want to say that if we look to the north of Cape Town, north of the Koeberg and north of Melkbosstrand&#x2014;and I am bearing in mind that an area there is being allocated for a nuclear power station&#x2014;but west of the national road and west of Kalbaskraal, there is a considerable undeveloped area, reasonably large, and adjoining the sea, which in my opinion ought to be investigated and if possible purchased and reserved for this future development. It may take 10 to 20 years longer than we think, but as sure as we are sitting here to-day, we will need it. If we do not make that provision the generation which comes after us will accuse us of short-sightedness. A city in this region will afford alleviation of the population pressure which will of necessity have to arise in the Cape Flats and the Peninsula. A city in that region is within daily reach of the labour market in Cape Town. A city in that region would be able to absorb and accommodate the platteland Coloureds so that they will not have to go through District Six and other residential areas here first before they are settled. A city in that region will supply labour to the Peninsula, but at the same time to the agriculture and other industries in Darling, Malmesbury, Wellington and Paarl because all these towns, as well as Cape Town, are situated within a radius of 15 to 20 miles from this region.</p>

<p>Let me emphasize just one more important point, because my time is almost up. I want to add that if the Government is thinking in this direction, as I hope the Minister and the Minister of Planning will do, and the Minister of Community Development as well, then we must also obtain the co-operation of the hon. the Minister of Transport, because the necessary lanes will have to be left open for the development of future roads and railway lines. These are things which must be provided. If we see what has to be done in our large cities to-day, if we see what has to be done in Johannesburg, and if we hear what has to be done elsewhere in the world, where the authorities simply ran up against existing cities and towns, then I think that we must very definitely give consideration to this factor as well and make the necessary provision for it. I am not suggesting that we should ask the Minister of Transport to-day to build a railway line at this juncture to Mamre, for example, which falls within the designated region, but I am very definitely asking the Department of Transport, the Railways, to give the necessary attention and the necessary cooperation in regard to this matter. We must keep those development corridors open for the purposes of building railway lines and main roads.</p>

<p>I am presenting this matter in all good faith, with a view to the future and because it is the Government&#x2019;s duty and our responsibility. At the same time it is also our self-imposed task to make provision for this sector of the population. I want to express the hope that hon. members on both sides of the House will in general support us, and that the hon. the Minister will assist us so that this may also go to prove that the Whites in South Africa are not only well disposed towards the <span class="col_2619-2620" refersTo="page_1332"/>Coloureds but that we are also making positive provision for their future.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>I listened to the hon. member for Piketberg with great interest, and I could not help but think of a hymn which I knew as a small boy, which went: &#x201C;There is a happy land far, far away&#x201D;. This motion tries to deal with the year 2000, but I want to deal with the year 1969. We have heard only recently, after 20 years of promises and 20 years of talk about the sky being the limit, that the Coloured man is a dilemma and that the Government does not know what to do with him, and that we must leave it to posterity. I do not know how many generations posterity is removed from us. The hon. member spoke about two generations. I think posterity lies many generations further away than that, for them to bring their minds to bear on the problem, if that is all the Government can suggest. I believe that the hon. the Minister should apply his mind to the lack of planning. The remedy is in their own hands, inside the Government. The Coloured people in the Peninsula and on the Cape Flats have great difficulties in getting houses. They are not being built fast enough. It is perfectly true to say that every little platteland dorp has a number of houses for Coloured persons. The majority of these houses are sub-economic, and the great complaint I have against the Government and the housing authorities is that the Coloured people are being arbitrarily removed and taken out of the homes in which they lived in the Peninsula and on the Cape Flats and pushed into small properties which are much below their station and standard of living. I believe the whole thing is due to the lack of planning. There is plenty of land in the Cape Flats, especially between Wynberg and False Bay where all these small vegetable farmers are. This is the part of the Peninsula, and the Flats, which should be developed, but why is something not being done? My information is that the Department of Community Development is running up against vested interests and political influences. I do not think we have to go to Kalbaskraal or to Melkbosstrand and other places to the north, to find land for the expansion of housing for the Coloured people, because it is right here with us. I have had conversations with persons associated with the Divisional Council and they will tell you that in their opinion it is a simple matter, by the use of bulldozers, to flatten out the dunes between Strandfontein and the national road, which is an enormous piece of country. You know, of course, Sir, that next month a plan will be produced showing what is suggested in regard to township layout in the Peninsula, and the Coloured people are put even further away than they are now. They are being put on the Swartklip Road. The hon. member said he did not want to ask the Minister of Transport to provide a railway to Mamre, but I think we should have a railway here on the Flats, because I have a letter with me in which a Coloured person complains about having to use the bus from Bonteheuwel to Wynberg at a cost of 23 cents, single, which means 46 cents a day. But this hon. member wants to put them 30 miles away. I asked the Minister of Transport. Not only is he unwilling to provide a railway, but Community Development gets the same answer, that, for these townships on the Flats the Minister of Transport requires a guarantee that he will get the traffic. What happens to these people in the meantime? It is all very well to have a grandiose plan in terms of this motion, but I am a realist and I say that we must get down to the practical stuff.</p>

<p>Oh no, they were. The Transvaal M.P.&#x2019;s were. I know that. That is the whole fact of the matter. There is far too much influence from the Transvaal in the affairs of the Cape Flats and Peninsula.</p>

<p>That is one aspect. Another small aspect is that this hon. member wants to plan for places 30 and 40 miles away. Do you know that when a small township in the Peninsula asked for a telephone service they were told that they could walk the 1.8 miles to the nearest telephone? Just think what happens when people get ill at night. This is the sort of planning that we get. Who worries about them? Nobody. It is only Coloured people. Push them here, push them there, push them anywhere. They have no redress and they can do nothing. Then they are asked to subscribe to a motion thanking the Government for what they have done! It is ludicrous. If it was not so silly it would be criminal. Further, the Divisional Council itself has offered in one township a house for a post office. But the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs cannot find the inclination to establish a post office for these people to use. We hear talk of cooperation. There is the co-operation of our local authorities, but nothing happens. The hon. Minister for Coloured Affairs, I think,.is really trying to do a job. But he is so hedged around by the lack of co-operation between Community Development and Planning that he is unable to make progress. The hon. member could only mention two items in his remarks. Firstly, he gave a chronicle of education or the lack of it, and secondly a talk about separate development. Coloured people <span class="col_2621-2622" refersTo="page_1333"/>think that there is plenty of separation, but very little development. They do not see the development. There is no industrial township where Coloured persons can go into industry, if they should wish to do so. They must get permits and permission from the local authorities. So, we find that this community, who has done no harm to anybody, the most law-abiding and most loyal community in our midst, are the ones who were singled out. If one looks at the Peninsula one will find that all that has been done is that Coloured people have been moved from one place to another. They have not disappeared. They are still there and they will remain there. When we hear talk suggesting that the Government consider dumping them 30 miles away or even further, one must begin to realize that we are getting a little crazy, because these people have to go to work. It costs money. I have a letter here in which a man tells me that he has to travel from Grassy Park to Paarden Eiland. He has to start at 5 o&#x2019;clock in the morning to be at his job at 7 o&#x2019;clock. Imagine what the position would have been, if he had to come from Kalbaskraal. These are the matters which I would like the hon. the Minister to give his attention to, because I think that the Government has enough hay on its fork, especially now that the future of the Coloured people is in a cul de sac. The sky is not the limit any longer. All that talk is gone by the board. When one talks about employment for Coloured people, one realizes with tremendous sadness, that White trade unions are now advising their members that they need not train any Coloured youths other than those who are at present indentured to them. How are these people to learn? The hon. the Minister for Transport has said that he does not allow them to work alongside Whites on the Railways. It is all very well for the other side to have pie-in-the-sky and grandiose ideas and schemes for developing a vast metropolitan complex 30 to 40 miles away from Cape Town. It is possibly true that there will be 7 million, but how many Whites will there be in the year 2030 in this part of the country?&#x2014;7 to 10 million. Is the proposition now that we should move them again over to the north of Bellville or, as the hon. member has said, west of the national road? I think the hon. member is unrealistic. It is easy, as he has said, on the platteland, to stand at Moorreesburg or Piketberg or Springbok, for you can see 50 miles, and there is not much to see. But here in the Peninsula it is a totally different story. I do believe that the Minister should not be concerned about what is going to happen in the year 2030, I think he must start being concerned about what is happening now, in the year 1969. We have had an eulogy from the hon. gentleman about education. Surely the time has come when Coloured education should be compulsory. This hon. member speaks with some pride about the number of Coloured school going children. It is the duty of every State to educate its citizens and these people should go to school, every one of them. Every child should be obliged to go to school&#x2014;the same as the White children do. Then the question comes down to teachers. They are leaving the profession. The reason for that is quite simple. They get a salary about half of what the White teachers earn, whereas they have to maintain the same standard of living and they have to buy at the same prices. They are leaving because they can draw a bigger salary elsewhere. The answer given to that one is, that they should be dedicated to their jobs. It is fair enough for White teachers to be dedicated to their jobs. They are dedicated, but receive top salaries&#x2014;perhaps not even enough for them, but very much higher, and very much more, than what is paid to Coloured teachers. In Coloured primary schools, you get the situation that a lot of teaching is done by married women with no qualifications. The hon. member has talked about the University of the Western Cape. I think the hon. the Minister will get a surprise when we deal with his Bill on that particular university next week. The whole fact of the matter is that the Coloured community is a lost community. All the efforts of the Government have been directed at them. In the old days we used to talk about giving them a Colouredstan. Where is their Colouredstan, where is their homeland, what are they to do? They have lived in the Cape for 300 years, as long as we have. Yet we now talk of them as becoming congested and crowded. I do not believe that this motion which we have before us this afternoon is an innocuous one. I think this a forerunner &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, this is a forerunner of the thinking of the Government, what is commonly known in politics as a change of direction, because you see, Sir, all the ideas which have been enunciated during the years, about the sky being the limit, have come to an end. When one speaks in this House of opportunities for the Coloured people in the Government service, hon. members on that side do nothing but jeer. They jeer at any suggestion which offers employment to the Coloured people. Insinuations are made that we, and myself in particular, are suggesting that these people should be put in charge of Whites, to order and to command, which is not true. The whole of the Government Service, in which they are entitled to a share, is closed to them, because of the attitude of the majority party in this Parliament. The Government has admitted that they have no solution to the colour problem, although last year I was astonished at the heights of eloquence to which certain Government speakers rose in offering the Coloured people this great Utopia, this golden citadel on the hill, namely separate development and their own <span class="col_2623-2624" refersTo="page_1334"/>Parliament. This is what the Coloured people were offered. Whites were to be excluded from their political activities. This happened last year, not 12 months ago. This was the culmination of years of struggle and strife by the governing party. This was the solution, the answer, the panacea to all ills which were bedevilling the Government because the Coloured man was somebody with whom it did not know what to do.</p>

<p>Only yours. Sir, I am going to ask that hon. member a question which I often ask from platforms, and to which I have never had an answer. My question is: The solution to what? That is the point. What is the colour problem? For which problem is a solution required? I should like someone to stand up and tell me what problems the Coloured people create. Do they work? Are they conscientious in their jobs? Are they loyal?</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Are they with us? Do you see them outside? An hon. member spoke just now about the &#x201C;integrasie van die ou dae&#x201D;. I ask any man in his sane senses to tell me this: When one lives here in Cape Town or in the Peninsula and moves about on the Flats, and goes into the factories and shops, who are these other people one sees with dark skins? Are they Coloured people? Are they integrated with us? What is the meaning of integration? Anyone would think that the Government had introduced something new. This is exactly how the Cape has been since Van Riebeeck first got off the ship. The first people to meet him on the beach at Roggebaai were Hottentots. I think it is time the Government became realistic and got down to some basic facts, and stopped all this talk about the Coloured man being a problem. We on this side are often asked, as the Nationalist propagandists on that side know, what our alternative is. My answer to that again is: Alternative to what? I ask this question because there has been no change. Nothing has happened in the Peninsula except that Coloured people have been chased from one part to another. This is the point. Government speakers talk from platforms about solutions. They say that this party is a party of integration. But the actual physical facts are that the Coloured people are here. They will always be here. They will never be anywhere else. The Coloured man is the one genuine South African. They have been born and bred with us. When the hon. member says that, purely because land is expensive, some consideration should be given to the purchasing of land in distant places, I want to say that the hon. the Minister, in collaboration with the Minister of Community Development, the Provincial Administration and the local authorities, should so amend the law that housing required for township purposes shall be regarded as being for public use. As such, it could then be expropriated. Expropriation proceedings would ensure that values were fair, just and equitable.</p>

<p>Sir, I should now like to revert to the Cape Flats. The Joint Town Planning Committee of the Cape Town City Council and of the other municipalities could quite easily solve any problems in regard to land in the Cape Flats if they could find out from the Minister of Community Development what he intends to do. Their problems would be further simplified if the Minister of Planning could make up his mind to tackle the job. The plan which is on the point of being implemented, and which will, I understand, appear in April, makes provision for Coloured housing as far away as Macassar Beach. That is an awfully long way from Cape Town, Sir. Even that is too far. Stretching westwards from Strandfontein towards Claremont and Wynberg are large stretches of countryside which are crying out for development. They are waiting for the local authorities concerned to subdivide them and offer them for sale.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like Government members to get it into their heads that all Coloured people are not sub-economic occupiers or tenants of sub-economic houses. They pay an economic rental as soon as their income rises. They would like to move to bigger and better houses which are simply not available. I think the time is long overdue for the hon. the Minister to have some consultations with the Minister of Community Development to provide for a better type of house for Coloured persons in the businessmen group, the teaching group and the artisan groups. They should get away from the idea that all Coloured persons are sub-economic. The Minister must apply his mind before very long to the provision of proper training for Coloured youths. I concede that he has already done something in this regard, but if Coloured youths are to be trained properly in trades and if they are to become useful citizens, they should be apprenticed to skilled journeymen. That is something which is long overdue.</p>

<p>Finally I should like to say that I cannot support this motion because I think it is a pious one. I shall go further and say that I think it is intended for a purpose which is not very obvious from the words used in the motion. I do not think that this motion was <span class="col_2625-2626" refersTo="page_1335"/>intended as something innocuous for the benefit of the Coloured people in the year 2030.</p>

<speech by="#van_breda">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to react in any way to the contribution of that hon. member. You will understand, Sir, that if one were to react to so much destructive and bitter criticism, one would not be able to conduct a constructive debate. I do want to say, however, that the time for discussing the interests of the Coloureds on the basis of such arguments is fortunately drawing to a close.</p>

<p>To-day I want to confine myself, in the first place, to the astronomical increase in the Coloured population here in the Cape Peninsula. In the course of my discussion I want to try and indicate to you, Sir, how vital this motion moved by the hon. member for Piketberg is in point of fact, and how necessary it is for active steps to be taken in the spirit in which he moved his motion. To-day I want to state it as a fact that nearly one-third of the Coloured population of the Republic is living in the complex of Greater Cape Town. This phenomenal growth in the Coloured population occurred mainly in the post-war years when there was a tremendous flow to the Peninsula as a result of an industrial revolution. It appears from figures that the white population of the Cape Peninsula increased by 140 per cent in the period between the 1921 census and the 1960 census, but that proportionately the Coloured population increased by 271 per cent. Now the expectations are that in the next decade, in other words, up to 1980, the Peninsula will have a population increase of approximately 351,000, of which number 283,000 will be Coloureds. The ratio between White and non-White will then be two to one in favour of the Coloureds. As the hon. member for Piketberg indicated, the conservative estimate is that the total population of the Peninsula will be at least two million by the year 2000. He also gave hon. members a projection of what the Coloured population would be at that time. In addition to all these factors the Coloureds have the highest birthrate of all population groups in the Republic, i.e. an increase of 4.7 per cent as opposed to 1.4 per cent in respect of the Whites in the Peninsula. Furthermore, the Coloureds are also showing a tendency to-day to an ever-increasing extent to move from the rural areas to the urban areas where there are employment opportunities and where wages are better as a general rule. This movement is illustrated by the fact that 47 per cent of the total population of the Peninsula consisted of Coloureds in 1921 and that this increased to 53.1 per cent in 1960. In 1921 68.6 per cent of our Coloured population lived in the cities. This figure increased to 89.5 per cent in 1960. But now it is so that there still is a considerable reserve of Coloureds in the rural areas of the Western Cape, people who are being drawn to this metropolitan area as a result of industrial growth. They will be drawn to an increasing extent if we cannot arrest the movement towards the city.</p>

<p>Now the question arises on the one hand: Where are all these Coloureds living to-day? To me the most provocative question remains: Where, when one takes this tremendous anticipated increase into account, are all these Coloureds going to be settled in future? It is easy to fling about accusations as the hon. member for Karoo did so freely; but 30 years ago no-one could have foreseen the present development. However, there can be no doubt in our minds as to the development which will take place within the next 30 years, even though we do not have the full picture before us at the moment. Necessity compels us to think in terms of the next 30 years, even though this hon. member&#x2019;s vision is restricted to 1969. On the basis of data which the municipalities have received from time to time, they have done a great deal in regard to Coloured housing as well as bringing about resettlement and more orderly residential areas. But areas which might have had the appearance of being planned at that time, no longer seem to be that to-day because of various developments. I want to mention a single example in my own constituency, as this is the constituency in which the largest Coloured areas are situated. I want to take the municipal area of Parow as an example, where resettlement work for the Coloureds was undertaken ten years ago to the south of the white area of Tiervlei. At that time this seemed practical but to-day the pattern there is quite different. What was regarded exclusively as a resettlement area has developed into a Coloured residential area in which 20,000 Coloureds are living at the present time and in respect of which additional housing has reached an advanced stage of planning. This has resulted in a position that a white community is completely hemmed in between the railway line to the North and a Coloured area. This also gives rise to the situation that Coloureds, in order to earn their livelihood, must move through these white areas every day as a matter of necessity.</p>

<p>But this is not the only place where this problem has arisen; it has arisen in all areas where a Coloured area is adjacent to a white area and where there is movement to and from places of employment. This is why the hon. member for Piketberg also advocated a breakaway from the idea of these two areas having to develop next to each other. But defective planning in the pre- and immediate post-war years not only resulted in the uneconomic utilization of land, but also located communities at the wrong places. In this regard we in our wisdom, seeing that this is the year 1969, can mention many such cases, such as Windermere, which now is an improved area called Kensington. But the situation of that area is wrong. To-day we cannot remove Kensington, because, in terms of the Group <span class="col_2627-2628" refersTo="page_1336"/>Areas Act, the Coloureds too are entitled to that certainty of residential separation which the Act affords the Whites. But there are also the areas of Claremont, Elsies River, Florida and the much discussed District Six.</p>

<p>In support of my argument with regard to increasing land prices, I want to mention to hon. members the case of the Elsies River Coloured area which is situated in the municipal area of Goodwood and in which 80,000 Coloureds are concentrated at present. I must say that a large section of them are still living in miserable slum conditions. Now, the position is that the Municipality of Goodwood is not in a position financially to solve the most urgent of these problems. Do hon. members know that the total amount collected in rates from that municipal ward comes to an annual amount of R174,000, of which approximately R74,000 comes from the industrial area. In other words, the remaining R100,000 is contributed by the Coloured residential area. Of this amount R40,000 is the <i>pro rata</i> share for the normal and the non-profitable services such as administration, fire brigade services, etc. Consequently an amount of R60,000 at the outside of the rates collected annually remains for <i>quid pro quo</i> utilization. According to estimates it will cost approximately R4 million simply to provide the necessary facilities and services. This excludes the main outfall sewer and the stormwater drains. Therefore hon. members can see that at a rate of R60,000 per annum which is available, it will take us nearly seven years to develop Elsies River&#x2019;s services. Then we shall have the situation that the services will have been developed but that not a single house will have been built. This is only one example I want to mention in order to indicate what a tremendous sum the price of land comes to in the existing areas. Then I want to say that increased housing density in respect of the Coloureds is inevitable if we want to utilize this land economically. As a matter of fact, I notice that this already is the policy of the Cape Town City Council. There is an announcement in the afternoon paper that the Cape Town City Council is going to erect a complex of flats at a sum of R2 million in implementation of this policy of increased density and more economic utilization of land. But now one asks oneself whether this is the solution or whether we are merely occupying ourselves with an economically acceptable measure. Should we continue the further over-concentration of Coloured housing and should we continue the further overconcentration of industries? Then I want to ask whether our action is not financially economic whereas we actually meant to act on a socio-economic basis. Should we allow this process to continue as it does at present for an indefinite time, i.e. to concentrate up to 1 million Whites and many more non-whites in an around our large cities. The population here is mixed during the day, separated at night, but over the week-ends everyone is on the street looking for escapes and recreational facilities which will hardly be available any longer. In the Western Cape there is enough room for Whites as well as non-Whites to be able to live under decent conditions rather than to be crowded into the Cape Peninsula complex. The population concentration in and about Cape Town, including the Cape Flats, has already assumed excessive proportions for its more than 1 million inhabitants. When we see that social, transport and recreational facilities for Whites as well as non-Whites already constitute a problem to-day, I do not want to know how difficult these things are going to be within one generation when this will be a completely built-up area. One will need the wisdom of Solomon in this respect. In his time Solomon said that man should go to the ant, consider her ways and be wise. In nature we find that when an ant colony becomes too large, part of that colony forms a new colony and finds new living space. In other words, decentralization takes place.</p>

<p>The hon. member who introduced this motion looked in the direction of the West Coast and I want to support him as far as this is concerned, because that was the logical thing to do and not as the hon. member for Karoo saw it. I want to support the hon. member for Piketberg wholeheartedly, but you must allow me, Sir, to look in a somewhat different direction, namely in the direction of the Bot River complex beyond Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. Now hon. members opposite should not tell me that it is too far to travel from that area to the Peninsula, because that is not the idea. In the limited time at my disposal I shall not be able to go into the matter in detail, but this area lends itself to dreams being dreamt at this stage, dreams which may become reality, especially when one is driving through this low-lying sour veld in the direction of Hermanus. To me it is inevitable that this area will have to become a future industrial area when saturation point has been reached in the Cape Peninsula. You will allow me, Sir, to digress a little from this motion in order to justify this statement. This area has absolutely everything required for the location of industries. There is a great deal of land which is not suitable for agricultural purposes, there is the railway connection at Bot River station, as well as the new coastal road which is being planned as well as the fact that a lack of water cannot be a real problem. This area is not far from the metropolitan area of Cape Town. There is the harbour at Hermanus which is not in fact suitable for heavy traffic, but the facilities can be extended. The point I really want to stress is that there is a tremendous labour potential in this area. In and around this area there is a concentration of traditional Coloured areas of which I want to mention only a few. The one is Genadendal, which has now given its name to a constituency which includes the towns of Greyton, Elim and Hawston near Hermanus. This is the point at which I return <span class="col_2629-2630" refersTo="page_1337"/>to the motion. These Coloured areas lend themselves in an absolutely ideal way to tremendous expansion without any over-concentration of Coloureds as we at present have in the Cape Peninsula with the attendant social problems. In passing I should like to mention Hawston as an example. This is an example of a beautiful small Coloured town which can be a nucleus for future development and which covers more than 900 morgen at this stage. It is situated on the coast and it has all the potential of becoming the future Hermanus of the Coloured population. Adjacent to this large area there are large pieces of State-owned land which can be used for housing. In the same way I can mention other Coloured areas which have special possibilities and which are all situated within easy reach of this Bot River complex.</p>

<p>Apart from the advantage with regard to industrial development, there are further advantages here, i.e. the necessary seasonal labour will be available for the apple industry at Elgin and Grabouw. But I do not want to go into this matter too deeply as my time is limited, but I must mention this in order to indicate why before long we shall have to look to this area as a rapidly developing Coloured area with alternative industrial opportunities. Here is an opportunity not only for housing but also for creating unparalleled possibilities for development and orderly government for the Coloureds. We shall have to do so in order to create new employment opportunities for the Coloureds and to enable us to arrest the flow to our metropolitan area. It will remain our task in future to create employment opportunities for the Coloureds although many of them are still living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise in respect of economic demand.</p>

<p>My time has expired, but I want to mention that it has already been proved in Israel that large residential areas which were created in undeveloped areas attracted industries to them. In this I also see a possibility for developing the area I mentioned, because if we can create housing conditions in ideal circumstances, the industries can be attracted to them. Therefore my plea is that we should plan on a regional basis and that we should acquire land even now before it will be too late as far as the future is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my friend the hon. member for Tygervallei, in my opinion always makes a constructive contribution to a debate. I do think that he considers his case carefully before he presents it and to-day has been no exception. I believe that this motion has also been carefully thought out by the mover and by the seconder and no doubt by those who will still follow him. I think it bears out what we on this side of the House have contended for a long time, namely that before group areas are established and before the future, for example, in the Peninsula of the White communities and the Coloured communities is decided upon, there should be very careful investigations.</p>

<p>If I am to be fair to the hon. member for Tygervallei I would say that his argument this afternoon has been that it is no longer acceptable that Coloured areas and white areas, although separate, should be adjacent. He can see the undesirability of such close proximity and I think he has in mind certain circumstances and conditions that pertain in his constituency and more particularly in Maitland. He admits, if I heard him correctly, that postwar planning, for which this Government is responsible, was wrong and he says further that the Government is learning lessons as a result of the mistakes which have been made. He questions whether there has been over-concentration and whether it has proved to have been an economic proposition to have established all the non-European townships in the Cape Flats area. He feels that&#x2014;and I gathered from what the proposer of the motion said that he also feels&#x2014;there should be decentralization, and in the case of the proposer of the motion, he suggested that there should be decentralization to the extent that a Coloured town should be developed in the region of the Malmesbury and Melkbosstrand area. In the case of the hon. member for Tygervallei he suggests that a further town should be developed in the area of Bot River down to the sea at Hawston. I asked him when he was speaking whether that meant a geographically consolidated area to take in, for example, Genadendal, Greyton, Elim and Hawston. It could mean a geographically consolidated area. I did not get an answer. I think these are matters that have to be considered very carefully. It bears out, as I have said before, what we have always maintained, and that is that the &#x201C;solution&#x201D; to community development, to group area development, that the Nationalist Government brought with them when they came into power in 1948, was not a final solution and that it should have been far better thought out and far better worked out.</p>

<p>Sir, if I may refer to the motion itself, the proposer thanks the Government for the many measures adopted during the past two decades in promoting the socio-economic welfare of the Coloured population. Now, I do not see the Coloured population through rose-coloured spectacles; I believe that we have to face up to the fact that there are many members of the Coloured population who have taken to crime; that there is a very high incidence of drunkenness and alcoholism among them; that the vast majority of the assaults and knifings that take place in the Cape Province are perpetrated by Coloured people; and that many sections of the Coloured population have shown a marked degree of unreliability and irresponsibility. But I would like to point out that there are different strata of society among the Coloureds, and that there are decent middle class Coloureds. That is where I quarrel with the Government in that I believe that they have not made the most of their opportunities in building up the decent middle class amongst <span class="col_2631-2632" refersTo="page_1338"/>the Coloureds and encouraging and assisting them. I regret that the middle class Coloured group itself does not take greater responsibility for the development of its own people.</p>

<p>I have long felt that they could play a far more active role in assisting their own people than they have so far.</p>

<p>I should like now, Sir, to deal with the attitudes of Gen. Hertzog and Dr. Malan in their approach to the Coloured people. In so far as Gen. Hertzog&#x2019;s attitude is concerned, he expressed his views in this House in 1939 and I fully subscribe to them. As regards the economic status of the Coloured people he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Coloured people shall not by reason of race or colour be debarred from engaging in any form of industrial occupation or employment. The Government will endeavour to ensure that the working conditions of employment accord with the social policy set out hereunder.</block>

<p>Then he deals at some length with the social status of the Coloured people and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no desire either on the part of the Whites or of the Coloured people that there should be social intercourse between each other and social separation is accepted by both as a definite and settled policy of the country.</block>

<p>Then, to refer to what Dr. Malan said when he came into power, his argument was that the Nationalist Party based its policy on the fact that Coloured people form their own separate group between, on the one side the Europeans, with whom they share a common language and cultural interests, and, on the other side, the Natives from whom they differ considerably. I would like to examine the views that I have quoted of Dr. Malan. I would like to ask more particularly what measures this Government has taken to bring about a distinction between the Coloured people and the Native people, a distinction which obviously Dr. Malan envisaged. What steps have been taken by this Government since 1948 to protect the Coloured people, for example, from the Native people? Later on in his statement about the social status of the Coloured people, he recognizes that there is a more civilized group among the Coloured people and he says that special attention should be given to the requirements of the more civilized ones among the Coloured people. That bears out precisely what I said a few minutes ago, namely that this Government has failed to develop and encourage the interest of the middle class of Coloureds.</p>

<p>Sir, the Group Areas Act, when it was passed, was claimed by the introducer, Dr. D&#x04E7;nges, to be the most important of the apartheid measures. &#x201C;The purpose of the Group Areas Act was to demarcate areas for each racial group in a fair and equitable and judicial manner,&#x201D; to (quote Dr. D&#x04E7;nges. In the third reading he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that if we remove the points of contact that cause friction, then we will remove the possibility of that friction.</block>

<p>I believe I am entitled to ask whether the contact points have been removed and whether the friction in fact exists. I am very sorry that the hon. member for Maitland is not here this afternoon. This Government has been in power for 21 years and the hon. member for Maitland seems to carry on a perpetual war concernings points of friction. One thinks particularly of the bus terminus at Mowbray, a matter which constantly enjoys his attention; one thinks of the non-White hospitals in certain portions of his constituency, a further point of friction, and one thinks of other members on the Government side of the House who have referred to the difficulties which exist when there are White bottle stores in Coloured areas and White bottle stores in White areas with a large Coloured clientele. The points of friction have not been removed, Sir, not at all.</p>

<p>Then one thinks about the beaches. This Government has been in power for 21 years. The points of friction still exist. I can take hon. members to various beaches, not in the Cape Town municipal area; I am talking about beaches outside the Cape Town municipal area, in the Divisional Council area. The Divisional Council has done a first-class job in providing separate amenities in most of these areas but because this Government cannot tell them where they stand, for example, with regard to the beaches along the Swartklip coast, there are mixed beaches there and there are further points of friction. The point that I am making is that this Government has done singularly little to remove the points of friction that they claimed they would be able to remove when they came into power. What have they done? This Government, admittedly, has removed some. It has cleared up slum conditions. Sir, that is the duty of any Government. The United Party Government also cleared up slums.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It created them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Of course they cleared up slum conditions, and when the United Party is returned to power it will likewise clear slum conditions where they exist and where they have been left by this Government. That is the duty of any Government. But this Government has gone further. It has moved settled and established communities and I believe that they have their order of priorities wrong. Sir, let me give you an example of that. In certain parts of the Peninsula, to quote Simonstown, to quote Kalk Bay and Claremont and to quote certain parts of Wynberg, areas <span class="col_2633-2634" refersTo="page_1339"/>where there certainly have not been slums, the Government has concentrated on moving people out of those areas. The decent middle class Malays and the decent middle class Coloureds have been moved out of these areas and put on the Cape Flats. In the case of those in my area, they are moving them from Simonstown and from Kalk Bay and putting them at Slangkop. What is more, in those townships they have the good, the bad and the indifferent Coloured persons all mixed up together. The proposer of the motion himself went so far as to admit that in the townships there is no marked distinction between the economically different groups amongst the Coloured populations. I believe that it is quite wrong that a Coloured man who is earning a high wage, as many of them are, should be allowed to hire a house in a township at a sub-economic or a very low rental. I believe that like the White man, and particularly the poor White man, he should have to go to building societies and make financial arrangements in accordance with his financial means. That is something which has been completely overlooked by this Government. My main argument is that without forethought and without planning the Government has proceeded to demarcate the Peninsula into different group areas. It has moved out from Simonstown, Kalk Bay and the other areas that I have mentioned, many settled non-European communities. I do not believe that that has been in the interests of the Whites or of the non-whites concerned. I believe it has been a hasty step and one that certainly has not been thought out properly. To give as an example what has happened at Slangkop, you have had settled communities from Kalk Bay and Simonstown moved out there, a long distance from transport. Admittedly they have been brought nearer the beach amenities provided by the Divisional Council, i.e. firstclass beach amenities at Soetwater. But think of the problems which have also been created. There is the problem of transport. How are they going to get from Slangkop to the nearest rail point which is Fish Hoek? Fish Hoek is a small, condensed, entirely White area. What problems are going to be caused if you are going to bring non-Whites from Slangkop to use the transport facilities in the centre of Fish Hoek?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>But you do want them to live together in the same areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Where else could they go? From Slangkop they can go to Glen-cairn and a station could be built for them at the Cape Town end of Glencairn where there is no settled population of any kind. But this requires a road to be built from Slangkop over the mountain to the Cape Town side of the Glen Valley to the new station that I have mentioned at Glencairn. But all of this requires advanced planning. These settled communities have been moved to Slangkop without this advanced planning having been done, without such facilities being available to them. As the hon. member for Karoo has mentioned, they are paying very high bus fares and taxi fares to get to their places of employment, quite unreasonably so and quite unnecessarily so.</p>

<p>Sir, the principle of decentralization is not unacceptable to this side of the House; it never has been. That is why I personally believe that it is not a bad thing to give consideration to the decentralization of Coloured populations in various portions of the Peninsula and the areas surrounding the Peninsula. I can see nothing wrong with it, but then it must be planned and there must be considerable and considered advance planning. That is why I believe that this afternoon&#x2019;s motion has been a complete vindication of the attitude of this side of the House at the time of the passing of the Group Areas Act in 1950. The attitude of this side of the House at that time was that the principle of social and residential separation was traditional in South Africa, but that the establishment of group areas was so complex that the whole question should be referred for report on its practicability to an impartial commission. I believe that that attitude holds good to-day and has been vindicated by the fact that this motion has had to be moved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I think the motive behind this motion is quite clear to all of us on this side of the House. We see a new line of thinking on the Government side. Otherwise I cannot fathom why they have introduced a motion of this nature, where hon. members have expressed their gratitude to the Government for what has been done for the socio-economic development of the Coloured community, and also expressing the view that more land should be purchased for the Coloureds during this year 1969. The hon. member for Piketberg, who introduced the motion, mentioned his reason for wanting us to invest in new land for Coloured townships, namely that the price of ground is rising year by year. I concede that. We know that this is taking place all the time. But at the same time we must bear in mind that while land values are rising, the prices of urban stands and urban properties are increasing at the same rate as the prices in rural areas. It is not merely the one type of land which is increasing in value; so where the Government would have to pay more for land to develop for Coloured townships, at the same time the people who would have to move out from the urban areas in which they are now living, would also receive fair compensation for their land and properties, regardless of when the purchase and the sale of land might take place.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Piketberg mentioned that an area such as Melkbosstrand should be considered. I wonder why he does not consider areas even further away, beyond Saldanha. If he is going to <span class="col_2635-2636" refersTo="page_1340"/>move these people 30 miles or more, he might as well move them 100 miles. I cannot possibly see how the Coloured community can work in the Peninsula on a sound economic basis if they have to live a distance of 30 miles from Cape Town.</p>

<p>This is a problem which I have appreciated for many years. What this motion reveals clearly to me is a lack of planning and a lack of policy. Of course we have seen, for at least 21 years, since 1948, unfortunate episodes taking place year after year, and from election to election, in that, quite clearly in many areas in South Africa, the Coloured community has been used as a political foot ball for political gain. [Interjections.] The hon. member can make as much noise as he likes. He can come to any public meeting of mine, and ask me questions and I will welcome it. I can remember the years when I was at school in Steynsburg. It was an Afrikaans-medium school. I remember that at that time the United Party Government was removing Coloureds from a slum area in Steynsburg and resettling them in a new area. This took place long before we ever thought of this Nationalist Party Government. This process did not start in 1948. Nobody can tell us that.</p>

I can mention other areas, apart from Steynsburg, where the United Party Government took the matter in hand. It was done in General Smuts&#x2019;s time. You see, Sir, when the Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Bill was before this House last year, the Leader of the Opposition, whilst speaking about the representatives being removed from this House, said: &#x201C;You are doing away with Coloured representation in this House&#x201D;, and the Prime Minister interjected: &#x201C;Yes, it depends on what you give them in return&#x201D;. This House subsequently passed the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, which is something quite new and foreign to South Africa.

I am thinking of places like East London and Port Elizabeth, and further to the north, Queenstown and Aliwal, where development has taken place, but under this Government the Coloured people in those areas are no better off to-day than they were when this Government took over. In East London in particular we still have North End, a slum area, and nothing is being done.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to extend my sincere thanks to the hon. member for Piketberg for having presented this topical matter to the House to-day, a matter which not only affords the House an opportunity of considering what has been done during the past two decades by this Government for the betterment of the <span class="col_2637-2638" refersTo="page_1341"/>Coloureds, but which also afford the House an opportunity of casting a glance into the future, in order to see what tasks await us. It is fortunate that this country and the Coloureds are to-day being Government by a Government such as this and not by a Party for which the hon. member for Karoo is a mouthpiece; for if the poor people of South Africa had been left to the mercies of such a vision, the future would definitely have been a black one for us. To take it amiss of us for wanting to look to the future and to insist that we should simply concern ourselves with the year 1969 certainly does not testify to leadership, but for the moment I shall leave it at that. I shall subsequently make a further reference to the hon. member.</p>

<p>By way of introduction I should just like to say that what the Government has done during the past two decades for the Coloureds in the field of education and economy and politics has not gone unnoticed by them. I think one can to a very large extent attribute these good race relations between ourselves and the Coloureds which exist to-day in this country to the fact that they see to-day what the Government has done for them in these various fields. Unlike the hon. member for Karoo, they see this, and they also realize that the Government is sincere and that the Government is in earnest as far as they are concerned. That is why the Coloureds are also deeply interested in what is being planned for their future, and that is what I am going to confine myself to now, reference to the motion which requests us to plan for the future with a view to the population increase.</p>

<p>Let me say at once that the expected population growth of the Coloureds in the next few decades, the extra numbers which will in future have to provided with work and accommodation and who have to make a happy subsistence, are matters which are receiving daily attention from the authorities, that is the Government and the Provincial Administration in this country. Thanks to that attention on the part of these bodies which these matters are receiving day by day, we have to-day a very good picture of what the position is going to be in a few decades time, and I am not going to refer to that.</p>

<p>I want to begin with the Cape Peninsula, which has the greatest concentration of Coloureds, where more than 500,000 Coloureds are living. In the first place I want to ask what the carrying capacity of the Peninsula is, this Peninsula which because of tradition and economic considerations is and will remain such an important key area to them. The question one must furnish an immediate answer to is what the economic and social carrying capacity of the Peninsula is. The size of the Coloured group areas which have already been proclaimed in the Peninsula is 9,500 morgen. Of this 9,500 morgen the greatest part has been developed; 740 morgen still remain to be developed. But added to this there is that other larger part which has been investigated by the State by means of its Department of Planning with a view to future Coloured settlement. That area totals 15,000 morgen, besides that which I have already mentioned, which is being envisaged for future Coloured settlement in the Peninsula. It sounds like a lot, and it is in fact a large tract of land. If one views it from the air one realizes what a large tract of land it is. But this land must be properly utilized, otherwise we are going to get into difficulties in the future. Progress is being made with that planning. Unlike what is being thought by hon. members opposite, who are apparently living in a dream world and who think that there is no planning, planning is in fact being undertaken on a very large scale. Thorough consideration has already been given to this tremendously large area in the Peninsula by the Department of Planning and the Provincial Administration, and planning has been undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Greater Peninsula three separate independent Coloured towns have been planned for the future. The intention is that it should not be one continuous Coloured town from Athlone to Macassar, but that these should in fact be three separate, independent towns, each with its own character. In these towns industrial sites are going to be set aside. Contrary to what the hon. member for Karoo tihnks, namely that the Coloureds are not being afforded any industrial opportunities, such sites are going to be set aside. Let me correct the hon. member on a statement he made. Not only are Coloureds entitled to acquire land in the existing industrial areas by way of permit, but this Government, through its Coloured Development Corporation, is in fact encouraging Coloureds to acquire industrial sites there. Apart from that these industrial sites will in future be made available in these three independent towns and these towns will be laid out in such a way as to offer the necessary community facilities and attractions. As far as possible arrangements are going to be made to the effect that they will have to be self-supporting. In other words, they must each have their own business centres and they must obviously have their community centres where cultural, religious and other facilities can be made available. In addition it is the intention that these independent towns will also have their own beaches. To the west they will have Strandfontein, and to the east Macassar beach will be developed. A great deal of development will still in future have to take place in regard to these two beaches so as to provide the Coloureds with the necessary beach facilities. But in spite of this large tract of land here, it is also necessary that this land, with a view to the future population increase, will have to be planned very judiciously. It is felt by our planners that we will in future have to have a vertical development on the CaDe Flats. In spite of the fact that there now appears to be a great deal of land available, we shall have to plan vertically with a view to this population increase in future. In <span class="col_2639-2640" refersTo="page_1342"/>other words, flats and multi-storied buildings will have to be erected from the outset in these three independent towns which are to be established on the Cape Flats. With such a pattern it is expected that it will be possible to accommodate more than a million Coloureds in future in this Peninsula area. These three towns which are to be established, together with the existing development, will, according to expectations, be able to accommodate more than a million Coloureds.</p>

<p>But we are not only engaged in planning, we are also acquiring the land. As the hon. member for Piketberg rightly pointed out, land prices are increasing and in 20 to 30 years&#x2019; time the prices could be exceptionally high. These are all aspects which the Government is taking into consideration. Steps have already been taken to acquire land, and I can mention a few of the purchases in order to indicate that the State is not simply planning but is also implementing its planning in this respect. Adjoining the Cape Flats section, to which I referred, the Stellenbosch Divisional Council is developing a town in the Macassar area where 2,000 houses are to be erected. Apart from that in the same Macassar area, the State itself has acquired 850 morgen for the purposes of this future development. At the nearby Eerste River station is the Kleinvlei area where 480 morgen has been acquired for this Coloured development. In the same way a town is being planned at Kuilsriver and this is going to be developed there in the near future. At Kraaifontein the Divisional Council of Stellenbosch has acquired a further piece of land 450 morgen in extent which is intended for Coloured development.</p>

<p>Before I come to further expansion in this regard and refer to other areas, such as the West Coast, I would just like to say a few words about the facilities which are going to be made available in these towns. I am doing so particularly because certain derogatory remarks have recently been made in the Press again. It has been said that we are developing this Bonteheuwel-Heideveld area by merely building small houses there. I am coming in a moment to the sub-economic complaints of the hon. member for Karoo. It has been alleged that we are building such unattractive little houses there, and that these are in fact no towns in the true sense of the word. That is why it is necessary that I should, for the sake of the truth, merely state what development is in fact taking place. In the aforementioned areas the following buildings have already been constructed, there are 22 newly erected schools, 5 community centres, a swimming bath, a library, a theatre, 3 clinics, 64 shops, 8 sportsgrounds and 8 equipped playgrounds. Surely this is an indication that the Government is carefully looking after the social welfare of those people. This is the pattern which will in fact be followed in the three towns which are to be established, and in other towns as well.</p>

<p>Now I want to concede that, with a view to the far distant future, this development in the Peninsula will not be adquate, and that is why it is a good thing the hon. member for Piketberg focused the attention of some members of the Opposition on this matter. At this moment the Government is in fact looking further afield than the Peninsula. After all we know now what the population increase is going to be in future. We must therefore take into account the fact that those people will have to be accommodated. It is a senseless piece of propaganda on the part of the hon. member for Karoo to say that we want to settle those people 30 miles away. If the Cape Flats becomes built up over a period of 30 years then people will have to go elsewhere, because how else must they be accommodated? If we settle them here in the western area, in the Mamre area, to which I shall come in a moment, it does not mean that all of them need work here in the Cape. If this planning idea of ours, i.e. that there should be industrial sites there as well, is implemented, then surely those people will be able to work in the townships. On the other hand one must bear in mind that not everybody likes living in an urban area. One must also accept that there would be some Coloureds who would prefer to live in more rural surroundings. With a view to this we must see to it that the rural areas are also developed. We are meeting this need and making provision for it in three ways. The first is to develop our Coloured towns, places like Mamre, Genadendal, Hawston and others. The hon. member for Tygervallei asked for future development in Botriver area. That is precisely what is being done. Not only did Genadendal remain static for years, it even began to go into a decline and the Coloureds there all wanted to leave because the town showed no more signs of vitality. Then the Department of Coloured Affairs intervened there and <i>inter alia</i> established a creosote factory which served as an economic shot in the arm for that area. Planning in connection with agriculture there has also been undertaken by the Department. Now Genadendal is once more becoming a vital town which is keeping its people, and this is also in the interests of the surrounding areas which need their labour. Similarly the 950 morgen covered by Hawston have been proclaimed, and that area is such that it can be further developed, so that we will not leave it at that 950 morgen.</p>

<p>I come now to Mamre, in regard to which the hon. member for Piketberg also put in a plea. He asked that a city should also in due course be developed in that area. Whether it will be a city or not, one thing is inevitable; town development will in future have to take place in that area. We are in fact engaged in that. It is not a matter in regard to which we are dreaming dreams and expressing pious wishes. The Department of Planning in consultation with other Departments, is looking at and acquiring land in that area with a view to future town expansion which will have to be undertaken there. All this indicates that the <span class="col_2641-2642" refersTo="page_1343"/>Government is in fact engaged in planning. It is engaged in that planning with a view to future requirements. We are not simply thinking in terms of exclusively Coloured towns; we are thinking in terms of the task of the White towns in this regard. The hon. member for Piketberg pointed out that we do not want a Coloured town adjoining every White town. I agree with him, we cannot have a Coloured town adjoining every White town, because there has to be all kinds of facilities, schools, etc.</p>

<p>Wait, listen for a moment. Most platteland towns will have to retain their Coloured townships. I concede that not every little hamlet can have a Coloured town, but by far the most platteland towns will have to remain where they are, adjoining the existing White towns. Consequently I now want to address a plea to the town councils of those White towns. I want to ask them to make greater use of the means which the Government places at their disposal for the development of housing schemes in each White town. Not only does the State grant loans for the erection of houses, the State also grants loans for the acquisition of land for Coloured housing in those White towns. Many White towns are in fact making use of them. The hon. member for Piketberg spoke with praise of the housing schemes of certain White towns, but I would be neglecting my duty if I omitted to say that there are still many White towns which are not doing their duty properly in this respect. Those towns are not yet making full use of the facilities and the means which the Government is placing at their disposal for the creation of better Coloured housing schemes adjoinging their towns. I really want to express the hope that they are going to do this, because it is in the interests of their own region, it is in the interests of the need to keep the Coloured in the platteland. It all goes hand in hand with the need to retain our population balance in this country. After all we cannot allow&#x2014;no country in the world can allow&#x2014;everyone in the platteland to stream into the cities. After all it is necessary that a kind of population balance be maintained. In other words, there must be enough Coloureds in the platteland to fulfill their economic function there by making their labour available there, etc. To keep the people there, however, it must be made attractive for them. Apart from the establishment and the development of Coloured towns, and apart from the obligation of White towns to establish Coloured housing schemes, there is still the obligation which rests on the farming communities themselves, i.e. to make life and living conditions for their own farm workers as attractive as possible. In this respect my visit to Vlaeberg, which falls in the constituency of the hon. member for Stellenbosch, was really an inspiration. There 7 farmers from Vlaeberg met in Stellenbosch and established a community centre where cultural and other sporting facilities could be made available for the Coloureds of that farming community, so as to make it more attractive for those people to live there and in this way to reduce the need to leave and go to the city. This is, in my opinion, an example which will in fact have to be followed to a much greater extent by our farming communities. In this respect as well, Mr. Speaker, the Government is doing as much as it is possible to do at this juncture to keep the Coloured farm workers on the farm. It is known to you that we have already agreed to grant loans to farmers for the erection of houses for their farm workers. Apart from that the Government has felt that we must bring the little farm school for the Coloureds into its own again. In that respect more assistance will have to be granted in future than was granted in the past. That is not all however. To make it more attractive for the Coloured teacher teaching at that little farm school, State aid will also have to be granted in future so that housing can be provided for them there to keep them on the farm so that they can contribute their share and in this way help maintain the population balance. In these many ways the Government is not only engaged in planning but also in lending assistance and carrying into effect this great idea which has to be implemented. It will always be our task to encourage these growth points which we envisage by means of planning and appropriation. These are growth points which can help to get our Coloured community settled in an orderly and happy way in this part of the country in particular.</p>

<p>With reference to the motion of the hon. member I just want to say this to the House in conclusion. The House can rest assured that the Government will, with full consideration for the future population increase and with full consideration for the economic and cultural needs of the Coloured population, act in this way so that a future generation will not be able to level the reproach at the present generation of White governers that we were short sighted and that we did not plan far enough ahead for them. On the contrary I am convinced that on the basis of these steps which the Government is making a future generation, which looks back upon the year 1969, will be able to say: &#x201C;They saw, they planned, they did&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#erasmus">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>On Friday I was engaged in demonstrating how unfounded and irresponsible the complaints of the hon. member for Durban (Central) against the Management of the S.A. Airways were, i.e. that, in his opinion, Captain Smith should not have been allowed to fly. I demonstrated that there was nothing wrong with his flying ability and that he executed a perfect take-off and flew beyond the critical stage up to a reasonably safe height, i.e. between 600 and 700 feet. At the same time we must remember that the second pilot sits beside the first pilot and does certain things which have to be done in assisting the pilot in control, precisely according to the pattern in the schedule as inculcated in them during their training. Now, what happened in that cabin from that height onwards and for the next thirty, dramatic seconds, remains a provocative secret. It is also a fact that no shred of objection was or could be raised against the other two pilots. They were both men who were in their prime. There is no proof as to which two of the three pilots were in control of the aircraft. It could have been either the second or the third pilot. This fact therefore makes the accusation of the hon. member for Durban (Central) clearly ridiculous and the Management of the Airways can therefore not be blamed under any circumstances. The accident is clearly attributable primarily to the human factor, as was the finding of the commission. Its nature will forever remain unknown. The only manner in which this enigma could have been solved would have been to have had a film recording taken in the cabin, which could then have proved what had taken place there during the last 30 seconds, but as far as my knowledge goes this type of installation is not yet practicable in aircraft. I want to agree heartily with the hon. the Minister that if a data recorder had been installed it would have given the commission no more facts than they had&#x2014;perhaps a few more&#x2014;and it could definitely not have prevented the accident either, despite the hon. member for Albany&#x2019;s argument here.</p>

<p>The second complaint of the hon. member for Durban (Central) is based on the fact that the Management of the Airways did not ensure that the crew had first flown together. This complaint is just as groundless as the first. The elementary fact is that pilots are trained as individual pilots and not in teams. Every man can handle an aircraft through and according to his own ingenuity and not as a member of the team. Any two pilots who have been trained on any type of aircraft according to schedule can fly together without ever having met or known each other. Each one knows precisely what he must do. It is not even the practice in any other airline in the world to first let pilots fly together. The hon. member may go and make inquiries if he does not believe it. The third complaint is that Captain Smith merely underwent a one-hour conversion course. That complaint is also in fact petty. The position is that this man had already acquired 4,608 flying hours&#x2019; experience on all models of Boeing aircraft. The C-model aircraft which was involved here differs very little from the other 707s and the manufacturers of the Boeings have prescribed this one-hour period as a standard period which must be used for a conversion course and you may rest assured that this period will always incline to the side of safety. The Management can really not be blamed here because there was nothing that they neglected to do, and if we accept that Captain Smith was at the controls, he had nevertheless still executed two perfect take-offs and one landing before the accident occurred. The hon. member made mention here of the fact that Captain Smith once struggled to complete a conversion course. I could find no mention of those facts in this report at all, and I maintain that that statement of his is altogether irrelevant. It was actually petty and unnecessary of him to have mentioned it. I do not even know whether it is the truth. It also has nothing to do with the competence of the Airways Management.</p>

<p>The last complaint was that the airport at Windhoek is a very dangerous one, and that it was a pitch dark night. These two statements were simply drawn out of thin air. They are again not relevant to the competence of the Airways Management. It is nonsense that the J. G. Strydom airfield is dangerous. We do not even have to argue further about that; it is obvious. I should like to know how the hon. member wants to execute a take-off on a dark night. Does the hon. member not know that provision is made for dark nights, thick mists, and very difficult flying conditions by way of instruments and that the co-pilot receives a very intensive training in instrumentation? I personally believe that the dark night had nothing to do with the whole matter. I honestly want to say that I was shocked that the hon. member for Durban (Central) mentioned this <span class="col_2645-2646" refersTo="page_1345"/>matter here. I have always appreciated his scientific approach to matters, but in this instance he has failed miserably. I cannot fathom his motive. I really cannot believe that he wanted to use this disaster in order to steal a few political marches.</p>

<p>Sir, if I have talked nonsense then the hon. member is doubly guilty of having done so. By this he has unnecessarily opened wounds and humiliated the family members of the crew, apart from the groundless and unreasonable accusations and criticism which he expressed here in respect of the Airways Management. Unfortunately this speech of his has not done him any credit and neither has it rendered a service to this very fine undertaking of which we are so proud. He rendered South Africa no service by these actions. I believe that our Airways is as good, if not better, than any other Airways in the world. I think that the Management is the most efficient there is, both organizationally and technologically. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that this House has the fullest confidence in him and in the team of officials supporting him. We want to wish him well and to say to him, &#x201C;Carry on the good work&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to pursue the subject of the tragic loss of the Boeing aircraft much further, except to say that both sides of the House as well as the country should not lose sight of one fact, namely the evidence did not show conclusively who the pilot at the controls of the aircraft was at the time of the accident. I think it is something that should be borne in mind by this House, by the country outside, and also by the sorrowing families of the deceased crew members.</p>

<p>I wish to appeal to the hon. the Minister to-day for something which I have repeatedly appealed for in the past, and I hope my appeal to-day will not again be in vain, as was the case on past occasions. I wish to appeal to the Minister to apply some of the profits derived from the transportation of fuel through the pipeline from the coast to the Witwatersrand towards reducing the cost of the fuel on the Witwatersrand itself. In the past we may have asked that all the profits should be utilized to reduce the price of fuel on the Rand, but to-day I am prepared to limit my appeal. I ask that only the difference between the profits that would have been made had the fuel been transported by ordinary trucks and the profit obtained from sending it up by pipeline should be used to reduce the cost of fuel on the Rand. I regard it as absolutely indefensible that these huge profits of R15 million and more should be used only for other purposes, and that no benefit is derived by fuel consumers on the Witwatersrand. The people on the Rand are without doubt being milked to-day to provide profits for the S.A.R. Last year the profit was R15 million, this year it will be R40 million. Although this profit of R40 million this year will not all be derived from the transportation of fuel to the Witwatersrand, I do believe that at least half of the profits will have been obtained from it. The Witwatersrand and the Vaal triangle are the greatest users of fuel in South Africa. More road miles are travelled there than in any other part of the country. As far as taxation is concerned, it makes the greatest contribution to the Government&#x2019;s revenue. Now we find they have to pay much more for their fuel, and one might say it is the equivalent of a fine they have to pay; it is the equivalent of a sales tax on the petrol used by the people of the Witwatersrand. I wonder whether the Minister realizes that this policy of his is pushing up production costs on the Reef. He is hampering economic expansion. Is he so short-sighted that he cannot realize that if he were to lower production costs by lowering the cost of fuel, industries would expand and production would increase on the Reef, which means the Government would obtain so much more in the form of other taxes? He is actually killing the goose that lays the golden egg. If I may use a simile, if agriculture needs fodder which is the life-blood of animal husbandry, then very fairly the Minister sees to it that the fodder is transported at a low tariff. Fuel is the life-blood of our industrial economy, and if industry needs that life-blood the Minister goes to the extreme of taking as much money as possible from the consumer. I believe here we have a shocking state of affairs. The Minister is pumping fuel from the coast to the Witwatersrand at a cost of not much more than 1c per gallon, and he is making a profit of 7c on every gallon, which is a profit of 700 per cent.</p>

<p>I know the excuses of the hon. the Minister. Firstly, he says that if fuel was to be transported by rail, there would also have been a surplus. He would in any case have made money out of it. Therefore, to-day I am only asking for the profits over and above that, which he is saving, to be used to bring down the price of fuel on the Witwatersrand. The hon. the Minister says that he cannot do that. He says that tariffs will have to be increased in respect of other items if he uses the profits to reduce the price of fuel on the Witwatersrand. These words come strangely from a Government which has hidden a R180 million in its main budget. They come strangely from a Government which has wasted millions upon millions of the taxpayer&#x2019;s money. They come strangely from a Minister who is not using the manpower on the Railways to the fullest benefit of the country. This Minister last year in February was also not even using that pipeline <span class="col_2647-2648" refersTo="page_1346"/>to 100 per cent capacity. Hon. members should know that the pipeline was only being used to a capacity of 68 per cent. I trust the position is better now. If the hon. the Minister wants more money, surely he could use the pipeline to its fullest capacity.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. the Minister can solve the problem by building more pipelines. A new one is being built this year, and another one will also be built later in this year. But this is not nearly enough. I remember last year the hon. the Minister tearfully told us that if he had to reduce the tariffs for stocks conveyed by the oil pipeline to the Witwatersrand, he would have to increase the price of bringing coal to the Western Province. There is an answer to that. I do not want the Minister to laugh out aloud at the answer. He should start thinking now of doing what they are doing in the United States of America, where they are even to-day transporting coal by pipeline. It can be done. I do not think that tearful excuse of his holds water.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to the Minister to take a much broader view of the use of pipelines, to make it part of his policy to replace a large percentage of our transportation needs by pipelines in future. I wish to bring to his notice the example of the United States of America, a fantastic example of how pipelines can be used and are being used in the rest of the world to-day. In the United States there are to-day 1,000,000 miles of pipelines, four times the length of all its railways and times all its airline routes. 43 per cent, almost half, of all the energy fuel in the United States is being transported by pipeline to-day. Last year 30,000 miles of pipelines were laid, almost 100 miles a day. Crude oil is being taken from Houston to New York, almost 2,000 miles, at a cost of two cents a gallon. Even excluding the pipelines used for transportation of natural gas, as the Minister will know, at least 300,000 miles of pipeline are being used for crude oil and refined products in the States to-day. The hon. the Minister should have a plan for the vast use of these pipelines in future. It will solve many of his manpower problems, as well as many of his income problems. He can reduce the high cost of shipping goods by rail or by sea by having more pipelines. Pipelines have the advantage of being unaffected by weather. They are immune to strikes. They eliminate the necessity of sending back empty freight cars to the point of despatch. Above all, only a handful of people are required to control a huge cross-country pipeline system. Let me give the following example, based on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own figures, just to give him an idea of how he can save manpower through only this one method, namely the extended use of pipelines. He has a staff of 225,000 railwaymen. They produce an annual revenue of R850 million. That means that for one unit of manpower in the Railways R4,000 of revenue is produced. Now let us look at the pipelines. There is a staff of only 305 operating the pipelines and these 305 brought in a revenue of R23 million, that is R75,000 per unit, for the Railways. Here we have the contrast. The ordinary unit of manpower in the Railways, a hard-working man, produces R4,000 of revenue per year, but a unit of manpower on the pipelines produces a revenue of R75,000 a year. I realize there are lots of goods that cannot be transported through a pipeline. One cannot convey passengers by pipeline &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, one cannot put the Minister through one, for that matter. As a matter of fact plans are already being made in America to send trains through pipelines by means of air pressure within the next 15 or 20 years. My appeal to the hon. the Minister is therefore that he should take a much broader view of this whole problem of the use of pipelines. It is not only a temporary panacea or something that can be used as a means of transport between Durban and the Witwatersrand, but it is something that can be made use of for transport between all the major centres of South Africa within the next 15 or 20 years. I believe that the hon. the Minister should recognize what is going on in other countries and that he should start planning on a broad basis now so that many of the problems regarding manpower, where our profits are coming from, and in regard to our defence, will be solved. This requires vision on the part of the hon. the Minister and we can only trust that he has it in this respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one is almost inclined to be opposed to anything which the hon. member for Orange Grove pleads for, whether it be television or pipelines. One is almost traditionally opposed to what the hon. member pleads for.</p>

<p>In answers which he gave in this House the hon. the Minister has already stated his policy very clearly in respect of the interdependence of the various divisions of our transport system. The hon. member said that there should be a saving and that the profits made on the pipelines should go to the consumer. To the question of where the difference in revenue was to come from, the hon. member made a somewhat feeble contribution and we should like to know from him where tariffs must be increased if the hon. the Minister is to relinquish this revenue so easily. In respect of the conveyance of solids by means of pipelines I want to point out that the medium of conveyance in most of these cases is water and I am of the opinion that at present we have a greater water shortage than a pipeline shortage.</p>

<p>This Budget is the 15th which the hon. the Minister has introduced, and he has once more made an unequalled achievement in respect of the number of years and the amount concerned. The United Party has had to listen to the hon. the Minister for 15 years in the introduction <span class="col_2649-2650" refersTo="page_1347"/>of his Railways Estimates. In married life the ladies in particular like to indicate the number of years of marriage by a certain name and even to link this to festivities. We know of the well-known golden wedding, silver wedding, etc. By coincidence 15 years of married life constitute the tin wedding. This reminded me that of the 15 years in which the United Party has listened to this Minister and his Estimates, this year has really been characterized by the tinniest criticism we have had for years. Their criticism was really poor because they could in fact say nothing about this Budget.</p>

<p>Since we are now almost at the end of the discussion of this Budget, and the money is now being provided for the administration of our entire transport services for the year, it is a fact that this Budget was drawn up with a very careful eye on the general condition of the country&#x2019;s economy. It was drawn up with due regard to advance estimates, and all factors which can influence the functioning of the economic machine were taken into account. Because there is a mutual influence between the transport system and the economy, this Budget is definitely going to have an important influence on the country&#x2019;s economy. Just think of the question of tariff increases, which has been mentioned so frequently. If the Minister had come along with tariff increases now, it would have resulted in an inflationary pressure on consumer prices.</p>

<p>There is a specific group of people on whom this Budget exercises a particular influence, i.e. the Railway servants. They are actually the people who stand at the focal point of the Budget. The Railway pensioner looks at this Budget with a smile because of the benefits he derives from it. Many of them are proud of the share they had in the building up of our transport system in the years when they were in active service. Now, after this Budget, they are feeling even happier in having been able to have a share in such an organization which looks after their interests in this way. This Budget, then, has accommodated Railway pensioners to an extent previously unequalled. But also those who are employed by the Railways at present, are particularly affected. It is true that they are not affected in the sense that they have received financial benefits from it, because those were received last year. This Budget affects the Railway servant directly in his daily task, in his productivity, in the loyalty which he displays towards the service and in the sacrifices which he is prepared to make in order to let the Railway services run smoothly. In my humble opinion the Railway official is the most important factor for the ensuing year in any Railway Budget. For me it actually boils down to the fact that we come along to the railwayman and say, &#x201C;Look, here is the industrial capital for the year. We are handing it over to you. You must now keep this undertaking and all its branches running smoothly. You must keep the wheels rolling&#x201D;. And we may confidently leave it in their hands. Over the past year they set up a record in respect of the largest volume of traffic dealt with. We expect that in the ensuing year, with the greater volume of traffic which will be offered, they will even exceed this record. And they may tackle this task with confidence. We on this side of the House are happy with the work which the Railway official is doing. We have confidence in his ability to do his work and to improve on previous achievements. But we do not only have the confidence; we also appreciate the work which he is going to do, and if someone knows that his employer has confidence in him and appreciates his work, he will go ahead with confidence. They may rest assured that the Minister, the Administration and this side of the House will look after their interests. Salary increases have always come at the right time. As has been the case with the pension increases this year. There are furthermore all manner of services supplied by the Railways Administration to its servants, services such as housing, training and study facilities, opportunities for work for retarded individuals, and so on.</p>

<p>In addition they need feel no concern about the sound policy pursued by the Minister and his Administration. There is the question of the interdependence of the various subsections. The profits made in one subsection are used to cover the losses in another. This prevents the prices of commodities evidencing large fluctuations. The tariff policy of the Minister as a whole is sound. Because it is so, the Railway servants may enter the years ahead with confidence because they know themselves to be employed in a sound undertaking.</p>

<p>Another matter which this Budget underlines, is the sound relationship existing between the Minister and the Railway Staff Associations. The Railway servants may enter the years ahead confident in the knowledge that these good relationships will continue. Good relationships are essential for sound consultation. This has also always been the case. The relationships at present are such that the Minister can discuss matters with them in a good spirit and in that same good spirit point out to them where they are wrong. In spite of that the good relationships continue. That is very important.</p>

<p>But after having said that now, it is as well for the Railway officials to note what is being said of them from the other side of the House. They must take note of how their efforts are being scrutinized by the other side of the House. The hon. member for Yeoville, for example, specifically referred to &#x201C;incompetence&#x201D; among Railway servants. The hon. member for Durban (Point), again, referred to promotions and implied that only those who had the ear of the officials responsible for promotions were in fact promoted.</p>

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Those complaints were not sufficiently substantiated. We <span class="col_2651-2652" refersTo="page_1348"/>know what the hon. member for Durban (Central) said about the competence of certain senior Airways officers. We heard that the hon. member for Salt River professed that the safety of the service is being endangered by the Minister&#x2019;s staff policy. They say these things in such a way as to create the impression that they are taking up the cudgels for the railwayman. But in everything they say about the railwayman there is a hostile undertone. They want to undermine the policy of interdependence, the dependence of one division of the Railways on another. They want to wreck the Railway tariff structure, a policy which has yielded very good results up to the present. They also criticize the way in which staff is utilized. &#x201C;Use the available manpower&#x201D;, they said. When the Minister asked them directly what their policy was in respect of the employment of non-Whites, for example, he could not obtain a reply. [Interjections.] The Minister in his turn stated his own policy very clearly so that the railwayman could take note of it. But the Opposition does not want to tell us what their policy is. The railwayman must note that the Opposition plans to use all available labour, without saying in what form or according to what pattern. There is a great deal of criticism, but during this Session and in the Railways debate we have heard no elucidations from the Opposition about what they would like to do in respect of this matter, as was the case with their federation policy.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I find it almost fascinating to listen to hon. members opposite and to the way in which they find reasons for thanking the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>I did not thank the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>[Interjections.] The hon. member now feels a bit guilty and says he did not thank the Minister, but he did not have to thank the Minister because he had nothing to thank him for. He is now becoming a little worried. I am surprised at the speech of the hon. member. He spoke about our plea that we should use the available manpower and he tried to turn that into an attack on the United Party, and he also tried to run away from what his own Minister said. What was the Minister&#x2019;s attitude on this question? He stood there shouting at us: Tell us what will you do if the trade unions object to the use of black manpower? He kept on repeating that until eventually we said to him: What would you do, and what did you do? He then hesitated for a moment, taken aback that we should dare to put that question to him, and then he said: &#x201C;I use Native labour: even if the trade unions are opposed to it, I use it if it is in the interest of the country to do so.&#x201D; He was quite open about it and I admire him for it. He has been taking credit from this side of the House and from the country and from the newspapers supporting the Opposition, and even from his own trade unions, for the fact that he is a practical Minister and that he does use all the available manpower. But he does not follow his Government&#x2019;s policy. He ignores it. He stands above the Cabinet; he does what he likes. He is independent in the same way that his newspapers are independent from the rest of the Government Press. [Interjections.] I intend dealing with another matter where he overruled the Cabinet. Listening to hon. members opposite, one would never dream that there were such people as railway workers living in their constituencies. All they have done is to thank the Minister for this thing or that thing. The hon. member for Lichtenburg thanked the Minister for allowing railway water to be used in the gardens. It made the gardens so much better because they were getting railway water. And that hon. member thanked the Minister for solving the truck problem. Why was there a truck problem? Because that Minister&#x2019;s predecessor cancelled the United Party policy of getting trucks. We ordered trucks and Mr. Sauer cancelled the order, and that is why this Minister himself says that he took over at a time of crisis in the Railways. He had to save the Railways from the Nationalist Party Government, and that is why he sits there now looking like a cat licking his lips after eating cream, because he saved the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Now, I am not going to thank the Minister for anything, but I do want to express appreciation to his staff and his Administration for the way in which they responded to my appeal to help those forgotten people in the country, the poor, drought-stricken farmers. I made an appeal to the staff of the Railways to provide tankers to get water for the farmers in my constituency and I must say that I have never seen such a response from any other Government Department as I got from the Railways. It was most expeditiously done, with no waste of time, and I was impressed by the sympathy and the understanding shown by the officials to whom I made my appeal on this occasion. I have been asked by the farmers&#x2019; associations to express appreciation to the Administration and the staff for what they did on that occasion. When I deal with the staff and the Administration, how different is the response I get from them and the response I get when I ask the Minister for anything. I make no apology for coming back to this point again. I have raised it on several occasions. This shows that this Minister dominates the whole of the Cabinet. I do not know whether he is a &#x201C;ver-krampte&#x201D; or a &#x201C;verligte&#x201D;, but whatever he is, he is going to win. All other Government servants who are seconded to the Transkei get an allowance. They get up to R80 a month more than their counterparts in the rest of the country. The people who do not get this allowance are the police, the postal officials, members of the staff of the auditing department and the railway servants. The hon. the Minister makes the excuse that the other Government servants are seconded to a foreign Government. I pointed out that the Transkeian Government was not a foreign Government <span class="col_2653-2654" refersTo="page_1349"/>yet, and he said, &#x201C;No, not yet, but it is going to be a foreign Government one day and that is why they get this extra allowance&#x201D;. Sir, I have pointed out often that the Minister&#x2019;s servants come into closer contact with the Africans in that territory than those civil servants who get the allowance. The railway officials in the Transkei resent the fact that they are not getting this allowance, and I am making an appeal for those railwaymen again. The hon. members for Durban (Point) and Yeoville and others have quoted the complaints of railwaymen against the Administration. Sir, these complaints are justifiable. In addition to those complaints, the railwaymen working in the Transkei have another complaint and that is that their Minister discriminates against them in favour of other officials. When I pointed out on one occasion that it was not only the seconded officials who received this allowance but also members of the staff of the audit department, who are not seconded officials, the Minister said that he would inquire into the position. He did, and he found that that was correct. He said in this House that he would see the Cabinet about it and he did; he took away the allowance from the staff of the audit department. They are now treated on the same basis as the railway officials. Sir, the Minister cannot liken the railwaymen in the Transkei with railwaymen employed in Zululand or in any other reserve. The white people are not leaving Zululand. The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development talks with pride of the fact that the white people are leaving the Transkei. Sir, it is Government policy that they should get out, and the more they leave the Transkei the fewer social amenities will there be for the Whites who remain, and the Whites who remain are the railwaymen; they have to remain.</p>

<p>As far as the bus services are concerned, the Government is training Bantu bus drivers and they are taking over the bus services but the Bantu are not taking over the running of the Railways. When I asked a few years ago what the policy was with regard to the Railways and whether they were going to have Bantu drivers the answer was, &#x201C;No; that would only come in time&#x201D;. They are taking no steps to train Bantu to do those jobs which are being done by white railwaymen at present so the white railwaymen will have to stay in the Transkei. Their services are important and necessary and we cannot do without them. And, Sir, they live there with a grudge; they are dissatisfied and you cannot have efficiency from a dissatisfied staff. That is why I again make this appeal to the hon. the Minister. I am not asking him for something indeterminate. He knows how many railwaymen there are; he knows what would be involved in cash payments that he would have to make, because the numbers of the white railwaymen are not going to increase. In fact, if they start handing over the Railways to black railway-men, the number of Whites will become fewer. The Minister cannot say therefore that he does not know what amount of the taxpayer&#x2019;s money would be involved; he knows that very well. His railwaymen in South-West Africa get this allowance and there is no reason why the railwaymen in the Transkei should not get it.</p>

<p>The Minister says that because they have received it for so long they have a vested interest and therefore he cannot take it away. That was his reply. But, Sir, the fact is that they do get it. Why did they get it in 1924? Because they were doing a different kind of work; they were in different surroundings; they were not working in the Union and that is why they got that allowance, and I say that the Minister should give this allowance to the railwaymen in the Transkei. He should put them on the same basis as other white civil servants working in the Transkei. Sir, I will continue to make this appeal on behalf of those forgotten people in the Transkei, the railwaymen.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down said he refused to thank the hon. the Minister. I think if we have ever had a Minister of Transport in this country who should be thanked, then it is the present Minister. I want to say right at the outset that I want to pay homage to the Minister for what he has achieved in the past 15 years since he has controlled this Department. We all know that the Minister knows all about trains and railways from A to Z; as a matter of fact he was launched on a public career from the footplate of an engine. What really astonished me, and I think all hon. members on this side, was the way in which he dealt with complex and very technical matters concerning airlines during the course of his reply to the hon. member for Durban (Central) who spoke about the disaster at Windhoek a few months back. It was a magnificent performance by a magnificent Minister, and I sincerely hope the Minister will be at the controls of the South African Railways for many years to come.</p>

<p>Having closely followed the Railways debate last week it is quite clear to me that the Opposition were having difficulty in finding any serious flaws in the way the Minister handled the affairs of the Railways over the past year. They picked a few points at random and hammered away at them, trying to create the impression that there was a state of seething discontent among the country&#x2019;s railwaymen. The one main point which they raised once again was the Railways&#x2019; staff shortage and the concomitant overtime which railwaymen have to <span class="col_2655-2656" refersTo="page_1350"/>work. When the Minister cornered the hon. member for Yeoville, as the hon. member for Germiston pointed out, and asked him to tell the House how a United Party government would alleviate the staff shortage, he shied away from it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>It is not true.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, you did. The hon. member did not want to tell us whether they would appoint non-White labourers on a large scale on the Railways. The hon. member shied away from it every time. This reticence to give the House a candid answer to the Minister&#x2019;s question is in my view because the United Party want to open the sluice gates of non-white labour on the Railways should they come to power but they dare not tell the electorate that. The Minister candidly said that in the interests of the country he would appoint non-White workers in certain vacancies so that white men could obtain better positions on the Railways, and now the United Party want to create the impression in the country that the Minister wants to flood the Railways with Kaffirs. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point), who has so much to say now, spoke of much so-called dissatisfaction among the railway staff. Year after year he has filled the role here of a sort of unofficial commissioner of grievances. Every year he reads a few letters here from people who are supposed to be aggrieved about certain matters on the Railways. Surely the hon. member knows there are proper channels through which these grievances, if they are genuine, can be put, namely the staff organizations. The Minister has invited the hon. member to take up these matters with him so that he can go into them personally. But the hon. member prefers to score a few cheap political points in the House by flaunting the few so-called grievances in public.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Do you think there are only a few grievances?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, only a few grievances. The hon. member went further last Friday and made very serious allegations across the floor against certain Railways officials, people who he knows cannot reply to his attacks because they are not in a position to do so. I think it is very unfair. The hon. member said that there are railway servants who are hesitant to disclose information to their M.P.&#x2019; for fear of victimization. He also said that railway officials sometimes coerce railwaymen to accept transfers to forlorn places somewhere in the bundu. I think it is a scandalous reflection on our very worthy railway officials who are working very hard, especially as a result of the shortage of staff. I think the hon. member owes them an apology, because he knows that they cannot reply to him across the floor of the House. The hon. member also tried to create the impression here that there is a state of tyranny and inquisition in the Railways, but we on this side reject that accusation about the railway officials with the contempt it deserves.</p>

<p>Before I come to a few other points which I want to raise with the Minister, I want to say that the South African Airways plays an increasingly outstanding role in the transportation of goods and passengers in South Africa and also in the economy of the South African Railways. We are fast becoming a nation of flyers. South Africa is becoming airborne. Whilst a few years ago it was very easy to obtain a reservation on an aeroplane, to-day it is becoming more and more difficult.</p>

<p>It is for that reason I want to touch on a few matters concerning the airlines. Something which has not been raised here and which I want to raise, and which also shows the very modern and efficient way in which the South African Airways are being handled, is the announcement in January by the hon. the Minister that South African Airways have a solution for the continuing hijacking of planes now occurring in the United States. I happened to be in the States when the wave of &#x201C;skyjacking&#x201D;, as the Americans now call it, was at its height last year. The American airlines were absolutely helpless. As a matter of fact, nowhere else, as far as I know, except in South Africa, has a country come forward with a method to prevent the hijacking of planes. All kinds of suggestions have been made overseas, such as X-raying the passengers to detect whether they are carrying guns on their person. But in the overseas countries, as we know, where the air traffic is very dense, such a system would be too laborious and time-consuming. The result so far has been that skyjacking, as the common cold, has been accepted as something which has to be lived with and something which cannot be prevented. In fact, because no one has been injured so far, apart from the unfortunate shooting that took place the other day in Colombia, some Americans are even enjoying the adventure of being &#x201C;skyjacked&#x201D;. I have heard them say when they fly to Miami: &#x201C;Will we be taken for a joyride to Havana?&#x201D; We in South Africa, of course, cannot take the hijacking of our planes so facetiously. We can accept that if one of our planes should ever be hijacked, say to a hostile African country, it could have dire consequences for the passengers. It would certainly not be a laughting matter. Consequently, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and the Department on the fact that they have been able to find a way to prevent the hijacking of our planes. Naturally, for obvious reasons, the technique must remain secret and confidential. But I am quite sure that if other nations are interested, we would be prepared to share our secrets, and perhaps we should volunteer our secret technique to them. As I have said we read in the paper last week that an innocent passenger was shot dead during a scuffle with a hijacker in Colombia. The first blood has now flown and perhaps <span class="col_2657-2658" refersTo="page_1351"/>South Africa could make its contribution to prevent this horror in the air spreading.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with another aspect, namely the training of our pilots, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister what the position is in so far as trainee pilots are concerned. Are enough men coming forward in view of the tremendous expansion in air travel which lies around the corner? Are many well-trained pilots still coming from other sources such as the South African Air Force? I know that for very urgent defence reasons as few as possible of these pilots should be drawn away from the South African Air Force and I want to ask whether it will not be a good idea to establish a special College of Air Training, sponsored and financed by the South African Railways Administration, for the training of professional civil pilots.</p>

<p>I also want to raise another matter and this concerns the revolution which is coming in the sky as far as air freight is concerned. First the aim was faster and bigger jets for the transporting of passengers, but now the introduction of aerial freight trains is on the horizon. When we read the annual report of the South African Railways and Harbours Administration for the year 1967-&#x2019;68 we see that the Administration is doing everything possible to stimulate the carrying of air freight in our aeroplanes. Over the weekend a small news item appeared in a newspaper that Pan-American Airways is establishing a special air freight terminal at Jan Smuts Airport for this very purpose. I therefore hope that the hon. the Minister will continue vigorously in this direction. Giant aeroplanes are bringing about impressive changes in South African commerce and industry in the field of air freight transportation. I want to mention only a few aspects where changes can be effected. It will mean better service and faster delivery that will eliminate the need for much expensive warehousing and the keeping of large stocks by companies. In the second instance shipment by air will cut the delay in transportation and losses in regard to damage and theft. The potential of transporting fresh fruit, vegetables and meat, not only to South Africa&#x2019;s domestic markets where there may be a shortage, but also to our overseas markets is tremendous, as I see it. I cannot go too deeply into this matter but I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not consider, when ordering new jumbo jets in the future, as he must, buying also one or two convertible cargo-passenger jet planes. As I see it, the South African market may not yet be ready to justify the buying of these big air freighters the Americans are starting to use, but convertible cargo-passenger jet planes may be a better investment for South Africa at this stage.</p>

<p>For the convenience and comfort of air travellers I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it will not be possible to introduce a hot and moist facial towel service on our internal services during the summer months. I know this will sound like a trivial matter, but those of us who have travelled overseas know that it is general practice for airlines operating in the hot climates like in the Far East, to distribute to passengers these facial towelettes either of cotton or paper, soaked sometimes in eau de cologne. I can assure hon. members that it is wonderful how refreshing the application to one&#x2019;s face of one of these towelettes is.</p>

<p>Last year I asked the hon. the Minister whether film shows could not be held on our airplanes on the long overseas flights, and the hon. the Minister then said that the matter had been investigated and that it was found to be not very popular amongst passengers. I now want to mention something else and I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he would not investigate the possibility of installing an in-flight &#x201C;Theatre-in-the-Air&#x201D; such as some overseas airlines already have on their long overseas flights. This &#x201C;Theatre-in-the-Air&#x201D;, as it is called, consists of eight different channels on which assorted programmes of music can be listened to through ear-phones without disturbing the other passengers. Amongst the programmes on the different channels are such programmes as popular show tunes, classical music, tunes for teenagers, a children&#x2019;s hour and even a language laboratory in the air by which foreign languages such as French and German can be taught.</p>

<p>I have raised these questions with the hon. the Minister and, as I have said, although they appear to be trivial, I think that all of us who have travelled will appreciate that these conveniences and comforts promote a sense of comfort and well-being for every passenger.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us proceed. The hon. members on the other side have accepted and agreed, that there are grievances on the Railways, that there is dissatisfaction and that the hon. the Minister does employ a non-white labourer when he thinks fit to do so. This is accepted, and the hon. the Minister has said so. Tributes have been paid to him, that he is a man who stands head and shoulders above his colleagues. I think that speaking of him as a Minister, that is correct. But the big thing is, that amongst those qualities he has one other quality. That is the rare quality of having the skill of never answering a question, if he does not want to answer it. Many questions were put to him during the Second Reading, which he just left alone or to which he made only passing reference. The hon. the Minister has failed to give any reaction to my request for something to be done about Coloured pensioners on the Railways. When I pressed him at the time, he also failed to give me a suitable answer to what the future of the Coloured people will be, as far as employment on the Railway is concerned. He tried to make a little political capital by doing his best to embarrass this side of the House. Then, by pulling the rabbit out of the hat, he said that he does not take any notice of the trade unions and the staff associations, when he thinks it is necessary, in the interest of the country, to employ them. Within two days of that statement being made, I saw a statement in a newspaper, where the staff association leader, Mr. Liebenberg, said that he had no knowledge of any dispute with the hon. the Minister about the employment of these people. So, how can the hon. the Minister come into Parliament and tell us, that he pays no attention to the objections of the staff association in view of the fact that, in this instance, they did not raise any objections? This is what he has said. This is the big deal. This is the kind of thing which bedevils our relationships with the Coloured man. I am quite sure the hon. the Minister likes to employ numbers of Coloured persons, but he cannot do so because of the attitude of hon. gentlemen on that side. We have heard the other day that, as far as the Coloured people are concerned, the sky is no longer the limit, and that they now enter a <i>cul de sac</i> as far as their future is concerned. We have also had all this talk about separation and no development. I should, therefore, like to ask the hon. the Minister what development can Coloured people expect on the Railways. I would like the hon. the Minister to give us a straightforward answer to that question, so that the Coloured people may know. Many of them, especially parents, feel that the time has come that their children should have the opportunity to share in the Railways and its prosperity.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister also referred, rather lightly, and flippantly, to my suggestion about the question of overtime in relation to staff and their salary scales. The hon. the Minister said to me, that he did not understand what I meant, and that I must think again. Well, I happened to think beforehand, not afterwards. What I am suggesting to him is that, while this amount of overtime is being paid, Railwaymen regard that overtime as part of their emoluments. They would suffer very serious hardships, if that amount of money was to be removed from their pay packet. When you employ additional people, which I suggest should be Coloured&#x2014;the Minister possibly thinks he would be able to find Whites, but he does not say where&#x2014;the value of the pay packets would necessarily be reduced. If Coloured people are involved, there will immediately be a big political &#x201C;bohaai&#x201D; over this whole business. My proposition to the hon. the Minister is that an assessment should be made of the amount of overtime which these men work, and that it should be averaged out in relation to the grades and scales upon which they work, and that that should be the normal or the basic wage for the grade. Then nobody would suffer a reduction of great magnitude in his pay packet. That is quite a simple and straightforward proposition, and I ask the Minister to accept in good faith that that is a sincere attempt to help him over the difficulty of acquiring additional labour, which he must have. This would also get him over the political problem of employing Coloured persons in the Railways. We all realize that this problem does exist, and I think I realize this better than anybody else. These are two points which I think the hon. the Minister should reply to in some detail in his reply.</p>

<p>I also asked the hon. Minister how he could explain his attitude over the years, when I have spoken to him across the floor in regard to his refusal to give concessions, or reductions, in tariffs in certain areas. Persons from these areas have stated that the development of the region is militated against by high railway tariffs. This is the one leg. His attitude has been, that he would make no reductions because it has not been proved that railway tariffs militate against the development of industry. But, in the brochure which has been published by the Department of Economic Affairs, it is stated that the Minister of Transport is prepared to give a 15 per cent discount on railage on merchandize manufactured and transported by the Railways from certain specified points known, as growth points or decentralized areas. Here, on the one hand, we find that a group of people are asking for a reduction of tariffs, which the Minister refuses, while, on the other hand, he gives a reduction of 15 per cent, and not only that, but also 25 per cent on harbour dues at the ports to which these goods are sent. I should also like to get a straight-forward answer on that question, so that we may know his reasons for refusing to accommodate one group of people and his ready willingness to assist others.</p>

<p>The last, and final, point is the one about <span class="col_2661-2662" refersTo="page_1353"/>the question of planning on harbours. It has been said here, and other speakers will probably also raise the matter, that the planning of harbours is behind the times and that insufficient attention has been paid to this particular activity. During the debate on another matter earlier this session, the hon. the Minister of Planning, by way of interjection, when I suggested that 100,000-ton ore-carriers might come to Port Elizabeth and that there were no facilities in that harbour to accommodate that type of ship, said to me: &#x201C;The Government has not said that.&#x201D; In other words, my suggestion that planning should be taken care of at those ports to enable that type of ship, loaded with ore to be carted away, was not within the planning of the Government. I have a newspaper article here which was published about eight months ago, saying that the Government of Chile is not only providing deep-water berths already for 100,000-ton ore-carriers, but a second port is in the process of being deepened to accommodate similar carriers. The Minister referred to the fact last year across the floor of the House, that the amount of ore being used in Japan from this part of the world was controlled by the easy access to ore from Australia. Now ore from the Mount Newman deposit, which is an enormous one, is already being loaded onto ships with deepwater berths and taking that business away from us. As far back as last year, the Japanese made it clear that they did not intend to take ore from us to the extent that they did before. It is the contention of many, that the planning by the Railways of deep-water berths is very much behind the times. I would say to the Minister that I think the proposition to separate harbours from the railways is not unreasonable. One must remember that the Railways have no competition. They can do just what they like and they do not have to meet any competition of any kind. The law takes care of them, but the harbours are in a different category, because in many parts of the world many harbours, privately owned in many cases, are far in advance in their thinking and in their assessment of the requirements of merchant ships. In my opinion this is a most serious matter. The Minister has treated lightly suggestions of using a place on the west coast as a port and also any suggestion from men like myself, who also think they know a little about the proposition, to do something about making sure that the ore exporting business is taken care of on a scale which it deserves and which it needs. The report on Iscor makes it clear. They also expect to share in the ore exporting business. I do believe, and I say it quite frankly, that the hon. the Minister would be well advised to take the House into his confidence and tell us exactly what he is going to do about the provision of deepwater ports for this type of ship. One sees them in other parts of the world and many of them come around the Cape. I believe that the time is overdue for him to do something about it.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I think his remarks the other evening to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition were in extremely bad taste. I do not think it becomes his office, nor his ability as a Minister. I think he is sufficiently competent and has enough efficient people at his back, to give all the answers that are necessary to any queries raised by any member of this House. I think it is extremely bad for a Minister, in his position, and with his experience, and as Leader of the House, to pass the remarks he did about the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>We are now coming to the end of the debate on Railways and one is a bit disappointed when listening to the Minister&#x2019;s replies. A business organization such as the Railways which involves a considerable amount of money finds itself in difficulties through lack of forecasting for the future. The Minister is budgeting to lose something like R49 million on his Railways, he does not offer any solution as to how he is going to overcome that, and that is really a serious problem when you look at the balance sheet of the whole organization. Hiding behind the profits of the Harbours and the pipelines is of course unsound. Ordinary business principles would not allow it. If you have a department in business which loses money, you can close it down, but the Minister cannot do that. So he should examine the whole position of the Railways. Years ago he had the same trouble and he appointed the Schumann Commission to go into the whole question of his policy in regard to rates. I say this because industry, the farmers and the whole country should know well beforehand what the Government is going to do. He cannot continue to recoup his losses out of another fund. If you look at his Budget and you examine the replies he gave, he does not offer any solution; he is only hoping that business will be better, but there is nothing concrete. There is nothing really to offset this very big loss. It has been said from the other side of the House that we did not thank the Minister for the extra money he gave the Railway pensioners, but that is something we have been asking for for more than a year, namely better conditions for the Railwaymen. It was really done with the purpose of attracting men to his staff. When one listens to the hon. the Minister and the other hon. members, they feel that we come to this House with little paltry complaints from Railwaymen about what is happening. It shows up the fact that the hon. members opposite are not in touch with their Railway constituents, [Interjections.] I am going to tell you something, Sir. If you go among the Railwaymen, people who are close supporters of the Government, and you see the very deep dissension among them, you get a shock. At the time when the Minister was a railwayman, it was like a religion. A railwayman had a purpose and a life to serve the Railways and his son usually followed him. To-day that is not so. I recently went to a farewell party given for a prominent railwayman and he said openly that if he had <span class="col_2663-2664" refersTo="page_1354"/>his time over again he would not go back to the Railways, because there is no future in it. I spoke last year about the dissension that exists in regard to the application of the disciplinary measures. They do not like it. I asked the Minister to set up a commission of one person to examine the application of the disciplinary code. The disciplinary measures are applied by people who are incompetent. Foremen, charge hands, who have had no judicial experience can never judge the merits of evidence. People are fined and the System Managers invariably do not like to reverse those findings. These people are not competent to apply justice and you get this dissension. The workers do not like it. We have heard cases mentioned by the hon. member for Durban (Point), and I have other cases. It is not right. This could never happen in a firm outside. While I admit that there must be a disciplinary code, I say it must be properly applied, but it is not being properly applied and it is creating very serious dissension. You only have to go around, as I have gone around in this area and elsewhere, to find that there is dissension. If hon. members opposite say it is not there, I say they are out of touch completely.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister was telling us about his pipelines which are dealt with in another Bill. The hon. member for Turffontein also mentioned the question of pipelines here today. We were pleased to see that the hon. the Minister had broadened his view as far as pipelines are concerned, and that he was making provision for the conveyance of ores, gases, etc., by pipeline. We hope to see gases conveyed by pipeline from Louren&#x00E7;o Marques to the Reef. But I should like to ask the Minister not to adopt the attitude, when he conveys ores and gases by pipeline, that it is high-rate traffic and that high rates must be charged to make up for the loss on the conveyance of other traffic. As far as the principle of applying the rate which the traffic can bear is concerned, it is not correct, of course, to say that principle applies in the case of petrol conveyed by pipeline because all that happens is that the people who pay this high rate simply pass it on to the public. If a person is a commercial traveller, then under his costing system he passes on this high charge to the public, with the result that the public have to pay more. These commodities should be conveyed at a competitive rate. Sir, the hon. member for Karoo has referred here to our ore exports. As far as ore exports are concerned, we are faced with world-wide competition and in order to be able to export our ores we should get down to the lowest possible rate because, after all, the fact that we have to export large quantities of our ore is due to the fact that the Government has not put up sufficient steel works and processing works to enable our ores to be used locally and to export the steel. In that respect the Government has failed.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we come back to the old question of the manpower shortage, the problem that faces the Government and that faces all of us in this country. If the Government had carried out the United Party policy of bringing immigrants at the time when they were available, the position would have been very much different to-day. We have a terrific backlog to make up and we are not going to make it up because with the prosperity and the very high living standards on the Continent and in the rest of the world, to-day people are reluctant to come here. We have nothing to offer them; we do not have television and we cannot offer them the social services to which they are accustomed. Hon. members opposite are all afraid that we may become a social welfare state. There is no real incentive for workers from overseas to come here. Sir, we must therefore make use of the labour that we have available in this country. The unions over the years have agreed to what the Minister has now done. To-day he is using our labour to the best advantage. These jobs have to be revalued. We cannot have Whites doing jobs which can be done either by Coloureds or by Bantu. These jobs have to be revalued and our white railway workers have to be uplifted. The Minister is acting correctly and we support that policy of making the best use of the labour of this country.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister has not said anything about the question of attracting passengers to our railways and about providing air-conditioning in the trains. This is something that must be attended to. We must look at this from a business angle. We can only attract passengers by improving the services we offer.</p>

<p>Then I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to give his consideration to the position of our air mechanics. You find to-day that there are different categories of technicians. The mechanics who are being used for the maintenance of ground vehicles are highly qualified, thoroughly trained people, yet they are not classified as technicians. When the change-over took place even the storemen who work with those mechanics were classified as technicians but not the actual mechanics. This affected the mechanics adversely because there is a difference in pay. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that it is wrong to have different categories of mechanics. Take an aircraft mechanic, for instance. The hon. the Minister might say that he is of a higher standard than an ordinary motor mechanic. He might think that but I know a lot of motor mechanics to-day who are very much better than some of your air mechanics. They go through an intensive course of training, and these mechanics have to maintain highly sophisticated machines. There should not be any differentiation in pay.</p>

<p>Another question that I want to raise with the hon. the Minister is the use of the D.F. Malan and Durban airports as international airports. I understand that Durban is an international airport but D. F. Malan has not been classified as such. I know that the hon. the <span class="col_2665-2666" refersTo="page_1355"/>Minister just shrugs this oft but we in the Cape have to suffer the indignity of finding &#x2022;that aircraft using the now air route to America overfly the D. F. Malan Airport. There is, of course, a saving in mileage, but if these aircraft landed and fueled at D. F. Malan they could carry very much more in the way of cargo and passengers. They could then carry 5,000 lbs. more weight or 25 more passengers. Moreover, if these aircraft fueled in Cape Town they could fly overseas nonstop. Sir, it is all wrong that our airport here, the D. F. Malan, has not been declared an international airport. I say that flights to America should start from the D. F. Malan airport, not from Jan Smuts. We should make use of every pound of weight that we can put on our aircraft to make the service more payable. I hope the hon. the Minister will give consideration to this.</p>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>I sat and listened attentively to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. He made a very pointed indictment here against the mechanics of the Air Force. I think it was altogether undeserved. Sir, all people in the world are not equally good, and all mechanics are probably not equally good, but I give the hon. member the assurance that those are all persons who have received a very thorough training. After their training course they must undergo various tests before they are graded as first-grade mechanics. The hon. member comes along here and reviles the mechanics. I do not know whether the hon. member knows what air mileage is performed in this country by the S.A. Airways. He referred here again to the aircraft accident which took place in Windhoek, but that accident was attributable to human factors, and they will always be present. Only this morning we heard over the radio of the tremendous air disaster in Venezuela. Every day one hears of air disasters overseas. The hon. member wants to create the impression here that it is unsafe to make use of our Airways because our mechanics are supposedly not good enough to check the aircraft properly. Sir, that is blatant nonsense. Take the number of passengers who travel by air to-day in comparison with the position a few years ago. The number of passengers has virtually doubled a hundredfold because people to-day feel that air transport is one of the safest forms of transport. Compare the number of accidents in the air with those on the road. Every Monday morning we read in the paper of the large number of motor accidents which took place during the week-end and in which many people lose their lives. In proportion there are probably 50 to 100 per cent more road accidents than accidents in the air. In spite of all the precautionary measures taken to reduce the number of road accidents, by making the roads wider, for example, by constructing double carriage ways and by the imposition of speed restrictions, a tremendously large number of road accidents still take place. These accidents are attributable to the human factor because one always finds people who take risks. I am not saying that pilots and mechanics take risks by allowing the aircraft to take off without having been properly overhauled. I assume that every aircraft is properly overhauled. But because an accident has now taken place, all the blame is cast on the hon. the Minister. This I cannot accept. I want to take up the cudgels for the mechanics of the S.A. Airways this afternoon, and I want to place it on record that we have the highest regard for them. They do their work in such a thorough, intelligent way that accidents are restricted to a minimum. I cannot see how the hon. member can stand up here and make such an accusation against our mechanics. He is doing them a grave injustice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who just sat down once again referred to the Airways. I want to tell him that we on this side of the House accept that our Airways officials and technicians are of the highest order. They are well trained and efficient. Furthermore, we have their loyalty. That does not mean that when we on this side consider that there are one or two unsatisfactory factors, that we should not raise them. On the contrary, I think we are rendering South Africa a good service by bringing such factors forward.</p>

<p>But I should like to refer back to a matter I raised earlier on in the debate, i.e. the question of an emergency fund. The Minister in reply to me said it was not the function of the S.A.R. Administration to establish such funds. I accept his explanation with reservations. Is there any reason why the Administration cannot make interim payments in cases where it has to pay compensation in the end to persons who died or who were seriously injured as a result of accidents? In the two major accidents over the last couple of years more than a hundred people were killed whilst many were injured. If one were to calculate the number of dependants involved, one would find that there are quite a number. What is more, most of them come from the low-income group and, consequently, they are particularly hard hit when the breadwinner is put out of action as the result of an accident. If the Railways Administration could make interim payments to the dependants, it could help to allay their anxiety over the period until full compensation has been paid. As I pointed out to the Minister, compensation takes a long time to finalize. Could the Minister not, in these circumstances, consider issuing an instruction that interim payments could be made to those people who are subjected to particular hardships as a result of accidents?</p>

<p>I should also like to return to this question of separating harbours from railways. The Minister said that a separation of harbours from the railways would result in an increase in railway rates. He went on to state that the Durban pier had cost the Railways R30 million. To me this seems a case of have your <span class="col_2667-2668" refersTo="page_1356"/>cake and eat it. One moment it is a disadvantage to separate the Railways from the harbours, as it would increase railway rates. The next moment we hear that the Railways had to pay the R30 million for the Durban pier. I would be more convinced by the Minister&#x2019;s argument if he could quote to me business houses and chambers of commerce, that support him in his standpoint that the Railways should not be separated from harbours. If he could bring me evidence of that, I would be far more happy. If the separation of harbours from Railways would result in an increase in railway rates, how come that the Railways have paid for the new pier in Durban Harbour? The Minister cannot have it both ways. Therefore I should like him to quote to me outside authorities who support him in his view.</p>

<p>The Minister mentioned that sea passenger traffic was falling off, and that, consequently, it would be no sense to build an extra passenger terminal in Cape Town harbour. I pointed out during the debate that figures disproved this point of view because passenger traffic, according to all authorities, seems to be increasing, so much so that at this very moment a new passenger liner is receiving the South African flag here in Cape Town harbour. I think the facts disprove what the Minister has said. In fact, indications point to the opposite. I should like to see the official figures of the number of passengers who have arrived in Cape Town harbour during the past three years. I should like to know whether these official figures bear out the Minister&#x2019;s standpoint that a new passenger terminal in Cape Town harbour is uneconomic.</p>

<p>I should also like to touch upon the labour question and comment upon the Minister&#x2019;s statement that no excessive overtime was being worked. The crux of the matter here revolves around the length of a normal shift. The Minister said that a shift of 12 hours was quite normal for an engine driver, for instance. But to work a 12-hour shift week after week and month after month is, in my view, excessive overtime and detrimental to the worker&#x2019;s health.</p>

<p>Another question I should like to raise with the Minister is the schedule of some of our main-line passenger trains. I should like to know whether the running time of these could not with benefit be changed. It so happens that the main-line passenger train from Durban to Cape Town runs through the most uninteresting part of South Africa at the most interesting time of the day. It misses out the scenery at both ends of the run. Is there any reason why that should be so? Perhaps the Minister has a good reason. But I fail to see why the times of departure at both ends cannot be adjusted so that this part of the trip can be made during daylight hours. There has also been an outcry against the fact that passenger trains have to travel through the Karoo during the hottest parts of the day without being air conditioned. This is a point the Minister should take into consideration.</p>

<p>Another question is that of the admission of the public to Cape Town harbour during week-ends. As reason for the present embargo on the public in the harbour during weekends, is given the fact that the harbour personnel are very busy and that, hence, they cannot afford having tourists running all over the place. But let me remind him that Durban harbour is open at all times, despite the fact that it handles a good bit more traffic than Cape Town. If Durban harbour can be kept open under these circumstances, I fail to see why Cape Town harbour cannot.</p>

<p>Another point I should like to raise is the question of the registration of crew members of fishing vessels leaving the docks in the course of the day. We have had cases along our coasts of fishing trawlers having been reported missing while nobody had the slightest idea of how many crew members there were on board. I should, therefore, like to know whether it is not possible when a fishing trawler leaves one of our major ports for the port captain to be informed of every member on that trawler. Should something then happen to that trawler, it would be possible for the authorities to know just who is on that trawler. Up to now this has not been the case.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal has referred once more to the question of a passenger terminal in Cape Town harbour. In support of his point of view he cited the fact that a new passenger ship has to-day come under the South African flag. But this is not a new ship in passenger traffic to South Africa. On the contrary, it is a ship which has been plying the trade already for a considerable time. The change of flag only means that the ship has now been taken over by Safmarine. Therefore this is not a new passenger ship in the sense that it is additional to the existing passenger fleet.</p>

The hon. member again made a charge of incompetency against senior officials of the S.A.A. I expected him to apologize for that but instead of doing so he repeated his charge. I want to say the Assistant General Manager of Airways, Mr. Conradie, and the Airways Manager, Mr. Jimmy Adam, are two of the most competent officials in the Service. I think any other airline would be proud to have two men of such outstanding ability in its service. I am very sorry that the hon. member made such very serious reflections on their ability.

In the course of his speech he said, &#x201C;So one can go on and quote dozens, hundreds, and perhaps thousands of cases &#x2026;&#x201D; He said he could quote thousands of cases.

<p>Let me deal with some of the charges he made. He said for vaccination against influenza the poor railwayman had to pay R3 for the first person, R2.20 for the second and R2 each for subsequent persons. However, the Management informs me that 40.000 railwaymen in key positions are being vaccinated free, and the rest against payment of 90c per dose of vaccine. The hon. member also said, &#x201C;We would have expected something more imaginative from the Minister&#x2014;real modernization &#x2026; There should be a re-approach to the question of mechanization and modernization and the elimination of the old useless systems.&#x201D; Thank heavens, I do not have the fertile imagination <span class="col_2671-2672" refersTo="page_1358"/>which my hon. friend has, for then I would have been in real difficulties. He said I must be more imaginative as far as modernization is concerned. But the trouble is he lets these remarks hang in the air. He does not say what he refers to. He spoke about &#x201C;the question of mechanization &#x2026;&#x201D;. He does not say what he is talking about.</p>

<p>I made my Budget speech and I replied to the debate with a long speech in the hon. member&#x2019;s absence, but he said he read my speech and knows all about it. In my Budget speech I spoke about mechanization and modernization, about the resultant staff savings, and things of that nature. Everything was there. I say the hon. member should be more explicit. He said, for instance, he expected an &#x201C;imaginative scheme&#x201D; to try and improve the training basis of the Railways personnel. Has the hon. member ever heard of Esselen Park?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I have been there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, he has been there. Well, well, well, and he still said this! In spite of having been there, he still said there must be an improvement in the training basis of Railways personnel. Apparently the hon. gentleman finds it extremely difficult to learn. Does the hon. member realize that in all the railway systems in the world the Esselen Park College is the biggest and the most modern training college for railwaymen, not only in the southern hemisphere but throughout the railway systems of the world? Does the hon. member know we have people coming from overseas railway systems to see what we are doing at Esselen Park? Yet he says the training basis of our Railway personnel must be improved.</p>

<p>In my days there was no Esselen Park. I had to do my own training and my own learning. Now we have that wonderful college. It is really a Railways university, as we call it. But the hon. member says we must improve the training basis of the Railway personnel.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member talked about the atmosphere of the S.A.R. He says &#x201C;there is no atmosphere in the Service to make the matriculated youth feel that there is a chance to advance himself.&#x201D; Atmosphere! I know there is a lot of smoky atmosphere when the steam locomotives come into a station and are blowing smoke, but I do not know what atmosphere he is referring to. Then the hon. member says further, referring to the matriculated youth: &#x201C;To get promotion, he must be pally with somebody higher up.&#x201D; Now surely, that is devoid of any foundation. There is no substantiation for that at all.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have not taken it out of context. I can quote him if he likes. I have his speech here. Apparently he has forgotten what he said a couple of days ago. But I say that statement is devoid of all truth, namely that somebody must be pally with somebody higher up. Promotions are based on merit, on efficiency. That is the provision of the Act. Only when the efficiency of two or more servants is equal, then seniority comes into play. Apart from that, there is an appeal system on the South African Railways which no other Government department has. In other words, any servant who feels that he has a grievance in regard to promotion has the right to appeal. He can appeal to the General Manager and to the Railway Board. They make use of those channels. It is only after very thorough investigation, after weighing all the factors, that a decision is arrived at, either to reject or to uphold the appeal. No other civil servant has that right. They cannot appeal. But the Railwayman has that right to appeal. To think for one moment that all these promotions take place because the persons affected know somebody higher up is, of course, the biggest nonsense one can ever talk. There is no such thing. This appeal procedure has been in existence for 60 years and has been found to be satisfactory. It is supported by the staff. But still the hon. member makes this accusation.</p>

<p><span class="col_2673-2674" refersTo="page_1359"/>Then the hon. member says that there has never been more dissatisfaction than there is at the present time. He says further that I must not hide behind the trade unions and that I must institute an impartial investigation into this dissatisfaction. Then the hon. gentleman says that if this inquiry finds there is no dissatisfaction, I could make a monkey out of him. I will not interfere with nature. [Laughter.] Of course there are individual grievances; I have never denied that. The hon. member quoted half a dozen. There are and always have been grievances, but any servant who is dissatisfied and has a grievance can appeal through the right channels right up to the Minister and the Railway Board. With a staff of 225,000 it is quite obvious that there must be dissatisfaction among many of them. There must be grievances. There are groups that are dissatisfied. Any group whose requests are refused, is dissatisfied. The hon. member mentioned the assistant foremen. Of course they are dissatisfied, because their requests have been refused.</p>

<p>Had you not said that it was a reasonable request?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. The hon. member does not really know. The trouble is he always listens to one side of the story, and not the other. That is why he brings these matters before the House. Of course the assistant foremen receive less earnings than the men in the workshop, the artisans working under them. But those artisans do not receive higher wages; they receive higher earnings because they do bonus work. That is not only confined to the artisans in the workshops and the assistant foremen. The running foreman receives less than the driver working overtime and Sunday time. Their earnings are higher than that of the running foreman. There are quite a number of other grades where there are similar conditions. As a matter of fact, the pilots on overseas routes have much higher earnings than the Manager of the Airways. The General Manager of the Railways even receives a bigger salary than I get as a Minister.</p>

<p>I said it is quite right. I have never denied him that, because I have given him that salary. Does the hon. member not know that? I am responsible for giving the General Manager the salary he is getting, a higher salary than that of the Minister. As a matter of fact, if this was a private undertaking, he would probably have received four times the salary he is receiving now. He deserves it, as the hon. gentleman said. That is what I am trying to tell that hon. member; it is nothing new. It happens in many grades. Of course these men are dissatisfied. Whenever a request is refused them, they are dissatisfied.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>But is that sound policy?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, of course. I have to say &#x201C;No&#x201D; very often to the trade unions when they come to me with requests. But I still have their full support and loyalty, despite the fact that I am saying &#x201C;No&#x201D;, because these men are responsible men. They are responsible leaders. They know that when I say &#x201C;No&#x201D;, it is generally in the interests of the Administration. They realize that. But there is no general dissatisfaction. I reject that entirely.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman said that I hide behind the trade unions. Does he realize that these staff organizations represent 90 per cent of the European and Coloured workers? If they did not look after the interests of their members, they would not be re-elected to their executives. They are not appointed; they are elected by their members. If they do not do their job as they should do it, they will not be re-elected to those positions. What right has the hon. member to speak disparagingly of the trade unions when they represent 90 per cent of the workers, Coloured and European? They do an excellent job of work.</p>

<p>To show how little reliance one can place on many of the statements made by the hon. member, I want to deal with one of the matters he raised, in detail. The hon. member must listen now. I am quoting his Hansard. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">The driver of a train who was 16 minutes early, fills in that he was on time, thereby implying he had worked 16 minutes more than he did in fact work. He is then tried for fraud, because he might, although he did not, defraud the Railways of 1 1/12th cents.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. gentleman said. What are the facts? First of all it was not a driver. There were two ticket examiners in Braamfontein. On 22nd September, 1967, they were on duty on train No. 9589 from Naledi station to Johannesburg. This train should have departed at 10.31 p.m. and was scheduled to stop at all stations. The train actually left I 10.26 p.m. and did not stop at Merafe, Inhlazane and Ikwezi, but stopped for the first time at Dube and arrived at Johannesburg 18 minutes before the scheduled time. I continue to quote in Afrikaans:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Bantoepassasier wat die trein op Naledi gehaal hot om na Merafe-stasie te reis, het op Dube in &#x2019;n erg beseerde toestand uit die trein gekruip en beweer dat fay, nadat die trein van Naledi vertrek het, deur die twee kaartjiesondersoekers aangerand is. &#x2019;n Ambulans is deur die Spoorwegpolisie ontbied en die Bantoe is na die hospitaal vervoer. Die klagte van aanranding is deur die lede van die Spoorwegpolisie ondersoek en beide kaartjiesondersoekers is op 31 Januarie 1968 in die landdroshof in Johannesburg skuldig bevind op &#x2019;n aanklag van aanranding en gevonnis tot drie maande tronkstraf, sender die keuse van &#x2019;n boete. Uit die polisieondersoek in verband met die aanklag van <span class="col_2675-2676" refersTo="page_1360"/>aanranding het dit geblyk dat die looptye van die betrokke trein vanaf Naledi na Johannesburg nie korrek op die joernaal van die kaartjiesondersoeker aangetoon is nie, deurdat daar aangedui is dat die trein op Merafe, Inhlazane en Ikwezi stilgehou het, terwyl dit nie die geval was nie. Dit het daartoe gelei dat &#x2019;n aanklag weens die oortreding van artikel 2 (c) van Wet No. 6 van 1958 teen die kaartjiesondersoeker aanhangig gemaak is &#x2026; Die Spoorwegpolisie is, nes die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie, verplig om alle misdaad wat onder hulle aandag kom te ondersoek. Die beslissing of &#x2019;n strafregtelike vervolging ingestel moet word al dan nie, berus egter by die Senior Staatsaanklaer en die Prokureur-generaal. Die dossier in verband met die aanklag van die beweerde oortreding (bedrog) is aan die Senior Staatsaanklaer, Johannesburg, voorgel&#x00EA; met die aanbeveling dat die saak departementeel afgehandel moes word, maar bedoelde amptenaar het besluit om strafregtelik teen die kaartjiesondersoeker op te tree op &#x2019;n hoofaanklag van bedrog &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is what really happened. In other words, these men were sentenced after having been found guilty on a charge of assault. This evidence came to light in the course of the Railway Police&#x2019;s investigation and they had to report it to the public prosecutor and he decided to prosecute. Now what remains of the hon. member&#x2019;s accusation? The hon. member should make more and better enquiries before he raises a matter in this House. If he does that and hears what the position actually is, he will not be so silly as to come to this House with this sort of charge.</p>

<p>The untrue thing is that the blame was placed on the Railways and he said that we prosecuted the man, which is quite untrue. It was done entirely at the discretion of the Public Prosecutor. There was no special investigation in regard to the question of fraud. It was merely incidental to the main charge of assault. The hon. member therefore has no case.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This is exactly the trouble. The hon. member believes everything he reads in newspapers and I do not.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of tally clerks. I want to be brief, because I only have half an hour at my disposal to reply to the Third Reading. The Railways employ 441 tally clerks. A special inquiry was made regarding this matter and since this matter has already been raised by the trade union concerned, I think it was unnecessary for the hon. member to raise it here. 125 of these tally clerks were found suitable for appointment as checkers, but only 89 were prepared to be so appointed. The wages of those tally clerks actually performing the duties of checkers were increased to R5.55 per day, which is equivalent to the minimum wage of a checker, as from the 16th February, 1969.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about victimization and mentioned the case of the train driver who was fined for refusing to work after having asked for relief. I think it is important that I should deal with this matter in brief. Staff Regulation No. 86 in regard to the relieving of trainmen reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">(1) A trainman (other than a ticket examiner) who is required to work beyond the ordinary hours of duty may request that telegraphic application be sent for relief after the expiration of a total period of 12 hours of duty, and such relief shall be provided subject to the exigencies of the Service.</block>

<p>In other words, there is no compulsion that relief must be supplied. It is not a new regulation that relief shall be provided subject to the exigencies of the Service; it has been the regulation for decades. Now what really happened in this particular case the hon. member mentioned? The hon. member gave the names of three drivers from Cape Town. The cases against Aggenbach and Horn are still <i>sub judice</i> and have not been finalized yet. The history of the third case regarding Mr. Van der Westhuizen is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Op 11 April 1968 het drywer D. S. van der Westhuizen en assistent A. Visser op trein No. 40 van Touwsrivier na Kaapstad gewerk. Sy vorige skof het 14 uur 57 minute geduur en hy was daarna 9 uur 29 minute van diens af. Op Vo&#x00EB;lvlei het die drywer om 10 nm. &#x2019;n brief aan die bedryfsdienaar oor handig waarin hy en sy assistent versoek het om 12.43 vm. op 12 April 1968 afgelos te word, d.w.s. nadat hulle 12 uur diens voltooi het. Die bedryfsdienaar het die versoek na Kaapstad oorgedra, maar daar was geen aflos beskikbaar nie. Die trein het om 12.55 vm. op 12 April 1968 by Woltemade aangekom. Daar het die terreininspekteur die drywer versoek om die Woltemade-verkeer af te haak en die ander verkeer na Paardeneiland te neem. Dit sou ongeveer &#x2019;n halfuur geduur het om dit te doen. Drywer Van der Westhuizen het geweier om dit te doen. Sy eenheid is toe ontkoppel en hy is toe daarmee weggestuur na Paardeneiland.</block>

<p>It was therefore found that this driver was guilty as charged and he was accordingly fined. The hon. member also said that Railwaymen who give information are subject to victimization. I do not know of what earthly use it is to Railwaymen to give information to this hon. member about their so-called grievances. I do not know what they can gain or accomplish by doing that. Surely they do <span class="col_2677-2678" refersTo="page_1361"/>not think that the hon. member will be able to persuade me to agree to their requests or that airing the grievances will make the position any better? They have their official channels they can utilize and there is also a procedure whereby they can appeal. Why do they come to the hon. member and of what earthly use is it?</p>

<p>They do not go through the ordinary channels, because they do not go as far as they can go if they want to. Having their grievances aired here does not help them in the least, and I take the strongest exception to Railwaymen who write to their members of Parliament to air their grievances, because they have a sympathetic Board, a sympathetic General Manager and a sympathetic Minister. [Interjections.] That is their overwhelming experience. The hon. member quoted only about half a dozen cases out of a total number of 225,000 workers. I do not know what these people can gain by running to the hon. member. They can gain absolutely nothing. As far as victimization is concerned, I want to say that no Railwayman has been victimized because he went to his member of Parliament. As a matter of fact I allowed some Railwaymen to stand as members of Parliament for the United Party. They were not victimized. I allowed them to serve on United Party committees and they have never been victimized for that although I think it is very silly for them to do it. All the Railwaymen who stood as candidates for the United Party have always lost their deposits, but the fact remains that I have never stopped them from doing so. There is therefore no question of victimization. I want to say that they should make use of the existing channels and the appeal procedure whereby they can air all their grievances. If they have grievances that affect them as a group they have got their trade unions. The trade unions are always prepared to fight for them.</p>

<p>*In the few moments I have left I should like to tell the hon. member for Lichtenburg that the railway link between Lichtenburg and Mafeking is something he has raised before. It is an uneconomic proposition, but I asked for a further survey to be made so that I can see what the real position is, i.e. what the traffic is and where the railway link should be built.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vasco said I should give consideration to the building of harbours and that I should not close that door. I can assure the hon. member that the door is not being closed and that I am always giving consideration to it, but at present there is no justification for it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove again discussed the pipeline, but I am not going to repeat what I already said during the Second Reading debate. The hon. member said I should also plan for the conveyance of other commodities through the pipeline. If he had been here when the Bill was put through Parliament the other day, he would have seen that I had already taken the power to build other pipelines for other commodities.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In regard to the Transkeian allowance I want to say to the hon. member that this is a hardy annual and that I have replied to the hon. member before. I want to suggest to the hon. member that he should read my reply in Hansard which I gave him last year.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Turffontein wanted to know whether we are getting enough men to train as pilots. I can assure him that we are indeed getting them. As I said the other day, we are getting them from the Defence Force. The hon. member will realize that in the event of war the entire S.A. Airways will be transferred to the Department of Defence; in other words, all my pilots will then be used by them. That is why there is the arrangement that I can get pilots from them. In connection with air freight, there are already aircraft in service which can be converted into freight-carriers, and it will be possible to do the same with the new aircraft on order.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In connection with the towels which the hon. member said that we should provide on internal services, but I think the passengers reach their destinations so quickly that they will not have an opportunity of using that service before they get there. Then there was reference to film shows and music channels and earphones. We tried that. We made an experiment with earphones and music on the internal service, but it did not prove a success. The passengers did not like it, and so we abolished it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo spoke about Coloured pensioners. I explained the position to him last session, and I dealt with it fully then. I suggest the hon. member should read my reply to him last session when he raised this matter.</p>

<p>There is no contributory pension scheme for the Coloured workers.

In regard to the Coloured workers, I wonder whether the hon. member knows that two years ago I received an address from the Coloured Workers&#x2019; Association thanking me for what I had done for the Coloured people since I have been Minister of Transport. They actually came to my office in Union Buildings, Pretoria, to present me with this address of thanks and appreciation for what I had done for them.</p>

<p>I would love it. I dealt with the future of the Coloured people on the Railways last session also, and I do not want to repeat myself because my time is very short. In regard to consolidating overtime with wages, I think that is quite impracticable, even if you take an average amount of overtime. All the railwaymen do not work overtime. There are many grades where no overtime is ever worked and where there is also a shortage of staff. There is a shortage of staff in the clerical grades and all the clerks do not work overtime. So that suggestion is quite impracticable. In any case, if they object to Coloured people being employed in posts formerly occupied by Whites, they will still object whether you consolidate their overtime with basic wages or not.

<heading>UNIVERSITY OF FORT HARE BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>When this debate was adjourned on Thursday the House was not in a mood to discuss those questions which one wanted to raise, and I hope that in the remaining time one might be able to persuade the hon. the Minister perhaps even at this stage that this Bill and the ones that follow it are not the wisest things to do in regard to Bantu higher education. I think the first and most important question one should ask is whether this change in status and in the manner in which the University of Fort Hare is to be conducted is wise at this stage. Are these Bantu university colleges ready for this step that is now to be taken? I think when one transforms a university college into a full-blooded university, there are certain criteria which should be observed. If one looks at the preamble of the Rhodes University Private Act, No. 15 of 1949, one finds the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas the said University college has in respect of the number of its students, the range of its work, the competence of its staff, its financial resources, the size of the community which it serves and in other respects reached a standard such as to justify its incorporation as a university &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the test. When a university college has achieved all those things, one is entitled to transform its status into that of a university. The figures that have been quoted by the hon. members for Berea and Green Point and others make it quite clear that this Bill is nonsense at this stage; these university colleges have not yet reached that stage, judged by the quality or the size or the money or in any other of the fields, nor passed the tests one would normally apply before giving university status to an institute of higher learning like this. And it appears that certain hon. members opposite agree with this. The hon. member for Mayfair asked what the hurry was. He said: &#x201C;Ons moet &#x2019;n agterstand inhaal&#x201D;.</p>

He said these institutions were not ripe for such development, and he said that when the time came when they were ripe, the White Council would disappear. These arguments only bolster up what was said on this side of the House, and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister agrees with that, because the remarkable thing is that the hon. the Prime Minister said in a Press release on 1st April that the Government had taken this resolution in regard to these Bills in the belief that the university colleges and their personnel have given proof of their ability to maintain the same standards which are applied by the independent universities. Now who is right, the hon. the Prime Minister or the hon. members who spoke? What are the views of this Minister? Are they really able to maintain the same standards which apply to or are applied by the independent universities? And if they are, why is it then felt necessary to maintain this stranglehold on them? What a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive, as the saying goes. I think we are entitled to ask ourselves whether we are justified in spending the money which is going to be involved in three complete, different universities for the Bantu people, when none of them has developed to that stage where they would in ordinary circumstances, were this not an ideological matter but purely a matter of higher education, have qualified to be translated into independent universities.</p>

<p>One wonders as to the wisdom of the method by which this transformation is to take place. Why should these university colleges for the <span class="col_2681-2682" refersTo="page_1363"/>Bantu be removed from the protective umbrella of the University of South Africa? What is going to be put in its place? If you look at the Bill, what is put in its place is nothing, except the Department of Bantu Education. That is what is put in its place, and nothing else. They are removed from the influence of the University of South Africa and they are removed in the result from the sphere of higher education. How can anyone assume that the Minister and his Department are any substitute for the umbrella of the University of South Africa? All three of these new universities for the Bantu will come under the umbrella of the Minister and his Department. Surely when you are dealing with higher education, you are dealing with higher education. When you are dealing with universities, you must have a <i>universitas.</i> You must have all the influences that there are in the field of higher education. Surely if we are going to have any higher education in this country, we must have higher education which is higher education and it should all come under one Minister. But here we have this Minister who deals with higher education for the Bantu. There is the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs, who deals with higher education for the Indians. It is hard to believe, but that is what is proposed. Then we have the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, who will deal with higher Coloured education, and we have a fourth Minister who will deal with higher education for the Whites. The question that this poses is whether there is going to be a difference between the higher education, the university education, of the Coloured people, of the Bantu people, of the Indian people, and of the White people? And if there is a difference, what is it? Does the hon. the Minister say there will be no difference?</p>

<p>If there is going to be a difference, we would like to know what it is, because we believe, as I said before, that higher education is higher education; and if you are going to call a place a university, it must have the status and the standards of a university. One wonders whether any service is going to be done to the Bantu people by this move. At the moment these people receive in their university colleges degrees from the University of South Africa, degrees which are recognized throughout the academic world in this country and elsewhere. I wonder, with this sort of institution removed entirely from that academic world, which was accepted, whether the degrees which will be obtained by the Bantu from these universities, controlled by the Department, and unrelated to any university, in that sense, will be recognized anywhere else. I think this is a question which might well be asked and it is terribly important. If you go on to higher education and you wish to expand your field, then you very often have to go elsewhere in order to obtain the experience and the learning that we do not have at some of our own universities. This is extremely important and up to now we have maintained a standard in respect of all our people under the umbrella of the University of South Africa, but now that is to disappear. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister has given that any thought. I wonder whether he has consulted with anyone, and whether any consultation has been undertaken in respect of this matter with other universities and with educational authorities outside of our own borders, quite apart from the fact that we would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether, when he proposed the provisions of this Bill, he consulted with the Transkei Legislative Assembly, the elected body of people who represent the Xhosa people for whom this university is intended. I hope the hon. the Minister will make a note to reply to that question, i.e. whether he consulted with them, and whether, if he did not consult with them, he does not feel that they are entitled also to have some say in the staffing of the council; whether they should not have the right also to nominate persons to this council. I hope the Minister will make a note of that and reply to it when he replies to this debate, part of which he has not heard.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s antics in respect of higher education, with his thesis, are not such as to encourage one to believe that he made accurate notes. He might as with his thesis have changed his mind between the time he took the notes and the time he advised the hon. the Minister. Sir, I think the question that we have to ask ourselves is this: Is this the right method to build towards a university? Because this institution is in fact not going to become a university; it is going to become part of a department store, part of the Bantu Administration and Development department store, that part intended to put the Xhosas into one department, and that is why this question is so important. It is envisaged that there are going to be different standards of university education or not? If not why is it that we cannot have one Minister, the Minister of Higher <span class="col_2683-2684" refersTo="page_1364"/>Education, in charge of all these Bills relating to universities?</p>

<p>Sir, there is very little time left but I want to say this: If there is one aspect in respect of which we in the future have to have some sort of contact with the non-White people, then surely it is in the sphere of higher education so that we can have educated people, university graduates, coming together and talking to each other about those matters which concern them all. You can have no dialogue in this sphere if the standards of your education are going to be as different as they might well be. Sir, these universities must develop our way; in other words, they must develop along the lines of Western Christian civilization, and they must develop alongside of and in collaboration with the existing universities.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is why the hon. member for Kensington was at such great pains to indicate what it was that we wanted when we talked about a university. We want a university that is a university in the South African sense, a place of higher learning which will produce a standard which will not only be sufficiently high for our own country, but a standard which will be sufficiently high for those graduates to expand and extend their knowledge in other countries. Sir, there are other things that we would have liked to discuss but procedurally we cannot do so except by having a select committee. Seeing that this umbrella of the University of South Africa is being removed we would have liked to see a South African Bantu University, a bigger umbrella of which all these universities would become constituent parts, but procedurally we cannot do that at all except with a select committee. I suggest that that is a thought which is worth considering and I suggest that this is another reason why the hon. the Minister should indicate that he will ask the House to accede to the request that a select committee be appointed before the second reading.</p>

<p>Sir, I have one minute left and I want to make a plea once again to the hon. the Minister at least to allow this matter to go to a select committee. The debate we have had here is not the foundation for a place of higher education. What we should do is to discuss what is best for all of us in the future by having at least one sphere where the Black people, the Coloured people, the Indian people and the White people can talk to each other as civilized, educated people.</p>

<p>The hon. member, right at the end of his last minute (which, between parentheses, he did not even put to full use) gave me great cause for mirth. I have often had a great deal to say in the House and know that when you come to your last minute you try to cram all the allegations you want to make and all the facts you want to mention into that minute. The hon. member did not use a part of his last minute; the part which he did in fact use, he used to repeat what he had previously said. That just goes to show how insincere the hon. member was in regard to the facts he mentioned, and how unconvinced he was, and how lacking he was in arguments. I shall return later to the hon. member; for the time being this is all I want to say. I want to keep him in suspense until the end, because if I reply now to all the points he raised, he may perhaps leave.</p>

<p>Sir, I really want to begin by expressing my gratitude to hon. members on both sides of the House. I want to express my gratitude to hon. members on my side of the House who participated in this debate and who made my task very easy with the effective way in which they reacted to miscellaneous arguments, and perhaps also more substantial arguments from the opposite side. In that way hon. members on this side of the House of course made my task much easier, and I need not therefore reply to the miscellany of points raised by the opposite side. I therefore want to express my thanks to hon. members on this side who spoke and offer my sympathy to my colleagues on this side who wanted to speak but who did not get an opportunity to do so. In addition I also want to express my gratitude to the Opposition, particularly to the hon. member for Kensington and to the Whips of the Opposition who understood that I would have been unable, owing to official duties, to have been present at the debate which was to have taken place on Thursday, and who were quite satisfied to have the debate heard further by my able Deputy Minister who, very faithfully, left me what are in fact too many notes in regard to this debate. I thank the Opposition therefore, but I am afraid that I must be honest and say that my thanks to the Opposition cannot extend any further than that.</p>

<p>At the outset of my reply I should like to say something which I should perhaps have said in my Second-Reading speech. As a matter of fact, I am sorry that I did not do so, although I am afraid that it would not have been of much use. It would have been a vain attempt. After all, it must be very clear to everybody and it must have been accented by all that although we are now coming forward with this Bill of Fort Hare&#x2014;and the same applies to the other two which will follow and in fact to the other four which will follow&#x2014;that we are not now for the first time in 1969 coming forward with the concept of separate universities for the non-white nations. This is not the first time we are coming forward with a thing like this; it is an old thing; it was thrashed out 10 years ago in this House. The important fundamental principles of this measure, and of the others, are simply located in the academic aspect at the university colleges in regard to which a change is being effected. No change is being made to the financial basis and numerous other aspects affecting <span class="col_2685-2686" refersTo="page_1365"/>the college. Perhaps the whole thing is being overhauled and modernized a little as far as the wording is concerned, but the only fundamental feature which affects these colleges in principle is simply the academic aspect. In other words, in preparing these Bills we actually found ourselves in the difficult situation that we had for technical reasons&#x2014;and for technical reasons only&#x2014;to draft an entire new Bill for each one of these five colleges, and also for this one which we are now dealing with. Also for technical reasons, therefore, it was not possible to confine the discussion within this Council to that academic aspect which in fact contains the fundamental change. Because an entirely new Bill was submitted to the House, use was made of this opportunity to discuss these matters as if we were coming forward with this concept for the first time in the history of South Africa. This is the technical explanation, and we will probably have to accept it. In fact it is very unfortunate that this debate was conducted on a basis which presupposed that we were now coming forward, for the first time in the history of South Africa, with institutions of this type for the non-white nations. Sir, I am not going to play that little game in my reply. I am not going to pretend that we are coming forward with these non-white universities for the first time. I shall reply to the odd points which were raised, but I am not going to reply fundamentally to this matter as if this were the first time we were coming forward with non-white universities.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Kensington moved as an amendment that this Bill be referred to a select committee.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Unfortunately the hon. member for Kensington did not elaborate satisfactorily on the amendment which he moved. Sir, what is the object of this House in referring a Bill like this to a select committee? It is to examine the Bill properly&#x2014;and that is what we did 10 years ago&#x2014;and to come forward with suggestions as to how to improve it. A select committee can only go into a matter like this theoretically, and that is what we did in 1959. But. Sir, we have had almost 10 years of practical experience of the five university colleges. In the case of Fort Hare we have had 50 years of practical experience, and I say there is absolutely no justification for a select committee at this stage after eight or nine years&#x2019; experience in the case of four of these colleges and after 50 years&#x2019; experience in the case of Fort Hare. There is absolutely no justification for it and the hon. member for Kensington should have dealt with this aspect first before he tried to make out a case for a select committee on this Bill. We also had the very useful advantage that the five colleges could co-operate with my Department and with the other Departments concerned in drafting this Bill and the other Bills. [Laughter.] Sir, that hon. member is laughing at his own ignorance. We had the staffs of those colleges and the bodies of those colleges who could give their attention to these Bills when they were drawn up. We had consultations over a long period with regard to these Bills. I cannot see therefore what justification there is for a select committee as asked for.</p>

As I say, she gave us three names: Professor McCrone, Professor Thom and Dr. E. G. Malherbe. Now, Sir, who is Professor Thom? He is one of the persons who collaborated with us in the preparation of these Bills. Perhaps the hon. member does not know it, but Professor Thom is the chairman of the Council of the University College of the Western Cape.</p>

<p>The hon. member has forgotten what Dr. E. G. Malherbe said in a book which he specially wrote when we introduced the laws in regard to separate university colleges in 1959. In 1959 he accepted the principle that colleges of this nature could be established in South Africa. I shall come to that point later. I shall then show the hon. member that it is dangerous for her to suggest that Dr. Malherbe should serve on such a commission, because there is a 50 per cent chance that he will not decide as she thinks he will decide.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should also like to remind hon. members and especially <span class="col_2687-2688" refersTo="page_1366"/>the hon. member for Kensington, who moved the amendment, that Dr. Rautenbach, the Rector of the University of Pretoria is the Chairman of the Council of the University College of the North. He is also a very experienced man. He is one of our most capable rectors and academicians. He is a man whose advice and assistance were also available to us when we prepared these Bills. The same applies to the chairman of the Council of the University College of Durban, Professor van der Walt. As a matter of fact, Professor van der Walt is not only the chairman of the Council of the University College in Durban, but he is also a member of the Council of the University College of Ngoya in Zululand. These eminent academicians in South Africa co-operated with us when we drew up these Bills. I do not think that there are any other people available in South Africa who could, in a commission of inquiry, give us better information than we already have received from these and other persons. I think that, after what I have said now, the hon. member for Houghton must just be satisfied that nothing will come of her request for a commission of inquiry. The same applies to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I want to discuss something else now, which various hon. members on the opposite side of the House have touched upon. First of all I want to discuss general matters. Later on I shall deal with the specific matters. The general matters which I now want to mention are firstly the question of academic independence and secondly the general autonomy of these institutions. Hon. members on the opposite side confused these two matters completely. They concentrated on the general autonomy&#x2014;or let me rather say the alleged autonomy&#x2014;of the university, while in this Bill we are dealing with academic autonomy or independence. This does not affect other aspects of existing laws. Hon. members who confused these two subjects, sang the same old theme song: of ten years ago, namely that these universities would be hopeless and that they do not even look like institutions which would have autonomy. According to them, I, and I take it the other Ministers as well who will deal with similar Bills, will have a tight stranglehold on those universities. That is what the hon. member for Durban (North) said this afternoon. Sir, perhaps hon. members will recall what I said in 1959 as an ordinary member and backbencher, when we were originally dealing with this matter. If they cannot remember, they would be advised to look it up. We must realize one thing, and that is that if any state, department or minister or high ranking government official plays a role in the constitution and the administration of a university, it does not in any way mean that that university&#x2019;s autonomy is being affected. Hon. members, and particularly the hon. member for Durban (North), who has become rooted to one single idea complex, must fully comprehend that in the world in which we are living there are many patterns for the idea of a university. There is not only the Cambridge and Oxford pattern. There is not only the French and American pattern. There is a large variety of patterns, and all that we here in South Africa are doing is to apply that diversity of patterns in respect of our non-white universities as well. I want to repeat that there are universities in the world where the state plays a much greater role than we are playing in the case of these five university colleges, or than we have played to date. Yet those university institutions in other countries are regarded and accepted as being autonomous universities, and there the state plays a much greater role than we are playing here. I should like to mention a few examples. It would do the hon. member good to look up this matter in the library. The books are there. If he does not feel like doing that, Sir, he can read my speech I made in 1959. It is very short, but it will help him. If that is too much for him, he must simply listen to what I am now going to say. We are following a pattern which is without a doubt being followed in the Western world. I shall mention examples of this. With this non-white university we are following a pattern which is being followed in the Western world, in Britain as well. Even in Britain we do not merely get the Oxford and Cambridge pattern. There are other universities as well. In America, France, Greece, Belgium and numerous other western countries there is a large variety of patterns. I want to make this very clear to you, so that hon. members can perhaps learn something. There is, for example, a university in Holland, the principal of which himself has admitted in black and white that there is not merely one criterion which is of importance when considering whether a university is autonomous or not. This, is namely, the appointment of its lecturers and the compiling of its estimates. It is in that very case that the State plays a role, but those people still maintain that they are autonomous. But I want to mention better examples than that. I am now coming to what Dr. Malherbe wrote. In 1955 he published a booklet under the title &#x201C;The Autonomy of our Universities&#x201D;. On page 4 of that he states (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although the state university or the state college may be an innovation in South Africa, there are precedents for this and there is nothing inherently wrong with the principle.</block>

<p>That is what Dr. Malherbe wrote in 1959. At the time when these colleges were being established he said that there was nothing inherently wrong with the principle of State universities, apart from that, these five university colleges which are now going to become universities are not even State universities such as are to be found in other parts of the world. So, for example we find in America&#x2014;and I want to mention three examples only&#x2014;the State university of New York, the University of California and the State University of Ohio. At <span class="col_2689-2690" refersTo="page_1367"/>these three universities all the council members, the chairman and the vice-chairman are appointed by the governor of the state. In some cases the governor of the state is the chairman and he has made the speaker of the legislative council of his state a member of that council, and the chief official of the department of education is also a member of that council. In respect of the State University of Ohio there is even a provision to the effect that not more than five persons from one political party may serve in the council of that state university. Therefore they even go so far as to lay down provisions regarding the university in terms of party politics. We are a long way from doing this, nor will we ever do so. Those hon. members do not realize that they are talking nonsense when they announce for world consumption here that we are doing something harmful here. What we are doing here does not even approximate to what exists elsewhere in the world. In America there are even institutions such as municipal universities where the mayor appoints the entire council, but we are nowhere near following that example. I want to mention that in America, and particularly in France, there are universities which call themselves autonomous but whose estimates have to be approved by the state. This is something which can be compared to the situation in regard to our university colleges. I am also mentioning the case of the Belgian universities where the minister under whom they fall has to appoint all the lecturers. Here the council appoints the lecturers with the approval of the Minister. The salaries received by the lecturers there are paid out by means of departmental cheques from the state and not even by means of those from the universities. But they do not state that the lecturers are government officials and that they are violating the definition of what a university should really be, as is being alleged by the hon. member for Houghton. They call themselves autonomous universities. I think that if there is any country where one can learn about education and the philosophy of education it is probably Greece. What is happening there? There are universities where all the lecturers are ordinary public servants. This is probably a terrifying idea to hon. members on the opposite side who think that there is only one single pattern which should be followed in respect of a university. We find the same in Australia in respect of the University of Canberra, but I do not think it is necessary to mention further examples. There are many more than those I mentioned.</p>

<p>A further general remark which was made here with such regularity that it seemed to me hon. members on the opposite side had been prompted to say this when they got together in a group, is that there is no need for haste with this Bill. They are trying to imply that we are in great haste with the introduction of this Bill to make universities of the university colleges. I now want to hasten to point out that we are not coming to this Parliament in any haste in order to introduce these Bills. We negotiated with the university colleges, and they with us, for almost two years. There were extensive consultations, and there has been no great haste with this. However, the time is quite ripe for this now, and that is why we are now introducing this Bill.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the opposite side&#x2014;and the hon. member for Green Point was one of them&#x2014;asked why there should be three universities. They said there could be one, but not three. Do you still remember 1959? Then they did not even want one, and they said that something like that should not be allowed.</p>

However, they are too afraid of their own liberalists to say it. They are playing both sides against the centre and sitting astride the fence again. That is what they are getting up to. They want to imply outside that they want to reduce the number of university colleges, so that they can influence those outside who perhaps do not like the idea of these colleges. This is another variation of the old story, i.e. that the Government is doing too much for the black people. They are making insinuations in this regard again, and they therefore want to reduce the number to zero. However, they are still afraid of the Mike Mitchells and the Cathy Taylors and all the other liberalists in the United Party.</p>

<p>If the hon. member is not a liberalist, we applaud her, but there are many others and she will probably know them better than I do. But she would like to intimate to those people that they do not want to abolish all of them, that there should be at least one. The point which hon. members should understand very well, and which the Bantu outside will understand, is that hon. members do not want to give each ethnic family of the Bantu nations, which ought to have their own institutions because of their distinctive, cultural backgrounds, a university college. That is the whole reason, and I would have liked <span class="col_2691-2692" refersTo="page_1368"/>to have heard, since they have said that there should only be one, whether they intended that one to be for all the Bantu nations, plus the Indians and the Coloureds, or did they mean that the one university should have been for the Bantu nations only. Should the Coloureds and the Indians have separate university institutions, or should these also he closed down and must they go back to the white universities? Hon. members on the opposite side do not talk about this, but merely make insinuations so that they can keep on sitting astride the fence when they get outside.</p>

<p>We came forward with this legislation because we wanted to lay this foundation timeously and this was a good thing for two very good reasons, which I want to mention. The first is that their education must also progress to the highest level, so that they can also have university institutions which would meet the needs of their specific distinctive cultural heritage and national character, and so that these institutions can provide the necessary education in order to further their development as distinctive nations. As hon. members on this side of the House have said, we are not concealing the fact that these university colleges were established ten years ago as an inevitable consequence of our policy of the separate development of each of these nations. For these reasons we brought them together into ethnic groups. The Sotho nations in one, the Nguni in another and of course, up there in the Northern Transvaal another one for the other ethnic groups living there. That is the one main reason. The other is that it is the sensible thing for us to have begun with this basic spade-work, i.e. the acquisition of sites and the construction of buildings, ten years ago so that we did not need to have made a start with it now or in ten years&#x2019; time, because what would it not have cost? As far as the costs aspect is concerned, we began too late with this, and we should rather have begun earlier. These hon. members do not want to realize this. This is of course a very important financial consideration as well. When those hon. members state that three universities are too many for the Bantu and that there should only be one, I want to ask them whether it is a valid argument to say to a population of 12 million that there should only be one university for them. Is that a fair criterion?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The figures relating to student I shall also mention. We do not run away from arguments which are worthwhile replying to, and all the hon. member has to do is wait. The other very important reasons I also mentioned during the Second Reading, but in order to complete the picture I shall mention them again now. The other reason is that increased independence for these university colleges is inevitable because the University of South Africa, from the nature of its objectives and its functions, cannot make provision for all the things we need. I have mentioned an example and I shall do so again. The University of South Africa cannot and need not have a faculty of agriculture. For us however it is very important and that is why we have made a start with the faculty of agriculture at Fort Hare by means of which we will at least be able to help all the Bantu nations in that faculties of agriculture have not yet been established at the other Bantu universities. This is not the only example I can give of academic justification for the step we are taking. I want to mention the example of law studies. I insist that Bantu law, as practised by the Bantu among themselves and in their homelands can come into its own far more successfully in the law courses offered at Bantu universities than it can at the white university institutions. There are still other examples I could mention. Each nation has specific needs which are peculiar to it, and that is why these universities can make better provision for those specific needs, i.e. because they are specifically designed and because they are not generally designed to further them.</p>

<p>We all know that the successful maintenance of a university, and particularly the maintenance of its academic standards, of increasing its status and ensuring work of a high quality, depends to a large extent upon its academic staff. It would be a tremendous stimulus to the academic staff of these institutions to know that they were attached to a university which had academic independence in the South African sense of the word even if it did not have complete independence in the South African sense of the word. It is important therefore that we should do this now and should not procrastinate because the time is ripe for it now.</p>

<p>Another point mentioned by hon. members was the costs aspect. It was argued here by hon. members and particularly the hon. members for Green Point, Berea and Kensington that the costs aspect was, to tell the truth, very disturbing. I want to say here that, to my mind, the whole tone of the arguments by hon. members on the opposite side smacked too much of the political opportunistic technique which they are always displaying, when it suits their purpose, of telling people that the Government is doing too much for the Bantu. It is the same technique which is being applied to the universities, only with a different variation. Hon. members made strange calculations, because they added the current costs for the year plus capital costs, divided this by the number of students and then stated that this was the cost per student, as if all the capital costs had to be redeemed in the first year. <span class="col_2693-2694" refersTo="page_1369"/>They do not think of it as a long-term undertaking. That hon. orator for Pietermaritzburg (District is now shaking his head. I am going to mention the cost figures to this House, and I want to say to hon. members that I am far more inclined to rely on the Controller and Auditor-General of the Republic of South Africa than on them, and these are his figures which I shall quote. I want to mention to you the unit costs, but before I do that, I want to make an assertion which will substantiate these costs and which is one that hon. members on this side of the House have made, i.e. that there is a very intimate correlation between the number of students at the university and the fact that it is a young university on the one hand as opposed to the costs on the other. There is a relationship between these two facts. The younger a university the fewer the number of students attending it, and the higher the running costs, and surely that is obvious. The older a university becomes, the lower the costs. This phenomenon has already made itself apparent over a period of four years, for which I want to furnish these figures. I am giving you the figures from 1963 to 1967, as furnished by the Controller and Auditor-General. In 1963 the unit costs per student at Fort Hare, according to him, were R2,135, and in 1967 this decreased to R1,490, because the number of students increased from 239 to 436. The number of students increased appreciably and the unit costs per student decreased appreciably&#x2014;cause and effect.</p>

<p>We find the same phenomenon at all three the other university colleges, and I am certain that the same figures will be supplied by my colleagues here, the Minister of Coloured Affairs and the Minister of Indian Affairs. In Zululand the unit costs in 1963 were R1,714 per student, and at that time there were 136 students. In 1967 the costs were R1,418, and then there were 331 students. At the University College of the North the costs in 1963 were R1,291. with 248 students, and in 1967 the figure decreased to R1,096 with 538 students. At all three institutions there is the same phenomenon therefore, although perhaps not with the same differences in percentage. As the number of students increase and the institution becomes older, so the unit costs per student decrease and for that reason they are going to decrease even further in future, except perhaps unless purely temporary circumstances crop up which may cause fluctuations. But as a normal phenomenon the figure will continue to decrease in future. So much for the question of costs. I can give hon. members no better reply than to say that it is a perfectly normal phenomenon that the costs should be high at the beginning. We have all realized this. But the costs have decreased and will continue to decrease to the extent to which these phenomena will be able to continue normally.</p>

<p>As regards general matters this is all I wanted to say, and I shall now come to more specific points raised by hon. members.</p>

<p>I come now to the miscellaneous points. Usually I believe that one should not play at loose balls, but I am going to do so now because these loose balls are really tempting. The hon. member for Kensington said that the fact that these university colleges are now going to become universities is a great blow to African countries because Fort Hare is now going to be closed to them. But Fort Hare is not closed to them in the sense in which the hon. member referred to it. There may be reasons why it has been closed to them temporarily, perhaps because there is no accommodation for students from those countries. The hon. member will probably agree with me that these university colleges have first and foremost been established for our Bantu. During the past two years&#x2014;I did not go back further than that&#x2014;these three colleges admitted 17 people from Rhodesia and Malawi because there were facilities for them. The normal basis in regard to the selection of students was applied. If there was no possibility that we would be depriving our own Bantu of opportunities by doing so, then provision of this kind could in fact be made in future as well. What did the hon. member want to achieve with the categoric allegations he made here? After all, it is irresponsible on his part as an old parliamentarian and a person who ought to display the correct pedagogical approach.</p>

<p>Hon. members asked me what consultation there had been with the Bantu in regard to this Bill. I now want to inform hon. members that there was consultation. Hon. members must bear in mind that we have at each of those colleges an advisory council, and that that is the body we have to approach. It is not necessary for us to approach the Bantu Governments. Why not? Because the Bantu Governments are represented on those advisory councils. The Transkei Government are represented on the advisory council of Fort Hare and there is also the necessary liaison with the Ciskei Bantu in that advisory council. The same applies to the others. Thorough consultations were in fact held with the advisory councils in regard to the principles and objectives of this measure. I can inform the hon. member that when I was at Fort Hare in 1967 the advisory council discussed this question of academic independence with me. The council, under the chairmanship of a Ciskeian Bantu, even asked me whether we could not give attention to this matter and I told him that we were going into it and that the necessary negotiations would ensue. They did ensue and at all three Bantu university colleges which my Department deals with, unanimous appreciation was expressed for the academic autonomy for the university colleges which we are now effecting. I think that with these few words I have replied adequately to that question.</p>

<p>Since I am now discussing the advisory councils I would also like to say the following. The hon. member for Kensington in particular tried to dramatise this matter by asking what kind of things the senate and advisory council were. He wanted to know where else in the <span class="col_2695-2696" refersTo="page_1370"/>world one found things like this. But that is no argument. Where else in the world does one find Natives? Where else in the world does one find the many other things one finds in South Africa? Where else in the world, for example, does one find United Party men (Sappe)? Such things one finds only in South Africa. Should we now prevent a university or a university college in South Africa from having an advisory council simply because nothing like it exists in other parts of the world? We must develop our university colleges and universities according to the needs and according to the circumstances of our people and the situation in which we find ourselves. That is why they are there, and they are doing excellent work. We are allowing the councils to continue doing that excellent work. As I have said, the necessary representation is there. The Transkeian Government itself is represented on the advisory council and the Transkeian administration is represented on the council. Similarly the Ciskeian Bantu are represented in the advisory council and the Ciskeian administration in the council of Fort Hare. The hon. members opposite tried to chase up a hare where only a skunk was skulking. Someone on the opposite side made very pointed insinuations about clause 10 (1) (c) and the word &#x201C;such&#x201D; which is contained there. It was insinuated that the senate will be composed of &#x201C;such professors and senior lecturers of the University&#x201D; who were approved of. There is a very good reason for this. The Minister must keep an eye on what is happening there. It is quite correct. The hon. members for Durban (North) and Kensington would do well to look up the Act for the white University of Natal and they will find the word &#x201C;such&#x201D; there as well. Section 9 of the University of Natal Act&#x2014;the white, not the Indian university&#x2014;also makes provision for selection in the appointment of members of the senate. I just want to say that we do not apply selection. Of course we will appoint all white professors and heads of departments who qualify for the senate. Similarly an advisory council can in turn appoint the Bantu who qualify for that.</p>

<p>No, wait a minute. I remember that reply very well, it is fresh in my memory.

But the chancellor of Potchefstroom is appointed by the council.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says he knows that. The hon. member went into ecstasies here; he said it about 10 to 12 times. In fact, it is one of his educational cliches&#x2014;that Professor Chris Coetzee of Potchefstroom is a man for whom he has the greatest admiration. He was rector of Potchefstroom for many years, and despite the great admiration which the hon. member rightly has for Professor Coetzee, Professor Coetzee has never caused his council to relinquish the procedure of appointing the chancellor and having him elected by the convocation. But that does not count. The chancellors of the Universities of South Africa. Natal, Rhodes, the Free State, Port Elizabeth, and the Rand Afrikaans University, seven universities altogether, are all appointed by the council in South Africa. But when the non-white colleges become universities and the council appoints their chancellors the hon. member for Kensington says: &#x201C;wickedness&#x201D; superlative. The hon. member for Durban (North) asked a while back why we could not develop these universities on the pattern of the University of South Africa. If the chancellor of seven white universities is appointed by the council and the chancellor of only four is appointed by the convocation, which is South African, the seven or the four?</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member for Wynberg may as well say I am &#x201C;terrible&#x201D;. I am not half as &#x201C;terrible&#x201D; as she is. I want to furnish only two figures to hon. members, namely that of Bantu students who passed St. 10 with matriculation exemption, and those who did not. The number of students who passed with exemption in 1959 were 72; in 1968 there were 775 (more than 10 times as many); the number of students who passed with school-leaving certificates (without exemption): 152 in 1959 and 491 in 1968. The percentage of passes: in 1959 (all the groups in St. 10) 29 per cent as against 55 per cent in 1968. This is a very large increase. We admit&#x2014;why should we deny it?&#x2014;that initially there were very few students which the universities could draw material from. But it has improved appreciably, and it will gradually improve even further. The figures prove this. This is the tendency. Connected to this there is another matter which is aften raised, i.e. that the figure indicating the ratio between students and lecturers is extremely unfavourable as far as these non-white university institutions are concerned. I have the figures in respect of the University Colleges of Fort Hare, Zululand and the North here. To save time I am not going to repeat them. But here, too, there is a very clear correlation between the number of students, in other words the size of the university, and the lecturers. In 1962 at the University College of Fort Hare there were 3.7 students per lecturer. This year that figure has already increased to 5.5. In Zululand it was 3.4; it is now 5.3.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<p>In what year was it 3.4?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>1963. [Interjections.] No, 1962. But for the hon. member&#x2019;s information, it was 3.4 per cent in 1963 as well. At the University College of the North it was 4.3 in 1962. For 1969 the figure was 7.7. Let us compare the figures with those of white universities which are many years older. At Stellenbosch the ratio in 1966 was 6.6 students per lecturer, according to the Department of Education. This is one point less than the figure which applied at the time to the University College of the North. In 1966 the ratio at the latter institution was 6.4. That at Stellenbosch was 6.6. How&#x2019;s that? Let us take another example. The University of Cape Town is probably a very fine example for hon. members on the opposite side. In 1966 the figure in respect of the University of Cape Town was 7.8 students per lecturer. To-day the figure at the University College of the North is 7.7, that is .1 behind Cape Town, which is almost a century older. The University College of the North is eight years old. Let us take another fine example, i.e. the University of Rhodes. The figure for Rhodes was 6.9 students per lecturer in 1966. This is less favourable than the figure for the University College of the North to-day, i.e. 7.7.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) raised only one matter about which, for the sake of fairness, I must say something. The hon. member stated that he was very mixed up. That I can very well understand, because he is still so to-day. He was very confused last year, he said, when I made a speech at Ngoya and spoke for the first time in public about the coming academic independence. He said that he was terribly confused and that he could not understand it. I do not find that strange. I think there are many university matters which he cannot understand. Then he wanted to know what I had said, because he said that the Bantu were also confused. The Bantu were not confused. They wanted to know from me what the Prime Minister had said, and what I had said. We had said precisely the same thing. We always say the same thing in respect of all matters.</p>

As long as I am thrown into the same boat as he is in I am in good company. The Prime Minister said last year that the Government had decided that the five colleges <span class="col_2699-2700" refersTo="page_1372"/>could be separated academically from the University of South Africa, that is to say in respect of curricula, training of students, examinations, courses, degrees, diplomas and certificates. This is what the Prime Minister said in a Press statement which was issued on 3rd April at 7 o&#x2019; clock in the evening. In my speech at Ngoya I said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since they (the university colleges) have achieved the maturity which will justify their separation from the University of South Africa &#x2026;</block>

<p>I am talking now about what I said at Ngoya. I said the following as well (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition the Government has agreed to the representations which have been made by the various colleges and their control departments, to the effect that the academic ties with the University of South Africa can be severed. The necessary legislation is at present being prepared and in this way the colleges will each in his own good time also be able to acquire academic independence.</block>

<p>Only a person who cannot understand these things, could not have understood this. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton had a great deal to say and she behaved herself here in the way a venerable old member on our side who always used to sit here formerly used to refer to her, i.e. as a mother superior. On Thursday she was in fact again mother superior making merry, or grandmother superior. She said things like &#x201C;There is no autonomy&#x201D; and &#x201C;With the grip of the Minister&#x201D;, etc. I had in fact pointed out in my introductory speech how there were much firmer grips on universities which were autonomous and which called themselves this in the world, firmer grips than what we are experiencing here. But in addition I should just like to add this: We have had eight to nine years&#x2019; time to judge what kind of grip the three Ministers have had on the university colleges, and I maintain the grip they had was a magnificent one, because they have made something valuable of those colleges, and they are now able to become universities. It was not a grip which strangled them, but one which caused them to flourish, caused them to expand. She said the institution would be &#x201C;only a creature of the Minister&#x201D;. It is nowhere near &#x201C;a creature of the Governor&#x201D; as they have in Australia and America and other countries. And if a creature of the Minister can be of such a good disposition as we have had here, then I say that the Minister may as well create more such creatures in South Africa. She said the universities would not even have an opportunity &#x201C;to take part in the work of the committee of university principals, and they will be excluded from the joint representation to the Government.</p>

<p>&#x2020;But that was always so. These colleges did not have free access to the Committee of University Principals. They could be called in for joint consultations when it was necessary, and in future that will also be the case.</p>

<p>Yes, but they were colleges then.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but now that they will become universities, they will have their own joint committee of rectors, of principals, where the five of them will come together and where necessary they will have the required liaison with the other white universities in matters of interest. But it is not necessary to come into one body for every single thing that has to be discussed there.</p>

<p>*Then the hon. member for Houghton spoke of her definition of &#x201C;the right to decide who shall teach, what shall be taught and who shall be taught&#x201D;. As far as this definition is concerned, I just want to say that if ever there was a hackneyed phrase, this is it. This definition does not hold water as far as the universities are concerned; it does not hold water as regards those overseas universities to which I have just referred. It does not hold water as regards our white universities, nor does it hold water as regards these universities of ours. But least of all does that definition hold water as regards our white universities prior to 1959, because if it did, I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton how many professional men were produced by Cape Town, Wits, Rhodes and Pietermaritzburg, who were prepared to allow non-Whites into their ranks and into their lecture rooms? How many teachers, architects and engineers, and graduates for all the other professions for which Whites can qualify themselves at those universities, did those universities produce? Not one. Why not? Because as far as they were concerned the issue regarding the Bantu was not exercising the right of teaching the Bantu; the issue merely was to gratify their liberalistic beliefs, to tell the world: &#x201C;We are a multi-national university; we are a university that takes in everyone &#x2018;without any recognition of colour or creed&#x2019; &#x201D;. They have a few Natives and a few Indians and a few Coloureds at their university and that raises them to the status of sacred academicians who say about themselves: &#x201C;We are sacred, because look, we have a few non-Whites amongst the thousands of Whites.&#x201D; They did nothing for them. They did not train them for a profession. Those universities did not produce a single person who could be a principal of a school to-day. They enrolled them merely for the sake of trying to soothe their liberalistic consciences. I say that definition was a lamentable failure when they <span class="col_2701-2702" refersTo="page_1373"/>had the right and the opportunity to train non-whites at their own universities. Then they did not do so. The hon. member also spoke of clause 14 and said that in terms of that clause I could appoint the lecturers to teach history, etc. What nonsense! There are not two positions. The main object of clause 14 is to ensure that appointments will be made in a proper way so that non-white lecturers, in particular, may also be considered for appointment when the time is ripe, and, above all, to deal with all positions above that of labourer. As far as my three university colleges are concerned, I have been dealing with all positions above that of labourer up to now, and when the time arrives, we shall make a differentiation and we shall say: &#x201C;You may appoint the lecturers, or the junior lecturers, yourselves.&#x201D; But there are not two kinds, one of whom is appointed by me and the other by the university. [Interjection.] No, the hon. member for Houghton wants to interpret the clause in this way. But this is not how the clause reads. In practise there are not two kinds of posts. I have to confirm all posts, and this may subsequently be changed as and when that is justified by circumstances.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 17 she spoke oven more nonsense. She said clause 17 was something which had been taken from the Coloured Persons Education Act and went on to say, &#x201C;Now note that we are making &#x2018;glorified schools&#x2019; of these university colleges&#x201D;. To that I want to tell her in the first place that in my opinion it was a very unbecoming remark to have made to have spoken of a &#x201C;glorified school&#x201D;, which clearly contains the insinuation that the position of the non-White teachers was inferior. It is an insult to the entire teaching profession of the Bantu, Coloureds and Indians to say that if anything at the university seems to have something in common with a school, that is a &#x201C;glorified school&#x201D; as though a school is something which cannot have its own inherent character and value and virtue. But what is the position as far as this provision is concerned? It does not come from the Coloured Persons Education Act. I have never thought the hon. member to be stupid, but since she has become a Grandmother Superior, it seems to me as though she is becoming so. This provision is contained in section 30 of the existing Fort Hare Act, which was passed long before the Coloured Persons Education Act. It is also contained in the Extension of University Education Act of 1959, and it is a provision derived from the Public Service Act. Now, according to her, the Coloured Persons Education Act has also been derived from the Public Service Act. What a stupid argument of the hon. member! She could have found other arguments. She also said the degrees would not be recognized by overseas universities. That may be the case; I do not know, but that will not be the case because of the academic standards. That will be the case if politics were to be brought into play and it will not surprise me if certain hon. members were going to do their best to have politics brought into play. [Interjections.] Any failure to recognize the academic certificates and the work of the non-White universities will not be based on the intrinsic value of the academic work itself, because we do maintain standards. Every measure for doing so does exist, and the hon. members know that.</p>

<p>I can assure hon. members that I have nearly come to the end of my speech, and that, of course, also means the end of the opposition to this Bill. I still want to deal with certain questions raised by the hon. member for Green Point, but he is not present at the moment. The one I want to deal with is the question of all questions he wanted me to deal with, and I shall do so now, because I know there may be a good reason for his absence. The hon. member asked whether the attitude adopted by the Government was to extend education over a wide level so that there might be general literacy amongst the Bantu, or whether we wanted to offer education merely along a narrow course to a selected few which would enable only them to receive secondary and university training. I should like to reply to this question. I think the hon. member for Green Point and the other members know what the answer is, because we have this every year under the Education Vote. The reply to the first question is, &#x201C;Yes, it most definitely is the Government&#x2019;s policy to bring literacy to the Bantu on a wide level by means of the school system&#x201D;. The primary object is to make as many Bantu as possible literate, and the literacy rate proves that we may be proud of what we have already achieved. The second question was: Now what about education on the more narrow level? I say this is our secondary object, our additional object, i.e. the best ones should be able to go to the high schools, the vocational schools, the universities and the colleges for the training of teachers. I think I have now replied to the question of the hon. member which he called the 64 million dollar question. He also said that it was wrong to extend the universities as we were doing here. This is not what we are doing here; the hon. member put that wrongly. We are not extending the universities; we are only giving the universities a new status. The universities already exist and they themselves will extend intrinsically with their increase in numbers. He also had a great deal to say about costs. In my remarks right at the outset I replied to that. The hon. member for Green Point also raised the question of health training, which is not at all relevant here, because the doctors to whom he referred, are not being trained at Fort Hare or at the other two institutions, and for that reason I shall not go into this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) had a few things to say to which I have already replied fairly fully, but in passing I still want to put him on the right track. Once again he did not study this matter properly. On previous occasions I caught him out for not having done his legal study work properly, and in this <span class="col_2703-2704" refersTo="page_1374"/>case he did not do much easier work properly. He asked, &#x201C;Why has Rhodes no representative on the Council of Fort Hare?&#x201D; In the first place, there, is no such thing as giving representation to this or that university, representation is only being given to certain other bodies, such as the Government, for example. We are not giving white universities representation on the non-White councils. It is not to the university that representation is being given, an individual is taken from the university. [Interjections.] The hon. member is still grumbling. Has he failed to notice that Professor Gerber of Rhodes is in fact a member of the Council of Fort Hare.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But I have just said there is no such thing as representation for Rhodes. We take people from Rhodes and from Stellenbosch as well as from other places. We are not giving Rhodes representation; we are giving that to an individual from Rhodes whom we want to have on the council. But the hon. member did not study this matter properly.</p>

<p>Then I come to the final question which was raised by the hon. member for Durban (North) and to which I said I would give a reply. The hon. member asked whether there would be any difference in the academic standards of the Bantu universities, the Coloured university and the Indian university. I am now able to reply more fully to that question. There was no need for the hon. member for Rosettenville to have giggled as he did a short while ago, because I cannot give a proper reply to such a question sitting down. There is no need for him to giggle now; now he must listen. My reply to that is that we are doing everything in our ability to prevent such a difference in standards amongst the five universities from developing, and in order to ensure that we are taking the necessary measures. We take many measures. In the first place, as hon. members know we anchor the academic standards of the non-White universities to white universities by introducing of their people into our senates and into our faculty boards as co-opted members. Therefore one very important measure is the anchoring of the academic standards of the non-White universities to white universities. Another measure is consultation amongst the five non-White universities, consultation which also existed throughout the years they were colleges. There are two main bodies of consultation. There is the co-ordinating body of officials of the three departments concerned in this matter and on which officials of the universities will also serve to ensure not only the necessary academic co-ordination but also administrative co-ordination. Then there is the body to which I referred a short while ago and for which, if necessary, further provision may be made by legislation, and this is that the rectors of the five universities of the non-Whites will have joint sitting on a permanent body where they will be able to have consultations. I maintain that these bodies along with the general attention which the Department will give to the five universities, plus the anchoring to the white universities, will create sufficient opportunity for ensuring a proper balance amongst these five universities as far as academic standards are concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, I have replied very fully to this debate&#x2014;perhaps for too long a time&#x2014;but I am satisfied that I have replied to all the most important points, and consequently I am looking forward to the hon. member for Kensington withdrawing his little amendment, if that is possible. We shall not hold it against him if he were to do so.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for two reasons it is a special honour and a special privilege to me to introduce the Second-Reading debate on the University of Zululand Bill. The first reason why this is an honour and a privilege to me, is that I can do so after the excellent reply given by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education to the Second-Reading debate on the University of Fort Hare Bill. There is a second reason why this is a great privilege to me and this is a personal reason, but hon. members opposite will allow me to mention it, because it weighs heavily on my mind. Shortly after I had returned from Oxford and had been appointed as research officer in the Department of Bantu Administration and Development in 1953, one of the first instructions I received from the then Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, and the Secretary for that Department, Dr. Eiselen, was to prepare a memorandum on the planning of the two Bantu university colleges that were to be established. Those colleges were that of Zululand and that of the North. That is why it is a special privilege to me to make this Second-Reading speech here.</p>

<p>This Bill seeks to divorce the university college of Zululand academically from the University of South Africa, just as was done in the case of Fort Hare, and to entrust it with university status and greater academic responsibilities.</p>

<p>Right at the outset I want to draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that the principles embodied in this University of Zululand Bill do not differ in any way from the principles laid down in the Fort Hare Bill. Except for the name, these Bills are precisely and absolutely identical. In fact, if hon. members compare these two Bills, they will see that the provisions, apart from that provision which is specifically concerned with the university college in question, are absolutely of the same tenor throughout.</p>

<p>We have already been told here that the only principle which is truly new as far as the university colleges are concerned, is to be found in the fact that the academic ties which the university colleges have had with the University of South Africa up to now, are going to be severed and that academically these colleges are going to act autonomously in future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this principle, as well as the other principles which are being duplicated in this Bill, has already been dealt with in detail and you will therefore pardon me if I do not elaborate on it any further, as I am of the opinion that it would only be a waste of the time of the House.</p>

<p>The day when the university college of Zululand acquires university status and greater academic responsibility will indeed be a most historic and memorable day for that university college and for the Zulu nation. This measure involuntarily reminds me of another day which was also exceptionally significant in the history of the development of the Zulu nation, i.e. the day on which a university institution of their own was established for that nation at Ngoya in Natal in terms of the Extension of University Education Act, 1959. I can also state now that, if the Opposition are not of this opinion, I can inform them that the Zulu people do in fact think so and that they do in fact mark that day as a special day in the history of the development of the Zulu nation.</p>

<p>I did my field-work there. I paid a vistit to Zululand recently. I am speaking with full responsibility when I say that the Zulu people regard it in this light. It would do those hon. members good if they were to do what I did and were to ascertain personally what the Zulu nation&#x2019;s views are in this regard. For the first time in their history the Zulu nation has been granted, on the road to independent development, a university college and now a university. As will be proved by the figures which I shall furnish presently, the Zulus are availing themselves freely of this university. They would, therefore, be a peculiar nation if they did not mark such a day as a special day in their history. They are in fact doing so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I did my field work there and I lived there for nine months. Since then I have lived in Natal for six years. I was there recently for two weeks, and I visited some of these places then.</p>

<p><span class="col_2707-2708" refersTo="page_1376"/>*Sir, the establishment of the university college ushered in a new period in the history of the Zulu nation in 1959. I just want to tell that hon. member that this is the one nation I got to know as a student. I have a very soft spot for the Zulu nation. I became very well acquainted with the then Zulu king, Ciprian Ka Dinizulu, when as a student I was doing field-work there. A week prior to his death I had a very interesting conversation with the Zulu king. I just want to mention this to the hon. member in passing. The establishment of this university college was not only a further recognition of the identity of the Zulu nation, but also brought university training within easy reach of the children of the Zulu. When I was staying there as a student, I could not think, not in the wildest flights of my imagination, that 20 years later it would be my privilege to testify here, on behalf of the Zulu nation, to a university institution that was established in order to afford the children of the Zulu the opportunity of receiving university training. For the first time, with the establishment of this university college, the Zulu nation had its own university institution which could, with the right attitude, produce the trained manpower which the Zulu nation had always needed so for its own social, economic and cultural development. This is something which every nation yearns for and which every nation needs. It would now be possible to send trained Zulu men and women out into the world to render services to their own community. My own Afrikaner nation has had a great deal of experience of this in this century. In this way a stop was also put to the suspicious attitude towards education which had developed in the minds of many responsible Bantu as a result of the fact that, having completed their training, their most capable sons and daughters had usually become quite estranged from their own nation and its problems. This has also been the case in the history of other nations. I should now like to say something to the hon. member who asked me those questions a moment ago. In this respect I am thinking of the words used by the Zulu paramount chief, to whom I referred a moment ago, who gave evidence before the Native Education Commission in 1950. I, who knew that paramount chief, know that he spoke from his heart when, amongst other things, he said the following on that occasion (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What are you doing with our sons and daughters in your plan for education? Once you have finished with them, they, with the white man&#x2019;s knowledge, tower above the nation like bluegum trees, but the only value they have for my Zulu people, is the value the bluegum tree has for the soil, i.e. it merely exhausts the soil and never fertilizes it.</block>

<p>Sir, this distrust which existed formerly is undoubtedly something of the past. This National Government can be thanked for that. To-day the university college of Zululand is being accepted and supported fully by the Zulu nation. Its products accept their responsibilities towards their nation and the nation assimilates them into the Zulu community with confidence.</p>

<p>Whereas the University College of Zululand is once again about to experience a historic moment in its existence, i.e. to enter the next very important phase in its development, I want to show you briefly, Sir, to what extent this institution has been developed and become established in less than ten years, so that you may form an idea of what has been brought about and achieved over the past nine years. I drafted one of the first memoranda on the planning of a university college in Zululand, and now it is my privilege to-day to introduce this legislation in this House. When I drafted my memorandum at the time, a university college for Zululand was merely an ideal. There was nothing at the time. At that time nobody even knew that it would be situated at the beautiful spot where it is situated now, i.e. at Ngoya. I have no alternative but to describe it as a miracle that, although there was nothing at the time, I am now in the position to sketch the following picture to this House. Buildings to the value of more than R2&#x00BD; million have been erected since 1960. Apart from the well-equipped lecture rooms, laboratories and the library, excellent provision has also been made for the needs of the students. I wonder how many of those hon. members have been to the university college to see how matters stand there. Modern hostels with every convenience have been provided, hostels of which any nation, and therefore the Zulu nation as well, may justifiably be proud, while adequate sport and recreation facilities, such as tennis courts, a football field, a swimming bath, etc., have not been forgotten. Now you might as well say that too much is being done for the Bantu. But these things have been done for them, and these people are happy and contented. At the moment there are three full-fledged faculties and 30 departments. You must bear in mind that all of this was brought about in the comparatively short period of nine years. In addition, 75 lecturers, of whom ten are Bantu, and 39 other members&#x2019; of the staff, of whom 23 are Bantu, are in the service of the university college at present.</p>

<p>With your leave. Sir, I now want to digress for a moment, since a question was put to me and I said that I could answer that question. When it was asked, there was doubt as to whether this was in fact possible. Therefore I want to answer that question now. It is interesting to note the following ethnic classification of Bantu pupils who sat for matriculation and senior certificate examinations in South Africa in 1968. You will recall that in the absence of the Minister the hon. member for Green Point put a question the other day. Bay way of interjection I said at the time that I could furnish the necessary figures. That is why I now want to furnish the relevant <span class="col_2709-2710" refersTo="page_1377"/>figures. I notice that the hon. member is not in the House at the moment. The figures in respect of the year 1968 alone, are as follows:</p>

<p>I think I should also furnish you right now with the figures in respect of pupils in secondary classes. I am doing this more particularly in reply to the statement the hon. member for Green Point made during the Second Reading stage of the Fort Hare Bill. I know that the Opposition has agreed not to conduct a lengthy debate on the other two university Bills and I also want to prevent that. I also want to thank them for agreeing to that. I want to furnish them with these figures because I think they are important, so that they may form an idea of the pool from which students for these Bantu universities may be drawn. The hon. member for Green Point questioned these figures the other day. I shall now furnish you with the figures in respect of Bantu pupils in secondary classes. In Forms 4 and 5 there were 2,576 pupils in 1960. This number increased to 5,562 in 1968. That means that this number has more than doubled itself. In Forms 1 to 3 there were 45,022 Bantu pupils in 1960. This number increased to 76,677 in 1968. I mention these figures merely to give you an idea of the fact that the pool from which students may be drawn for these Bantu universities is steadily showing a substantial increase and that we are really convinced that that problem that was envisaged does therefore not exist.</p>

<p>The University College of Zululand started with only 41 students in 1960. That was indeed a modest beginning. There was a consistent increase in this number until it was 94 in 1962. A year later it had therefore been more than doubled. In 1964 the number of students totalled 180, in 1966 it was 299 and in 1968 it was 368. It is expected that more than 400 Bantu students will enrol at the University College of Zululand this year. It is also important to note that 354 of that 368 enrolled Bantu students are Zulus. This means that only 14 students belong to other ethnic groups.</p>

<p>There is a steady increase in the number of degrees and diplomas conferred at this university college every year. As against the meagre total of 2 degrees which were conferred in 1962, a total of 30 degrees were conferred in 1967. I repeat that in regard to what was merely an idea and a thought in the initial years, it can to-day be reported that up to 1967 the following degrees and diplomas were conferred: Twelve honours degrees&#x2014;and this has, after all always been an advanced degree&#x2014;were conferred. I wish it could have been 112 or even 1,012. In addition, 86 baccalaureus degrees were conferred by this one university. In addition to that ten postgraduate diplomas and 128 pre-graduate diplomas were conferred. In addition to the courses of instruction offered at the University of South Africa, this university college may, in terms of section 22 of the University Education Act of 1959, also offer study courses on diploma level in any subject or course of training in which the University of South Africa does not offer instruction. The university college has profitably availed itself of this provision and introduced several diploma courses of its own. We want to pay the highest tribute to them for having done so. In such cases the university college itself determines the curricula and even conducts the examinations. The university college and its staff have exercised this power with a great deal of responsibility. The standards that have been attained, compare favourably with those of any other university. Just let me tell you here to-day, Sir, that in that planning stage to which I referred a moment ago, when this university college was merely an idea and no more, one of the problems with which we struggled most in the planning phase was how to ensure that it would be possible to maintain real standards at these Bantu university colleges. I want to pay the highest tribute to the hon. the Minister who has had so much to do with the implementation of these university colleges. He is the person who has all the information in this regard at his finger-tips. Why? Not because this is a &#x201C;creature of this Minister&#x201D;, but because it is an ideal &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; which has been converted into something fine and proper which really means something to those nations and which, both in the physical and in the spiritual sense, means much more to those people than the Liberal lady has ever been aware of in her wildest dreams. Speak to these people and find out for yourselves. It is easy merely to talk about these things, and that is why it is so easy to be liberal, but to implement them, this is what commands appreciation and this is what this side of the House has been doing so faithfully. That is why things are going well in this country; that is why the necessary good relations exist and that is why there is mutual trust. This is not brought about by talking only, for that is easy. I congratulate these people because from the outset they have had the sense of responsibility&#x2014;and I wish I could say this for that side of the House&#x2014;to make such a splendid success of this opportunity which they have been afforded. I want to repeat that one of the major problems in the planning stage was to attain standards. Spectacular success was achieved in this regard. We shall still live to see students from overseas universities going to those university <span class="col_2711-2712" refersTo="page_1378"/>colleges. This afternoon, in fact, the hon. the Minister mentioned figures in this regard. That is why I say that at present the standards compare absolutely favourably with those of any other university.</p>

<p>The following loans and bursaries have been made available to the University College of Zululand. The Department has granted 148 loans averaging R100 each. These loans amount to R14,800 in all. Fourteen bursaries averaging R115 each have been granted by outside bodies&#x2014;and this is addressed to the hon. member for Houghton who implied here the other day that this was not possible. The total amount granted by outside bodies is, admittedly, still rather small at the moment, but it does amount to R1,610. The principle therefore is not what the hon. member said it was in her argument. The Department has also granted six bursaries averaging R200 each. The total amount granted by them comes to R1,200. The college has granted 18 bursaries averaging R180 per student. The total amount granted by the college comes to R3,240. Outside bodies have granted 135 bursaries averaging R110 per free bursary, i.e. not loans. The total amount donated by outside bodies in respect of bursaries comes to R14,850. The total amount of these bursaries and loans therefore comes to R35,700. As I mentioned to you, Sir, a very large percentage of this amount was donated by outside bodies. We are therefore not quite such bumpkins as we may appear to be.</p>

<p>In addition to these the Department of Bantu Administration is also making the following bursaries available. Students who have completed their studies must undertake to render service to the Department of Bantu Education or to a Bantu authority for a certain number of years. Twenty bursaries of R100 p.a. each are being granted to suitable in-service married Bantu officers who are, with the retention of their full salaries, exempted from service so as to enable them to study on a full-time basis at one of these university colleges in an approved course of study. Finally, 50 bursaries of R300 per annum are being granted to suitable Bantu students for full-time study in an approved course of study at one of the Bantu university colleges.</p>

<p>I want to refer once again to the major contributions made by the University of South Africa in also making such a major academic success of this institution. The co-operation, the guidance and the assistance of the University of South Africa have been cordial and spontaneous at all times and on all levels. This most definitely redounds to the credit of this country. Whereas in future Zululand will have the services of lecturers from other universities in its senate, I want to express the hope that in future this sound constructive academic inter-action between the staff of these two university institutions will take place continually.</p>

<p>At the moment these university colleges are already offering nearly all the courses of study for which there is a need amongst the Bantu. Furthermore, statistics prove that the Bantu are no longer as keen as they were before to go to white universities for their training. Over the past four years, i.e. from 1965, 32 applications&#x2014;namely eight in 1965, seven in 1966, nine in 1967 and eight in 1968&#x2014;were received from Bantu persons who wanted to continue their studies at white universities. What is important, is that it was only necessary to approve five of these 32 applications, i.e. four for engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand and one for practical laboratory work at the University of Natal. Why? Because the necessary provision, which was to the satisfaction of the Bantu students by whom the applications were made, could be made at the various Bantu university colleges for the other 27 applicants. That is why I conclude by saying that the Government is convinced that the University College of Zululand is ready and fit for greater academic autonomy and that it will be capable of coping successfully with this major task which awaits it. Personally I do not have any doubts whatsoever as to the results which will be achieved in the next ten years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is one great advantage in these debates and that is that we have the opportunity of removing any misunderstanding and for clarifying statements which have already been made.</p>

<p>I have not very much to say about the introduction of the hon. the Deputy Minister, except that I liked that quotation from the Zulu chief. I have heard it several times in this House and I have heard it outside this House; it shows that the chief had a feeling for figurative speech, it is a very beautiful statement. However, I do not see how it helps us in this debate, but still it is very nice to hear it. The hon. the Deputy Minister asked us whether we have ever been to Ngoya, whether we have ever been to the Zululand University College. I have never been there, but I want to go. I have never been invited. I went to Fort Hare before it was taken over by the Department, because I had the opportunity, but I have never had the opportunity since the takeover.</p>

<p>It is a privilege which I will never abuse. I shall be very glad to have it and naturally I shall not discuss details of what I see there in this House. I have never had that opportunity, but I should very much like to have it. As I have said, this is an opportunity to remove misunderstandings. There is one misunderstanding which I should like to remove immediately. In the last debate we have had the old story again. I quote from what the hon. member for Koedoespoort said on 6th March, 1969, in column 2063, because it is another way of stating the same old story:</p>

<block name="quote">They &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the United Party,</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; did not want to afford these university colleges an opportunity of proving themselves; they did not want these university colleges to be a success. Throughout the years, outside and inside this House, they have suspiciously and scornfully spoken of &#x201C;tribal colleges&#x201D;&#x2014;at the present moment they still talk of &#x201C;colleges of the bush&#x201D;, &#x201C;ethnic non-white colleges&#x201D;, or &#x201C;indoctrinated colleges&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is absolutely untrue. I have used the expression &#x201C;ethnic colleges&#x201D;; I cannot think of a better word. I do not use the words &#x201C;tribal colleges&#x201D;. I have asked Africans before how they would like to be described. I think &#x201C;ethnic group&#x201D; is a very good name, but the other statements are quite untrue. I have to do something which I do not like to do, in order to disprove it, and that is to quote from a speech which was made by myself. This speech was made when these university colleges were created in 1959. I quote from col. 3518 of Hansard of 1959:</p>

<block name="quote">We say: Establish your new colleges, our new colleges, because we want to make them a success. We want to make the college for Coloured people here in the Cape a success. I know members who would wish to serve on the council of this college.</block>

<p>That is members of Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Dutch professor who was here recently, accepts this policy. Everybody accepts this policy. We say that when we establish these new colleges, leave the open universities to be controlled by their own councils as they are to-day. Mr. Tomlinson in giving evidence before our Commission said: &#x201C;Make these new colleges so attractive that the students will go to them.&#x201D; Every witness was prepared to endorse that.</block>

<p>Where do I refer to bush colleges? I quote further, from column 3519:</p>

<block name="quote">I am not going to quote from the <i>Burger</i>&#x2026;</block>

<p>Mind you, the <i>Burger</i> was with us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of two years ago but I want to quote an article which has appeared in the issue of 24th March this year&#x2014;</block>

<p>That was three weeks before the debate. The <i>Burger</i> said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;&#x2026; wat ons graag behoorlik bespreek wil sien want ook <i>Die Burger</i> hou in hierdie saak nie van gedwonge apartheid nie&#x201D;. They do not want compulsory apartheid and every educationist of any standing has the same views&#x2014;establish your colleges and leave the open universities under the control of their councils.</block>

<p>I thought this quotation necessary so that there would be no misunderstanding. We have been anxious to make these colleges a success. When we served on the select committee which became a commission, we actually drafted a Bill. We sat on the select committee after the Second Reading. Does that show that we were not co-operating? We sat on the select committee and we drafted an alternative Bill&#x2014;it is a pity it was not accepted. The position was that we co-operated at every stage and the evidence we received from all the universities, and especially from the Afrikaans language universities, supported our view.</p>

<p>I now want to come to one or two principles of the Bill which have been quoted here. One of the principles we have to deal with is the question of an advisory council and an advisory senate. That is important because it comes in the constitution of the university and there are clauses devoted to it in the Bill itself. What is our view? Our view is that we should not have an advisory council or an advisory senate. Now, hon. members say that the senate has worked well. It has not worked well! I say this, because the hon. the Minister in reply to a question of mine said, during this month:</p>

<block name="quote">Weens die beperkte getal Bantoe wat by elke kollege vir aanstelling as lede van die adviserende senaat kwalifiseer, kan hierdie liggaam nog nie doeltreffend saamgestel word nie.</block>

<p>There has never been an advisory senate.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question of the advisory council. We say there should not be an advisory council; we say it is humiliating for those people that they should not be members of <span class="col_2715-2716" refersTo="page_1380"/>the council which should be what they call&#x2014;I do not like the word &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;, it is a bad word&#x2014;a mixed council. The hon. the Minister has quoted a few names here; I am now going to quote a few names of people who gave evidence on this matter. One of them has been mentioned by the Minister himself; I can mention two of the names that the hon. the Minister has mentioned. I refer to Professor Chris Coetzee, Rector of Potchefstroom University. Here is a question which was asked by one of the members of our commission:</p>

<block name="quote">You have said that you are in favour of a mixed council, a council consisting of Whites and non-Whites.</block>

<block name="quote">Reply: Initially, yes in the beginning.</block>

<block name="quote">Question: &#x2026; and eventually, non-Whites?</block>

<block name="quote">Reply: Yes.</block>

<block name="quote">Question: Would you say that the Whites and non-Whites on that council should have completely equal rights?</block>

<block name="quote">Reply: Yes, the Government nominee would not have one vote more or one word more to say than the elected members. We would all simply have equal rights.</block>

<p>I come now to number 2, namely Professor Olivier, a delegate from SABRA. Let us see what he says about the same thing. Whenever a witness appeared hon. members from the other side who were on the commission insisted on getting replies to this question. They wanted to establish an advisory council. This is what Professor Olivier said; I will not quote too much of it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As long as you merely prescribe, as long as you tell them, &#x201C;Look, the only function you have is merely to advise, but actual executive responsible functions you will never have for a long time, or will not have in the foreseeable future, or we are in any event excluding you for a long time,&#x201D; we will not get their co-operation. Mr. Chairman, I am convinced as I sit here this morning that if we want these colleges to be a failure we must do it on that basis. In my own mind I have no doubt whatsoever, I want to be absolutely honest with you &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If a non-White is a member of the senate as the head of a section and if he has a seat in the council, well, let him have that seat. It is part of the price we have to pay for what we wish to achieve. My objection to the other matter is this, my objection to the other system is this. The Bantu will not be moulded, gradually moulded if he gets there from an entirely inferior position, and then immediately has to have control of the whole matter. How can he develop? One does not develop by being a spectator. He should do things himself and in this way he will gradually develop. How is he to develop if he is not in a position to participate? That will also be the situation here. This is a problem about which there will be differences of opinion because we have always held the idea of no equality with a view to the future.</block>

<p>There you are; there is the position laid down by the leaders of Afrikaans thought; they have laid down the same principle as we have adumbrated here in this House. If men are to learn how to run the council, if the Africans, the Coloureds and the Indians are to learn, they must be members of the council.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the Minister quoted the professors and I thought I would join him in doing that.</p>

<p>I want to go on to an examination of this university college. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs will have an innings presently because he has a similar matter to deal with. I want to quote certain figures as the Minister and the Deputy Minister have done. I want to give the authority for my figures. I must say this. Whenever we ask a question of this department we get all the information we require. I must pay them a tribute. The Department of Bantu Education are excellent in that way. What I am quoting now are replies to questions given by them. All the figures come from the department. I have fixed my time as the end of 1967 because I then had the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report for checking the figures. There is sometimes a slight difference, but the reason for that is obvious. The Auditor-General&#x2019;s report reflects the position as at the end of March and when I ask a question it is for the calendar year. So any minor discrepancy is explained in that way, and I do not doubt the figures for a moment. Let us have a look at this college which it is proposed to establish as a university.</p>

<p>In December, 1967, the number of students at the college was 331. There were only 174 matric students, i.e. 53 per cent. Just about half of them were matriculated students who should be at a university college at all. The others could be at a training college or some <span class="col_2717-2718" refersTo="page_1381"/>place where they could take another course for a diploma. I am speaking of university students. There were 157 non-matriculated students. The staff figures were as follows. There were 12 white professors and one non-white. There were 50 white lecturers and 8 non-white, together making 71. We had 71 staff members for 174 matriculated students. We are now talking about a university, not a diploma college. It means for the matriculated students there were rather less than 2&#x00BD; students per lecturer. Let us say 2&#x00BD;<i>.</i> If we take 15 students at that institution on this ratio, there is one professor and five lecturers for them. It seems to me to be rather an expensive method.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Don&#x2019;t you think we are giving them the very best then?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, as they say in the army, they are getting jam on it. Taking all the students into consideration, not only the university students who should be there if it is to be a university, it works out at 4.7 students per staff member, rather less than five. So it is not a big show, it is not a large college on the point of becoming a university. I think we are all agreed about that. What is the cost, not to the Government but to the taxpayer of South Africa? I have the figures here and I have the total cost which I was given by the department. It is a little less than the figure given by the Auditor-General but I am taking the department&#x2019;s figures for the end of December. When I talk about total cost, I do not mean capital cost, I mean expenditure and income. For salaries alone it costs the matriculated students R1,980 per student per annum, other expenditure per student is R974 per annum, and the total for each matriculated student is R2,954 per annum, let us say R2,950.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Are you unwilling to pay that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I should think I am unwilling! Everybody is unwilling to pay this amount if we can get the same service at a lower rate. Surely it is not necessary to have these high costs at this stage? Let us go a bit further. Taking all the students at this college which we are now considering in this debate it cost in salaries R1,040 per student per year and other expenditure is R512, so for all students it is R1,552 per student per year.</p>

<p>Now, I know a certain Deputy Minister says that numbers do not matter, but apparently figures and money do not matter either. I do think the same service could be obtained without this cost. That is the point I want to make.</p>

<p>Let us move on and take the progress report of the student through this college. How does he go through the college? It is a question of selection, how you select your students and how they go through. I got the most recent figures in reply to my questions because I wanted the best in this respect, seeing the Auditor-General does not come into it. How many passed their first-year examinations in December of last year? Thirty-two passed, which is 37 per cent. How many passed their second-year exams? Eighteen, which is 30 percent. How many passed their third-year exams? Thirty, which is 66 per cent. What happens when a student fails? Is he promoted to the next year&#x2019;s class? I should like the Minister to tell us that when he replies to the debate. How many years at this rate does it take a student to get an ordinary B.A. or B.Sc. degree? Let us work it out. If this happens every year, perhaps some of them give it up in despair; I would not be surprised. But those are the figures I should like to get.</p>

<p>I want to say I regret the hon. the Minister refused to accept our amendment on the last Bill because we made an offer of co-operation. We are anxious to co-operate. What could we have discussed?</p>

It was an excellent way; that is how university education has developed in South Africa. How does it apply in this case? We could have considered an umbrella arrangement, a University of Bantu Colleges with three constituent colleges. If the Minister wants it broader or not, I do not mind, then we would have a University of South African Bantu Colleges. The three would have been constituent colleges. I think then the Minister would have been able to develop on much better lines than to-day. Then the University of Bantu Colleges would have granted these degrees.</p>
