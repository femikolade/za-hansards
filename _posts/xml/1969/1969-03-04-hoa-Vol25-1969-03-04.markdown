<heading>Off-shore oil tanker terminal off Isipingo</heading>

<question by="#oldfield" to="#minister_of_agriculture">

<num>*17.</num>

<from>Mr. G. N. OLDFIELD</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Agriculture:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether permission has been granted for the establishment of an off-shore oil tanker terminal off Isipingo; if so, (a) when and (b) to whom;</li>

<li>(2) whether his Department consulted the local authorities concerned; if so, (a) which authorities and (b) what was their reaction; if not, why not;</li>

<li>(3) whether any objections were raised; if so, (a) by whom and (b) on what grounds;</li>

<li>(4) whether the possibility of oil&#x2019; seepage or leakage has been fully investigated; if so, (a) by whom and (b) with what result; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_agriculture" to="#oldfield">

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE:</from>

<p>(Reply laid upon Table with leave of House.)</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) No. An application by Shell and BP South African Petroleum Refineries (Pty.), Limited and Mobil Refinery Company Southern Africa (Pty.) Limited for the establishment of an off-shore oil tanker terminal near Isipingo has, however, been approved in principle by the Ministers of Agriculture, Transport and Economic Affairs. Details are being worked out by the Departments concerned for final consideration by the Government.</li>

<li>(2) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) The City Council of Durban whose area of jurisdiction borders on the sea-shore at Reunion Rocks from where the proposed pipeline will be laid in the sea.</li>

<li>(b) The City Council of Durban was not in favour of the proposal because of&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) the unprotected nature of the mooring and the danger that the pipeline might break and the leaking oil might pollute the city&#x2019;s beaches and bathing places.</li>

<li>(ii) the incalculable loss the pollution of the beaches can cause the city in general and the tourist trade in particular in spite of any indemnifications and guarantees which may be furnished. The City Council is also of the opinion that the leasing of any portion of the <span class="col_1787-1788" refersTo="page_0916"/>sea-shore and the sea in the vicinity of Reunion Rocks for the purpose in view will probably seriously encroach upon the enjoyment of the beach by the general public. After discussions between representatives of the City Council of Durban and representatives of the oil companies, the City Council decided on 24th February, 1969, that if the application of the oil companies is approved by the Government the Council insists on the approval being made subject to the following conditions:

<ol>

<li>(I) Oil companies using the terminal shall accept full responsibility to take immediate steps to combat any pollution at its own risk. For this purpose they should ensure that the required gear shall be available in Durban at all times.</li>

<li>(II) If, notwithstanding the precaution under (I) above, the beaches should become polluted, the use of the pipeline must cease until the cause of the pollution has been removed.</li>

<li>(III) All companies using the terminal must be members of the Tanker Owners Voluntary Association Concerning Liability for Oil Pollution.</li>

<li>(IV) The consortium of companies using the terminal must jointly and severally indemnify the City Council to its satisfaction against any damage which I may be caused to its under-sea sewerage pipeline through the installation and subsequent use and maintenance of the terminal.</li>

<li>(V) The terminal should be sited as far as possible from the shore.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li>

<li>(3) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) Mr. W. V. Raw, M.P.; Mr. I. Noel Davies from Durban and the Municipality of Amanzimtoti.</li>

<li>(b) Mr. Raw is concerned about the possible threat to Durban&#x2019;s beaches and stated that the economic consequences of a serious oil leakage which may result if a break in the pipeline should occur, will be incalculable. His objection is subject to such guarantees that can be given.<br/>The objection of Mr. Noel Davies is based on the safety aspect. He also applied for a similar terminal near Isipingo although preference is given to an application for similar facilities outside the proposed new harbour at Richards Bay.<br/>The Municipality of Amanzimtoti objected pending a guarantee that no oil pollution of beaches will take place and an undertaking that the Municipality will be compensated should oil pollution actually occur.</li></ol></li>

<li>(4) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) By the oil companies concerned in consultation with the Department of Industries.</li>

<li>(b) It has been established that at the approximately fifteen existing offshore oil tanker terminals throughout the world, the danger of pollution is no greater than in the case of tankers moored to quays and discharging oil in the orthodox manner. According to the Department of Industries there is no reason why the proposed terminal at Isipingo will not function equally efficiently.</li></ol></li>

<li>(3) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_agriculture" to="#bennett">

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) I am fully conversant with the short term effects of the drought and a number of loan and subsidy measures are in operation so that deserving farmers are enabled to maintain livestock and to keep their non-White farm labourers for the duration of the drought. Special assistance is already available in regard to&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) loans for the conveyance of livestock and fodder by private transport;</li>

<li>(b) loans for the purchase of fuel for an applicant&#x2019;s own vehicle to convey livestock and fodder;</li>

<li>(c) loans for the maintenance of livestock;</li>

<li>(d) loans for the payment of rent for grazing;</li>

<li>(e) loans for the purchase of rations for non-White farm labourers;</li>

<li>(f) railage rebates on the rail charges of fodder and livestock;</li>

<li>(g) a subsidy on the purchase price of fodder;</li>

<li>(h) guarantees to Land and Agricultural Bank to lend R20,000,000 to wool-brokers to assist wool farmers; and</li>

<li>(i) guarantees to the Land and Agricultural Bank to lend money to agricultural co-operative societies to purchase and stockpile fodder.</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) Rehabilitation measures are under consideration.</li>

<li>(3) From experience gained and from information which became available after the past prolonged and widespread drought in other parts of the country it would appear that the measures mentioned in (1) supplemented by the veld reclamation scheme will greatly assist in the rehabilitation of stock farmers, especially if the provisions for rehabilitation in the Agricultural Credit Act, 1966, are also made use of.</li>

<heading>Unclaimed awards in terms of Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act</heading>

<question by="#suzman" to="#minister_of_labour">

<num>1.</num>

<from>Mrs. H. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) What was the amount of unclaimed awards in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act as at 31st December, 1968;</li>

<li>(2) whether the Commissioner for Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation had discussions with representatives of employers in commerce and industry during 1968 on means of ensuring payment of awards; if so, with what result;</li>

<li><span class="col_1795-1796" refersTo="page_0920"/>(3) whether any amendment of the Act to ensure effective recording of workmen&#x2019;s permanent addresses is contemplated; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_labour" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF LABOUR:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) As at 31st December, 1968, the total unclaimed moneys since 1943, including old cases under the previous Act, amounted to R1,558,707.61, which represents less than 1 per cent of the total compensation awarded over the same period.</li>

<li>(2) No, but upon acceptance of claims for compensation from workmen the employers of such workmen are approached by letter with a view to arranging advances to such workmen against compensation payable in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and this has given excellent results.</li>

<li>(3) No. This would duplicate services already rendered by the Departments of Interior and Bantu Administration and Development. The maintenance of such a record would require an enormous increase in the staff establishment of the Commissioner. Residential addresses and addresses of next of kin are, in any case, furnished to the Commissioner on the employers&#x2019; reports of accidents and also on the claims for compensation which are completed by workmen or on their behalf.</li>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I said yesterday in my reply to the hon. member for Kensington, I have more faith in the principle of bilingual members in councils than an artificial classification into Afrikaans and English speaking members. That is why I would prefer to agree with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that a clause should be inserted somewhere to the effect that with the appointment of members to a council, full consideration shall be given to the bilingualism of members on that council. I believe that only when the two official languages are fully appreciated, applied and understood by both language groups will a mutual understanding and appreciation also develop for the extension of one another&#x2019;s cultural assets, which can then take place. That is why I am prepared, in the Committee Stage, to move the following amendment, i.e. that after subsection (5) of clause 3, a new subsection (6) be inserted which will provide that the four members of the council who are appointed in terms of subsection (2) and a person who is appointed as chairman of a Commission in terms of subsection (5) must be persons who in the opinion of the Minister have an adequate knowledge of the two official languages and the culture of the two white population groups of the Republic. I shall then have this amendment added in due course.</p>

<p>Another request addressed to me by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was that the annual report should be laid upon the Table. Of course I agreed with this principle, but after inquiry and further investigation it became clear to me that the annual report of the Department of Cultural Affairs will report on more than 75 per cent of the activities of this Cultural Council. It will not therefore be practicable or expedient to lay a separate report upon the Table, since adequate provision for this will be made in the annual report of the Department. Of course I said yesterday already that I would remove the word &#x201C;advisory&#x201D; and an amendment to this effect would also appear on the Order Paper. What was disappointing in fact in the remarks made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was in the first place his complaint that it was a very poorly prepared Bill. He also quoted a few examples and I just want to say that this Bill was drafted by a very senior law adviser of the Department of Justice. I think the Bill was checked by my own Department, This Bill was not assembled haphazardly. The hon. member also asked us whether we had ascertained what was being done overseas. This Bill followed after a three months overseas visit by the Secretary of Cultural Affairs, in particular to countries with whom we have cultural treaties. There are many aspects of the Bill, dealing with its organization and mechanism, which were in fact inserted on the basis of knowledge acquired by him on his visit abroad. He reported to me, and I was made fully conversant with matters. There are, of course, the countries with whom we have cultural treaties, i.e. Belgium, Holland Germany, and there is also very close co-operation with the United Kingdom, and from all these countries all that was good and what could be applied and adapted in South Africa was taken. Then the Bill was drafted on this basis. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also referred in very derogatory terms to the contents of clause 2. He read out all the various subdivisions, and then remarked in conclusion: &#x201C;This is what we are already doing&#x201D;. He then came to subclause (3) which relates to the activities of and the powers the Minister will have in connection with cultural and educational matters. Paragraph (vi) states(&#x201C;provides such other services as he deems necessary or expedient, or to subsidize or finance the provision of services by any person&#x201D;. With reference to that he said, &#x201C;whatever that may mean&#x201D;. This is a very wide clause and it not only creates the possibility of elaborating on the present pattern but also creates the possibility for the Minister to do various things, depending upon new circumstances. Here there is an opening therefore. It leaves an opening for the Minister to subsidize or to finance other things, depending upon new circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also wanted to know why the Minister was also reserving to himself the power to appoint members of commissions. The reply to that is simple. The Minister, in the first place, appoints the Council. The Commissions advise this Council on various special matters&#x2014;matters such as the utilization of leisure, youth work, and so on. The Council, in its turn, must make recommendations, taking into consideration <span class="col_1827-1828" refersTo="page_0936"/>the available funds. It must also advise on co-ordination. Naturally all the chairmen will be members of the Council. Because this is the case, I can see no objection to the Minister having to appoint the members. In fact, I cannot see who else should do this. After all, it would be something completely unheard of for the Council to appoint those members, something contrary to normal practice. I hope the hon. member for Bezuidenhout will now accept that we have done the right thing here.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member appealed to me to devote my attention in the first place, when this legislation is in operation, to the promotion of creative writing. That is of course a very good suggestion. But it is already being done. I cannot anticipate the coming Estimates, but when the hon. member sees the Estimates, I think he will be satisfied with the provision which is in fact being made in this connection. This sort of thing still needs a great deal of persuasion, and although the isolated results of that may appear to be unnoticeable a great deal of progress has nevertheless been made. We must encourage and be of assistance to our writers. That fact is quite clear.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Simonstown for the positive speech he made and for the positive standpoint he adopted, if one leaves out of reckoning the bits of political propaganda he made in it. His contribution and opinion on the basic principles involved here I regard as beneficial to this entire matter. I want to give the assurance to other members on this side of the House who also made contributions&#x2014;the hon. member for Rissik and the hon. member for Algoa&#x2014;that we have succeeded, with a few minor exceptions here and there, of dealing with this subject in the spirit in which it ought to be dealt, because what is at issue here is the fostering of culture in South Africa at the highest level.</p>

<heading>NATIONAL MONUMENTS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill repeals and replaces the existing legislation on the preservation of natural and historical monuments and antiques in the Republic and South-West Africa. A National Monuments Council is being established in the place of the Historical Monuments Commissions of the Republic and South-West Africa, and new powers are being granted to the Council so as to enable it to preserve, in a more efficient way, our national monuments. The preparatory work for the Bill began a few years ago. In 1967 a few urgent amendments were made to the Natural and Historical Monuments, Relics and Antiques Act the purpose of which were for the most part to enable the Historical Monuments Commission to deal more rapidly with its business. In the meantime the recommendations contained in the White Paper on South-West Africa have been published, and the comprehensive amendment of the Natural and Historical Monuments Relics and Antiques Act, 1934 (Act. No. 4 of 1934) has become a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>The first important new principle embodied in the Bill is consequently the expansion of its provisions to include the Territory of South-West Africa. Members from this Territory as well will now be appointed to the new National Monuments Council, and they will represent the interests of the Territory on that Council. Up to now the Republic and Territory have each had their own Historical Monuments Commission. In future one joint Council will devote attention to the conservation of our heritage. With the appointment of members to represent the Territory the vast expanses in the Territory will be taken into account, and the representation of the Territory on the Council will of necessity have to be equal to or greater than that of the two smaller provinces in the Republic. The second and equally important principle which is embodied in the Bill is the power which is being granted to the National Monuments Council to issue provisional declarations to the effect that certain immovable property is a national monument, without the Minister having to be involved in the matter in any way. Such a provisional declaration will remain valid for three years only. The purpose of this provisional declaration is to afford the National Monuments Council an opportunity of investigating the importance of the immovable property thoroughly before proceeding to recommend the permanent declaration thereof to the Minister.</p>

<p>You will ask me why the Historical Monuments Council is being vested with this power. The need for the provision appears from the experience the Historical Monuments Commission has had, and amounts to this. As soon as the Commission began with an investigation into the history and the architectural or aesthetic capacities of a building&#x2014;and such an investigation takes up a great deal of time&#x2014;the owner was, as it were, notified in advance of the Commissions plans. If such an owner was not well disposed towards the ideal of conservation he could change such a building drastically, yes, even demolish it. The powers which are now being granted to the Historical Monuments Council will enable it to declare, provisionally, a building which is in danger, to be a monument. After that it will have a maximum of three years at its disposal in which to complete its investigation. Should it appear during the course of the investigation that the building is not of sufficient importance to merit its being conserved, then the <span class="col_1829-1830" refersTo="page_0937"/>Council can cancel such a provisional declaration immediately. Furthermore, if the owner has good grounds for feeling dissatisfied about the provisional declaration, he can appeal to the Minister, and the Minister can then have such a provisional declaration cancelled.</p>

<p>A third new principle is being introduced by granting the Council the powers in certain cases to compel the person who is responsible for the damage or unauthorized changes to a monument which is to be declared to restore the damage. In the past only a small fine was imposed, particularly in the case of an unauthorized alteration upon the person responsible for that, but he could not be compelled to restore the monument to its original condition. In order to ensure that damage which has been done will be restored, the Historical Monuments Council is now being authorized to require that the damage be restored, and, if the owner or person who was responsible for the damage should refuse to restore the damage, the Council will be able to restore the damage itself and recover the costs from the owner or the person responsible for the damage, and as a further deterrent against such meddling with a proclaimed monument, the maximum fine is also being increased. I trust prospective vandals will find in this a further deterrent.</p>

<p>A matter which could possibly have caused problems is the payment of duties, taxes or moneys by the Historical Monuments Council to the State. In this regard clause 15 is now clearly stated. The existing legislation makes provision for the purchase of immovable property but omits to say anything about the payment of any tax. In the past only Government property were involved, but in future it may be necessary to purchase private property. The state subsidy is virtually the only source of income of the Council and the payment of taxes will simply develop into a cycle and mean unnecessary work. The properties which the Council purchases or which are donated to it, are as it were protected and preserved by it on behalf of the State. There is therefore no sound reason why transfer fees and other moneys should be payable.</p>

<p>For the rest certain details in the act are being amended, and I shall go into these fully during the Committee Stage. I simply want to express my gratitude here towards those persons who have, since 1923, served or are still serving, for some period or other on the Historical Monuments Commission of the Republic. They have performed a difficult task with cheerfulness and dedication. Since the South-West Africa Commission is now going to cease to exist, and since the functions of that Commission, in the same way as those of the Republic, are now being transferred to the National Historical Monuments Council, I want to thank South-West African members as well for their outstanding work. In future an attempt will be made as one team to safeguard our monuments and preserve them for future generations. It must still be borne in mind that we are merely the curators of our monuments, and that our purpose must still be to hand them over in an unimpaired and even improved condition to posterity.</p>

<p>May we from now on hear just as often and with as much emphasis of cultural preservation as we are hearing of soil and nature conservation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>There can, of course, be no doubt about the acceptance of the principle of the Bill. It is a very important Bill. It is an attempt to preserve all that is best in the heritage of South Africa. The Bill itself, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, is a Bill to rationalize the legislation that we already have. The key to a consideration of the Bill is in the Schedule where we have a number of Acts which will now be superseded by this new measure we have before us. Sir, all that one can do in considering this Bill is to refer to some of the clauses because the clauses contain the principle of the Bill. I should like to refer first of all to clause 3. Subsection (2) of this clause provides</p>

<block name="quote">A member of the council shall hold office for such period, not exceeding five years, as the Minister may determine at the time of the appointment, but shall be eligible for re-appointment &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is quite in order. Now I come to the proviso&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that if in his opinion there are good reasons for doing so, the Minister may at any time terminate the period of office of any member.</block>

<p>I think it would be better if the hon. the Minister would consider substituting the usual provision that we have, that is to say, provided the member does not become insolvent or is not sentenced to a prison sentence or that his health does not fail. This should be stated; it should not be left completely to the discretion of the Minister</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I come to clause 9. This is a detail but it is one which we should consider when we come to the Committee Stage. Subsections (7) and (8) provide that the council will submit information to this House; that reports will be laid on the Table and that the Auditor-General will audit the accounts. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether copies of the reports will be made available to members. I think that is very important.</p>

<p>Now I want to mention one matter here which I think is relevant and that is two points that come up in clauses 10 and 12. It seems a far cry from this preservation of monuments in South Africa to think of the preservation of a monument on a Karoo farm. Sir, last year I visited a certain Karoo farm. I will not mention the name of the owner. Hon. members can apply to the hon. member for <span class="col_1831-1832" refersTo="page_0938"/>Walmer if they wish to have further information. I will not mention the name because hon. members would be very anxious to go there at once and it might prove an embarrassment to the owner. The owner of this farm, a South African, has made a remarkable collection of fossils. He is a palaeontologist of world renown. This work has continued practically over his whole lifetime. His collection is regarded as unique by palaeontologists throughout the world. He has his own museum. Amongst his visitors have been, first of all, Dr. Broome, who was well known to us all, and, secondly, General Smuts who had a great interest in collections of this kind, as he had in all cultural efforts in South Africa. There have been visitors from the United States of America, and there have been visitors from the London Museum. These people have come to South Africa to see a collection on a farm in the Karoo where one man has devoted his time to this great hobby, a hobby which became a very serious study. He has received recognition from one of our universities. The University of the Free State, I understand, has conferred an honorary doctorate upon him, but if there is to be any national recognition of services of this kind&#x2014;and it has been mooted in this House that such a decoration will eventually become available&#x2014;I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that a case of this kind should be considered. I do not know whether the Minister has visited this collection himself. I think it would be worthwhile for him to do so, for I am sure he would be very impressed. Some of the rarest and earliest collections available in the world of fossils are to be found there. They are from the original Karoo deposits.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, this piece of legislation is simply another one of the fine facets of our National Government, i.e. this Bill which is aimed at maintaining and conserving our cultural historical heritage, and which is now being placed on the Statute Book. Our country is exceptionally rich in heritages of this kind, which ought to be preserved for posterity. Every city, every little hamlet, and even most farms have a few of these relics which deserve to be retained. However, one always has difficulty that it is not always possible, in the face of progress to preserve and to retain that which belongs to the past. It was Gezelle who in his poem &#x201C;Die Mandelbeke&#x201D; complained &#x201C;En die overschoone Mandel, wierd di slave van den Handel&#x201D;, and that is what is happening to us in South Africa in recent times. There are people who have simply no feelings for the value of preservation. Too often bulldozers come along and destroy places which were of aesthetic, historical or even of theological importance. Where those places were, petrol stations and cafes are often constructed. We had a similar case here, near the city, near Mostert&#x2019;s Mill, of Coornhoop, which would have been demolished if private individuals had not taken timeous action to save it.</p>

<p>As the hon. Minister said, this Bill is for the most part a measure to repeal and to consolidate the old Act of 1934, the amended Act of 1967, and in addition the Ordinance which applies to South-West Africa and to consolidate these into a much wider and far more comprehensive measure.</p>

<p>What we find striking is the much wider powers which are being entrusted to the National Monuments Council. In clause 5 (1) we find that this Council can declare anything to be a monument. According to clause 10 the Minister can declare any article of aesthetic, historical, archaeological, palaeontological or scientific value to be a monument. Clause 12 (2) contains a new aspect, because for the first time reference is being made to meteorites or fossils. The clause also mentions drawings or paintings on stone, rock engraving and the contents of graves, caves, rock shelters, middens, and even shell mounds. In this way jewellery and furniture and any other form of Africana can be included within the framework of this Bill in order to protect, conserve and maintain it for the future.</p>

<p>It is also important to mention, and the hon. the Minister has already referred to that, that this measure consolidates the work done by the old Historical Monuments Commission of the Republic and of South-West Africa, and we feel that it is desirable in order to avoid overlapping and duplication in future.</p>

<p>It also appears that in terms of this Bill the Council is being afforded a greater opportunity of acquiring funds than was the case under the old Act. Clause 5 (1) (b) (iii) refers to the possibility of obtaining a State subsidy for the purchase, restoration or maintenance of a monument. Clause 9 (1) refers to moneys appropriated by Parliament, moneys which are obtained in terms of this Council&#x2019;s own Ordinances, the interest accruing to revenue, as well as other sources. This is a very important aspect of this new Bill, because we know that the old Historical Monuments Commission had difficulty in accomplishing even the bare necessities, and in coming out with their money, in order to purchase and maintain monuments. Now it is also possible for this Council to channelize financial assistance even to private bodies and individuals. I am mentioning the Simon van der Stel Foundation, which is engaged in the same type of work as this Council. The old Council, as I said, had to rely on allowances, donations, fees and incidental contributions only.</p>

<p><span class="col_1833-1834" refersTo="page_0939"/>A further important amendment of the old National and Historical Monuments Relics and Antiques Act is the extending of the period in respect of provisional declaration of immovable property by the Council from a period of three months in terms of the old Act, to a period of three years, in terms of this Bill. It was very necessary. The three-month period was impractical, because it made no provision for the necessary research and investigation before the final declaration was made. As a result it often happened that, before the inquiry with a view to the final declaration of such a monument was completed, something happened to that monument. In some cases it was even destroyed. In this way it often happened that this monument was sold, alienated or badly damaged. Now the Council has a much longer period of time while the provisional declaration lasts to deal with all its investigational and research work, before it is finally declared.</p>

<p>Clause 12 (2), which refers to the question of meteorites and fossils, may at first sight perhaps not appear to be very important.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the United Party are still the closest to fossils we have here. It has happened too often in the past that research workers came from abroad, drew generously on our supply of scientific monuments in the shape of meteorites, fossils and even rock drawings, and then those objects were taken out of the country. This clause was necessary therefore to put an end to that practice, because we believe that those objects should be kept in South Africa.</p>

<p>We are pleased about the reintroduction of section 5 (g) of the old Act, dealing with the erection of memorial tablets, furnishing information on historical events in regard to those places in both official languages. We feel that that matter is very important, seen from the point of view of tourism. Those people who are interested in tourism, have problems in regard to the tours they arrange to historical places. When they arrive there is not enough information to furnish to those visiting tourists in order to make it worthwhile for them to visit those places.</p>

<p>Clauses 17 and 18 (2) deal with the question of the delegation of powers. In clause 18 (2) provision is being made to call in the assistance of local authorities. But it is a fact that local authorities are not available at all those places, and many of these monuments happen to lie outside the areas of local authorities. I wonder whether it is possible, within the framework of this Bill, to make provision to the effect that similar powers can be delegated to local regional tourism promotion committees, which have to deal with this type of thing every day. They are locally available and can therefore see to the conservation and maintenance of these monuments, as well as to en sure that these monuments are utilized, to put it in this way, by bringing visitors to see them.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to refer to clause 10 (2) (a) which deals with the acquisition of land, and clause 5, which deals with access roads and the fencing of that land. We are pleased about this, but it often happens that some of these historical monuments are situated off the main roads, and if I may be allowed to be a little parochial here, I want to mention that there are a few of them in Zululand. I am now referring to Ultimatum Tree, near the Tugela River and Fort Crealock. I can even refer to the grave of John Dunn. These are historical monuments, but it is virtually impossible to get to these places. There are no signposts and the marking off of the site is not all it should be. Neglect is the order of the day and the result is that the monuments are simply standing there, of no value, historical or otherwise, to anybody. So tourism cannot benefit by this either. In this regard I want to ask the Minister how it would be possible to make provision in this Bill for monuments such as these, particularly of a historical nature, which are situated within the Bantu areas. Bulawayo Kraal, one of the biggest of Chaka&#x2019;s kraals, is situated in a Bantu area, and it is impossible even to obtain that piece of land, and to conserve it properly, to protect it for posterity, and to make a tourist attraction of this historical monument. I can also refer to Coward&#x2019;s Bush where Chaka had the members of his impis who showed themselves to be cowards put to death. This is something interesting, and overseas tourists take a great deal of interest in it. But because these monuments are situated in Bantu areas, it seems to me as if nobody can obtain any jurisdiction over it, in any case not from the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. Consequently these monuments are lost to us. This Bill is just in time therefore, and we as a country are very grateful to the Government for this comprehensive Bill which is now being introduced, and we believe that the work of the old Historical Monuments Commission is going to be done much more smoothly after the passage of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a further development of the Act of 1934, and we support it one hundred per cent. There are a few questions that we want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister during the Committee Stage, but on this occasion I want to address only one request to the hon. the Minister. In clause 5 the functions of the council are defined, and I wonder whether he cannot give attention to the possibility of also having the council act in an advisory capacity where local communities want to erect a national monument. When travelling through the country one often comes to the conclusion that it is a pity that local bodies did not have sound advice when they wanted to erect some particular little monument. They had the funds and the good intentions to accomplish something, but they obviously did not have good <span class="col_1835-1836" refersTo="page_0940"/>technical advice. The result is that, as one travels through the country, one sees monuments in the smaller towns which are unfortunately of such a nature that they do not quite serve their purpose. Although it is a good thing that the monuments are there, we cannot really be very proud of them. I wonder whether it will be possible for the Minister to consider this matter so that he may introduce an amendment during the Committee Stage which will grant the council the right, when it is approached by local bodies or institutions for advice in connection with the erection of a monument, to assist such local bodies. That is all that I want to put to the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr., Speaker, in terms of the provision being made in this Bill, the Historical Monument Commission of South-West Africa will virtually cease to exist. The national monuments of South-West Africa will now fall under the large umbrella of the council envisaged in this legislation. In the first place, I should therefore like to break a lance for the Historical Monument Commission of South-West Africa and for the task it has been fulfilling up to this stage. South-West Africa is one of the countries which has been richly endowed not only with geological and archaeological monuments, but also with historical monuments. A short while ago the hon. member for Zululand spoke of meteorites. I may just mention the fact that South-West Africa has the largest meteorite to be found in the world to-day. This meteorite lies at Hoba-West, 12 miles from Grootfontein. The meteorite weighs 65 tons, and consists of nickel, chromium and the other elements found in such a meteorite. But South-West Africa also has other interesting archaeological and geological monuments. We have, for example, an extinct volcano, an amazing phenomenon which attracts thousands of tourists. We have there the petrified forest. At the petrified forest one sees tree-trunks measuring 5 ft. across and approximately 110 ft. in length, all lying in the same direction. They are virtually in the desert. How did they get there? This is very interesting.</p>

<p>We have our own White Lady of the Brand-berg mountains, a drawing in colours which is approximately 14 inches in height and which is to be found in the Brandberg mountain range. It was discovered in 1918 by Professor Maack and it has become world famous. It is being coupled to an interesting part of the history which took place on the island of Crete in the year 2100 b.c. I do not want to go into these details, but they are very interesting.</p>

<p>The only known dinosaur tracks in the world to-day are to be found in South-West Africa on the farm Otjihaewemaparo, 12 miles from Kalkfeld. The tracks of these beasts, a large one and a small one, with three toes, are to be found over a distance of 30 yards. These tracks are imprinted in granite and, according to the scientists, they are 177 million years old. This is very interesting. To-day one also finds what is known as the Bushman Paradise in South-West Africa. This in point of fact is a paradise of Bushman drawings. This too is very interesting.</p>

<p>But South-West Africa&#x2019;s history and monuments are to-day being linked in a very fine way to the climatic conditions of the territory. South-West Africa is a dry, arrid country, and it is mostly desert. It is interesting to note how this desert has left its imprint on the history of South-West Africa over the years and centuries in which the people of South-West Africa made its history. This one can see in, for example, the Bondelswarts rebellion of 1922. The then Administrator of South-West Africa was the now late Mr. Gys R. Hofmeyr. In 1910 he was the first Clerk of this House. His headquarters during that rebellion was an old railway carriage, which used to be the personal carriage of the late President Kruger. During that rebellion the troops came across a well in the desert in which there was water which had been poisoned by the Natives. There they found the following striking inscription: &#x201C;Drink jy. dood jy; en drink jy nie, dood jy ook, so drink maar&#x201D; (If you drink, you die: if you do not drink, you also die, so go ahead and drink). This is characteristic of the history of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>In 1904 Otto Klein, a non-commissioned officer, went into the Epukiro with 41 men. There they were dying of thirst. Two weeks later Otto Klein arrived at the only place where water was to be found and there he also died of thirst shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>There is one episode in the early history of South-West Africa which I find very striking, and that is the Battle of Thirst, which took place in the desert on 4th January, 1905. I should like to tell you something more about this, Sir, just to illustrate what a special history South-West Africa has. This incident occurred in the south of South-West Africa. Major Mesiter who was in command of 223 troops pursued more than 1.000 armed Witboois into the desert. This took them days and eventually the horses and the troops were beginning to die of thirst. They had the choice of turning back, but because they knew that the Witboois knew the nature of that region, they knew that they would eventually go to a place where water was to be found. Indeed, the troops eventually found the Witboois at Groot Nabas. This is a very interesting historical place, which has, as yet, not been declared a historical monument. The troops found the Witboois there, but these Witboois had entrenched themselves around the water. A battle commenced with lasted for three days. The Witboois were sharp shooters and defended the water well. There was no chance of the troops ever reaching the water. Eventually the German troops became hysterical. One of them, Artillery Commander Von Nauendorff, who was severely wounded, in his distress offered 10.000 marks for one mouthful of water. Another soldier, non-commissioned officer Wehinger, offered him a mouthful of wine, but his reply was, &#x201C;Friend, you <span class="col_1837-1838" refersTo="page_0941"/>who are only wounded in the shoulder have more need of it than I&#x201D;. Nevertheless, by the third day the situation was so serious that the troops knew that they would die of thirst that day if they could not devise a plan. Do you know, Sir, what a wonderful plan they devised after they had at one stage decided simply to storm the water-hole and many of them had been shot down by the Witboois? They decided to let all the horses loose. The horses, which had virtually been dying of thirst, stormed the water-hole in a cloud of dust. Under cover of that cloud of dust the German troops followed with drawn bayonets. The first 128 horses were shot down by the Witboois but under the cloud of dust the troops reached the water-hole and succeeded in driving the Witboois away. But, Sir, this is only one example and I do not want to mention more. South-West Africa&#x2019;s history is richly endowed with similar interesting episodes which have to be preserved for future generations.</p>

<p>But South-West Africa&#x2019;s history is also characterized by another feature which differs to some extent from the history of the Republic of South Africa. This is the particular role which the German population has played in the early history of South-West Africa and to which I, as an Afrikaans-speaking person, refer with pride to-day. These German pioneers were involved in many interesting episodes in the early history of South-West Africa. I want to tell you only one small episode, Sir. This occurred on 11th January, 1904. Lieutenant Gustav Voigts was sent out with 34 men on a reconnaissance to Okahandja in an open armoured carriage hauled by a steam locomotive. They went there and a small distance from Okahandja they encountered the Hereros who bombarded them, and within a short while seven of the troops were killed. They knew that they did not have a chance; they would lose the battle and all of them would be killed. But a strange thing happened. While the engine driver, who was hit first, was lying on the footplate, the engine suddenly started belching black smoke, gave a few jerks and the soldiers thought that it was exploding. It jerked into reverse gear and set off in the direction of Windhoek at an alarming speed. It travelled at such a speed that the men who were in the armoured carriage had great difficulty in climbing over the trucks to see what was happening. When they eventually reached the locomotive they found a small Damara boy. What had happened, was that he had taken some coffee to the engine driver early that morning and had been waiting in a corner of the locomotive to take the flask back without his knowing anything of the dangerous order this mission had been given. However, he had seen his master operating the levers before, and when this attack took place, he pulled the lever, set the locomotive in motion and in that way saved the men. Nonetheless, I just want to ask that when this council has been appointed it should take proper cognizance of this special feature of the history of South-West Africa which bears the imprint of men and women who left us a heritage which we, the Afrikaans, English and Germanspeaking people of South-West Africa, shall never forget.</p>

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Middelland has jumped the gun on me, but I am quite certain that you, Sir, as well as I have enjoyed immensely the speech he made about South-West Africa. I think we both know more or less what he was speaking about. But the thing that worries me is that last year I mentioned the Thirstland Voortrekkers and I am sincerely hoping that the Minister will not forget these people and their bits of property which are still left, and that they will be gathered and housed in a proper place.</p>

<p>I, too, would like to mention one incident. On the Skeleton Coast there was a Coloured man who swam out at Rocky Point to save his friends from the wreck of the Sir Charles Elliot, and I believe his grave has now been declared a national monument. But a little further up from there I found a rather interesting relic, two small &#x201C;strandloper&#x201D; huts in a small reef there, and I was wondering whether that could not be protected, but I believe they do not exist any more.</p>

<p>There is also the famous German-Herero monument at Omaruru which has not been mentioned, and the Herero Monument at Okahandja, where they gather every year. I think these places should be looked after. Then I was wondering what has been done with the Welwitschia plants growing in the Namib desert. Are they protected to-day? Because people go there and cart these plants away. They just destroy them really, because they can never get the tap root out, which is up to 60 feet long. Then there are the graves of the Germans in the Nossop, south of Gobabis Township. The Hereros arranged that at 12 o&#x2019;clock on a certain day they would kill all the people, and all the white people there were killed. I remember that a German who was digging a well was killed also. He was hit on the head with a hammer. Those people are all buried there. I really think that graves of that description should be looked after. But as I said before, my great worry is the relics of the Thirstland Voortrekkers. There is also the grave of William Worthington Jordan that has never been found, between the Etosha Pan and Ovamboland, where he was murdered. I was wondering whether it would not be possible to trace him and to erect some sort of monument to him, because he gave all his worldly possessions to help the Thirstland Voortrekkers.</p>

<p>I should like to thank hon. members on both sides of the House very cordially for the peaceful atmosphere in which we have received this piece of legislation, and for the contribution they made, particularly the contributions by the last two speakers, the hon. member for Middelland and the hon. <span class="col_1839-1840" refersTo="page_0942"/>member for Pietermaritzburg (City). They revealed to us that with the amalgamation of South-West Africa&#x2019;s Monument Commission with that of the Republic they will be able to bring us a rich harvest of fine things which have already been accomplished, but probably also a richer harvest of matters which still have to receive attention. In any case it is very interesting for us uninitiated to hear these historical surveys and these admonitions. The speeches of these two hon. members will definitely be referred to the established Council so that they can give the necessary attention to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington spoke first, and all the points he mentioned will probably be best dealt with, as he himself stated, in the Committee Stage. However, he spoke about clause 3 (2) in regard to the proviso in respect of some of the members of this commission can be discharged. He does not agree with it, and he in fact advocates the old wording. The information I have received is that the Law Advisers maintain that it is quite out of fashion to say that; one does not in fact say that in a law any more. The hon. member for Kensington and I who are not so young any more, prefer the old way of saying things, but apparently they do not want it like that now. But the hon. member can accept however that if a, member of the Council has to be got rid of then it will take place on the grounds he mentioned there. I cannot quite see how any other justifiable grounds can be mentioned, but the new method is to state it as it is stated there. It seems to me the hon. member and I will have to bow to the greater knowledge of the younger generation.</p>

<p>As regards clause 12, the hon. member had something to say in regard to that very important collection. All I can say is that it is not necessary for provision to be made for that. In clause 10 provision has already been made for that. The Council can in fact be of assistance in declaring such collections as those which the hon. member mentioned as historical monuments. That they can do so is an extension of the powers of this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand, who gave a sound and comprehensive survey of the new legislation touched upon a point here which was very important. That is the question of monuments which are situated in areas where we cannot really exercise any authority. He mentioned two cases of monuments in Bantu areas. I cannot at this juncture furnish him with any reply in that regard, but I think it is such an important point that I will have the matter investigated in order to see whether it can be done, and how those monuments can be preserved for posterity.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also addressed a request to me to the effect that assistance should be given to local authorities or local bodies by the Council when monuments are to be erected. The spirit of clause 18 (2) of the Bill, in terms of which assistance to local authorities can be granted, includes this. However, I will make very certain whether this request is included in that, and whether it is in fact possible to lend assistance in terms of clause 18 (2). If not, then I shall move the necessary amendment in the Committee Stage. I think that with this I have dealt with all the points which were raised, and I want once again to express my thanks and appreciation to hon. members.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it will be noted that in the Bill the name Declared Cultural Institutions is given in the place of the existing designation State-aided Institutions. Apart from the fact that the designation State-aided Institutions is confusing because bodies such as schools, universities, etc., all receive State aid, it is necessary for these institutions to be better identified, i.e. with the designation cultural institutions which in reality they are.</p>

<p>The services which these institutions offer the public are in the first instance the stimulation of a desire for knowledge, which results in the expansion of knowledge. The visitor is stimulated and this leads to the broadening of his interests. Unwritten history is illustrated here. Man becomes more aware of the world in which he is living, the vast expanses of time and space, the earth with its trees, plants and animals, his history and development, as well as his achievements in the field of science and art. In the second place these institutions help the visitor to appreciate whatever is beautiful in nature and the artistic and other creations of man. In the last instance the visitor is afforded the opportunity of relaxing and enjoying intellectual and aesthetic pleasure.</p>

<p>The functions of the various institutions, although their divergent nature differ considerably, can be summarized as follows: collection, processing, care of and conservation, research work, publication, exhibitions, educational services and administration. The basic function is that of collection which are followed by the essential functions of processing and preservation work such as cleaning, repairing, restoring, mounting, etc. The national historical institutions in particular afford exceptional opportunities for research. Numerous overseas scientists visit our country in order to study and to describe that which is offered. When the research work is completed, the result must be published in order to acquaint the scientists with new developments in a particular science and all its ramifications. <span class="col_1841-1842" refersTo="page_0943"/>This collective material must also be offered by way of exhibition to the child at school, the university student and the adult.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in order to implement the above-mentioned functions, there must be an administration, and now I am referring you here to the Bill before you. The existing Act in terms of which control over State-aided institutions is exercised dates from 1931, Act No. 23 of 1931, which has already been amended on various occasions. Further amendments are again necessary now, but instead of that I thought it would be better to submit this new Bill and to have the old Act repealed. Apart from the fact that the existing Act is obsolete in its scope and terminology, and apart from the consolidation idea, it would appear from what follows why a new Bill is necessary.</p>

<p>The existing Act does in fact make provision for a grant-in-aid to institutions from moneys appropriated by Parliament, but has nothing to say about the responsible Minister, nor about consultation with the Minister of Finance; it has nothing to say about the purposes in respect of which those grants in aid may be allocated, and the basic conditions associated with them. This uncertainty is now being cleared up in clauses 2 and 3.</p>

<p>Although the institutions are declared to be corporate bodies, provision is being made to the effect that a declared institution cannot without ministerial approval purchase or otherwise acquire, hire, sell, let or exchange or otherwise alienate, hypothecate or encumber immovable property or invest, lend or borrow moneys. These things now require approval. Such approval will also be necessary in order to let, sell, exchange or otherwise alienate any articles belonging to an institution. The funds needed for all these operations are derived for the most part from the Treasury, and hence the necessity for ministerial approval. Clause 9 makes specific provision to the effect that the State will provide and maintain land and buildings. In the past this was in fact the practice, but now it becomes a legal obligation. This land and these buildings remain Government property and must be safeguarded. Apart from this, the interests of the State must be protected against any losses. I am thinking here for example of a donation made to an institution. If it is going to cost more to utilize than it is really worth it cannot simply be accepted by that institution. In addition, the control over the investment, lending out or borrowing of money is equally necessary in order to ensure, for example, that it is not invested in an undertaking which is going to go bankrupt within a year or that money is borrowed at an excessively high rate of interest, while it could have been borrowed somewhere else at a lower rate of interest. The indicated Government control is therefore absolutely essential.</p>

<p>A deficiency which in the past made the administration of the institutions difficult is being met in the Bill by making provision not only for the declaration of an institution in terms of clause 3, but also for the cancellation of such a declaration in terms of clause 14. The motivation for this is that in the past the need arose, and I foresee that the same need will arise in future, to divide an existing institution and to declare two independent institutions. The cultural historical section of the Transvaal museum, Pretoria, has for this reason already been declared an independent institution. It subsequently appeared to have been an illegal step. This Bill not only legalizes this step but makes provision for the cancellation of a declaration of an institution and the declaration of two separate independent institutions. In this connection I can just mention that I already have a request before me to declare the cultural historical section in the old Supreme Court building, Cape Town, which at present still forms part of the national museum, Cape Town, to be a separate independent institution.</p>

<p>The establishment of boards of control over the institutions is already an established usage and needs no further argument. An essential innovation however is the establishment of an Advisory Council and a Committee of Heads of Institutions. These institutions must develop within a national development programme into fully fledged cultural and scientific centres. Such a development programme entails that a national development policy must be laid down. Such a policy will in turn have to be planned and implemented by competent body. I am thinking here of an advisory body similarto the universities advisory committee which was established in terms of the Universities Act, (Act No. 61 of 1955). As I said earlier on, research is an important function of these institutions. There is therefore a need for a coordinating body which will prevent overlapping between these various institutions and other research bodies, and in order to determine general guiding lines for such a programme at the institutions. Officials in the Department of Cultural Affairs do not always have specialized knowledge in regard to matters which affect these institutions very closely. That is why such an advisory body is regarded as the obvious way in which to furnish the Minister with advice. In addition, such a body will aso be able to eliminate the investigating committees into the various needs and problems of the institutions, every few years.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, provision must also be made for the interests of the various institutions, in so far as they themselves are affected, to receive attention. There is already such an administratively adjusted body. i.e. the State-aided Institutions Committee. By transforming this body into a statutory body, i.e. the Committee of Heads of Declared Institutions, action taken in regard to matters of general importance are amalgamated. Joint consultations with a view to efficient administration and the fulfilling of tasks are hereby ensured. This body will also serve as joint mouthpiece for <span class="col_1843-1844" refersTo="page_0944"/>all the institutions when they address representations to the Department.</p>

<p>In conclusion provision is, at the request of the South-West Africa Administration, being made to the effect that the provisions of this Bill should also be applicable to South-West Africa. The other provisions are of a merely consequential nature.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are having a busy time! The hon. the Minister and I seem to be closely engaged during these days. I think that this Bill gives evidence to us of the very energetic staff that the hon. the Minister has. They have been reorganizing certain parts of their administration with very good effect indeed I think. There have been items in our annual estimates that have not been so clearly set out as we should have liked. Now we have this opportunity to get clarity.</p>

<p>I see that most of the control will be by regulation. I think that is unavoidable. But there are certain safeguards that one can ask for. One of these safeguards is contained in clause 11 where it is stated that the accounts will be audited by the Controller and Auditor-General. We will see something about that in the annual report.</p>

<p>There is the other point which I have mentioned before and I think it can be elaborated upon. There is a necessity for annual reports on the work of these councils. If they are to receive public money, we should have information about how that money is being spent. I think that is an elementary request and I would like the hon. the Minister to give it his attention. I understand that each of these institutions will have a council and that there will be an advisory council in command of them all that will advise the hon. the Minister and that his department will report to the House or to the Committee. I hope that will be possible. We have no objection to the Bill. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the work which his staff is doing in preparing a well organized department.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as in the case of the Bills we dealt with prior to dealing with this Bill, i.e. the National Culture Promotion Bill and the National Monuments Bill, as well as other Bills already piloted through Parliament by the Department of Cultural Affairs, this Bill to me is another fine fruit of the independent status of this Department. We know that cultural affairs have always been the patient and docile attendant of education. Now that it has been raised to the status of a partner&#x2014;perhaps still a junior partner to a very large extent&#x2014;of education, this Department is already beginning to give a good account of itself. As long as cultural affairs fell under the old Department of Education, Arts and Science, the attention was directed exclusively at educational affairs. Because the needs of education were so immediate, the attention, as far as financial provision was concerned, was directed at education. Cultural affairs and cultural institutions had to be satisfied with the proverbial crumbs which fell from the table. I intentionally do not say the rich man&#x2019;s table, because education as such has not always received the portion it ought to have received from budgets of the past. Now there is a marked improvement.</p>

<p>The original Act, i.e. the State-aided Institutions Act of 1931, made provision for&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; State-aided libraries, museums, art galleries, zoological gardens and botanical gardens, and kindred institutions &#x2026;</block>

<p>This stigma of being known as State-aided institutions has stuck throughout the years since 1931. In the amending Acts which followed&#x2014;there were quite a few, namely in 1948, in 1957 and in 1966&#x2014;reference was always made to &#x201C;State-aided institutions&#x201D;. These words, &#x201C;State-aided institutions&#x201D; give me the impression that these cultural and kindred institutions have had to be satisfied with the crumbs I have just referred to. Otherwise they have had to assume the roles of beggars. The institutions that were more modest eventually stopped trying whereas the institutions that were less modest and perhaps knew the art of begging somewhat better, received reasonable amounts. However, the title of this Bill, namely the Cultural Institutions Bill, is removing, at least from the wording, the destitution with which these institutions have been stigmatized in the past. That is in my opinion, a very positive step in the right direction which will in future have excellent results.</p>

<p>In my opinion this Bill is, in the main, a measure which consolidates the existing Acts. It makes this legislation more streamlined and the terminology is in keeping with modern concepts. All existing declared institutions&#x2014;a whole list is mentioned in this Bill&#x2014;are receiving recognition and an opening is also being left for the addition and recognition of new institutions. Whereas the Minister used to be dependent on his Department with regard to the handling of matters affecting individual institutions, the Minister is now going to have the assistance of the Advisory Council for Declared Institutions which is to be established. This advisory council is being empowered to advise the Minister. This arrangement is being made in clause 12 (14). This can lead to a greater measure of uniformity in the handling and treatment of the declared institutions, and to me the establishment of a Committee of Heads of Declared Institutions in particular, spells the modernization and streamlining of the activities of the institutions. As all of us will admit, the heads of the institutions are acquainted with the real needs of the institutions, and every truly inspired head of such an institution is the pivot on which everything in the institution hinges. While I am speaking of the heads of institutions, surely it is fitting that I should mention the dedication and the purposefulness with which the heads or the directors of these institutions have been <span class="col_1845-1846" refersTo="page_0945"/>fulfilling their task. They have often had to do so under difficult circumstances because of a lack of funds. These heads truly inspire their staff and their actions also infuse the public with interest.</p>

<p>It has been my special privilege to have been serving for many years on the board of curators of the National Cultural History and Open-Air Museum, to which the Minister also referred in his Second Reading speech. In connection with this special institution I should like to mention the name of the energetic directrix, Mrs. Roodt Coetzee, whose inspiration for her work will make a deep impression on anybody, whose capacity for work is conspicuous and whose knowledge of her task astounds one.</p>

<p>I have also had the privilege of being a member of the board of curators of the Transvaal Museum for a few years. I also want to pay tribute to the good work of the former head, who has passed away. I also want to pay tribute to the disposition with which the new head, Dr. Brain, is setting about his task. He is setting about this task with great enthusiasm and he regards it as his life task.</p>

<p>With regard to the open-air museum of Pretoria I want to say that it actually is an addition to the old cultural history museum. It is in point of fact the modern extension of a cultural museum. I want to mention three objectives in brief. The open-air museum is, as I have said, a modern extension of the cultural museum and its real objectives consequently are no different. Its objectives are to introduce people to the cultural past and to educate them in that regard, as well as to promote research into culture. The second objective of an open-air museum is to reproduce the material manifestations of the cultural life of the past by means of a careful reconstruction of buildings and landscapes. Finally, a national open-air museum has to have regard, in addition to all these things, to the various cultural communities of a country. Consideration is also being given to the representation of certain important material cultural elements of our countries of origin in order to illustrate the relationship between us and our countries of origin.</p>

<p>On behalf of the board of curators of the museum to which I have been referring, I want to thank the Minister once again for everything he is doing in this connection. I did this last year, and now I emphasize it again. I thank him for the special interest shown by him in the Cultural History Open-Air Museum, particularly in the open-air museum division. I want to thank him for the assistance he rendered in obtaining the land. We also have to thank the City Council of Pretoria for the fine piece of land it gave for these purposes. Last year the hon. the Minister said in a speech, &#x201C;In future we shall spend much more money on this very important aspect of our nation&#x2019;s past&#x201D;. That is why this legislation before us holds so much promise. This open-air museum will also make its contribution to the preservation of our cultural possessions, because a nation that neglects its cultural possessions is neglecting its heritage and will become spiritually impoverished.</p>

<p>Just as good work is being done by the directors and the staff of the said two museums, so good work is being done in other museums in our country in connection with the preservation of that which is cultural-historical, natural-historical, as well as natural-scientific.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to express my gratitude to the local authorities, to be specific, to the city councils, for the allowances they have been paying to these museums in order to promote the work of these museums.</p>

<p>I am speaking of additional financial support, Mr. Speaker, because this Bill also deals with the provision of more money, and for that reason what I am saying is complementary to that. We want to thank these authorities most heartily for the financial support they have been giving, because the lack of funds has been the museums&#x2019; biggest obstacle after all. Consequently I want to ask, and in my opinion this is relevant, people who can make donations, who have articles which may otherwise be neglected because their children may no longer be interested in such items, to bequeath those donations to these museums. The articles may be of great cultural value. If there are people, authorities, companies, etc., that wish to make financial donations, these will definitely be welcome.</p>

I thank the hon. members for this.</p>

<p>I want to give the hon. member for Kensington the assurance that this last of the series we are now dealing with will all be included in our annual report, instead of being placed in separate reports. The Department of Cultural Affairs is still a small department. We are now developing it, not in order to create a large and new empire, but in order to be able to render efficient service. Until such time as its annual report justifies it, it is probably not necessary to table separate reports here. We hope that, as in the past, the report on the past year will be available to all hon. members at an early stage in the next year.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the remarks I have to make about clause 2 will be applicable as well, I think, to clause 3. This clause deals with the appointment of assizers. It seems to me that a new class of assizer is going to be created. The old class had to have an elementary knowledge of physics. I suppose it covered the usual range of heat, light, sound, magnetism, electricity, some mensuration, and so on. But now we seem to create a new class of assizer. Are these men to be employed temporarily, or are they to be civil servants who have to go through another course of training? It does not seem clear to me from clause 2. It says here: &#x201C;re-assize any or any particular kind of weighing or measuring instrument &#x2026; in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and to perform such other functions as may be assigned to assizers by this Act&#x201D;. So it seems to me they may be creating a different type of assizer. I wonder if the hon. the Minister can help me in this respect.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think we are digressing far from the existing system. Basically no changes are being made to the present dispensation. Actually, I think we are simply widening the scope somewhat; because instead of appointing the officials to assize &#x201C;weighing and measuring instruments&#x201D;, as was provided in the old section, the new clause reads to assize &#x201C;any or any particular kind&#x201D;. Therefore, if a person is qualified to perform his duties in respect of a certain class of weighing or measuring instrument, he may be appointed. He will not be appointed on a temporary basis, but on a permanent basis. It is not the idea to make provision in this clause for the appointment of temporary officials. In addition their powers are also being extended to some extent. The old Act read: &#x201C;to carry out the provisions of this Act&#x201D;. These words are being substituted in the new Bill by &#x201C;to perform such other functions as may be assigned to assizers by this Act&#x201D;. For example, in terms of this substitution the officials are being empowered to carry out certain inspections.</p>

<p>No, but this clause renders the appointment of new persons to the staff a little bit easier. It enables the superintendent to entrust them with a slightly wider field of inspection duties. Actually, we think this will assist in alleviating the staff shortage to a certain extent.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The intention is to use the existing personnel, whose qualifications will be acknowledged. New officials will be appointed. The board will have a broader choice to lay down the subjects in which they want these men to qualify, instead of the Act laying down the subjects specifically.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>That is so. We feel that the number of weighing and measuring instruments will increase to a very large extent. There are also certain other instruments, like water meters, etc. It is possible that they could be brought within the ambit of this legislation. So, if a person is specialized in a certain direction, the board will perhaps not require the same entrance examinations for him. There might be an easier entrance examination. While he is working, the basis of his qualifications could be broadened by prescribed subjects so as to qualify him for operation over the whole range of the Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The object of the Bill is to amend certain Railway Acts; the implications of the various clauses are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum which has already been laid upon the Table, and my observations will therefore be brief and to the point.</p>

<p>Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 5 are aimed at increasing the statutory powers of the Railway Administration in connection with materials which may be conveyed by pipe line and which is at present restricted to petroleum products and other liquids. As it may be necessary in future to lay pipelines for the conveyance of other kinds of traffic, it is the intention to augment the statutory powers of the Administration by authorizing it to lay pipelines for the conveyance of any material, that is, solids, liquids and gases. It is also necessary similarly to extend the expropriation powers of the Administration, so that it will be possible to obtain the land required for the laying of pipelines for the conveyance of any product or material. The amendments in clause 4 are consequential <span class="col_1851-1852" refersTo="page_0948"/>upon the increase in railway fares, goods tariffs, and miscellaneous costs as from 1st September, 1966, and relate to the excess charge payable by passengers if they travel without a free pass or ticket, with an inadequate pass or ticket, or beyond the authorized distance. Clause 6 relates to the alteration of the route of the proposed new railway line between Vryheid and Empangeni, which has already been approved by Parliament. Hon. members will see from the report of the Railway and Harbour Board that has been tabled, that as a result of the progress made with the planning of the Richard&#x2019;s Bay area and in view of the particulars which have since become available as a result, it became necessary to take the railway facilities for the area into consideration. It was found that, owing to the changed conditions, the route originally planned for the railway line between Vryheid and Empangeni would no longer, as a whole, fit in with the development of the area concerned. Consequently it is suggested for the consideration of Parliament that the route of the railway line concerned be altered so as to fit in with the changed circumstances. In clause 7 provision is made for the confirmation of certain changes in the conditions of employment of the staff which were introduced with retrospective effect by way of regulation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are grateful to the hon. the Deputy Minister for his exposition, but I am afraid that it is not quite satisfactory. We should not like to oppose this Bill, because it is an administrative Bill which is probably necessary to enable the Administration to do certain things, but I feel that we are entitled to more information than we received, either from the explanatory memorandum or from this little speech made by the hon. the Deputy Minister. Therefore I immediately want to ask him a few questions about matters on which I had hoped he would enlighten us in his introductory speech. There can of course be no objection to our extending the powers of the Administration by authorizing them to lay pipelines through which it will be possible to convey goods other than petroleum products and other liquids. I think it is quite right that provision should also be made for solids, liquids, gases and so on, because the experience of other countries has shown that this can be a very efficient and inexpensive form of conveyance. It would have been interesting, and at the same time it would have helped Parliament in deciding about this matter, if the Deputy Minister had told us, for example, from where to where he had in mind that these goods should be conveyed. Is this pipeline for the conveyance of manganese and iron ore? I think that Parliament is entitled to have this information, and if, for example, it is manganese or iron ore, which are mined in the dry parts of South Africa, the hon. the Deputy Minister might have told us by means of which liquid it is to be conveyed, and if that liquid is water, where the water is to come from. If the conveying agent is to be water, he might have told us whether he intends to re-use the water. This, of course, is essential in South Africa to-day, that is, that we must learn that we have to use water not only once, but over and over again. I think it would have been more interesting, and it would have been more respectful towards this Parliament, if the Administration, and particularly the hon. the Deputy Minister, had furnished this information. Clause 4 of the Bill provides, for example, that an increase is to be made in the excess charge that is levied if someone gets onto a train without a ticket. All of us who know something about the South African Railways, know that this applies mainly to Bantu. Now and then it happens that a member of Parliament gets onto a train without his ticket, but that is simply carelessness. However, there are thousands upon thousands of Bantu who, owing to ignorance or to a more sinister motive, get onto a train without a ticket, but is the hon. the Deputy Minister satisfied that he will be able to administer this Bill effectively in the case of Bantu? There are members on this side of the House who will in a moment, or perhaps when the discussion is resumed, speak from their own experience about what they have seen on Bantu trains, or on trains conveying Bantu passengers mainly. They will be able to convince the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is virtually impossible for a conductor to apply this clause of the Bill. It would have been interesting to us if the hon. the Deputy Minister had told us, and it will still be interesting to us if he will tell us when he replies, especially after the information that will be furnished by other hon. members here, what hope there is of applying this clause. We have nothing against the clause in principle. Railway tariffs have increased over the years, because the value of money decreased, and therefore it is quite fair and justified that this specific excess charge should be increased, merely on account of the decrease in the value of money.</p>

<heading>TRANSPORT FACILITIES</heading>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move the motion standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, deploring the inadequacy of the transport facilities in our twentieth century cities, calls upon the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a commission to investigate and report, <i>inter alia,</i> upon&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) cheaper and more efficient mass transportation needs including the possibility of monorail or underground services;</li>

<li>(2) adequate subsidization of urban authorities; and</li>

<li>(3) other financial assistance to provincial and local authorities.</li>

</ol>

<p>Contrary to what was about to be said to the hon. the Deputy Minister, when the last debate was adjourned. I want to remark that this is a very rare occasion on which I really believe that he and I are going to agree. [Interjections.] I had some doubts about it, and I wondered whether perhaps I was wrong; when I studied my motion I thought that perhaps I should have said that we deplored the inadequacy of the Government, but the motion does not say that. It deplores the inadequacy of transport facilities in our 20th century cities. I think the case is so unarguable that the Deputy Minister is going to agree with it. It is unarguable because we have a tangible and visible and an urgent need for an assault on the problem of mass removal of people in our cities. In fact, we have this demonstration twice daily in every city of South Africa. We have it every morning, and we have it every afternoon, with people going to and from their work, and there is no city in South Africa which has escaped it. We have traffic jams, we have delays, we have hold-ups, and we have the effect on nerves and on tempers, with the result that we have accidents. There is one stretch, for instance, leading into Durban where I saw the other day there had been 37 accidents in a matter of a few months, simply because of traffic jams. There is nothing wrong with the road; it is just a point at which traffic concertinas and you get the accidents. So twice a day in every city you have the visible evidence that we have a problem which had to be attacked immediately and with imagination.</p>

<p>Not only can we see it, but I think perhaps it would be as well if I looked for a moment to the statistics upon which I base this demonstrable need for an investigation into mass transport. It is not only time to face this issue; I think we have passed the time when we should have faced it, because the problem has become a very much greater one through the delay in attacking it, and with every year that passes it becomes even more and more difficult and expensive. Durban, for instance, as a city has just spent thousands of rands on traffic consultants to draw up a plan. When they presented that plan people looked at the figure of the cost with horror. Immediately you had people saying: This is impracticable and unrealistic. I read the other day a controversy in a Sunday newspaper over the 16 years of delay in dealing with the Pretoria-Johannesburg freeway. The Durban-Western freeway was held up for years because of delays and arguments over subsidies, and each of these delays makes the problem more difficult and the cost much higher; and it is now going to cost double or treble, or ten times as much, what it would have cost had we tackled this problem long ago. Therefore this appeal I make in this motion for an urgent inquiry relates to a matter which, if delayed at all, will add further to the cost, not only in the expropriation of buildings and land which are appreciating in value, but in the cost of the construction work itself. All I have dealt with so far has touched on only one small aspect of the problem of mass transport.</p>

<p>Let us look at our population figures. The Witwatersrand has grown from, roughly, &#x00BD; million population in 1921 to 1 million in 1936, to 1&#x00BE; million in 1951, and to over 2 million in 1960. In Cape Town a similar increase took place, although not quite so big. Durban grew from 168,000 to 680,000 people. Pretoria grew from 74,000 to 420,000, with this growth accelerating in recent years, from 1951 onwards. With this we have had the growth in private and public vehicles on the road. If we think that at the time when Johannesburg had &#x00BD; million people there were only 40,000 motor vehicles registered in the whole of South Africa, which grew until in 1958, when Johannesburg had nearly 2 million people, there were 1 million vehicles, then we realize what growth took place. From 1958 to 1967, in those nine years alone, it grew from 1 million to 1.8 million registered motor vehicles on the road. If we compare the growth of population with the growth of vehicles, we find that vehicular road traffic has grown at a far greater rate than public transport. I do not want to bore the House with a lot of figures, but I have taken out the figures relating to the S.A. Railways&#x2019; suburban traffic. Cape Town has gone up from 1940 with 47 million to 1965, with 102 million, and in 1967, 107 million. In Durban there has been a steady increase, except when the line was installed to Kwa Mashu, and similarly on the Witwatersrand there was a steady growth except when the Soweto line was installed. But if you look at the population, the vehicles and the public transport, you find that the trend has been for people to move on to the roads and that the public transport has not kept pace with vehicular traffic. There is only one reason for that, namely that public transport is not attractive to the average user. If you see the motor-cars nose to tail with one passenger in each car, spending far more on driving themselves in to business <span class="col_1855-1856" refersTo="page_0950"/>each day in his own car than he would have to spend on public transport, you realize that the only reason why he does it is because it is more convenient. Neither local authority transport, nor the S.A. Railways&#x2019; suburban transport, is meeting the demands of the public.</p>

<p>If you look at these figures again of public transport, you find that over three-quarters is for Bantu passengers, and roughly a quarter is for white or second-class passengers. But about three-quarters of the traffic is third-class traffic, and this again affects the numbers of vehicles on the roads.</p>

<p>Now, this is the background against which any investigation into the mass transport movement of people in our cities would have to take place, a background in which at present roads are choked with traffic, and yet the Government has withdrawn its subsidies on urban freeways within our cities. I accept that ring roads, the subsidy on which has not been withdrawn, are an important factor in the problem, but I still believe that the subsidy on urban freeways should be retained, because no matter what we do to provide public transport we will still have the motor traffic problem. I do not believe it is the right approach to say that because freeways are pumping vehicles into the cities, like a 10-inch pipe suddenly being reduced to a 2-inch pipe, so to say, with a solid stream being pushed into narrower streets, therefore you should stop freeways. We should expedite ring roads and we should take other measures to deal with the problem in the cities, but we should not stop the building of the freeways themselves because they are vital to the smooth flow of traffic. If you again take my own city of Durban, you have the freeways bringing the traffic in, but the ring roads lag years behind. The progress is so slow that even the effect of those ring roads is not being brought to bear, despite the decisions to build them. It all comes back to this question of continuously putting off the problem because of the expenditure. In the meantime each delay is costing South Africa and the taxpayer in the country additional thousands and millions of rands for every year that this urgent work is delayed. I do not want to deal in detail with the financial problem. I have colleagues who will deal with the details flowing from this motion. I therefore want to paint only the broad pattern of the problem of delays and the problem of financing that goes with them.</p>

<p>We should be getting people off the roads and if we want to do that we have two alternatives. Either we must go down underground, or we must go up. I believe it is perhaps, in our present cities, too late to think in terms of subways. I do not know how many hon. members saw the city of Frankfort whilst it was installing its subway system. It created untold congestion and mess. Whole buildings had to be demolished, and whole sections of streets closed, and year after year this has gone on, trying to superimpose a subway system on an existing system. Anyone who has tried to drive in that city, as I tried to do some four years ago, found himself going round and round in circles, and all you bump into is &#x201C;Road Closed&#x201D; signs and more subway work. So I think perhaps subways may be too late for our present-day cities, but I believe that the hon. the Minister of Planning, in any planning for future cities, should make provision and leave open space for subways to be incorporated into that plan; because obviously when the populations get to the right figure, that is the easiest way of moving people <i>en masse.</i></p>

<p>But I think there is also another direction, that of looking upwards towards the monorail system. Our existing ordinary surface train system is limited to topography; it is limited to the layout of suburbs. For instance, Cape Town can use the system with effect, as the figures show. Cape Town has 107 million suburban transport journeys against 41 million in Durban, and only 238 million on the whole of the Witwatersrand. Where your layout is along a straight line, a suburban train system can play a part. But the monorail system could be installed in nearly all our cities where it is not possible to use the normal train service. I have had a look at the monorail planning for the 1970 World Exposition in Japan. I am quite happy to send this over to the Minister to look at. It is all written in Japanese, but I will tell him a little about it. He can read it from the back while I read it from the front, because I believe your read backwards in Japanese. This monorail service carries 270 persons per car, and there are four cars per train, which means that it can move 1,080 persons at a time. The installation which they are using at this World Exposition is anticipated to carry 25,920 persons per hour to do a 2&#x00BE;-mile or 4.3-kilometre track in 2&#x00BD; minutes. In other words, faster than a mile a minute, with no driver and no staff on the train at all, operated entirely automatically, with entry from stations which can be controlled. Without going into the technical data, I mention this to show what is happening to-day. This, admittedly, is a special monorail being built for a special purpose, but in Japan this has grown from the use of monorails for normal commercial purposes, monorails which can be built, for instance, on a pylon of less than a metre, less than a yard, in diameter. In other words, it can be put down the centre of an ordinary road. Just as you have your lamp post down the centre of a two-lane road, so you could put your pylons with your monorails running on top of it. It can climb a gradient of up to 55 per cent and it can turn in 60 metres. In other words, it is flexible enough to use in fairly uneven cities; it is small enough at its base to take it up above the traffic on your normal routes without any necessity for demolition. I have not been there, but from literature and information I understand that in Japan many of the stations are in fact on the first floors of buildings; that they open directly off the monorail, into upper storeys of buildings, into offices, into shopping centres and so <span class="col_1857-1858" refersTo="page_0951"/>on. I believe that this form of transport is one to which we have not given sufficient attention and sufficient investigation as to its practical potential. I do not pretend to be an expert on the cost factor or on the engineering factor, but there are engineers who have claimed that they can produce a monorail transport system at a lower cost than the cost of building an ordinary public highway. These are rubber-track vehicles, electrically driven; they are smooth and easy to handle and control. As I say, on the Japanese monorail there is no staff provided at all. It is entirely controlled from a central point.</p>

<p>This sort of transport system is one which I believe could help to take many thousands of present motorists off the highways. You will never get them all off; you will never clear our roads entirely; that is impossible. Many people have to have their cars for their day-to-day work. But there are tens of thousands of others who in fact, if there was an efficient, cheap and reliable service, would turn towards it. Sir, all this motion asks for is an investigation into these problems with a view to seeking a solution and with a view to seeking better co-ordination of our transport resources. We have had the Marais Commission, which has reported but whose report is not yet available, and that may to some extent deal with co-ordination between local authorities and the railway services. But that was not a commission designed to investigate in detail the problem of urban transport. It was a national transport co-ordination investigation. Such a commission, if appointed, would have at its disposal a tremendous amount of data already collected. Durban, for instance, could make available to it immediately the complete calculations and efforts of its transportation consultants. The results of an investigation, which has taken two years or more to complete, would be available to an investigating committee immediately, without cost and without effort. Similarly the results of all the other investigations done by all the other cities of South Africa would be available. It is a question of putting that information together, investigating the question of practicability, investigating the question of finance and working out a system of co-ordination and administration. The question of co-ordination is a matter which will be dealt with by colleagues of mine on this side of the House in more detail. It is a matter of importance. It is no use having efficient systems unless you have proper coordinating machinery to tie them together. I will not deal at this stage with the details of the possibilities there.</p>

<p>If I may sum up, Sir, here we have a four-pronged problem. We know that there is a need; the need is visible and it is urgent. It affects rail, road and local authorities, and it affects in particular the financial relationship between the Central Government, the provincial and the local authorities. Those are the four factors which I believe require urgent investigation, and I hope that we are not going to have any vague generalization but a real acceptance from the hon. the Minister of this as an urgent national matter, a matter which we cannot afford to play around with any longer, a matter that we must tackle immediately this year in order to avoid this tragic postponement of decisions, which is taking place on such a big scale in all our cities. The only city which really can hold up its head is the city in which this House is situated, the City of Cape Town. I think Cape Town&#x2019;s highways and its suburban train service are an example to South Africa&#x2014;the train service because of the convenient lay-out of the suburbs, and the urban freeways because of the efforts of the Cape Town City Council but, more than that, because of the financial support that it has been able to receive from the province, from the Divisional Council and from the Central Government. They have got the money and they have got on with the job. Other cities have not enjoyed that advantage. Cape Town has had subsidies from three sources. Durban for a long time battled to get more than just the National Transport subsidy. Eventually the province was able to contribute. But the problem has been one of finance and Cape Town has shown what can be done. It is not finished yet; it has a long way to go, but it has shown that something can be done if it is tackled. Sir, my plea is that we should investigate and tackle this matter on a national scale as a matter of primary importance, so that by the end of this century we do not find ourselves completely throttled by traffic which cannot move and people who cannot get to work.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) moved his motion in a way altogether different from its appearance in writing. None of us here to-day want to claim that the transport facilities, especially in our large cities, cannot be improved upon. We know that in many places it still leaves much to be desired. It is a question which this side of the House is most certainly not indifferent to. Whether a commission should be appointed to investigate this aspect I leave to the judgment of the hon. the Minister. I merely want to refer here to the commission of inquiry which already exists and which the hon. member mentioned, i.e. the expert commission under the chairmanship of Dr. Dawie Marais, which is investigating the entire question of transport co-ordination in South Africa. This is actually the correct point of departure. The present pattern of urban traffic is a three-fold pattern; the use of private motor cars, local public transport services and the national transport service, i.e. the Railways. Co-ordination for the maximum utilization of these existing services is of the utmost importance. I think that if we could bring about co-ordination between the various services in this field, we would already have progressed far in solving the existing problem. The hon. member for Durban (Point) raised this aspect and said that his colleagues would <span class="col_1859-1860" refersTo="page_0952"/>go into this matter further, but in his motion there is no mention anywhere of this question of co-ordination of services. Therefore I want to mention here that this question of a linkage between the various services is important. Sir, in saying that we are not indifferent to these matters, I must say to the hon. member that we must understand one another very well: The Railways, the national transport service, has a certain task within this framework, chiefly to convey people to the centre of town, but the transportation of people in the urban areas themselves is the basic task of the local authorities. The local authorities and the United Party and their Press are very particular that one should not encroach upon their terrain. We saw this last week when the hon. member for Middelburg moved a motion here. The <i>Cape Times</i> was immediately up in arms because the terrain of the local authorities was being trespassed upon. What the hon. member for Durban (Point) states in his motion and what he has just said are two different things. What is contained in his motion is no more than an attack on the administrations of the large cities of our country. To-day he was actually engaged here in introducing a motion of no confidence against the large city councils of Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town which are controlled by United Party supporters.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now come back to the motion itself. The national transport service, as I said, has a task in this connection. Its portion of the task is to convey the people to the centre of the city, and in that respect we may say with every justification and pride that the national transport service carries out its portion of the task exceptionally well. I do not want to go into particulars. The hon. member for Randburg, who will support me on this side of the House, will supply the particulars to hon. members. You know, Sir, how the Railways has spent millions upon millions of rand to improve its suburban train services to the maximum of efficiency. Just to give you an idea of the extent of the activities of the S.A. Railways in our large cities, I want to mention here that in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town an average of 2,600 trains are handled each day, at these four stations alone. The report of the Schumann Commission indicated that on these services the Railways suffered a loss of at least R40 million a year. What is that other than a contribution, a subsidy, to make efficient suburban traffic available? What is more, the State, on the other hand, has an agreement with the Railways that it will carry the responsibility for every loss which is suffered on Bantu services to resettlement areas. On those services the State subsidizes the Bantu passengers to the tune of about R12 million a year; in other words, the State spends an additional R12 million a year to supply cheap, efficient services for suburban Bantu passengers. I merely mention these two cases to indicate the part played by the national transport service.</p>

<p>I specially want to dwell now for a moment on a few other possibilities which the hon. member mentioned here as solutions for the problem. He mentioned the question of mono-rails, overhead railway lines, giving Japan as an example. The matter has already been investigated by the Johannesburg City Council. I just do not know what happened to the investigation. The hon. member spoke about delays in other spheres and he could perhaps merely have told us what his City Council in Johannesburg found out after they had conducted the investigation. I read in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 22nd June, 1966, under the heading &#x201C;Aid on monorail&#x201D;, the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Big overseas firms will be asked to help Johannesburg City Council decide whether or not to build a multi-million rand express monorail system between the central and the southern suburbs. The monorail plan which envisages a bus-in-the-sky is one of several bold proposals made after an overseas study tour by council officials last year. Among other recommendations made as a result of the tour, reports by Mr. J. F. Oberholzer &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Oberholzer is a United Party M.P.C. and I believe a really formidable United Party member in the Johannesburg City Council. Certain of the recommendations were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the council re-examine its transport policy, bearing in mind that transport is now recognized virtually throughout the world as an essential service which must adequately meet citizens&#x2019; needs; that the United Municipal Executive be asked to press once again for more realistic Government and provincial aid for urban motorway and major road schemes; and that the Executive be requested to urge a Government investigation into the need for planning future mass transit systems in larger urban areas.</block>

<p>In other words, this old United Party motion which was moved in the Johannesburg City Council is therefore to-day merely being dished up part and parcel to us here again. The matter has apparently now been investigated by the Johannesburg City Council. I also read in a subsequent issue of the same <span class="col_1861-1862" refersTo="page_0953"/>newspaper under the heading &#x201C;New study to be made of monorail plan&#x201D;, the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The plans to give Johannesburg an express-speed monorail service to the southern suburbs have been handed over to the city&#x2019;s forward planners.</block>

<p>Then it was given to the organizers and planners of the Johannesburg City Council and that is now the end of the story.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>What is the date of that article?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>The date is 16th June, 1966. Since then we have not heard of the matter again. Apparently the Johannesburg City Council came to their senses and simply dropped this matter like a hot potato. If the hon. member has other information from the City Council he may tell us about it. But he mentioned the Japan or Tokyo monorail here as a specific example of how efficiently the overhead line could work. A few days later I read once more in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 20th June, 1966, that &#x201C;Tokyo&#x2019;s monorail is not all that smooth&#x201D;. But I can comprehend that the hon. member understood nothing of his brochure because it was written in Japanese. The article in the <i>Mail</i> reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Johannesburg would be a brighter, faster-moving, more efficient city for a monorail transport system. But it would have to be a better monorail than the oft-cited example in Tokyo.</block>

<p>That one is worth nothing. The fact of the matter is this, as the article goes on to state&#x2014;*</p>

<p>The Tokyo monorail is slow, rumbling and cumbersome, not well patronized and certainly no asset.</p>

<p>Now, why does the hon. member want to come along and commend something like this to us as an example. Getting away from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> now, I come to an article in the <i>Railway Gazette</i> of 1st January, 1965. That is quite a few years back. An article appeared there under the title &#x201C;Monorail mania&#x201D;, and the editor who wrote this article said that this story of overhead railway lines had now become a mania with people, and that every town planner who is instructed to lay out a new municipal area and who wants to prove that he has mastered the most modern and enlightened concepts in connection with town planning, now includes a monorail in his scheme. That is what is stated in this article. It goes on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What the town planner fails to grasp is that merely by turning the train upside-down he has done nothing to solve the commercial and operating difficulties that face any operator of public transport.</block>

<p>This man, therefore, after a well-considered article, comes to the conclusion that this affair does not solve anything. But, neither are our Railways as stupid as the hon. member thinks they are. This matter has already been investigated by the South African Railways. On 20th August, 1964, the Minister of Transport announced certain schemes contemplated in connection with extensions to the Railways. In an article it is stated that the hon. the Minister of Transport said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister added that engineers had investigated a monorail system for some of the more thickly populated urban areas, but they found the cost to be too high at this stage.</block>

<p>That is what the Minister said. This investigation which the Railways instituted in connection with this monorail system brought to light certain deficiencies. The first was that the aerial rail system had not been thoroughly proved. Secondly it cannot be easily integrated with the existing railway system. Thirdly, it is more difficult to provide by-passes in cases of blockages than is the case with the conventional railway system. That is what I wanted to say in respect of these overhead lines. I do not think that the time is now right for South Africa to afford such luxuries.</p>

<p>No, I now quoted the hon. the Minister. Then the hon. member also spoke here of underground trains or underground services. He himself came to the conclusion that it was out of the question for South Africa&#x2019;s old cities. It has been proven in practice that it does not pay to tackle an extensive scheme for an already constructed city with fewer than 5 million people&#x2014;new cities are quite a different matter. I also have here an article about the problem which exists in other countries in respect of underground railway systems. The greatest problem there is to be able to feed these systems properly. I have here an article written by Mr. Gabriel Bouladon in which he explains the problem of supplying this underground system with a steady flow of passengers. Mr. Bouladon is chief of the engineering division of the Batelle Institute in Geneva. I cannot quote everything at present, but in this well-considered article the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As Mr. Bouladon points out, 85 per cent of an underground railway system is empty at any one moment&#x2014;a remarkable extravagance considering the cost of the tunnels.</block>

<p><span class="col_1863-1864" refersTo="page_0954"/>Consequently this matter is also one which ought to be considered seriously before we tackle it. And the hon. member also suggested another solution in which he actually criticized the Department for its decision no longer to subsidize expressways. A psychosis has also developed that by means of this expressways and such roads one can now wipe out all these problems as if by magic. Informed people tell you that it is not a long-term solution. Usually one cannot plan far in advance for such a great road. One can hardly plan such a scheme 20 years ahead of schedule. It then takes one several years to construct such an expressway. And, by the time one has constructed the expressway, one&#x2019;s problem is that there is once more sufficient traffic to overload it. But that was not my idea in the first instance. I want to read to you what Dr. P. J. Rigden had to say in this connection. He is director of the National Road Research Institute of the C.S.I.R. In an article in the <i>Commercial Opinion</i> of December, 1967, he stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be noted that in many cities the experience had been that new motorways built to cope with existing traffic called into existence new traffic sufficient to create a new congestion. There certainly seems to be growing feeling in the world that urban motorways alone are not the solution they were once thought to be.</block>

<p>I leave the matter there. We must have these conveniences, but after exhaustive investigation the Department made well-considered decisions in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member rightly said that there is a continual concentration of our people in the cities. Professor Sadie of Stellenbosch calculates that in 1970 almost 90 per cent of our country&#x2019;s total white population will live in the cities. In 1960 the percentage was 84 and in 1951 it was 79. 44 per cent of them live in our four large cities which I mentioned a moment ago. The tendency with our nonwhite population is the same. In 1961 33 per cent of the million vehicles in South Africa were registered in these four large cities, and in 1967, 559,000 of them&#x2014;that is 30 per cent of the total number of vehicles&#x2014;were registered in these four large centres. The C.S.I.R. calculated that in 1967 8,700 million motor-vehicle-miles were travelled in our cities. This indicates to us what a tremendous task it continually is to keep pace with this mass of traffic.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I do not have much time, but I shall mention a few things. As far as I am concerned, the following matters must receive a little attention for greater efficiency in respect of our suburban transport. In the first instance we must make much better use of the existing roads and streets in our cities by applying the most practical and modern methods of traffic control. I do not have enough time to elaborate on this point. In the second instance, we must see to it that, in town planning and in the re-planning of towns, the public transport aspect is not lost sight of, because our traffic problems often originate in the lay-out of our towns. We must bear in mind that the further the worker lives from the centre of town, the further the residential areas are, the greater are the problems in respect of transport services. In the third place we must, as far as it is practically possible, decentralize our business and industrial areas in our large city complexes and remove them to places where more parking facilities can be provided. At the same time we can thereby relieve the traffic density on our existing roads and streets. In the fourth place we must purposefully control and restrict certain types of traffic and certain vehicles on certain streets and roads. Fifthly, we must encourage our public to travel by motor car up to a certain point, where they can make use of public transport, instead of travelling right into the city by motor car. But then we must ensure that there are decent parking facilities at those outlying changeover points. Therefore we must consider constructing parking parkades at our suburban stations and at our bus termini rather than in the centre of town. Lastly I want to put this idea forward for consideration. In the large, distant outskirts of our cities, where the people have greater reason to travel into the city by motor car, satisfactory bus services must be instituted. The local authorities must meet their obligations more effectively in respect of the provision of transport for the inhabitants. They must institute regular, smaller bus services on the outskirts, and the function of these services must be to take people to the public transport points. These services can never be instituted on an economic basis, but the city councils must not be concerned with what they can make out of these kinds of services and whether they can be instituted economically. No, they must regard it as an obligation towards their local inhabitants and towards the greater city complex, to relieve the general transport problem.</p>

<p>I think my time has now expired. I want to conclude by saying that everything the hon. member mentioned in his motion is not unacceptable; in fact, we on this side are not at all unsympathetic towards this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Parow commenced to deal with this motion in an objective and, I thought, constructive way, but then turned aside to make suggestions that three of the country&#x2019;s cities had neglected to do the necessary planning and had not fulfilled their responsibilities in regard to the matter now under discussion. I do not want to follow on that line, but I should like him to know that Pretoria is also a city faced with this great problem. It has a scheme for road development which it is estimated will cost some R70 million, and that city, I take it, is not controlled by what the hon. member calls a &#x201C;Sap&#x201D; council. Yet they are only now thinking about road planning. I mention that merely in passing the show how childish the hon. member was when he tried to make some local authority propaganda out of this motion.</p>

<p>The trouble which I see, is this. The local authorities of the old established cities cannot possibly out of their own resources modernize their road systems. In a report which I saw recently the Department of Transport estimated the construction cost of a through road in one of our major cities to be on an average R5 million per mile. That includes the cost of expropriation and construction.</p>

<p>And more.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says &#x201C;and more&#x201D;. If that is so, how can the local authority of an old established city meet those costs out of its own ratepayers&#x2019; pockets? I will come back to this aspect a little later.</p>

<p>At this stage I want to develop the theme which the hon. member for Parow commenced to discuss, and that is the necessity for coordination of transport facilities, co-ordination which is becoming more and more necessary. It is as well that we should remind ourselves that in 1948 when the National Transport Commission was established in terms of the Transport Co-ordination Act, that commission was charged with taking over the responsibilities of the National Road Board, which had been established in 1935, of the Central Road Transportation Board, which had been established in 1930, and also to take over the responsibilities of the Civil Aviation Council. That was planned in 1948. One must look to see whether that commission has in fact achieved the co-ordination which is necessary. I venture to suggest that because of the rapid development in this country of ours, including the rapid development in the field of transport, the commission is faced with a well-nigh impossible task as it is now established. It not only has to take over the control of national roads and road-building of all types, but it also has to control motor carrier transportation, and it also has the added responsibility of controlling civil aviation to a great extent. I want to suggest it is quite impossible for one commission to deal with all these various forms of transport and at the same time to plan the actual co-ordination. My view is the time is now ripe that apart from a co-ordinating body, there should be small bodies of experts to deal with the actual control of those various sections of transport, in a coordinated manner. The hon. member was correct when he said that it was in the 1948 Act that the purpose of the commission should be the achievement of the maximum benefit and economy of transport services to the public. This is a matter which I believe deserves consideration and investigation. The purpose of the motion moved by the hon. member for Durban (Point) is to look at the entire field of transport. I want to emphasize that, to look at the field of transport purely in regard to road and air transport, is not enough. This commission should look into the matter and include Railway transport, which is not now in the hands of the National Transport Commission. I believe that, if there is to be proper co-ordination and if the maximum benefit to the country is to be derived from the investigation, Railway transport must be co-ordinated into and under the same umbrella that covers co-ordination of road transport, air transport, water transport, pipeline transport and any other type of transport which might be visualized. I believe that this board should be empowered and obliged to reconcile the conflicting interests among the various forms of transport and to eliminate the waste caused by unhealthy competition between the different forms. The experts in the field of road planning, road construction, aviation, shipping and Railway services should be charged with the implementation of the overall co-ordinated planning.</p>

<p>So far as roads are concerned, the National Transport Commission to-day does not accept complete overall responsibility. We should remember that we have roads in different categories. We have the national roads, provincial roads, main roads and urban roads. But the co-ordination as well as the efficient and economic financing of these roads as a whole, as a composite picture, does, I believe, need to be looked into. I believe that urban through-ways or ringroads must be co-ordinated with national road access to any city. Perhaps the hon. the Minister in his reply will be able to tell us, as I understand it, that although there is a withdrawal of certain financial assistance so far as urban roads are concerned, the National Transport Commission is still to accept responsibility for subsidizing the construction of ring-roads and certain of the bypass through-roads or through-ways, as they are referred to. I think that those apply in various large cities. In 1962 it was realized that this co-ordination should take place. Mr. Speaker, you will recall that it was then that the power was given to the National Transport Commission to subsidize urban roadways.</p>

<p>I want to say just a word in regard to the position as it applies in so far as the cities are concerned. The advantage, for instance, in <span class="col_1867-1868" refersTo="page_0956"/>Cape Town of the excellent national road access to the city, and those which are in the course of improvement and development, will be completely lost to Cape Town if they are, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) has said, to be in effect ten-inch pipes leading a flow into a city, which is going to be drained off in two-inch pipes. I believe that one already sees the effect resulting from the non-completion of certain aspects of Cape Town&#x2019;s roads, namely the damming up of the traffic stream into the city at peak hours. That will become worse and worse, unless the city itself is able to proceed with the completion of the planned complex of roads. We in Cape Town are, as I have said, fortunate as regards the planning and the work which has been done over the years by the Municipality and the provincial engineers, and which was expedited, I must say, to a great extent by the construction of the Foreshore system and the planning that was necessary, including the linking up of road planning. Certain of these plans are still to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>But where is the finance to be found? I want to say that the private road users, namely road users other than the Railway Administration, have contributed considerable sums to the Consolidated Revenue Fund by way of customs and excise payments. The pattern has been consistent over the years, but I may just refer to the most recent one. The figures for the financial year 1967-&#x2019;68 are most enlightening. The facts are that the Treasury received in respect of motor vehicles, motor parts, tyres, accessories, petrol and diesel fuel by way of customs duties R28,342,042, and by way of excise duty R116,629,395. That is a total of just on R145 million. This excludes the amount received from licence fees or any portion of the R15 million already made according to estimates by the Railways Administration on the pipeline for the first nine months of this year. How much of this R145 million have been used on roads? The figure is quite startling. I want to say that it is as parsimonious as it is startling, when one realizes that out of that contribution made by the motorist, whether for business or private purposes, out of the R145 million, less than R45 million was made available for road construction. The Government received into the Consolidated Revenue Fund a handsome profit out of the motorists to the extent of R100 million. I know this matter has been raised before, and we are referred to the subsidies and the grants to the provincial councils, the general grants and subsidies that are paid to them. But that is not an explanation and certainly not an explanation which covers this colossal difference between the amount contributed by the motorists and the amount which is actually made available for road construction. Now the city dwellers apparently have to pay for all the roads in the city. The city dweller, the man who owns property, whether he is a motorist or not, is now apparently to pay the total cost of urban roadways. The rates which are necessary to provide those urban roadways, must now be raised in respect of property owners in the towns and the cities.</p>

<p>As far as the rural population is concerned, there is certainly no chance of them expecting any reduction in so far as Divisional Council taxation is necessary for financing road construction. One wonders why this is necessary, because the motorist, the car user and the lorry user are paying more than enough to provide adequately for the cost of road construction. So I believe that if there is ever a reason which justifies the motion of the hon. member for Durban (Point), quite apart from those which he has mentioned and were underlined by the member for Parow, it is the lack of co-ordination and of proper use of the funds available for road construction for the purposes of road construction.</p>

<p>It is a matter which has to be investigated because if we are to have adequate transport facilities and the efficiency which is required, that efficiency and that adequacy cannot be achieved unless there is an adequate road network. Adequate urban roadways are as much a national responsibility as they are the responsibility of the local authorities.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, both the mover of this motion and his supporter were somewhat disappointing in certain respects. Personally, I expected that the nature and particularly the motivation of the arguments to be advanced would have been more comprehensive as well as more convincing than they really were. I must honestly say that I found the arguments advanced by the mover of the motion fairly limited and shallow. When one has an experience such as this, one usually asks oneself what the motivation behind the motion really was. A few arguments arose both from his personal attitude and that of his supporters which I should very much like to investigate closer. The first argument concerns the question of the statement of fact that in our large cities the passenger transport services to as well as inside the cities are hopelessly inadequate to-day, a statement with which I, personally, cannot quite agree. In the second place, the argument was advanced that the co-ordination between public and local transport as represented by the Railways, the National Transport Commission and the local authorities, was poor, something with which I, personally, cannot quite agree either. In the third place, it was stated that consideration should be given to bringing about better cooperation and control as regards the financing of this complex project concerning the transport machinery, particularly as far as it may have a bearing on our major cities.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, by way of introduction, I cannot refrain from adopting the attitude and <span class="col_1869-1870" refersTo="page_0957"/>stating that, in my opinion, the motion before the House, which was introduced by the hon. member for Durban (Point), once more produces clear testimony of not being well-considered, as I have already said, and the misplaced standpoints which are typical of representatives on that side of the House. This motion suffers from a lack of content because the arguments and the facts advanced as proof thereof, were represented in a disjointed manner and were deliberately linked with political motives, as I shall show presently. Furthermore, they are misplaced because all knowledgeable members of this House know only too well that three different commissions have already been appointed to inquire into the matters raised by the mover of this motion. They are aware of this and for that reason I want to ask what the motive is. This matter is actually <i>sub judice</i> and we shall have to wait until we receive the decisions and considerations of the Government as regards those reports of the various commissions. The first commission was the Borckenhagen Commission of 1956, then we had the Schumann Commission in 1960 and the Marais Commission in 1965. The report of the most recent commission is not available yet, but it will be considered by the Government soon. If only the mover of the motion took the trouble to find out what the terms of reference of those three different commissions were, he would have decided straight away that his motion was irrelevant. The underlying motive of ambition&#x2014;let me make this clear to the hon. member for Durban (Point)&#x2014;namely his aim to become the deputy leader in Natal, stands out quite clearly in the framework of his entire address, and I doubt whether the father to the thought will achieve this time what he is seeking.</p>

<p>For the consideration of the mover of this motion and his supporters, I want to ask whether it is not the duty of the mover and of his supporters to act positively in the communities of which they are the leaders and whether they should not tell their supporters that they also have a responsibility and a duty towards the local community as well as towards the State in the wider sense of the word. Instead of doing this, their attitude is to try and find as many obstacles to place in the way of the Central Government. I just want to say how utterly regrettable this unfortunate anomaly is. The same will be said by any member of the United Party who has an objective approach if he means it well with his local community and his fatherland.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us have a closer look at the picture which is at issue here. The statement was specifically made here by way of implication that the Railways and the National Transport Commission were not in a position to provide, or are, indeed, not providing in the needs in that they were unable to provide the necessary transport facilities. During the financial year 1967-&#x2019;68 altogether far more than 446 million suburban passengers were transported by the South African Railways. From the reports we deduce that the number of first- and second-class passengers on suburban train services decreased, and we deduce further that these services were not used to their full extent. However, the number of third-class passengers increased by more than 17 million. The fact that fewer trains ran during the year under review is mainly attributable to the strict control exercised by the Head Office in respect of special mainline trains as well as the curtailment of the suburban train services during week-ends as a measure of economy. The position is not anything approaching a surplus or a congestion as far as transport is concerned. We read of measures of economy and improved control with a view to economizing, in other words, not anything approaching maximum utilization. Mr. Speaker, we read further that in the Estimates for the current year provision is being made for an amount of almost R13 million in respect of suburban electric passenger coaches alone. This is proof of adjustment and co-ordination and of being well-informed of the needs of the time and the services which are expected of a public undertaking such as the Railways. In addition, the following subsidies were paid by the Department of Bantu Administration in the under-mentioned urban areas in the interests of the resettlement of Bantu: Johannesburg, R5 million; Durban, R2 million; Cape Town, R3 million and Pretoria, R2 million. This is proof of a realization, an obligation and a willingness to accept responsibility in connection with this essential service, in the first place in the interests of commerce and industry but, in the last instance, in the interests of the urban areas which are concerned here.</p>

<p>But on whose behalf are you replying now, Hans?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schoeman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>On your behalf. The hon. member for Durban (Point) alleged that the service was inadequate, and I am furnishing proof that what was at issue, was not the statement made in his motion, but other motives, motives which I have already referred to.</p>

<p>In addition, during the past year the National Transport Commission paid subsidies to the same areas, the cities which are, unfortunately, suffering, and those subsidies were also paid in the interests of commerce and industry and the private sector. An amount of R654,000 was paid to Johannesburg; to Durban, R590.000; to Cape Town, R9,000; to Pretoria, R146,000 and to Germiston, R167,000. I take it that this is further proof of the indifference and the lack of coordination between the National Transport Commission and the Railways as regards the necessity for these services, as was alleged by the mover of the motion.</p>

<p>I now come to the example of the realization of responsibility on the part of these cities themselves. Where do they stand in this struggle as against these proofs furnished by <span class="col_1871-1872" refersTo="page_0958"/>the State? Last year the public transport services in Durban incurred a loss of R620,000; Johannesburg suffered a loss of R1,260,000; East London, R220,000 and Pietermaritzburg, R138,000. This is proof of their responsibility towards the ratepayers, and may I make an exception in this connection in the case of the local authority of Cape Town, which did not suffer any loss, but which displayed the management initiative, the keyword to success, and left transport to private initiative as a result of which a net income of R76,000 in respect of commission was paid into its coffers. The hon. member for Durban (Point) will do well to use this small broom he used to-day to sweep in front of the doors of the National Transport Commission and the Central Government, to sweep in front of the doors of the local authorities of Johannesburg and Durban. It is time that they should realize what their duties and responsibilities are and that they are also called upon to display the management initiative and the originality and to contribute towards the solution of this problem.</p>

<p>I go further. I just want to touch briefly on the question of free-ways of which we have heard so much. It has already become evident that the National Transport Commission is under no obligation to contribute towards the construction of urban free-ways, and it is laid down by law that the National Transport Commission may, in its discretion, defray all or part of the cost of such roads from the Road Fund&#x2014;there is no misunderstanding in this connection. Why are some people so keen to demand more than that? All of us are well conversant with the origin of urban free-ways, and for this reason I do not want to deal with the matter in detail. However, it seems to me that, in spite of serious warnings issued in connection with the excessively high cost of urban freeway schemes, local authorities have nevertheless initiated such schemes which caused them to land into financial difficulties in respect of which we had to listen to a great deal of misplaced excuses. As a result of the great deal of pressure that was brought to bear upon the Commission, it was compelled several years ago to start contributing towards a portion of the cost of urban freeways and the Commission undertook to make available from the Road Fund the under-mentioned amounts for this purpose for a period of time: Durban, R10 million; Port Elizabeth, R5 million; Johannesburg, R15 million; Pretoria, R10 million and Cape Town, R11 million. I know that the estimated cost was far more than these amounts. To quote round figures, the estimated cost in respect of Durban was R25 million; Port Elizabeth, R14 million and Johannesburg, R42 million, but as far as Cape Town is concerned, it should be pointed out that no comprehensive scheme was submitted initially and that various projects were subsidized separately. The Commission contributed an amount of approximately R2.5 million towards these projects. The estimated cost of the comprehensive scheme which was approved recently, amounted to approximately R22 million and the Commission undertook to contribute an amount of R8.5 million, resulting in a total contribution of R11 million. This is proof of goodwill and of willingness to make a contribution and to be helpful, but what is the response on the part of the local authorities? Did they say, &#x201C;Thank you for your contribution; we are prepared to do this, that and the other&#x201D;? No, they demand as much as they can and, furthermore, they place as many obstacles as possible in the way as regards settlement of their claims. This is the new slogan of the super-South African <i>alias</i> the United Party members. With the exception of Cape Town, therefore, all the local authorities concerned are now insisting that the approved subsidies be increased, and it is time that we were given an indication as to what the attitude of the authorities in this connection is, and this indication was given by the hon. the Minister last year at the opening of the road named after him.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is known that, according to information, the Provincial Administrations concerned made the following contributions towards these schemes: Johannesburg, 40 per cent of the contribution of the National Transport Commission, by the Transvaal Provincial Administration, which means R6 million; Durban, R2.5 million, or 25 per cent. It should be noted that this is less than any of the others; Pretoria, 40 per cent, or R4 million of the Commission&#x2019;s contribution, and Cape Town, 80 per cent of the cost of the scheme.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the increased estimated cost of the freeways schemes and bearing in mind the recent estimate provided by Professor Verburgh of the University of Stellenbosch, namely that an amount of R2,000 million will be needed during the next 20 years for the construction of roads in urban areas, it can hardly be described as anything but a bottomless well.</p>

<p>I want to conclude. Unfortunately I could not deal with all the points I should have liked to deal with. I want to refer to one other matter, namely the bypasses outside cities and towns. Although it was decided not to make available any increased subsidies for the construction of urban bypass schemes and to have nothing more to do with such schemes, it cannot, however, be suggested that the Commission is adopting an attitude of indifference towards the cities. This is my response towards that of the hon. member for Green Point a moment ago. I can only say that its ultimate aim is to relieve the traffic problem in the major cities and towns, and a total amount of R122 million was provided by the National Transport Commission for this purpose. Therefore, there is definitely not a lack of coordination. There is definitely not a lack of willingness to make a contribution. Something that does exist, is a lack of positive response on the side of some local authorities and particularly an unwillingness on their part to accept responsibility themselves together <span class="col_1873-1874" refersTo="page_0959"/>with the provinces and the Central Government, and I think that if the United Party and the mover of this motion have any duty, it will be the duty to inform their local authorities in this connection and to give positive guidance. When that happens we shall all find that this problem of ours is not as formidable and unsurmountable as was tried to make out in the House this afternoon.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) has put a very constructive motion before this House. I have listened to two speakers from that side of the House and I must be perfectly honest and say that I have never heard two more destructive speeches. The hon. member for Parow does not want to do anything at all. He is against monorails and he is against underground railways. In fact, he is against everything, and I think he would like to go back to the old ox-wagon days. Then we find my old colleague, the hon. member for Randburg, getting up and getting very upset at the fact that somebody dared to mention that the Railways were not providing an efficient service for the urban Bantu in South Africa. This really surprises me, because surely the hon. member must know that for some Bantu workers to get to their work in Johannesburg from Soweto, they have to get up at 4 a.m. in order to be at work at 8 a.m. Surely he knows, too, that the railway services are running a train every 2&#x00BD; minutes during the peak time between Soweto and Johannesburg, and that this service has been proved to be entirely unsatisfactory, so much so that a very profitable Native pirate taxi service is operating between these two areas. I admit frankly that the Railways are doing their best to cope with a very difficult situation, but hon. members should not come along here and make statements in this regard that cannot be proved. Then the hon. member for Randburg seems to take a great deal of delight in showing that the internal transport services in Johannesburg are suffering a loss of more than R1 million, he mentions, too, in the same breath that the only transport undertaking showing a profit is the one in Cape Town, but of course he forgets to mention, very conveniently, that this is the only transport service that has not had to apply the Government policy of apartheid. Before we hear interjections from that side, let me tell him that a large part of Johannesburg&#x2019;s loss can be ascribed to the fact that they have been applying the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid faithfully. I will not spend very much more time on the hon. member for Randburg, because I am disappointed in him. He is an old colleague of mine, but I really feel that he made no contribution at all to this debate.</p>

<p>I prefer to regard the motion before the House as a timely and well-reasoned plea to the Government to recognize the urgency of finding ways and means of providing local authorities with funds so that they can provide the services needed for the people living in their cities. I would have thought that because of the vital role that mass transportation plays in the economy of the country to-day, this motion would have received the wholehearted support of both sides of the House. There can be no doubt that because of the unprecedented growth of the larger cities of South Africa over the past 20 years, the problem of providing adequate road systems and mass transport services from the revenue sources currently available to local authorities has assumed really alarming proportions and unless the Government can be prevailed upon to act very quickly and energetically in this matter, urban transport in South Africa is heading for certain chaos.</p>

<p>It would seem too that the long-awaited findings of the Borckenhagen and Schumann commissions of inquiry, which are expected to recommend forms of financial assistance from the Central Government to the local and provincial authorities, will not have any effect on the 1969-&#x2019;70 Budget. We see, therefore, that no immediate relief can be expected from this particular source. It is very difficult to understand, having in mind the urgent nature of the problem facing local authorities, how the Government has been able to sit on these reports for more than a year, especially when we know that it has taken the commissions concerned more than ten years to complete their work. Sir, although the provision of adequate road and transport systems is a national problem to-day and effects every major city in South Africa, I feel that the position of Johannesburg is particularly disturbing. I want to raise this matter specifically, and I do not do this in any spirit of provincialism. It is becoming clearer by the day that Johannesburg&#x2019;s 90,000 ratepavers cannot be expected to foot the back-breaking financial bill tied to the provision of adequate road and transport services indefinitely. Sir, to give you one example, figures show that the number of motor vehicles registered in the City of Johannesburg is increasing at the rate of 15,000 a year, and it is obvious that unless other sources of revenue become available to the council to keep pace with essential road development, a position of chaos must eventually result. Just like any other large city in South Africa, Johannesburg finds itself in a very invidious position. It knows what is needed. It has the planners who have planned ahead accordingly, but it now finds that it has to curtail essential development because of the lack of the necessary funds. What makes the position even more disturbing is that there is a feeling in Johannesburg&#x2014;I think a justifiable feeling&#x2014;that they are not receiving fair treatment in regard to finance from the province or the Central Government. They point out, for instance, that of the enormous income from motor-car licences, Johannesburg is allowed to keep only 16 per cent while the rest goes to the provincial authority. Surely, this income should be used by Johannesburg to finance its very, very urgent road and transport services. Sir, can any local authority be placed in a more difficult position in regard to its urban freeway programme <span class="col_1875-1876" refersTo="page_0960"/>than the City of Johannesburg? When the council decided about five years ago to embark on its freeway scheme, it did the correct thing; it discussed the matter very, very fully with the National Transport Commission and with the Transvaal Provincial authority. Both these bodies agreed with the council that a system of freeways was essential, not only as a solution to the city&#x2019;s internal transport problem but also as through-ways serving travellers wanting to pass through Johannesburg from other parts of the country to their points of destination. One must assume that the Transport Commission and the provincial authority accepted the position that the building of these freeways should not be the responsibility of the Johannesburg City Council only, because we find that they in fact agreed to contribute R15 million and R6 million, respectively, towards the then estimated cost of R45 million. An agreement was drawn up between the three bodies, and although the agreement contained a protective clause indemnifying the commission and the province against having to provide any further funds for this scheme, there was an agreement between the parties that the door would be left open for further discussions should the need arise. The Johannesburg City Council now finds itself in the very difficult position that having embarked on the scheme which is in the national as well as in the local interests, they have to find an extra R18 million, which is the difference between the original estimate and the R63 million which the scheme will now cost. Let me say immediately that the increase in the cost cannot be placed at the door of the Johannesburg City Council. It has come about because of lengthy arbitration proceedings, and we all know that the longer you wait, the more the costs go up. We find now that the Council again does the correct thing; it approaches the province and the commission and asks, I think very fairly, that they should contribute a further amount in proportion to their first allocation, and what do we find? The request is not only turned down but the Transport Commission makes the surprising statement that in their opinion freeways are no longer necessary and that they would not help to solve Johannesburg&#x2019;s transport problems. What a complete change of attitude, Sir. Under these circumstances can one blame Johannesburg for feeling that they have been treated very unfairly? It is a pity too that the Government itself remains adamant in its decision not to make money available from the National Road fund for the building of freeways, because this fund now has an accumulated surplus of R40 million standing to its credit. I believe some of this money should be used to assist local authorities to finance their very essential road building services. Sir, there can be no doubt that the crux of the matter to-day is that there is a degree of urgency. If the Government wants to assist local authorities to avoid chaotic road and transport conditions in the larger cities of South Africa, they will have to come out and help, and it is no good hon. members on that side saying that the responsibility for internal urban transport and roads must lie with the city council. We know that there is a limit to the amount of taxation that you can levy on ratepayers, and I honestly feel that the Government and the Minister in particular should give very serious consideration to the motion placed before the House by the hon. member for Durban (Point). I believe it is a very constructive motion and I have the greatest pleasure in associating myself with it.</p>

<p>His whole speech is nothing but a plea for Johannesburg. Sir, I want to put this question to the hon. member: When he was a Johannesburg city councillor and when, in 1961, Mr. Sporie van Rensburg introduced in the Johannesburg City Council a motion in which he requested that this monorail system and other systems be investigated with a view to coping with the future traffic problem in Johannesburg, why did that City Council not grant assistance at the time by starting such an investigation? Why did they have to wait five years, up to the present, before introducing a motion here in which they are asking for the same investigation for which that Nationalist asked in 1961? Surely, in that case the hon. member failed to meet his responsibilities as city councillor when at that time an objective proposal was introduced, i.e. that the Johannesburg traffic problems be investigated.</p>

<p>No, in 1966 Mr. Oberholzer once again introduced a motion in which he asked for an enquiry, a request which had been rejected by the City Council in 1961. But enough of that; I shall come back later on to a few of the statements the hon. member made. In the first place, I want to say that I have no quarrel with the hon. member for Durban (Point) in as far as he deplores the inadequacy of our traffic facilities in certain cities; he is correct. In addition, I am glad that he did not try to lay the blame for that inadequacy at the door of the Government. However, some of his colleagues immediately pointed a finger at the Nationalist Government, the National Transport Commission and the Railways. I shall come to that accusation later on. The hon. member made, in the first instance, a certain statement here in order to prove how inadequate the traffic services are supposed to be. I do not want to make political capital out of this motion of <span class="col_1877-1878" refersTo="page_0961"/>the hon. member. I do not want to do what was done the other day when the hon. member for Middelburg introduced a motion here and when his motion eventually became nothing but a political football. One could make a great deal of political capital out of this; for instance, one could ask who the persons are who govern those cities where these problems exist, but what would one gain by levelling these accusations? Therefore I do not wish to drag politics into this matter. If politics have to be dragged into this matter, the United Party would find it easier to do so because they have a great deal of influence with some of these city councils, so much influence, for instance, that they tell Ismay that he is not good enough for the City Council and that he has to make way. But enough of that, Mr. Speaker. That would not solve anything.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked, firstly, for a commission of enquiry. But, surely, an exhaustive enquiry has been ordered. It is necessary for this House to take cognizance of the terms of reference of the Marais Commission. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) levelled the accusation here that the reports of the Borckenhagen and Schumann Commissions had been tabled a long time ago and that the Government was taking its time about them. But it was as a result of the reports of the Borckenhagen and Schumann Commissions and the anomalies they pointed out, that the Government considered the matter to be so important that it appointed the Marais Commission. What were the terms of reference of the Marais Commission? I just want to read out to you, Sir, that part which is relevant here (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To enquire into and report upon&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(i) the role to be played by the various forms of transport, such as rail, road, air, pipeline and shipping, in the Republic of South Africa and the territory of South-West Africa so as to promote the development of the national economy in the most effective manner.</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, the terms of reference are so wide that an exhaustive investigation may also be made into all aspects of the matter, including industrial development in the cities and all other forms of development, with a view to finding the most effective solution. These are the terms of reference of the Marais Commission.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>My motion is confined to the cities only; those terms of reference are much wider.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This urban economy forms part of the national economy. Our cities, our rural areas and our provinces do not develop separately from one another. The country develops as a whole and the cities are vital components in the development of the whole of South Africa, and because urban development forms part of development as a whole and because there is more and more industrial and economic development in and around the urban areas, the cities are very definitely included in this enquiry. Therefore I believe that the Marais Commission would have concentrated on this matter and will submit a report in this regard. Then I come to the second part of the Commission&#x2019;s terms of reference&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(ii) the nature of the control measures and the administrative machinery which will be necessary for ensuring that the role assigned to each form of transport in terms of paragraph (i), will be played in the most effective manner, be it separately or by way of co-ordinating with one or more of the other forms of transport.</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, this commission of enquiry functions in a much more exhaustive manner and can submit a much wider report than would the commission requested here by the hon. member for Durban (Point). I think I can soothe his conscience with this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot go into this in detail.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Why is it not possible for you to go into this matter in detail? If a commission has to report on the co-ordination of all forms of transport, the latter would include those forms of transport which convey people, etc., from outside the cities into the cities themselves, as well as the distribution thereof; therefore it includes the co-ordination and integration of all forms of transport. It is not a separate organization. A moment ago the hon. member for Green Point said that he wants an overall co-ordinating body in this regard in order that we may have a &#x201C;bird&#x2019;s eye view&#x201D; of the traffic system. After all, that is what this enquiry affords us, but the person who proposed this enquiry is no longer satisfied with his own proposal. That is why I say that the Government is aware of the dilemma in which the local authorities find themselves. It is aware of the financial inability of the local authorities and the administrations to do the necessary financing. Just as was done by the Borckenhagen and Schumann Commissions, this Marais Commission is enquiring into the financial implications of the financing of local authorities, etc. This commission is and has always been aware of these traffic problems. What is the factual position? The factual position is that the South African Railways are responsible for conveying the passengers from the suburbs to a central point in the urban area. By furnishing figures the hon. members for Parow and Randburg very clearly proved what the Railways were prepared to spend on that. In regard to this matter they also furnished the number of passengers conveyed by the Railways. Therefore I do not <span class="col_1879-1880" refersTo="page_0962"/>want to take up the time of the House by repeating these things, because I think these two hon. members made carefully prepared speeches in order to put those facts right. I want to add&#x2014;and I do not want to repeat the figures the hon. member for Randburg mentioned in this regard&#x2014;that the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) said that transport facilities for the Bantu of Soweto were inadequate. And yet he said that there was a train every 2&#x00BD; minutes. The State is already granting&#x2014;and I am not referring to train traffic, peri-urban traffic and the traffic on national roads&#x2014;a subsidy to local authorities in respect of Bantu transport. I just want to mention to you, Sir, the case of Johannesburg, Pretoria, Germiston, Edenvale, Boksburg, Durban and Pinetown. In the year 1966-&#x2019;67 the utility companies of these cities received a subsidy of more than R1,804,000 to meet their expenses.</p>

<p>I mention these things in order to point out that the local ratepayers, as the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) put it here, are not responsible for this, nor are they being asked to fend for themselves and meet the costs themselves. The Government contributes a great deal in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not what is being paid by the employer. This is the subsidy granted by the Treasury.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that the hon. member for Parow made a very interesting proposal when he said that it was our duty to lay out peri-urban parking areas for the people of the suburbs so that they need not bring their cars into the city. The South African Railways tried this in the past by providing good parking facilities at suburban stations in an attempt to encourage people to leave their cars there and then to convey them to the central urban areas by train.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Many people make use of those facilities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, very few people make use of them. So few people made use of them that we have had to stop providing these facilities. The love of ease and snobbishness on the part of members of the public who drive to work in the mornings each in his own car, are such decisive factors that we fail to have regard to this bottleneck which we cause as a result. The Railways has been making use of this plan for a long time; in other words, the task of the Railways is to convey the passengers to the central area. After that it is the task of the local authorities to convey them further. I think that South Africa and this House cannot deny that up to the present the Railways has been performing its task in this regard very thoroughly, as was stated here by the hon. members for Randburg and Parow.</p>

<p>This problem is something of which several people are aware. The hon. member for Parow quoted from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> to show that Johannesburg had already investigated this matter. I do not want to repeat that. He also mentioned that the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> published another article, after this enquiry in Johannesburg, in which it was said that the Japanese railways were not good enough. However, that was not all. I want to point out to you, Sir, that we ourselves, the South African Railways and the hon. the Minister, have investigated this matter time and again. I want to mention a few examples. In 1963 an investigation was made into what the hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned as the second leg of his speech, i.e. the sky railway or monorail. I just want to read out to you, Sir, a few findings from the report of an engineering commission which investigated this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If all circumstances are considered the cost of &#x201C;Pneuways&#x201D; permanent way can be considerably higher than the conventional rail track, particularly if it is elevated above the ground level.</block>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should also be kept in mind that this type of railway has been a subject of experimentation for nearly a century and it is significant that no material application has been made up to the present.</block>

<p>If you turn back the pages of history, Sir, you would see that this type of transport has formed the subject of investigations since 1884. The rest of the world has never regarded it as an economic, paying and effective means of transport. I know that such a transport service was introduced on the occasion of the Olympic Games. However, it was only for conveying people to and fro over short distances. The conclusion this engineering commission arrived at in their investigation was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Taking all the relevant facts into consideration, it cannot be recommended that the provision of &#x201C;Pneuway&#x201D; transport be entertained.</block>

<p><span class="col_1881-1882" refersTo="page_0963"/>This is also applicable to Umlazi Township in Durban. They go on to mention the reasons why this would not be successful, in other words, this problem has already been investigated. I want to mention another example taken from a report on an investigation made into the same aspect in March, 1965&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Briefly the position is that no justification has been found for departing from the conventional rail transport system, the efficiency of which as a relatively cheap and rapid form of transport for the conveyance of large numbers of passengers has been proved over many years.</block>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>You are now referring to new development where no problems are experienced in regard to expropriation. I am referring to the cities themselves.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This enquiry covered an urban area as well as a new development area, and it was found that &#x201C;taking all factors into consideration and bearing in mind also that the overhead system despite experimentation over a period of more than a century&#x201D;, it is simply not acceptable to the world as an economic, proper system of transport. The hon. member for Parow also referred exhaustively to the underground railway system, the alarmingly expensive system. Now I want to say this. If there are cities which want to introduce an underground railway system which can be integrated with our railway system, then that is a matter for the local authorities concerned. Having investigated the matter and considered the possibilities, the local authority must study the financial implications, and then it must determine to what extent it may make application to the State for the necessary subsidization, via the provincial administrations. But it is not the task of the S.A.R. or of the Government to force any city in South Africa to introduce an underground railway system or a local system of transport.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite tried to make out a case that our subsidization was allegedly inadequate. The hon. member for Green Point did that and the hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned it in his motion and touched upon it briefly. Let us look at the various types of subsidization which we are undertaking. As regards urban freeways, the National Transport Commission has the power in terms of section 10<i>ter</i> of the National Roads Act of 1935, to finance and to subsidize, in part, freeways in urban areas, but then the Commission must also ascertain whether this would really solve the problem or whether this would not aggravate the problems of that urban area. I think what the legislature had in mind when the National Transport Commission was established, was that this Commission would be responsible for the construction of roads, in the first place, to take traffic from one point to another. The Commission is not responsible for financing and looking after the road-building programmes of the local authorities and the provincial administrations. Our Constitution makes provision for delegated powers and duties and responsibilities&#x2014;and responsibilities go hand in hand with these powers&#x2014;to be transferred to provincial councils, divisional councils or to other local authorities. As a result of pressure which was brought to bear upon it in the past, the Commission assisted in this financing, as was stated very clearly by the hon. member for Randburg. In a moment I shall say more about the figures he mentioned. An investigation was made and we arrived at the conclusion that the major national roads and freeways in our cities did not solve these urban problems. What do these roads do in actual fact? They bring traffic from outside the cities to the city itself, traffic which does not belong in the city or which did not want to go to the city. Consequently the Government has decided that we shall not carry on with this financing. For the purpose of the record we must put this matter right, for a wrong statement was made here. The Government has already granted R50 million towards the subsidization of these freeways. In addition to that it is spending an amount of R122 million. As the hon. member for Randburg explained, R172 million has been made available in respect of these urban freeways. I think it was the hon. member for Durban (Point) who complained because there had been a delay in the subsidization, because the National Transport Commission criticized the planning, etc.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, this is the reason that was furnished on the opposite side. I want to say at once that the subsidies granted by the Transport Commission, were granted immediately after the local governments had submitted their road plans and after they had been approved. Certain representations were made in this regard. Certain cities were not interested at all and now, after the event, they want to come forward with new plans and they want assistance, something which of course we cannot consider. In other words, the Transport Commission was never responsible for any delay. Any delays that have occurred, are attributable to unsatisfactory plans, unacceptable plans, and failure, on the part of the bodies which made application, to submit acceptable plans in good time and to conclude the matter. A few days ago the hon. member for Middelburg called attention to this problem of delays. He mentioned the dilemma which resulted because negotiations <span class="col_1883-1884" refersTo="page_0964"/>had to take place between the urban area, the provincial administration and the Government. When he mentioned that, he was accused of talking politics and advocating that the powers of the provinces and the cities be removed. Surely, hon. members opposite cannot say one thing, and to-day, a few days later, want to state the opposite here. Let us see how the financing was done. [Interjections.] According to Press reports, Harry Lewis really took the hon. member to task at Milnerton the other night.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Randburg told us what amounts had, in the first instance, been made available to Durban, Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Cape Town. Let me make this very clear. When these amounts were made available, the estimated cost was as follows: Durban&#x2019;s approved schemes would have amounted to R25 million, that of Port Elizabeth to R14,164,000 and that of Johannesburg to R42,416,000. At that stage Pretoria had not yet submitted any schemes. According to subsequent reports the hon. the Minister had said, &#x201C;Up to now I have granted assistance. The assistance I have already granted, I shall grant right up to the end, but no new amounts will be appropriated.&#x201D; Then we found that the road which had been planned for R25 million would now cost R58 million. This is the road in Durban. The cost of the Port Elizabeth scheme is now R20,023,000; that of Johannesburg is now R63,353,000; and at that moment Pretoria&#x2019;s scheme cost R73 million. I mention these amounts to show how these major urban roads in which many fly-overs are used, are becoming astronomically expensive. I say that the solution is to have our traffic outside our cities. The traffic leaving the city should not be channelled into one main road; it should rather leave the city at various points along a ring road. Such a scheme is perhaps the most difficult one for Cape Town, because we have the mountain on one side and the sea on the other, but it was for that very reason that Cape Town planned so far ahead that it has a splendid scheme at present. We realize that we should not channel all our urban traffic into one road, and that is why we are constructing ring roads and by-passes in order that there may be various points of exit for the traffic. In order to alleviate the traffic problems of the larger cities, we have already made available R25 million in respect of Durban&#x2019;s outer ring road, R3&#x00BD;million in respect of Pietermaritzburg, R2,300,000 in respect of Kroonstad, and R10,300,000 in respect of Pretoria&#x2019;s eastern by-pass alone. In addition, an amount of R3,200,000 has also been made available in respect of Standerton&#x2019;s by-pass, whereas an amount of R47 million is available for Johannesburg&#x2019;s ring road. In respect of Bloemfontein the amount is R5,700,000, East London R11,300,000, Port Elizabeth R11 million, and in respect of the Black River Parkway in Cape Town R2,700,000 has been made available. In other words, the National Transport Commission and the Government are trying to divert, in the manner indicated by me, the major flow of traffic which is causing such bottlenecks in our cities. That is why I say that the Government and the State are well and truly meeting their responsibilities in this regard.</p>

<p>The trend throughout the world is that the volume of traffic in the larger cities is beginning to drop as a result of the national freeways which are being constructed in cities. We find that the large chain stores and business concerns are moving outwards, to the suburban areas, because members of the public are realizing that there are better parking facilities out there, that the traffic is not as heavy and that it is easier to do business there. They are moving out of the cities. Consequently the peri-urban areas and the suburbs are going to get these benefits. This is a world trend which we shall have to accept here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Amongst other things greater financial assistance was requested here. We have the Schumann and the Borckenhagen Reports. Those commissions had to enquire into ways in which it would be possible for us to finance the provinces and the local authorities. Since it regards this as being so important, the Government appointed the Marais Commission with the wider terms of reference of investigating this matter further&#x2014;with specific reference to the said two reports&#x2014;and submitting its findings.</p>

<p>I say that in politics our story should always remain the same. Time and again during this session that side has levelled the accusation that, since this Government came into power, the South African taxpayer has found himself under an increasingly greater obligation to pay too much tax. They say that more and more is being taken from and asked of the taxpayer.</p>

<p>The hon. member opposite says yes. Now I want to ask him this question: If the taxpayer does not pay tax, irrespective of how it is collected, how are we to provide national services? They cannot want these two things; they cannot say that we should have fewer taxes and, at the same time, that we should provide services. Hon. members opposite must conduct themselves in a politically honest manner as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point tried to make a point, in the first place, out of our revenue from customs and excise duties as paid by the motorist in South Africa. But, surely, the hon. member knows that in terms of the Act in question we have a levy on petrol which accrues to the National Transport Commission. The Commission has to use that <span class="col_1885-1886" refersTo="page_0965"/>for financing the services it renders to the country. We do not have the surplus the hon. member mentioned. If I furnish the amount of the approved services, hon. members will see that, unless the Government makes more money available to the Transport Commission in a year&#x2019;s time, it would not be able to provide in full the approved and already planned services which it has already announced and accepted. That large surplus does not exist. There is another thing the hon. member for Green Point must realize. The provinces or the urban areas are after all reimbursed by the Government. The provinces are being subsidized on a rand for rand basis for the services they provide; in other words, our provincial and local roads which are built by the provinces, are being subsidized in that manner. The same principle obtains when local authorities receive sums of money from the provinces. I am not going to mention these amounts again, because the hon. member for Randburg has already done so. When local authorities receive their subsidies from the provinces, it is because the Government subsidizes the provinces to that extent.</p>

Hon. members should try to be realistic instead of only demanding more services but fewer taxes. Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat that at the moment it is not necessary for the Government to appoint a commission of enquiry into these four matters.

There is the figure pointed out by the hon. member for Green Point of R145 million a year, which comes in from excise tax and other taxes which are paid directly by the motorist. One might therefore well expect that a greater amount than R45 million a year will be devoted to making the life of the motorist a bit more easy than it is to-day in South Africa. I am in agreement with the hon. the Deputy Minister about the ring-roads and what relief the ring-roads will bring to traffic in urban areas and the decentralization this is going to bring to shopping and the movement of housewives, which to-day forms a very considerable part of the local urban traffic. It will not, however, solve what is by far the greatest traffic problem in every city to-day, namely the movement of people going to work at peak periods morning and evening. It is precisely those people who form the problem that we have to face and it is to meet the needs of those people, people going from where they live to where they work, that the hon. member for Durban (Point) moved this motion in the House. The motion deplores the facilities in our 20th century cities and it is specifically on that point that he asked for an investigation to be made. The movement of people in our big cities at peak periods is held up because the transport facilities are not available and because the roads are inadequate to carry what has become the conventional method of going to work to-day, namely the ordinary private motor car. When mass transport was first inaugurated the first means considered was obviously the railways. The hon. the Deputy Minister and other members who have spoken are quite correct when they say that the railway is the easiest and probably the most efficient means of mass transport, but in our country it is impossible to run railways, particularly the sort of suburban lines with which Cape Town is blessed, in many of the bigger cities of South Africa. What we have got here to-day is what they have got in America and Australia and in all the other countries of what one can call the new Western world outside of Europe, namely a society that is geared to the motor car.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister said that the National Transport Commission have changed their policy and where they supported the idea of urban freeways, they are now opposed to the idea of urban freeways. The fact is that if they do not build the freeways they are still not going to solve the problem. By not building the freeways and not subsidizing the urban authority in building freeways, they are merely making it harder, more difficult, and irritating and longer for the ordinary man to get to work. This is a disguised cost of production, not only in the time it takes a man to get to work and not only in the extra fuel that he uses, but in the irritation to his whole system which prevents him for nearly half an hour after he gets to his office from thinking constructively and making the contribution he should be making to the national economy. I believe that the National Transport Commission, in this particular case, by refusing to continue the subsidization of the urban freeways, have taken a wrong decision. The urban freeway, by providing a a readier means of access to the inner city, will get the man to his work provided that other facilities are co-ordinated, particularly parking, off-street parking and other aspects <span class="col_1887-1888" refersTo="page_0966"/>which are now the responsibility of the urban authority. But, Mr. Speaker, the problem is not the one of the construction of freeways; the problem is one of mobility, of enabling the flow of traffic, to keep it flowing and to be disposed of when it gets into the inner city enabling the man to get to his work. The reason why people use their motor-cars is that they can get to their places of work. That is the reason why the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s rail system and the buses in many instances are not as popular as they might well be.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow raised the matter of peripheral parking, where you can park your car outside the city and catch a bus to go into town. This is not going to take on without some means of selective toll. It may well be that a system of this nature might have to be considered, if a proper investigation shows that a peripheral parking system is indeed the answer to the problem of conveying people from their place of residence to their place of work in the inner city. Then it may be that some sort of selective toll, or something of this nature, might have to be imposed in order to discourage the use of the private motor-car and to encourage people to make use of these other ways and means of transport.</p>

<p>And at the peak hour?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the peak hour can be coped with. The hon. the Minister said that the system of the monorail had been largely discredited and written off throughout the world, but in San Francisco they are erecting the so-called Bay Rapid Transit System which is based on the monorail. The only difference is that it is not an overhead rail, but a vehicle which runs on a cushion of air on a raised concrete ramp. They are spending millions of dollars on it. It is cheaper to build, than the conventional monorail system which is in operation. I believe this is something which can be investigated; I am not particularly wedded to the idea of the monorail myself. I believe that the cheapest and most effective way of getting people from place to place is by means of the tarred or concrete road, and by conventional diesel engines perhaps or by electromotive power&#x2014;whatever may be established must be the best, the most and the cheapest. I believe that it is a matter which merits consideration. The hon. the Minister tells us that the Marais Commission is going to go into the whole overall system of transport. I am afraid, and I say this perhaps incautiously, that this Marais Commission may well take a considerable number of years because of the very complexity of the problem. This hon. Minister says that the Borckenhagen Commission and the Schumann Commission have made their reports on this kind of thing. But it is going to take many years of patient negotiation between the various tiers of authority of this country in order to work out what will be regarded as a satisfactory basis by the three tiers of government&#x2014;as a result of the recommendations of those commissions. Here we have another commission which is going into all these kinds of things, whereas what the hon. member for Durban (Point) asked for is something which is more immediate, because the specific problem of moving people <i>en masse</i> is the problem we have to live with every single day. One of our problems, as the Minister said in relation to the by-passes, is that every single major city in South Africa as a result of our past is the centre of a network of transport. Every major city is a through route to-day, and it&#x2019;s going to cost millions and millions of rand to obviate that and to get the pattern of traffic flowing around the major urban centres. To-day the problem is how to get these people cheaply from place to place. The motion asked that it should be investigated and I think if there is one thing the hon. member for Durban (Point) did wrong it was perhaps by not saying that there should be submitted an early report for consideration by the Minister and consideration of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am interested in the approach of the hon. member for Randburg. The hon. the Minister gave the game away when he said that the hon. member for Randburg and the hon. member for Parow came here with &#x201C;voorbereide toesprake&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>It sounded like &#x201C;voorbereide&#x201D; to me and I must say that was indeed the impression I got from the hon. member for Randburg. [Interjections.] I must say that I feel the people of Randburg, and particularly the ladies, might be far more grateful to the hon. member for Durban (Point) for the practical substance in the motion he has brought here to-day than they would be to the hon. member for Randburg and the Deputy Minister in their approach to their Bantu servants who recently had to be sent home. [Interjections.] I think we have ground here for research to be done, on the question of parking garages, freeways, a rapid transport system and even the possibility of using rubber-tyred trains. It seems to me an old failing of human nature that whereas people will go to park at the station, they will not park at a bus stop. It might be that by means of some articulated vehicle of this nature, we will be able to solve the problem. One cannot help thinking of the efficiency of the Osaka Express in Japan, where the train comes in at the station at a marked place. You buy a ticket at the station with your place marked on it and you stand on the platform while the train pulls in and stops opposite you so that you can step straight into your booked seat. Surely, something like that can be done in our own country to enable <span class="col_1889-1890" refersTo="page_0967"/>us to get ahead of the problem rather than to be behind the problem as we continually are.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of local authorities the hon. member asked for adequate subsidization. The matter has been covered to a certain extent. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree with the statement which has been made, i.e. that problems of urban roads, throughways and this sort of thing are far more than a local problem; it is a national problem which is far beyond the means available to the urban authorities. I think the hon. Deputy Minister will agree with that because he indicated that the National Transport Commission was prepared to go a certain distance towards meeting these particular circumstances.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>There is no doubt about it that the rate funds of the urban authorities to-day are simply inadequate. They cannot cope with the tremendous, ever increasing services. When you consider the city of Durban, where the budget is larger than that of the province of Natal, you will find that even Durban to-day is unable to cope with the demands&#x2014;particularly those imposed by these freeways. Then it must become common cause between us and both sides of this House must agree that this is more than a local problem&#x2014;it is in fact a national problem.</p>

<p>Referring to point No. (3): &#x201C;Other financial assistance to provincial and local authorities,&#x201D; I think the first point one must make is that the provinces themselves to-day are in financial difficulties. Any kind of assistance which is going to be given by the provinces is merely robbing Peter to pay Paul under the present circumstances. In fact, the provinces ought to be the overseers of the local efforts being made by the larger urban authorities in the fields of mass transport and road construction. I think we have to take into account to-day that there are increasingly large numbers of Bantu owned vehicles and Indian owned vehicles coming from the Bantu residential areas into the urban areas, the White urban areas. Also in the case of the suburbs there are vehicles coming into the inner city area, the borough area, which pay no rates whatever towards the burden which these people in city councils have to bear. It might well be that the provinces themselves will have to take upon themselves or ask the Minister to take upon himself legislation which will require financial assistance to be given to the central boroughs by suburban authorities. I think that this is something which the provinces are going to have to consider. Whether they will be approached by the municipalities, I do not know. It is something which is shaping up to-day in the relationship between the borough centres of the city and their suburbs who pay nothing in relief of the rate burden of the ordinary man living in the city area who has to foot the bill. Mr. Speaker, let&#x2019;s face it, all the people outside depend for their living on what they do in the borough areas. It may well be that something of this nature is going to have to be investigated. The hon. member asks specifically that there should be a committee to investigate the various matters he has raised. I think that one of the things that could be done at provincial level would be to establish economies of scale, whereby things could be done on a larger scale than that of the smaller local authorities throughout the provinces. This would, for example, involve standardization of planning, techniques and procedures, accepting tenders on a bigger scale for various works, etc.</p>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. member in this connection? Is the hon. member aware of the fact that in the past five years Natal had to pay back R8 million to the Treasury which Natal was unable to spend?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am perfectly aware of the fact that money has been paid back, but this was because of difficulties experienced in regard to planning. The problem is the planning of the roads. The problem again is one of technical manpower in the National Transport Commission itself and also in the Provincial Roads Department. I do not really understand the point of the hon. member&#x2019;s question. I realize that money has been paid back because the province was unable to spend it. The desire was there to spend it. The greatest difficulty is experienced in regard to planning, and because of the shortage of engineers to carry out programmes.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>No, the National Transport Commission and the provinces together. There is nothing political about this, Sir. I know the absolutely tragic position of the Provincial Roads Departments in all the provinces. I know this to be true specifically in the case of my own province of Natal. This is because of the shortage of trained engineers and staff to carry out the planning of these roads. In fact, practically the whole of this work is being given out on contract. I have said already that I believe that the failure of the National Transport Commission to continue with its policy of subsidizing the freeways is not going to inhibit the use of private motor cars. It will not prevent people from using their cars. It will merely mean that it will take them longer to reach their destinations. They will be far more irritated when they do get there. In fact this is a disguised increase in the cost of production of every single item which is produced here in South Africa. I do not believe that the National Transport Commission have come up with an acceptable alternative. Having agreed <span class="col_1891-1892" refersTo="page_0968"/>with the urban authorities that this was a way of obviating, to a certain extent, their difficulties, I feel that if they now do away with this scheme, the National Transport Commission should propose something else which is at least an alternative solution. That we have not had from the hon. the Deputy Minister. Perhaps we shall now have to wait for that golden day to dawn when the reports of the Borckenhagen Commission, the Schumann Commission, the Marais Commission and all the various commissions we have had, are all co-ordinated and synchronized. Perhaps, when the Government have taken the decisions that they are going to take, all the tiers of Government, whether local or provincial &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am surprised at the United Party for coming to light with a motion like this. When one considers this motion, one can come to no other conclusion but that that side ought to sing the praises of this Government for everything that has been done in recent years. This is particularly true in regard to the second point made in the motion, namely &#x201C;adequate subsidization of urban authorities&#x201D;. The National Transport Commission has been going out of its way in recent years to assist urban areas in the construction of Toads. When one has regard to the amounts which have been spent, particularly on areas which have been receiving generous grants from the National Transport Commission, one expects those hon. members to express their gratitude towards the Minister of Transport for having paid such generous grants to them.</p>

<p>There is at least one aspect I should like to mention, and that is that certain areas have been undertaking planning for years but have not at this stage succeeded in qualifying for these grants. If members of the Opposition wanted to address a request in respect of urban areas which have been undertaking planning for some years, but have not executed their plans to such an extent that they qualify for a subsidy, I could have understood that. But when one considers what has been given to those areas from which those hon. members come, one really feels that to act in this way and to suggest that what has been done is inadequate, reflects a lack of gratitude on their part. I am nevertheless of the opinion that a great deal has been done in this regard.</p>

<p>The first part of the motion of the hon. member for Durban (Point) concerns &#x201C;cheaper and more efficient mass transportation needs, including the possibility of monorail or underground services&#x201D;. A great deal can be said about this matter. We have just been listening to a statement, but I am satisfied that where the opportunity still exists for doing so, we should most definitely avail ourselves of the services we have on the surface. It is much cheaper and much more efficient. Many factors prove that we do not need that here. As regards tube trains, I can only say that they will probably be introduced in years to come, especially when one has regard to the fact that our large urban areas will have to bring their labour forces, in particular the Bantu labour force, from the homelands, as it will be impossible to have further extensions to the Bantu residential areas. If more Bantu labour were to be required, I assume that advance planning would be undertaken so as to render these train services as efficient as possible and so as to provide transport for the Bantu which will enable them to arrive in good time at their work. As regards our present system of transport, previous speakers made it very clear that it was not inadequate at all. Up to this moment our planning is completely up to date. No one can complain that our transport facilities are not adequate. In this respect too, we should rather express our gratitude for everything that has been done in recent years than point out the needs.</p>

<p>I now come to the third point in the hon. member&#x2019;s motion which concerns &#x201C;other financial assistance to provincial and local authorities&#x201D;. Various commissions of enquiry have been appointed in connection with this matter. Various reports on this question have been published. I am perfectly satisfied that the provinces are receiving generous contributions. The National Transport Commission pays a generous contribution of 70 per cent of the costs of roads in the case of the special roads in our provinces, and the provinces have to contribute 30 per cent. This is a special concession. I can only speak on behalf of one province, and that is the Free State, and there this has meant a great deal. If we keep ourselves informed about the activities of the various provincial administrations, we shall know that Natal too has expressed its gratitude for these generous allowances towards its special roads.</p>

<debateSection name="#introduction">

<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>

<p>The general slow-down in the national economy which became evident in the third quarter of 1967 persisted for the greater part of the current financial year. Private investment expenditure, particularly in the manufacturing sector, declined, trade inventories were allowed to run down and imports were at a low level. The effect of these conditions was clearly discernible in the comparatively low growth rate in the volume of traffic offered for transport during the first eight months of the current financial year. Highrated traffic barely exceeded the 1967-&#x2019;68 level and, despite an increase of approximately 2.5 million tons in ores and maize, the total goods tonnage for this year is expected to show a rise of less than 4.5 per cent as compared with 7.6 per cent during the previous financial year.</p>

<p>The working results have, nevertheless, been satisfactory and somewhat better than was envisaged. This is mainly due to the fact that the tonnage of maize and export ores has exceeded expectations.</p>

<p>From an operating point of view no undue difficulty has been experienced and, despite continuing staff shortages in many grades, it has been possible to meet the overall transport demand.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#future_outlook">

<heading>FUTURE OUTLOOK</heading>

<p>According to the latest quarterly bulletin of the South African Reserve Bank, a moderate but distinct economic revival is now noticeable. The record sales of commercial and other vehicles, the value of building plans passed, and recent statistics of the retail and wholesale trade, all suggest a new phase of expanding demand.</p>

<p>The value of imports, which in the first nine months of 1968 was nearly 7 per cent below the previous year&#x2019;s level, has also increased during the past few months. It is, however, too early to determine whether this is an indication of a resumption of growth in private investment in stocks and capital equipment. In October last the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch estimated a relatively high import figure for 1969 in the belief that as soon as the growth rate in the economy had picked up again there would be a general reassessment of the overall stock position in manufacturing and trade. This would seem to be in accord with the general feeling of optimism shared by the representative bodies usually consulted in this regard. A sustained increase in imports, and consequently in high-rated goods traffic, is, therefore, expected.</p>

<p>Regard must, however, be had to the severe setback in the agricultural sector as a result of a devastating drought. The overall expectation for the coming year is, therefore, that the growth rate in revenue-earning traffic will be only moderately higher than that of the current year.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#new_works_programme">

<heading>NEW WORKS PROGRAMME</heading>

<p>Hon. members will recall that in commenting on the steps being taken to keep abreast of the country&#x2019;s transport needs, I mentioned last year that the Brown Book for 1968-69 contained a programme of sanctioned works to be completed in future years at a cost of R471 million. The total programme of new works which last year amounted to R1,293 million now stands at R1,429 million and cash provision for the coming year against the various Brown Book items totals R158 million. The amounts to be spent in future years now rises to R550 million.</p>

<p>Although the existing programme of authorised work is a heavy one and includes projects which will require several years to complete, it is essential, if the country&#x2019;s transport needs are to be met, that new items be provided for each year. Major schemes often have to be carried out in stages to ensure proper co-ordination of the various phases of the work, and with due regard also to the availability of capital and labour.</p>

<p>I shall now briefly comment on the progress that has been made with some of the more important projects.</p>

<p>Work on the new lines presently under construction from Metsi to Kaapmuiden, from Empangeni to Richard&#x2019;s Bay, from Vryheid to a point on the last-mentioned line and from Merebank to Chatsworth is progressing according to schedule.</p>

<p>Good progress has been made with the various deviations and other line improvements being carried out on the different systems and some of these works have been completed. The concrete structure of the new bridge across the Orange River near Bethulie has also been completed.</p>

<p><span class="col_1895-1896" refersTo="page_0970"/>The doubling of the line between Cambridge and Blaney progressed somewhat slower than was expected but is now nearing completion.</p>

<p>The electrification of the Postmasburg&#x2014;Hotazel, Glencoe&#x2014;Hlobane and Reunion&#x2014;Kelso sections has been completed. Steady progress is being made with the electrification of the Kroonstad&#x2014;Harrismith and Natal North Coast lines. On the latter line electric traction will be in operation as far as Stanger by the end of this month.</p>

<p>The new yard at Sikame was opened to traffic during October last year. The new goods layout at Kroonstad, the marshalling yard at Bethlehem and the new diesel servicing depot at Noupoort have been completed, whilst the sub-depot at Port Elizabeth is partly in use.</p>

<p>The new Cape Town station has now been completed as also the demolition of the old buildings.</p>

<p>At Table Bay harbour the construction of the repair pier off M Berth is nearing completion and the additional pre-cooling facilities at D and E Berths have been placed in service. The widening of the Elbow Berth and the erection of the new cargo shed have also been completed.</p>

<p>As hon. members will have noticed from recent Press reports, the committee appointed to re-examine the proposed harbour extension scheme at Table Bay has submitted its report. The Administration has accepted the majority view that the outer harbour scheme proposed by the Department is preferable to a separate harbour at Rietvlei. Work on this project will now be commenced.</p>

<p>At Durban harbour all seven berths of Pier No. 1, Salisbury Island, are now in use and the work on the two berths along the cross quay is progressing. The second cargo shed was placed in service during October last year and the remaining two sheds will be commissioned by the end of this month. The additional berth for oil tankers at Island View is due for completion during May this year.</p>

<p>Work on the new pipeline for the conveyance of crude oil is progressing rapidly and is expected to be completed at the beginning of June this year.</p>

<p>New rolling-stock placed in service since the beginning of the current financial year comprises 5 narrow-gauge steam locomotives, 80 electric and 47 diesel locomotives, 32 mainline passenger coaches, 10 air-conditioned dining saloons and 10 kitchen and staff cars, 65 motor coaches and 154 plain trailers for suburban working, and 3,648 goods wagons of various types.</p>

<p>Rolling-stock already sanctioned but still on order, or to be ordered, includes 155 electric and 68 diesel locomotives. 10 air-conditioned dining saloons, 11 air-conditioned kitchen and staff cars, 402 main-line passenger coaches, including those for the new Blue Train sets, 137 motor coaches, 349 plain trailers and 7,057 goods vehicles, including 30 narrow-gauge cattle trucks.</p>

<p>In the Estimates of Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works for 1969-&#x2019;70, provision is being made for a further 100 electric locomotives, 150 main-line passenger coaches, 67 motor coaches, 176 plain trailers, 7 driving trailers, 3,820 standard-gauge and 110 narrow-gauge goods vehicles.</p>

<p>Provision is also being made for a number of trucks to be specially designed for the conveyance of motor-cans and to be used on the basis of fixed train sets.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the financial year two new Boeing 707 and two new Boeing 737 aircraft have been placed in service. Unfortunately one Boeing 707 was lost in the disaster near Windhoek. In my budget speech last year I informed the House that orders had been placed for three Boeing 747, one Boeing 707 and one Boeing 737 aircraft. Since then arrangements have been made to acquire two additional Boeing 707 and three Boeing 737 aircraft. Altogether ten new Boeing aircraft are now on order, namely three 707&#x2019;s, four 737&#x2019;s and three 747&#x2019;s. One of the Boeing 707 aircraft was ordered by Trek Airways but is to be taken over by the Administration in exchange for one of the older model Boeing 707 aircraft acquired some years ago. The exchange will take place next month when the new Boeing 707 model 344C is delivered.</p>

<p>The remaining two Boeing 707/344C aircraft and one of the 737&#x2019;s will be delivered before the end of this year. The other three 737&#x2019;s are scheduled for delivery in 1970 and the three 747&#x2019;s towards the end of 1971.</p>

<p>Line improvements and other new projects, and the acquisition of additional equipment such as rolling-stock, aircraft, etc., for which provision is made in the Estimates of Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works, represent only a few aspects of the progress being made with a range of measures to modernize the country&#x2019;s national transport undertaking and to improve its efficiency. In my budget speeches in recent years, I referred to mechanization and automation which, apart from other advantages, also assist in overcoming manpower shortages. Last year I mentioned that the mechanization of track maintenance has resulted in a considerable saving in staff notwithstanding an increase of almost 60 per cent in the gross ton-miles of traffic.</p>

<p>The introduction of centralized traffic control over the sections Kamfersdam&#x2014;Postmasburg, Hamilton&#x2014;Springfontein and Volksrust&#x2014;Newcastle has enabled the Department to reduce the establishment of station foremen&#x2014;a grade in which severe shortages are being experienced&#x2014;by 72 units.</p>

<p>I also referred to the need to run longer and heavier trains, and mentioned that the drawgear and braking equipment of trucks have had to be strengthened in order to be able to do so. At present bulk ore from the Sishen area is conveyed to Port Elizabeth and <span class="col_1897-1898" refersTo="page_0971"/>Iscor in loads of up to 3,300 tons which means a reduction of some 1,300 trains and a saving of approximately R2.6 million per annum. An even greater reduction in the number of trains, with a proportionately higher saving in running costs, will be achieved when a new type of truck now being acquired is placed in service.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year the General Manager undertook an extensive study tour of Canada, the U.S.A., Great Britain and several countries in Europe. At the same time three Assistant General Managers visited Great Britain and various railways on the Continent to study the latest developments in the field of transport. They gathered valuable information which will assist the Administration in meeting the country&#x2019;s transport requirements.</p>

<p>In keeping with modem trends, a marketing research organization has been introduced to improve and systematize contact with the Administration&#x2019;s customers. The primary function of this organization will be to determine customers&#x2019; transport needs and their special requirements, and to explore ways and means of adequately meeting these needs; to conduct research into the specific requirements of potential customers starting new undertakings in order to facilitate transport when the production stage is reached; to propagate the services of the Administration and to foster and maintain good relations between customers and the Administration. Specially trained staff will be used for this purpose. The scheme will initially be confined to two Systems, but after the experimental stage the organization will be extended to other Systems.</p>

<p>Realizing the need to utilize its manpower resources to optimum advantage, the Administration is making extensive use of O. and M. studies conducted by specially trained officials to streamline administrative procedures. Considerable success is being achieved and 672 posts have so far been abolished with a considerable recurrent saving in respect of salaries, part of which has been used to improve the grading of certain positions.</p>

<p>The overall staff position continues to cause serious concern, but as it is realized that the general shortage of labour is a long-term problem, the solution is being sought by introducing schemes and procedures, such as those to which I have referred, which make it possible to do more work with less staff.</p>

<debateSection name="#current_financial_year_in_retrospect">

<heading>CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR IN RETROSPECT</heading>

<p>I shall now give the House a brief review of the current year&#x2019;s working under the following heads:</p>

<ul>

<li>Passenger Services;</li>

<li>Goods and Coal;</li>

<li>Road Transport Services;</li>

<li>Harbours;</li>

<li>Oil Pipelines; and</li>

<li>Air Services.</li>

</ul>

<p><i>Passenger Services:</i></p>

<p>Whilst the total number of first- and second-class passengers has again dropped, it would appear that the decline of recent years in respect of this traffic is being arrested. During the months April/November the percentage decrease on the corresponding period of 1967 was only 1.7 for main-line and 0.95 for suburban passengers. The previous year the percentage loss was 10.5 and 6.1, respectively.</p>

<p>Third-class traffic also shows an improvement, viz. an increase of 6.1 per cent in suburban and 2 per cent in main-line journeys as against 5.9 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, last year. The rise in the number of third-class suburban passengers is, however, almost entirely due to the introduction of the new service to the Umlazi resettlement area in Durban. Suburban revenue from the first and second classes has risen by 0.5 per cent and main-line by 3 per cent, whilst in the third class the increases were 11.8 and 4.4 per cent, respectively. The abolition of location fares as from October, 1968, has brought about a further slight increase in third-class suburban revenues.</p>

<p><i>Goods and Coal:</i></p>

<p>With imports at a low level, high-rated traffic has shown little advance on last year. By the end of December, 1968, the increase in tonnage was only 0.82 per cent as against 4.43 per cent for the whole of the financial year 1967-&#x2019;68, and high-rated revenue was only R5.2 million, or 3.36 per cent more than the figure for the corresponding months of 1967.</p>

<p>Since September, the monthly value of imports has begun to exceed the figure for the corresponding months of 1967, and high-rated rail earnings are benefiting accordingly. The major increase in rail revenues during the current year, nevertheless, emanates from lowrated traffic. During the period April/December revenue from ores and minerals showed an increase of R3.9 million, maize R3.3 million, and coal R1.6 million.</p>

<p>Whilst there has been a drop in the world price of high-grade manganese ore due to a surplus on the market, the demand for low-grade ore, for which the price is fairly stable, has been strong, and South African exports in 1968 achieved an all-time record. During the period April/December the volume of this traffic increased by 24 per cent.</p>

<p>Iron ore conveyed for export also showed a substantial increase, viz. 30 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1967-&#x2019;68, but iron ore conveyed for local consumption fell slightly below last year&#x2019;s total. In the interests of the national economy and to assist South African producers to compete on the world market for ores, the Administration made a substantial reduction in harbour handling charges, viz. from 84c to 64c per ton, in October, and at the same time introduced night-shift working at the ore-loading installations.</p>

<p>Owing to shortages in the Republic, the Mealie Industry Control Board cancelled all <span class="col_1899-1900" refersTo="page_0972"/>shipments of white maize for February and March, 1969, and thereby put an end to the year&#x2019;s programme of bulk export railings of white maize to the ports. The tonnage of maize for local consumption&#x2014;particularly drought relief&#x2014;has increased considerably, but this traffic is conveyed over relatively shorter distances, so that the revenue now expected on the transport of maize, generally, is less than budgeted. There have also been no exports of kaffir corn during the latter part of this year as the 1968 harvest yielded only 2.1 million bags as compared with 9.3 million in 1967.</p>

<p>During the past nine months coal traffic provided nearly 4 per cent more revenue than in 1967 and, as stocks at power stations are no higher than last year&#x2019;s level, it is expected that railings will continue at more or less the present rate. Owing to the closing of the Suez Canal and to limitations on the availability of competitive supplies from Vietnam, exports of anthracite have increased but coal shipments as a whole were 84,000 tons less than the corresponding figure for 1967.</p>

<p>Revenue from goods and coal traffic in 1968-&#x2019;69 is now estimated at R462.2 million as against the budgeted figure of R447.4 million, and total revenue from Railways at R671.4 million or R38.4 million more than in 1967-&#x2019;68.</p>

<p>Five years ago (i.e. in 1963-&#x2019;64) earnings from high-rated goods constituted just under 30 per cent of total revenue from all services, but this percentage is declining each year and for 1967-&#x2019;68 stood at 26.7 per cent. Even allowing for the greater proportionate contribution now being made by Airways and the diversion of petroleum products to the pipeline, the decline indicates the increasing preponderance of low-rated goods. Furthermore, with the loss of the more lucrative short-distance traffic to road transport, the average length of haul has increased from 299 miles in 1963-&#x2019;64 to 311 in 1968-&#x2019;69. In fact, the available statistics for 1968-&#x2019;69 show that by the end of December the average revenue earned per ton-mile from goods traffic had declined from last year&#x2019;s figure of just over 1.59c to less than 1.55c.</p>

<p><i>Road Transport Services:</i></p>

<p>Although passengers and goods traffic conveyed by the departmental road transport services up to the end of December showed revenue increases of 8.08 and 6.01 per cent, respectively, on the previous year, this service is now also feeling the effects of the escalating wage structure, and a surplus of only R116,000 is estimated for 1968-&#x2019;69 as compared with R485,000 in the preceding financial year.</p>

<p><i>Harbours:</i></p>

<p>The volume of cargo discharged during the first nine months was 15.3 per cent below that of the corresponding period of the previous year. Although imports of consumer goods and capital equipment initially showed the effects of the credit restrictions, a great proportion of the decrease was in respect of petroleum products.</p>

<p>The shipment of maize and of maize products was by far the most important element of exports, and by the end of December these exceeded the corresponding figure for 1967 by nearly half a million tons. Grain elevator and harbour earnings benefited alike from these consignments, but revenue from this source will decline considerably with the curtailment of maize exports during the last quarter of the financial year. The ore installations handled 126,000 tons more traffic during the period mentioned, whilst the bunkering of ships diverted from Suez has helped to maintain harbour revenues.</p>

<p>Despite the recent increase in imports, harbour revenue up to the end of December had not yet reached the previous year&#x2019;s level, and the revised estimate for the year places the total earnings at R41.2 million, which is more or less the same as the 1967-&#x2019;68 figure.</p>

<p><i>Oil Pipelines:</i></p>

<p>As stockpiling did not occur to the same extent this year, pipeline revenue is expected to total R23.2 million as compared with R23.9 million in 1967-&#x2019;68.</p>

<p><i>Air Services:</i></p>

<p>Airways passenger earnings on the Springbok route exceed the 1967-&#x2019;68 figure by well over R2 million and on the Australian service by nearly R800,000. Revenue suffered slightly when there were strikes by aircrews in London and Paris last June and July.</p>

<p>Total Airways revenue is, nevertheless, expected to exceed the 1967-&#x2019;68 figure by R6.6 million, or almost 12 per cent.</p>

<p><i>All Services.</i></p>

<p>Revenue from all services is, therefore, estimated to total R798,230,000.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#expenditure">

<heading>EXPENDITURE</heading>

<p>As indicated in the Additional Estimates of Expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue Funds, it is anticipated that expenditure in respect of all services will total R811,337,000. The year is consequently expected to close with a shortfall of R13.1 million as against the budgeted deficit of R24 million. The shortfall will be met from the Rates Equalisation Fund, leaving a credit balance of R64 million in that Fund.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#prospects_for_1969-70">

<heading>PROSPECTS FOR 1969-&#x2019;70</heading>

<p><i>Goods and Coal</i>:</p>

<p>Despite record harvests of wheat in 1967 and 1968, it may be necessary to import supplies during the coming year, and additional revenue is possible from this source. Latest reports with regard to the maize crop prospects for the 1969 season, on the other hand, indicate that it is doubtful whether any maize will be available for export which will result in <span class="col_1901-1902" refersTo="page_0973"/>a considerable drop in Railway revenue from this source compared with recent years.</p>

<p>Exports of manganese, iron and, to a lesser extent, chrome ore, are expected to rise still further in 1969. A considerable increase in iron ore for processing at local foundries is also anticipated.</p>

<p>With Highveld Steel &amp; Vanadium Corporation building up to full production, capacity for steel production in the Republic for both the local and export market will expand considerably. Basic iron and steel production is expected to show an increase of between 5 and 10 per cent, but the South African metal and engineering industries do not envisage any large expansion in 1969. The ferro-alloy industry, of whose products more than 75 per cent are exported, has been affected by lower prices on the world markets and the outlook for next year is consequently uncertain. As a whole the physical volume of industrial production, which in 1968 rose by not much more than 4 per cent, is expected to show an increase of approximately 6 per cent in 1969.</p>

<p>Whilst imports have increased in recent months, in assessing the overall increase in traffic during the coming year, it is also necessary to take into account external factors such as the anticipated lower growth rate in the economy of some of South Africa&#x2019;s trading partners and the prevailing world currency uncertainties.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into consideration, it is anticipated that the total freight tonnage, i.e. revenue-earning goods, coal and livestock, will increase by 2.4 per cent in the coming year as against an estimated 3.9 per cent in 1968-&#x2019;69. The Budget makes provision for an increase of 1.71 per cent in goods revenue as compared with the estimated rise of 5.76 per cent in 1968-&#x2019;69.</p>

<p>The smaller increase expected in 1969-&#x2019;70 is due principally to the set-back in the agricultural sector and, whereas 1968-&#x2019;69 showed an increase of R2.7 million over the previous year in revenue from this source, the Budget for the coming year is based on a decrease of R14.1 million. In the case of export maize alone, the anticipated reduction will be R13.7 million.</p>

<p><i>Passenger Services:</i></p>

<p>In view of the more favourable trend in main-line travel in recent months, it is anticipated that the number of passengers in the second class will be only slightly below that of 1968-&#x2019;69, whilst an increase of 2&#x00BD; per cent is estimated in both first and third class. Suburban traffic, in both the first and second classes, is expected to maintain more or less the same level as in the current year, but it is anticipated that the number in the third class in the Umlazi area will increase further, and that there will be an overall improvement of 2.7 per cent in non-white suburban journeys.</p>

<p><i>Subsidiary Services:</i></p>

<p>In view of the prevailing drought, a considerable loss on grain elevator working is expected in 1969-&#x2019;70. Road transport is similarly affected and a loss of R163,000 is expected.</p>

<p><i>Harbours:</i></p>

<p>It is generally accepted that imports will increase in the coming year, and in the expectation that the Suez Canal remains closed to traffic and that other exports will compensate, in a measure, fox the absence of maize shipments, an increase of R4 million in revenue is anticipated.</p>

<p><i>Airways:</i></p>

<p>The Budget provides for an improvement of R10 million in air-passenger revenues. Besides the introduction of the new service to America, traffic is increasing on the Springbok, Wallaby and internal air routes. Freight revenue is expected to increase by R800,000.</p>

<p><i>Pipelines:</i></p>

<p>In addition to the normal growth in traffic in petroleum products, provision is made in the Estimates for revenue from the second pipeline which is to come into operation in June, 1969, and total pipeline revenue for the year is assessed at R47.7 million.</p>

<p><i>All Services:</i></p>

<p>Revenue from all services is, therefore, expected to total R853,167,000.</p>

<p><i>Expenditure:</i></p>

<p>In comparison with the increase of R95 million in expenditure in the current financial year over 1967-&#x2019;68 arising largely from the wage improvements, the Budget for 1969-&#x2019;70 provides for a rise of less than R47 million, of which some R18 million is accounted for by fixed charges.</p>

<p>Total expenditure on all services is estimated at R858,253,000, and the year is, therefore, expected to close with a deficit of R5,086,000.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#improved_pension_benefits">

<heading>IMPROVED PENSION BENEFITS</heading>

<p>During the past year benefits paid to railway pensioners have been under investigation by a committee specially appointed for the purpose. Railway pensioners, through their association, as well as the Railway Staff Associations, have represented the need for an improvement. As hon. members are aware, the Railway Superannuation Fund is quite independent of the pension funds operative for public servants and is, in fact, managed by a Joint Committee comprising equal representation of the staff and of the Administration. The staff have thus been associated with the investigation by representatives from the Joint Committee serving on the investigation committee.</p>

<p>The investigation has shown conclusively that improvements in the benefits provided by the Pension Funds are fully justified. Apart <span class="col_1903-1904" refersTo="page_0974"/>from the fact that the Funds have a credit balance totalling more than R500 million on investment, the modernized pensions plans available in the private sector make a better pension scheme for the Railways essential if suitable and sufficient staff are to be attracted to the Service.</p>

<p>The Administration has, therefore, approved of the benefits from its Pension Funds being amended to provide, with effect from 1st April, 1969, for the net annuities paid to pensioners who retired prior to 1st April, 1968, being enhanced by an initial 10 per cent and those paid to pensioners who retired on or after 1st April, 1968, and future pensioners by an initial 5 per cent.</p>

<p>In addition to the enhancements mentioned, the net annuities of pensioners who retired prior to the operative date, i.e. 1st April, 1969, will be enhanced as from that date by 2 per cent, compounded annually, for each completed year that they have been on pension; and further increased in subsequent years by the same percentage on each anniversary of their date of retirement, subject to a maximum period of 20 year in all.</p>

<p>Future pensioners, i.e. those whose pensions operate from a date on or after 1st April, 1969, will have their net annuities increased by 2 per cent, compounded annually, for each complete year that they are in receipt of a pension, similarly subject to a maximum period of 20 years.</p>

<p>As from 1st April, 1969, the existing terminal period of four years on which the average basic salary for calculation of pensions is determined will be reduced to three years. The factors employed in commuting portion of gross pension to a lump-sum payment will be increased, so that the commutation factor of a male person retiring at the age of 60 will become 12.0 instead of 10.32, whilst the factors for other ages and for females will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>The financial relief at present being given to pensioners by way of temporary allowance and bonus payments, will remain as at present. The committee of investigation also made certain recommendations affecting these payments, but the Actuaries have advised that they would prefer to await the results of the quinquennial valuation as at 31st March, 1969, before advising the Administration on the financial aspects involved.</p>

<p>From 1st April, 1969, the minimum income levels of R94 and R47 per month at present applicable to married&#x2014;single persons with dependants included&#x2014;and unmarried pensioners will, however, be raised to R100 and R50 per month, respectively. This change in conjunction with the percentage enhancements on net annuities paid from the Pension Funds will necessitate an adjustment in the amount paid by way of special supplementary allowance, with consequent additional expenditure to be borne by Railway revenue.</p>

<p>Coupled with the abolition since last October of the means test in respect of the temporary allowance and bonus payments, the improvements I have outlined will, I feel sure, afford welcome relief to pensioners.</p>

<heading>TRIBUTE</heading>

<p>For the first time in my long term of office as Minister of Transport, I have to pay tribute to the memory of a General Manager of the South African Railways who passed away while still in the service. With the demise of Mr. J. P. Hugo on 30th July, 1968, after a long illness which he bore with exemplary fortitude, the Administration lost a loyal and devoted servant.</p>

<p>Not only was he one of the most competent General Managers the South African Railways have yet had, but he had such an endearing personality that he was loved by all who had the privilege of knowing him. Having been closely associated with him for a period of seven years, his passing away was a great personal loss to me.</p>

<p>I am sure that hon. members who were privileged to know him or had occasion to call on his services will join me in paying homage to his memory.</p>

<p>I would also like to extend to Mr. J. A. Kruger&#x2014;Mr. Hugo&#x2019;s successor&#x2014;congratulations on his appointment to the very responsible position of General Manager of the South African Railways. Mr. Kruger, with his almost 39 years of devoted railway service, is known, I am sure, to all of us. I am fully confident that he will ably, and successfully, fulfil the task entrusted to him and that the vast railway organization can only benefit by his proven abilities and leadership. On behalf of the Government I wish him every success, and happiness, in his new position.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#appreciation">

<heading>APPRECIATION</heading>

<p>Mr. Speaker, besides the financial and other particulars I have just given the House, I also referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the steps taken to increase <span class="col_1905-1906" refersTo="page_0975"/>labour productivity on the Railways through mechanization, re-organization of staff, etc. I regard it as my bounden duty to mention here to-day the efforts by the staff themselves to keep the wheels turning. Apart from the fact that the mere handful of Airways personnel have achieved wonders, and are still doing so, it is significant that, whilst five years ago, 99.2 million tons of goods (i.e. revenue and free-hauled traffic combined) were handled, directly or indirectly, by the rest of the staff, viz. 220,600, this section, which at present only totals 217,600, i.e. 3,000 fewer than five years ago, will have been responsible for having handled an estimated tonnage of 123 million by the end of March this year&#x2014;an increase of some 24 million tons. This I think, is indeed a praiseworthy effort of which not only the country may be justly proud, but which also requires to be noted with appreciation.</p>

<p>I wish, therefore, to express thanks to the Railway Commissioners, the General Manager and every member of the staff for their cooperation, their loyalty, and their unabated diligence throughout the year.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, right at the outset I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. the Minister on the death of Mr. J. P. Hugo, the late General Manager of the S.A. Railways. All of us who knew Mr. Hugo had appreciation for him not only as a person but also as a capable and dedicated manager of the huge organization which had been entrusted to his care. I think South Africa as well as the Railways are the poorer for having lost such a man.</p>

<p>Then I would also like to associate myself with the Minister where he paid tribute to the newly appointed General Manager, Mr. Kruger. We want to congratulate Mr. Kruger on behalf of the Opposition as well and assure him of our co-operation, for what it is worth, in the task he has undertaken, and sympathise with him for having to manage the Railways under a Government which is tired and weary.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s opening words on, his survey of, the economic condition of South Africa. I only hope that on this occasion he is closer to the opinion of his colleague, the Minister of Finance, because I remember only too well how the hon. the Minister came forward last year with an announcement on the financial condition of South Africa&#x2014;that inflation had been curbed and so on&#x2014;while a week or two later the Minister of Finance contradicted him in a very striking and a very painful way. I hope that on this occasion there has been a little consultation, and that what he has said will also be confirmed by the Minister of Finance on 26th March.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister announced a deficit of approximately R5 million.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want him to know that this means nothing to us. He could have mentioned any figure, it would have had the same meaning for us, because every year this Minister has submitted an estimate in his Budget he has missed the ball completely. Again this year he announced an expected deficit of R24 million, and he now comes forward with R13 million. He was 50 per cent out. It is a pity that this should be the case. We would like to discuss the finances of the Railways with the Minister on a basis which has some meaning, but since what we get from the Minister and those who assist him are such blunders, such an arbitrary use of figures which means nothing, the discussion also becomes less valuable and becomes in fact valueless. I was glad to learn that the Minister is granting extremely valuable concessions to the pensioners of the S.A. Railways. We have discussed their interests across the floor of the House on many occasions. The Minister has always shown that provided the Opposition points out to him what is necessary he is willing to grant the necessary concessions, but I want to tell him at once that I cannot understand why he and the Government in general, when they do something good, should always do so with an attitude which is at the same time a petty one. With these increases and these concessions which he has now announced, we are given to understand that after 20 years the increase in pensions of 2 per cent will be stopped. Why? That means that old men of 80 years or more will cease to enjoy this annual concession. But it is when one, if you are spared, turns 80 or more, that your needs increase; then your troubles are more; your shortcomings greater; then you need an even greater amount of attention; then you need more money. And at that stage, while the Minister is doing something good here, he is being petty enough to say to the Railway <span class="col_1907-1908" refersTo="page_0976"/>worker: If you live long enough, if you live 20 years after retiring on pension, then I am going to penalize you, and I am no longer going to give you that increase. Mr. Speaker, there is still time; it is not yet final; this is only a suggestion. I want to express the hope that the Minister, before he comes forward with his final legislation, will put an end to this pettiness.</p>

<p>Sir, how many people can be concerned in this? After 80 years their numbers dwindle rapidly each year; it cannot cost the Railways much.</p>

<p>Then I also want to associate myself with what the Minister said in regard to the dedication of the Railway staff and their tremendous achievement in transporting an increased tonnage with fewer numbers, but this is of course a cause for concern as well, because there must come a time when the sacrifices being asked of the staff can no longer be made, when the people have reached their absolute maximum, and I wonder whether that time is not close at hand.

<block name="quote">(iii) &#x201C;culture of the white population of the Republic&#x201D; means pursuing the total perfection of that population by means of acquainting it with the best which has been thought, said and done in South Africa and in the world about all the matters which most concern that population;</block>

<p>The object is to attempt to provide a definition of the expression which appears throughout the Bill, namely the &#x201C;culture of the white population of the Republic&#x201D;. The definition which, with apologies to Matthew Arnold, I have thought might best describe what the &#x201C;culture of the white population of the Republic&#x201D; is as set out in my amendment. You see, Sir, I think it is very important that we attempt, and this is no more than an attempt, to define what it is that we mean by the &#x201C;culture of the white population of the Republic&#x201D;. The reason why I think this is important is that the hon. the Minister of National Education will in terms of the Bill have the power to do certain things of his own accord, in consultation in one instance only with the hon. the Minister of Finance. He will have the power to &#x201C;acquire, develop and maintain movable and immovable property&#x201D; in the first place, and in the second place to &#x201C;award bursaries and make grants for the undertaking of educational tours to foreign countries&#x201D;. That is one aspect. He does that in order to foster the culture of the white population of the Republic. I do not think one can assess what the Minister does when he spends our money unless we can determine here what sort of thing he should foster, so that we can later measure what the Minister and his successors do with our money in fostering that culture.</p>

<p>He has also the power, without consultation with anyone but the Minister of Finance, to do certain other things. He does not have to consult the National Advisory Cultural Council. He has the further power to &#x201C;award bursaries to persons in other countries for the purposes of study or research in the Republic&#x201D;, to &#x201C;arrange for visits by persons from other countries to the Republic, and from the Republic to other countries&#x201D;, and to &#x201C;arrange for the exhibition of art&#x201D;, etc., and he may also &#x201C;subsidize or finance a chair in a university &#x2026; in any other country&#x201D;. He may also &#x201C;donate books and periodicals to libraries and similar institutions &#x2026; in other countries&#x201D;. These are events which are going to cause the Minister to exercise his mind, in the first place, and then to spend our money, in the second place. Nowhere in the Bill does there appear to be any sort of attempt to define what &#x201C;the culture of the white population of the Republic&#x201D; is. I think that after the Minister embarks upon this programme, where he has absolute power to spend this money out of moneys appropriated by Parliament, when we as Parliament assess how he has spent that money, we should be able to determine some sort of standard to assess what the Minister does against a standard which we here set. It is true that in clause 3 of the Bill the National Advisory Cultural Council may &#x201C;make recommendations to the Minister, of its own accord or at the request of the Minister&#x201D; as to certain matters which are there defined, namely &#x201C;the plastic arts, music, the literary arts, out-of-school education of adults and youthful persons, the acquisition, in popular fashion, &#x2026;"&#x2014;we shall come to that later&#x2014;&#x201C;&#x2026; of knowledge of the applied, natural and human sciences, and the utilization of leisure, including physical recreative activities which are of such a nature as not to be courses of training with a view to participating in competitions&#x2026;&#x201D;. <span class="col_1909-1910" refersTo="page_0977"/>Now, that is not a definition of culture, because this is unrelated to the powers which the Minister will have in terms of clause 2. The Minister there spends the money appropriated by Parliament without reference to anybody.</p>

<p>I propose this amendment as an attempt to define what that culture is, and it has a reference to our country and to the world. It is certainly wide, but it is at any rate an attempt to define what sort of things the hon. the Minister should spend our money on. He should spend our money on &#x201C;pursuing the total perfection of&#x201D; the white population of the Republic by means of acquainting the members of that population with the best which has been thought, said and done in South Africa, and indeed in the world, in respect of those matters which most concern this population.</p>

<p>I have looked around in an attempt to find some sort of definition, and I think these words of Matthew Arnold come closest to it. This definition does not come from my own mind and from my own thoughts, nor is the language entirely mine&#x2014;it comes mostly from Matthew Arnold. I think we should at least attempt to place some background in the Bill against which we can measure what the Minister does when he tries to administer the Act.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to doubt the good intentions of the hon. member for Durban (North) at all. I think his intentions are very good, but I doubt whether he has really considered in depth, or perhaps he did not know, what the implications of his definition will be. We have inserted clause 3 in this Bill with the very object of restricting and defining the sphere of cultural activity, because if this is not done and we accept this definition of culture by the hon. member, it will mean that we will have to bring a great many cultural activities which at present fall under other Government Departments, under the education departments of the various provinces, and under private organizations. There is a vast number of private organizations which perform certain cultural activities. We will have to bring all those activities together under this umbrella. If, notwithstanding all these problems, I should still consider accepting the definition, it would mean that I would also have to amend clause 3, because that clause restricts the activities upon which this council advises the Minister. I would have to amend clause 3. For example, I would have to take into account the education departments I mentioned, the Department of Social Welfare, which performs certain of these cultural functions, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, etc., and incorporate all the functions performed by them into the Department of Cultural Affairs. I cannot simply act upon a definition, and then allow those other separate departments to continue with those activities. I believe in co-ordination too, but the hon. member will recall how in 1967, in order to bring about a little co-ordination in the most important matters in education we had to struggle, in the case of the National Education Policy Act, to do this without interfering with established rights, without laying down immediate provisions and without wanting to bring everything under one umbrella. I foresee that, in spite of the hon. member&#x2019;s good intentions, we shall only incur the ill-will of other bodies. Therefore I want to suggest that we should not attempt to define a delicate matter such as cultural activity in such a way that it will fit into a certain framework, but that we should rather start off from an existing practice. In my Second Reading speech I said that all the things mentioned by the hon. member were being done at present. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout summed the matter up correctly. There can be no objection to it. These things are only being put into statutory form now. Instead of Parliament having full authority over this appropriated money as before, they only received a general amount that was voted for these cultural activities. The Minister, in co-operation with his standing committees, distributed this money. But under this legislation Parliament is now obtaining a far greater measure of control, because these amounts are being specified and will appear in a specified form in the annual report. Therefore I want to suggest that we do not at this stage attempt to insert any definition. Time will tell whether, in the course of the development, it will became possible later on. So let us keep to the provisions of clause 3. Let us continue along the old beaten track and let us not object to doing so. Let us rather promote a good cause and let us not differ on it. I am sorry, therefore, that I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister used a fine expression, namely &#x201C; &#x2019;n mooi saak uitbou&#x201D;. I am with him. I appreciate that this is what one should try and do. My proposed definition attempts to make this, in fact, a &#x201C;mooi saak&#x201D;, which we can build on and build out. But I think the hon. the Minister misses my point.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the hon. the Minister indicated by his reply, perhaps, that he did not appreciate my point. The hon. the Minister says that clause 3 (3) defines really what this Bill is about. I think that is a fair statement of what the hon. the Minister has said. He then said that, if this amendment is to be accepted, he would have to do all sorts of things affecting other departments. His powers, in terms of clause 2, are not at all confined by the definition, inasmuch as it is a definition, of the functions of the council in clause 3 (3). That is the Minister&#x2019;s case. He says that it is intended to deal with those matters set out in clause 3 (3). Where does the <span class="col_1911-1912" refersTo="page_0978"/>hon. the Minister see that? There is no suggestion that the Minister, in exercising his powers under clause 2, namely with regard to the endowment of chairs at universities, the provision of bursaries, the provision of travel fellowships and all the matters that are set out there, has to do that in respect of those matters dealt with in clause 3 (3). That is not so. There is no restriction on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s powers to those matters in the relevant clause. Clause 3 (3) stipulates that the council may advise the Minister to do various things in relation to those matters I have read out, for example the plastic arts, out-of-school education, and so on. But the hon. the Minister may, without consultation, without reference to the advisory council, do what he is entitled to do in terms of clause 2 (1) (a) and (b). That is my point.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The difference lies in the extent to which the hon. the Minister may implement what the advisory committee suggests in terms of clause 3 (3). There we have defined what the matters are the hon. the Minister may implement and on what he may spend money. The difference is that, in clause 2 where the Minister has the power to acquire property, for example, to award bursaries and make grants for the undertaking of educational tours to foreign countries, he is not confined to what the council advises him. He has a free hand, as it says here, &#x201C;to foster the culture of the white population of the Republic&#x201D;. That has no relation whatsoever to the plastic arts and all the other matters set out in clause 3 (3). It is a different power. He has this power unrestricted.</p>

<p>It is no good the hon. the Minister saying &#x201C;He is very clever&#x201D;. It is not a question of being &#x201C;clever&#x201D;. It is a question of looking at this Bill. In respect of what matters does the hon. the Minister want to do this? This is what I want to know. All I want to know, is, if we are going to give him this power firstly, and in the second place, appropriate money, so that the Minister can exercise his powers, is he going to restrict it? Will he perhaps answer this question? Is he going to restrict it to those matters stipulated in clause 3 (3), namely the plastic arts, etc.? If he is, why does he then not put it in the Bill? If he is not, how is the hon. the Minister going to define to himself the expression &#x201C;the culture of the white population of the Republic&#x201D;? Because he is here given the power to spend money in order to foster that concept. That is what I want to know. I think we are entitled to know. I hope that the difference between clause 3 (3) and the powers contained in clause 2 are now clear. That is why, in answer to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s question, I think we should have a definition. Because when he exercises those powers, we can assess what he has done in accordance with what we think he should spend that money on. I hope that now that I have perhaps explained the misunderstanding between the hon. the Minister and myself in relation to clause 3 (3) and clause 2, the hon. the Minister will indicate whether he is prepared to confine his powers in clause 2 to deal only with those matters set out in clause 3 (3).</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Durban (North) has rendered a very valuable service in introducing this amendment. This is a Bill to provide for the preservation, development, fostering and extension of the culture of the white population of the Republic. During our Second-Reading discussion there was a divergence of opinion. There were hon. members who confused two cultures with this culture of the white population. They were not quite sure what it meant. There were speeches from hon. members which made it quite clear that they were confused about it. Now it seems to me the hon. the Minister is also a bit confused, if I may anticipate our discussion of clause 3, to which the hon. the Minister has referred. In his amendment to clause 3, he says that these people, who are going to be the important people on the council, must have adequate knowledge of the two official languages and the two cultures of the two white population groups of the Republic. I think I am justified in referring to this, because it reveals what the hon. the Minister has in mind. So, when we come to the definition of the &#x201C;culture of the white population&#x201D;, I think this definition is an exceedingly good one. I would ask the hon. the Minister to accept it. I cannot think of a better one. I think it is an excellent one. It is one that would apply to all people in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to put a question to the hon. member for Durban (North). Does he really think that if this amendment is accepted, he can ensure how the money is going to be spent, and what the money is going to be spent on? I fail to see that. I listened very carefully to what he had to say, but the position will remain unaltered. If the Minister wants to spend the money in a certain way, he can do so at his pleasure.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, but surely we are entitled to examine the way in which the Minister spends our money in furthering the culture of the white people of South Africa? We are entitled to examine it, using a certain test. What is that test? Surely there should be some test, so that when this Minister or his successor, whoever he may be, spends that money, or asks for more money, we can examine the spending of that money in the light of a definition of culture? But with no definition whatsoever, it means that the hon. the Minister may buy movable and immovable property. He may award bursaries and make grants for the undertaking of educational tours to foreign countries.</p>

<p>Yes, the Minister can do so, but now this provision is being placed on the Statute Book. He may do this in order to foster the culture of the white population of the Republic. Now, what does that mean? It is as simple as that. That is the whole purpose of this amendment. When the Minister exercises that power without reference to anyone else except the man who is going to give him the money, namely the Minister of Finance, what is he going to foster? Is it going to be anything the Minister thinks will affect the culture of the white population of South Africa, or is it going to be something which we can define? Is there anything wrong with the definition which I have proposed?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>That is what I told you in my first remarks.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know. The Minister said that I had moved this amendment in all good faith. I accept that, but if there is nothing wrong with the definition, and if it is broad enough, why does the Minister not want to accept it? The Minister also has the power&#x2014;and this has nothing to do with the plastic arts, etc.&#x2014;to award bursaries and to endow a Chair without reference to the advisory council. If the Minister is to endow a Chair at a university in another country, surely we are entitled to prescribe what the hon. the Minister shall spend that money on? This is now left entirely to the discretion of the Minister.</p>

<p>I am very indebted to the hon. member for Kensington for indicating that he thought that this was a fair definition of the culture of the white population. As I have said, I have moved this amendment in an attempt to define it, because I think it ought to be defined. If there is something wrong with it, perhaps the hon. the Minister will indicate what is wrong with it. If there is a better suggestion, I do not mind. I am not wedded to this definition. It is the best that I could find, but someone else might find a better definition. If someone will suggest a better definition, I am sure that we shall all be delighted to discuss it. I am not wedded to this definition. I just say that we must have some definition so that we, the people&#x2019;s representatives, can then better judge how this Minister, without consultation with anyone else except the man who gives him the money, is spending our money to achieve the object at which this Bill is aimed.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban (North) is playing with words in his arguments now. Moreover, he keeps on repeating the same argument. I should like to point out that clause 3 is the very clause that contains everything that is stated by the hon. member in his definition. It is stated clearly enough there. The amendment moved by the hon. member reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;culture of the white population of the Republic&#x201D; means pursuing the total perfection of that population by means of acquainting it with the best which has been thought, said and done in South Africa and in the world about all the matters which most concern that population;</block>

<p>Here, therefore, we are dealing not only with the culture in South Africa, but also with hat of the outside world. Apart from what the Minister said so clearly, it would require a tremendous amount of work and a large staff to cover that field, i.e. the world, as well. I therefore want to ask the Minister to retain the definition in clause 1 as it stands at present. It is unnecessary to add this definition that is proposed by the hon. member.</p>

<p>Amendment put and negatived.</p>

<p>Clause, as printed, put and agreed to.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 18, after &#x201C;may&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after consultation with the council and&#x201D;; and in line 31, page 4, after Minister to insert &#x201C;after consultation with the council&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The first part of the amendment seeks to insert the words &#x201C;after consultation with the council and&#x201D; after the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in line 18. The clause will then read as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">2 (1) The Minister may, after consultation with the council and in consultation with the Minister of Finance &#x2026;</block>

<p>The clause then goes on to detail the actual powers which the Minister will have in terms of this clause. He will, <i>inter alia,</i> have the power to acquire and develop property, and to award bursaries and grants to people to encourage educational tours to foreign countries. He will also have the power to award bursaries to persons in other countries and to do various other things which, I believe should be carried out after consultation with this particular council which the Bill will bring into being. If one considers the composition of this particular council, it is quite clear that the members will be appointed by the Minister himself. I am quite satisfied that the hon. the Minister will only appoint the members on the basis that he has full confidence in them and that he feels that they are adequately qualified to carry out the duties which he has in mind for them and for which this Bill makes provision. I believe, therefore, that it will further the intentions of this Bill that the Minister should consult with this particular council. In clause 2 (3) (b), in line 23, we notice that the Minister has accepted in this particular instance, that consultation with the council has certain merit, because this particular subsection reads, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may&#x2014;&#x2026; (b) after consultation with the council subsidize or finance any services aimed at the attainment of the objects contemplated in the said section 3 (3).</block>

<p>So, with that in mind, I believe that it would be to the benefit of the working of the council if the Minister will accept this particular amendment. Referring to the second part of the amendment, i.e. in line 31 on page 4 after &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after consultation with the council&#x201D; subsection (5) of clause 2 will then read as follows &#x201C;a bursary or a grant or a subsidy or the financing of a service in terms of subsection (1) or (3) shall be subject to such conditions as the Minister after consultation with the council determines &#x2026;&#x201D; In subsection (3) of clause 3 the functions of the council are laid down and the subsection reads as follows: &#x201C;The functions of the council shall be to make recommendations to the Minister, of its own accord or at the request of the Minister, as to how the culture of the white population of the Republic may be best preserved, developed, fostered or extended &#x2026;&#x201D; I have indicated that the hon. the Minister should have confidence in his appointees and I believe that this will be a tangible way to show to the people appointed to this council, that the Minister has full confidence in them and that he intends, wherever possible, to consult with them and to consider the advice which they are prepared to offer. I believe that if it is put forward as amended there is no doubt as to the extent to which the consultation will take place.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 2 only deals with the acquisition of funds, and surely the hon. member will accept that this is so. To me it is unthinkable that a Minister who appoints councils and commissions will not ask these bodies for their advice and will not use their advice as a basis in calculating what the cost is going to be. Surely it is quite unnecessary to propose this amendment. After all, a Minister will not simply think up some fictitious amount and then go to the Minister of Finance and tell him that this is the amount he needs. This procedure is followed every year by every department in respect of every amount appearing on the Estimates. All the divisions of a department follow exactly the same procedure and prepare draft estimates first. The Minister considers these draft estimates and indicates which items should be increased or reduced and in this way the final and complete Estimates are prepared. For example, how would the Minister be able to say that a certain amount should be provided for bursaries and that a certain amount should be allocated to something else if he did not first consult these advisory bodies he had appointed? I submitted the amendment moved by the hon. member to the law advisers, who regarded it as unnecessary. This is such an unnecessary amendment to a Bill that anyone who has any legal knowledge would ask why we were so foolish as to insert it in the Bill. I have no legal knowledge myself, but I feel that I cannot expose myself to this. As I have said, I submitted the amendment to the law advisers, who said it was ridiculous. Under these circumstances I cannot dream of accepting it.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation and I also am not a legal expert, but from a purely practical point of view I believe that the amendment has certain merits. I believe that any body concerned with culture and appointed by people of the stature the hon. the Minister envisages will have experience which will be of value to the Minister and his department. I see no great practical difficulty when it comes to the question of acquiring property and awarding bursaries, whether they <span class="col_1917-1918" refersTo="page_0981"/>be for people coming from overseas or for people leaving South Africa, or to arrange for visits or official exhibitions, that these people will be able at a suitable time when the Minister is discussing the Budget with his financial advisers to put forward what they consider would be a reasonable programme to be carried out if and when the funds become available. It was on that basis that the amendment was put forward, because I believe that the hon. the Minister, with due respect to his ability, is not able to devote detail and his full attention to a council of this nature with the multifarious duties and responsibilities which he as Minister has to perform. Here is a case where it is possible under those circumstances to give the council which is being created in terms of this Bill the opportunity to place these facts before the hon. the Minister. I believe that these facts can only be of use to the hon. the Minister if he chose to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot understand the arguments advanced by the two hon. members. The essence of this Bill is the establishment of a national cultural council, which has to be consulted by the Minister. The hon. member now wants the words &#x201C;after consultation with the council&#x201D; inserted after the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; wherever it occurs. The Bill provides for an advisory body, and now the hon. member expects those words to be inserted every time the Minister is mentioned in the Bill. If the hon. member wants to be consistent: there are a few other instances, which I can point out to him, where the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; occurs and in respect of which he does not propose the insertion of these words. The hon. member should be consistent and insert the words there as well. I think it is quite unnecessary and superfluous to insert those words, because the entire Bill implies that the Minister has to consult the board every time.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, surely the hon. member for Berea has suggested a very reasonable amendment. The hon. the Minister has himself said that he is going to consult them anyway and, therefore, why not have it in the Bill. The hon. the Minister has already said that in relation to these powers he has in clause 2 that they really were confined to those matters set out in clause 3, subsection (3). They are clearly not confined to those matters and I think the hon. the Minister appreciates this. The powers he has under clause 2 are not confined to the matters referred to in clause 3 (3). If it was his first thought that they might have been confined to those matters he should consult with the advisory board who deals with those matters. The hon. the Minister has to deal with a matter which concerns the white population of the Republic. I am wondering whether the hon. the Minister is listening to me or to the hon. the Minister of Transport. [Interjections.] Can the hon. the Minister speak with two cultures at the same time? Surely the hon. the Minister appreciates that something should be done here. He talks about the culture of the English-speaking people and the culture of the Afrikaans-speaking people. I grant him all this, but what I want to say is that here this hon. Minister is going to create, for example, a Chair in the university for the furtherance of the culture of the white population of the Republic. The hon. the Minister is an Afrikaans-speaking Minister and his culture is within that group, is that of an Afrikaans-speaking member of the Republic. Why, then, does he not consult with a board so that any views he might have which do not coincide with the culture of the whole of the population can be tested? Because, surely, he should test his views against that. To endow a Chair is very important. But it is also important to know what sort of Chair he is going to endow. What sort of Chair will he endow? Remember, he will do it on his own, i.e. without consulting anyone. I hope, therefore, the Minister can give us some indication of the type of Chair he has in mind. It is this sort of thing which requires that one should consult with members of the other language group of the white population of the Republic. Because we are dealing with the entire white population; that is why I want a definition. We are dealing with the white population of the Republic and their culture.</p>

<p>No, Sir. We have already decided that we are not going to have a definition. That is all the more reason why there should be consultation with a committee which should be representative, and presumably is going to be representative, of all groups constituting the white population. The hon. the Minister has an amendment on the Order Paper on another clause. He talks <span class="col_1919-1920" refersTo="page_0982"/>about &#x201C;bilingual&#x201D; people who are aware of the culture of the groups.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Surely, Mr. Chairman, I am entitled to refer to something else with the object of producing an example which has relevance to my argument? That is all I am doing. There is the example. Well, the hon. the Minister may regard himself as being such a person, i.e. as one having knowledge of the cultures of the two white population groups. On the other hand, he may not be such a person. But if he proposes to appoint a committee consisting of members who do have knowledge of all the cultures, then he should be obliged to consult that committee. As I have said, the hon. the Minister may regard himself as being such a person. On the other hand, I may not regard him as being such a person. What is more, the hon. the Minister will have a successor one day and that person may not have the same views as this hon. Minister. My point is that the Minister has absolute power under this clause. It is not necessary for him to consult with anybody whatever, except with the Minister of Finance. But what grounds can there possibly be for the Minister not consulting with the Advisory Board which he proposes to set up and which is to be representative of all the various aspects of the culture of the white groups in South Africa?</p>

<p>Sir, this amendment is not only reasonable but on the Minister&#x2019;s own utterances, one which he ought to accept.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, allow me to say the following. I want to repeat what I said in the first place, i.e. that any body which is created for the purpose of advising, will be consulted in connection with every relevant matter. In the second place, if the hon. member for Berea had proposed that it should take place &#x201C;in&#x201D; consultation with the council, the argument advanced by the hon. member for Durban (North) would have made some sense. However, as long as one talks of &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D;, the Minister may approach the council, consult it and thereafter simply ignore its advice. As I have said, if the amendment of the hon. member read &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D;, it would have made some sense because the Minister would then have been obliged to accept the advice.</p>

The reason why I raised this was merely to show that if the hon. member for Berea had proposed it in the first place, the argument advanced by the hon. member for Durban (North) would at least have made some sense. However, as the amendment reads now, the hon. member is talking nonsense. By way of summary, I therefore want to say that I regard this amendment as quite unnecessary. It has neither value nor significance, because the advisory body will be consulted as a matter of course in any case. After all, this is the reason for its existence.</p>

<p>Before saying anything further about this amendment, there are one or two questions I should like to put to the Minister. In clause 3 (3) it is stated that the functions of the council will be to make recommendations to the Minister as to how the culture of the white population of the Republic may best be preserved, developed, fostered or extended. Then four fields (a), (b), (c) and (d) are demarcated, and then these words follow, &#x201C;and such other fields as the Minister from time to time determines on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission&#x201D;. Why should the Public Service Commission be brought into the picture here at all? That is my first question. My second question is what the &#x201C;other fields&#x201D; actually are.

<p>It is difficult for us to decide whether we should approve of something if we do not know what the Minister is up to. In any case, I have already moved the amendment to this clause which I wanted to move. The Minister himself has an amendment on the Order Paper, and when he moves it, we will give our opinion on it. Nobody will object to it being prescribed that a member of the cultural council should have a knowledge of the two official languages and the cultures of the two white population groups. To my mind that is self-evident.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, Mr. Chairman. I would then like to refer to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech, and I just want to say that nobody has the least objection to the members of this cultural council being bilingual. In the second reading the hon. Minister stated it to be his view that we were clearly dealing with two groups in South Africa, with two languages and two cultures. I notice a contradiction in the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attitude, because as soon as we insist that the hon. the Minister should recognize the duality of South Africa in this respect in the appointment of public councils, then the Minister states, as he did in his Second Reading speech, that the time is past when one should still ask what a person&#x2019;s home language is.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I did not use the word that the time was past when one should still see what a man&#x2019;s home language is. I said it was time we asked ourselves whether the man understood both languages.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the Minister also stated clearly that we had reached a stage of national unity where one no longer had to make appointments on the basis of a person&#x2019;s home language. That, at any rate, is how I understand the Minister, but if I am wrong, I will be pleased, because I then take it that the Minister will support this amendment. What is at issue here is the question that when it comes to appointments to a council, and we are dealing here with two distinct groups, then it is not merely a question of bilingualism. It is a question of different interests. After all, we must accept the fact that an Afrikaans speaking and an English-speaking person displays a measure of partiality for what is his own. The Minister, who is sitting there as an Afrikaans speaking person, is after all partial to that which belongs to the Afrikaans culture, or is he not? I am prepared to state that as far as I am concerned, without my doing an injustice to the other man, I as Afrikaans speaking person am partial to what is Afrikaans. Now, the point is that when the hon. the Minister appoints members to a council, the entire council can, as this clause is phrased at present, consist of Afrikaans speaking people only. The Minister must remember that what is concerned here is a cultural council, in regard to which people from the two language groups are sensitive. One would not like to have the idea take root that one was being favoured above the other. Since one is dealing with the two groups and since one would like to see that justice is done to both, it is obvious that the Afrikaans speaking persons on that council will be partial to what is their own. In order to eliminate any difficulty in future, we should like to see the Minister recognize the fact that one has these two groups and that in the constitution of that council one has members who are Afrikaans as well as English speaking; in other words, as I put it there, that full regard should be had to the bilingual character of South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I will just have to make use of the same method as that used by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, i.e. to say something more about clause 3 before I come to the amendment. The hon. member asked why one should appoint more people from outside if one has a council and bring in even more people from outside as committees. It would be quite impossible for members of this Cultural Council, who will be appointed, to be experts in every sphere. There will be a commission on youth work, a commission on the art of writing, on poetry, on prose, on drama, and on music, on opera and on ballet. How is one going to have all these facets represented in the Council if one does not bring in the experts from outside? That is the intention, and nothing more. It will not be such a big council. These people will have to be advised. Even if I were, for example, to appoint one person for each of these facets to such a council, one would still be unable to accept the one person&#x2019;s opinion as the authoritative opinion. By this time I have seen, working only with the plastic arts, what tremendous differences of opinion can exist among artists in only one group. The same applies to any category of one&#x2019;s arts and one&#x2019;s culture. There are no two people <span class="col_1923-1924" refersTo="page_0984"/>who have the same opinion on painting, for example. The one says this is excellent, and the other says that is excellent; this matter is unsatisfactory, and that is better. That is the reason for this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, but you misunderstood me. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister why he cannot simply issue an instruction to the Cultural Council in regard to what he wants. Why must the Minister appoint the commissions instead of instructing the council as to what he wants and leaving the appointment of the various commissions to them?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But the commissions must make recommendations to the council. How can the council appoint that commission to make a recommendation to it? [Interjection.] That is something else again. After all, somebody must do it. But one cannot establish an advisory board and then instruct the advisory board to constitute a commission. You would be surprised if you worked with this kind of thing in practice. The best thing to do is to struggle hard to get into power and to get into a ministerial position where you have to do administrative work and then obtain various opinions, particularly from artists. You would be surprised to know what goes on, and that is a good thing too. You do not only want one opinion. The Minister can never pretend to be an expert in that field, but he does have the power of judgment to be able to say: Here is a direction and that person represents this direction, and the other one represents that direction, and that is why it would be best to establish a permanent commission so as to get the best advice with the expert assistance of those people. I am very sorry, but I think that in practice these things work quite differently. It is precisely eight years now that I have been dealing with these matters and I know what the problems are. This is not merely being inserted here in order to give the Minister power; what happens in practice has proved it to be necessary.</p>

<p>The other question which the hon. member asked is what the Public Service Commission was doing there. The Public Service Commission is absolutely necessary when the functions of a Department have to be determined. It must go through to them and they must state that this function can now be expanded, because this council still remains part of the Department.</p>

<p>Now, as far as the amendment is concerned, I wonder whether the hon. member for Bezuidenhout knows and realizes what the result would be if I accept his amendment? His amendment reads as follows &#x201C;In the appointment of the members of the council referred to in subsection (2) and of the commission referred to in subsection (4) the Minister shall have regard to the bilingual character of the country&#x201D;. I wonder whether the hon. member for Bezuidenhout would accept that if it is stated like that, then I have the right to appoint unilingual Afrikaans-speaking and unilingual English-speaking persons to that council. Nowhere in the Bill will he be able to prevent me from doing so if I want to interpret that amendment of his in that way. Now I am asking him if that is the way he wants it?</p>

</speech>

<p>Certainly not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is why I say it is now time I moved my amendment. It is with pleasure that I move my amendment, as printed, and I just want to add this. I did not say what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout claimed I had said in my Second Reading speech. I must repeat those words I used. As I have already indicated during the Second Reading debate, I do not regard it to be in the national interest, and persons who are appointed ought to be thoroughly bilingual and ought to have a proper understanding of both national cultures. I elaborated on this by saying that only if this was the case and there was mutual understanding, a mutual appreciation and a mutual ability and urge to foster both cultures in every sphere, then only can we ask that we establish a joint cultural council, under one umbrella body, although two cultures, with two languages, which will gradually grow closer towards one another, are concerned in this. But sit down with a few unilingual Afrikaans-speaking persons and an equal number of English-speaking persons who, as far as I am concerned, are also unilingual, unilingual in this sense that they do perhaps have a working knowledge of either one or the other of the two languages, but they cannot sit on a cultural council if they are not properly grounded in both cultures, if they do not have an understanding and an appreciation and sympathy for these. One would then be looking for trouble, and there are going to be outbursts. That is why I say I cannot accept the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s amendment, and I think mine is the solution. Let me admit now that many of these councils are being appointed, and there is a certain tradition which is taking shape in these councils. I shall, to the utmost of my ability, look for these people to find these people in both language groups, and not only in one language group. That will be my endeavour. In fact, we have at present on these councils which are functioning without this Act, excellent persons, who are marvellously bilingual, doing the work, either from the English language group or the Afrikaans language group. Jointly, they are co-operating extremely well together. Therefore I want to state now that if we want to take a step forward, there should also be trust. Without trust we cannot progress at all, that is if we do not believe one another. This side of the House, with our true striving after national unity would be the greatest fools under the sun not to do so; we would be bringing about our own downfall. But that side of the House is sabotaging this because they have no faith in the Afrikaans-speaking or in the English-speaking people, and they have no faith in this Government.</p>

I am asking that we should not be suspicious in these cultural matters. I only said that if it would satisfy hon. members I would introduce this subsection. There was nothing in my original Bill. But it began during the Second Reading debate; then that suspicion began to crop up. What is one going to do now? The hon. member for Kensington was the first to be a party to this, and he reproached me. He said that on the Education Council I had not maintained the ratio between Afrikaans- and English-speaking persons. I told him what my problems were, and he knows it very well. This was elaborated on and then I said that to state it so that there could be no possible doubt, I was willing to come forward with an amendment. And now I am adding something to the amendment. If I am spared, I will appoint this first council; and with this amendment I will see to it that qualified Afrikaans-speaking and qualified English-speaking persons will be appointed to this council.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am afraid we are quarrelling here about something in regard to which no quarrel exists. I was eager to have the hon. the Minister move his amendment first because there can be no possible objection to it. The Minister&#x2019;s amendment deals with the question of the bilingual requirement for members of the Council; that we accept; we accepted it as being self-evident that a member on such a council should be bilingual. [Interjections.] No, these are two quite separate matters. The Minister is trying to create a contrast between things which are not in contrast to one another. These are two entirely different matters. We are entirely in favour of the provision that the members of the council should be bilingual. The hon. the Minister is a bilingual person; I am reasonably bilingual; but we are Afrikaans-speaking Afrikaners in the first place, part of the Afrikaans cultural group. I am now coming forward with a supplementary motion. We have no objection to the Minister&#x2019;s amendment. We thought it was self-evident that he would appoint bilingual persons, and since he has now incorporated it in the Act, we accept it. Thank you very much; we have no objection to it. But I am now dealing with another point, and my point is that we would like to make certain that this Council will be representative of the two cultural groups. Both must be bilingual. Sir, let me say this to the hon. the Minister, and he must not be perturbed at my having to say this to him: If there is suspicion then the hon. the Minister is to blame. One does not want to deal with this kind of matter all day. We insist that justice should be done to both groups, and as Afrikaans-speaking person I should particularly like to see that when Afrikaans-speaking persons are in power, they must see to it that justice is done towards the English-speaking persons. [Interjections.] I think it can be proved, in regard to the councils which the hon. the Minister appoints, that very little attention is being paid there to English-speaking groups. I am saying this in a friendly sense to the hon. the Minister, but what do we find if we examine the list of appointments which he makes to public councils?</p>

<p>Of course merit comes first. But what I find so strange is the inconsistency in the Minister&#x2019;s attitude. When it comes to recognition of the two groups he states that we are two distinct groups; we have a certain measure of separation in South Africa; there are English and Afrikaans schools. The language groups are divided into separate schools. Even in business undertakings one has the two language groups in separate organizations. It is no use denying it therefore. But what happens in regard to the appointment of councils? I do not want to do the hon. Minister an injustice in regard to what he said in the Second Reading debate, but it has happened repeatedly, when we raise this matter, that the Minister states: &#x201C;But we are all South Africans&#x201D;; then he does not want to know anything about the groups when he appoints people, and that is why I am just emphasizing in conclusion that we accept the Ministers amendment one hundred per cent. It does not clash with ours at all. We have another amendment. In our amendment we request that when he appoints people he must see to it that there is maintained a proper <span class="col_1927-1928" refersTo="page_0986"/>balance between people from the Afrikaans cultural group and people from the English cultural group, and this is particularly important when one is dealing here with a cultural Bill, in regard to which one is going to find a measure of partiality.

<p>Sir, I cannot quite understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty. He became quite emotional about this. I think he is shadow-boxing. He is seeing some difficulty that is not there. Why cannot he accept the amendment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout? In his own amendment he refers to the cultures of the two white population groups. What the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is asking is that he should recognize that representation should be given to these two groups, and therefore the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says that he should have regard to the bilingual character of the country. I hope the hon. the Minister will do that.</p>

<p>I do not think they are rival amendments. I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is quite right. We have discussed this question on many occasions, as the hon. the Minister knows. When we got the Minister&#x2019;s first advisory board, I made an analysis of it and I exposed the imbalance of that board, although the members were all bilingual. Everybody on the board was bilingual but still you had that imbalance, and we exposed it. It was accepted throughout the country that there was that imbalance. We still have it to a great extent, but that is by the way. We want to avoid that. We can appoint the people the Minister has in mind. We can appoint bilingual people and we can appoint people from both culture groups. Therefore I ask him to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I do not intend to do that; I only want to refer to the remarks that were made by the hon. member for Paarl. He spoke, first of all, about the introduction of these Bills. When I introduced my Bill I introduced it as a private member, and on the Government side they tried to have the Bill ruled out of order. Because in drafting the Bill I had been very careful to make no reference to any expenditure, it was not necessary to obtain a Governor-General&#x2019;s warrant, and therefore the Speaker ruled in my favour. I want to make it clear there was general opposition to my Bill. The opposition did not only come from one section of the House. When we came to the Government Bill, I had had the good fortune, with the hon. the Minister sitting opposite me, to serve on the commission. It is one of the finest experiences I have had since I have been in this House. We had certain information which was not available to all hon. members in the House. The public did not have all the statistics, as we had, and therefore people felt it was necessary to have another investigation into the probable cost. Therefore the Bill was not accepted as I was prepared to accept it at the time. That is all I have to say. I am sorry the hon. member for Paarl is not here.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we adjourned I was dealing with certain aspects of the Bill. I pointed out that the hon. the Deputy Minister had not given us sufficient information which would have made it possible for us to form a proper judgment of the merits of this Bill.</p>

<p>Before I return to clause 6 I want to refer to clause 7 where it is intended to ratify certain changes in the conditions of service of railway staff with retrospective effect. We get a clause like this almost every year, and the standpoint of the Opposition is known. Provided such legislation in respect of altered conditions of service benefit the staff we have no objections. But we have the strongest objection if we are asked to ratify irregular changes in conditions of service which are to the detriment of the staff. The Minister really should give us an idea of what this is all about and how it affects the staff. It appears from the research which we have undertaken that these four cases will benefit the staff, or are at least neutral. I shall be very pleased if the Minister confirms this when he replies.</p>

<p>I am returning now to clause 6, which is to my mind a very strange and remarkable clause. Here the House is being asked, by way of an amendment in a clause of a Bill, to increase the amount which was voted for the construction of a new railway line, which is intended to link up with the main line between Vryheid and Empangeni, from R40 million to R74,759,000. Why? What is wrong? In the Bill dealing with the Additional Estimates of 1965-&#x2019;66 we were informed that this railway line was going to cost R40 million. We were prepared to accept that this was a provisional figure and that it would probably be amended after further investigation. In the Brown Book of 1967-&#x2019;68 we were informed that a further R3,375,000 would be required. When we are asked to vote again for such a precise amount as R3,375,000, Parliament is inclined to accept that it is a scientifically determined figure and that we can accept that that is the basis of the Railway Administration&#x2019;s planning of that railway line, that their estimates in regard to whether it will be a paying proposition or not, and its economic value for the land is based on a capital investment of R4,375,000. But the next year we were requested in the Brown Book to vote a further, please note, R2,270,314. This is apparently a very accurate calculation, i.e. up to R314 on this amount of R40 million. We were probably entitled then to accept that it was an accurate, careful calculation of the capital cost of this new railway line. And now, can you believe it, we are being asked this year to appropriate an additional R29,114,046. First of all the R40 million jumped to R43 million then to R45 million and now to R74,759,360. Now I want to know from the hon. Deputy Minister, what was the value of the information which we received from the Railways and Harbours Board when we originally considered this railway line? What opinion must one have in respect of that? We are being told that this railway line will be used mainly for the transportation of ore and coal, mostly low tariff goods, where the profit margin is very slight. If the Railways and Harbours Board have erred virtually 100 per cent in their calculations, in their facts with which they came along to Parliament and asked for the matter to be approved, what do those estimates of theirs mean? Those estimates were not submitted casually to Parliament; they were submitted after what appeared to be a thorough investigation. The territory was visited by the Railways and Harbours Board. They flew over the territory in a helicopter. They scrutinized it thoroughly. They spend hundreds, thousands of rand on the investigation, and stated that the costs would amount to R40 million, R43 million or R45 million. In the report of the Railways and Harbours Board this year, we learn that they have wasted their time and the country&#x2019;s money, as well as the Railway&#x2019;s money. I want to read to hon. members from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be noted that the total cost of the complete railway line is now estimated at R74,759,360, as against the original estimate of R39,809,400. As is evident from the foregoing paragraph, however, the proposed amendment and extension of the route between point A and D&#x2014;the subject matter of this report-&#x2014;will not materially affect the total cost of the entire project. The considerable increase of almost R35 million over the original estimate is attributed to other factors and is, therefore, not an issue here. The Board, nevertheless, wishes to invite attention to the indication in its original report that the estimate compiled at the time of the cost of the construction as well as the route of the line was based on preliminary estimates and an observation of the area over which the line was to be constructed, the reason being that a detailed survey, had at that stage, not yet been completed.</block>

<p>Why did they then come to Parliament with the accurate figures, accurate up to R314, if it was an estimate and not based on thorough investigation? The report reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The survey work has, however, not yet been completed and the present estimate of R74,759,360 will, therefore, have to be revised as soon as the survey is completed and full details of all requirements are known. It will, furthermore, be noted that the overall length of the railway line is now calculated to be only 127 miles, as against the originally estimated length of 135 miles.</block>

<p>The shorter the railway line, the more expensive. For every mile the railway line becomes shorter, the amount becomes a few million <span class="col_1933-1934" refersTo="page_0989"/>rand more. What kind of calculations and way of running things is this? Here follows the most priceless sentence in the report of the Railways and Harbours Board&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The decrease of approximately eight miles is attributable to the fact that it has since been possible to determine distances with a greater degree of accuracy.</block>

<p>In other words, they are asking Parliament to appropriate millions of rand, they tell us that they made such an accurate estimate that they could estimate it to the last three figures, and now we learn that they were not even able to determine the distances with any degree of accuracy. What is the Railways and Harbours Board doing? What services is the Railways and Harbours Board rendering to the Railways and to Parliament? By now we have not learnt to live with the idea that politicians are appointed to the Railways and Harbours Board, who do not necessarily possess the ability to undertake this extremely technical and complicated financial and exacting work. Is it not possible to have at least one of the three members of that Railways and Harbours Board, who is a financial expert, to assist the politicians?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, there are two politicians and one academician. There is not one man with practical experience of financial management and the operation of the South African Railways. [Interjections.] I have respect of these men. I have nothing against them personally. I may not do so to-day, but the time will come when I shall quote further examples of where the information, on the basis of which Parliament is being asked to appropriate millions and millions of rand for the construction of railway lines, is totally worthless, meaningless and entirely removed from reality and the facts. After all one cannot have such little regard for Parliament. One cannot act so irresponsibly by asking the public to appropriate money for certain objectives without having knowledge of these things. After all it indicates inefficiency if one has to admit every year that one made an incorrect calculation of not one or two per cent, but almost 100 per cent. Any private undertaking which is assisted by advisors who made such a hash of their work would fire them immediately. The Minister must remember&#x2014;I am now speaking to the hon. the Minister himself&#x2014;that according to the Railways Act and the Constitution of South Africa, it is expected of him to manage the Railways on business principles. But where do business principles come in when one misleads one&#x2019;s board of Directors in this way? I am not saying that the hon. the Minister is doing this deliberately, but out of ignorance, incompetence and inability. The hon. the Minister does not have the ability to see that he is being misled. He submits those figures to Parliament in good faith, but time after time he sees that he has been misled and nevertheless he does nothing about it. What must one think of that?</p>

<p>The United Party does not want to oppose this Bill in principle, because the work must be done. However, we want to ask the Minister to talk to the Administration, and particularly the Railways and Harbours Board and ask them to do their work thoroughly and properly. The hon. Minister must ask them to furnish facts and information to Parliament on the basis of which we can form a judgment and not to furnish information of that nature, which is not even worth the paper it is printed on. I hope that we will in future receive better and more scientific information from the bodies concerned.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to support the hon. member who has just spoken in regard to the Richard&#x2019;s Bay-Vryheid line. But before doing so I want to refer to clause 4 of this Bill. Clause 4 provides for an increase in the surcharge to be payable in respect of persons travelling without tickets. When the hon. the Minister was speaking, the hon. member for Yeoville interjected to ask whether this could be applied. The hon. the Minister then said that the surcharge was being applied and administered and that there was no problem. I do not think that the hon. the Minister knows what the situation is. The hon. the Minister travels down in his coach, air conditioned and with canaries, but I suggest that the hon. the Deputy Minister who introduced this Bill should go and have a look at a certain train which travels from Durban to Johannesubrg on Sundays. I have looked at it because I was asked by conductors who said that it was a disgrace that they should be asked to man that train. The corridors and the coaches of that train are so jammed with people that it is physically impossible for any official to go through that train without virtually standing on bodies. It is jammed particularly in the night when it traverses the Newcastle section, so much so that it is called by a name that would shock this House if I should use it, and I will use the euphemistic name. It is known as the African Mail or Bantu Mail except that the railwaymen do not call it that. They call it another sort of mail. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister how he is going to impose this surcharge when trains are run so overpacked with people that it is impossible for a ticket examiner to get to the people and check whether they have tickets? It is dangerous for ticket examiners to try it on many occasions and they are not prepared to risk their lives for it. I suggest that the hon. the Minister asks some of the ticket examiners and instead of flying over he must get down to the rails and have a look at what is going on sometimes.</p>

<from><span class="col_1935-1936" refersTo="page_0990"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That would be a wonderful idea. I was wondering the other day what sort of job we could get for some of the Deputy Ministers. Let the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport try collecting tickets. [Interjection.] I would have an even greater problem than he would have and I am sure I would not be as suited for the task as the hon. the Deputy Minister would be.</p>

<p>We are being asked to vote a provision which the hon. the Minister blithely says is being carried out without any difficulty. I want to question that statement. Could the hon. the Minister tell me in what percentage of cases this is being carried out? The hon. the Deputy Minister just says that it is being carried out. What evidence has he to support that statement? I have taken the trouble to have a look at one of these overcrowded trains and I think that a great deal more must be done in regard to providing barriers and automatic ticket machines, in other words, payment before getting onto the train. One can control people getting onto the train and also getting off through barriers on the stations, but this sort of surcharge is not going to solve the problem. To ask ticket examiners to apply this control in practice is not going to work in hundreds of cases.</p>

<p>I think we should go further. Where there are cases such as this Kaffir Mail as it is known, extra trains should be put into use in order to get some of the load off the train. Such overcrowding is unhygienic. Passengers literally sleep in the corridors and I am told that they even sleep in the toilets although I have not seen that myself because I did not go into the toilets.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>One could not get into it because of the people lying in the passages. They jammed into the compartments and corridors. Surely the Railways could do something about that sort of situation. The problem will not be solved by pushing up the surcharge by two cents or even 50 cents. I also suggest that the hon. the Deputy Minister should do more homework and not come with theoretical solutions to problems when he suggests measures in this House.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the question of pipelines which is referred to in clauses 1, 2 and 3. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is the intention of the Administration in view of the expanded power, to build pipelines for solids, liquids or gases and whether it is the intention of the Administration to build pipeline terminals at sea? I would not be allowed by you, Mr. Speaker, to deal with the controversy which is taking place at the moment in Durban in regard to the potential danger from pollution and the discussions between the Durban City Council and certain oil companies in regard to a pipeline terminal at sea but I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether it is the intention of the Government either to build or operate any such terminals, other than that at Mossel Bay, themselves, or whether it is their intention to link up the pipeline at Richard&#x2019;s Bay with a terminal at sea pending the deep water berths for large tankers which will be coming there?</p>

<p>Finally I want to return to clause 6 with which the hon. member for Yeoville dealt. I want to ask, now that the Railways and Harbours Board has been able to measure the route, whether the hon. the Deputy Minister is satisfied that this strange sort of line which gets more expensive as it shortens&#x2014;it is eight miles shorter and R37 million more expensive&#x2014;has now been determined finally? I accept the statement of the board that there may be revisions. I am talking about the alignment and the location of the line and not about the detailed surveys which will still have to take place. Like the hon. member for Yeoville I think it is a disgrace that we should have to face this sort of request from the hon. the Minister. But how far have we got certainty in regard to this matter? There is the question of the terminal, for instance, the terminal point is now no longer to be at the originally planned terminal but is to have its own marshalling yards, etc. How much is this linked up with the planning of Richard&#x2019;s Bay itself? To what extent has the hon. the Minister of Planning&#x2019;s department and the hon. Minister of Transport consulted in regard to the layout of the new city of Richard&#x2019;s Bay, the location of the various industrial areas, etc., and to what extent does this new planned terminal point fit in with that plan? To what extent has consideration been given to the control of this line over the hundred miles or so where it passes through Bantu areas? These are the aspects on which I feel that the hon. the Deputy Minister should give us some information before coming to ask us for this tremendous increase of nearly 100 per cent for a line about which they told us, when they originally asked for R40 million, that they knew exactly what they were going to do about it. We support the building of this line and therefore we will support the voting of the money, but we do not support the inefficiency with which it is accompanied.</p>

This measure, which provides for an increase in the amount to be paid by persons who travel without tickets, is in fact designed to prevent these people from simply getting onto that train without having made reservations and then simply overloading the train.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned a second point as well, i.e. the question of the Richard&#x2019;s Bay railway line. If the hon. member had taken the trouble to go and inspect that terrain, he would not have raised any objection, because he would have realized that any advance calculation could only be more or less correct.</p>

The cost of building these bridges was calculated in advance, but after the washa-wavs in the area between Vryheid and the 45-mile point more bridges had to be built, and the cost will therefore be much greater.

<p>It would perhaps have been a good thing if hon. members had gone to take a look themselves, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) claimed he did in the case of the over-crowded trains, because then they would have had a better idea of the problems which crop up there. It has been suggested that there ought to be better planning and that there ought to be more trains running. Before sitting down I want to repeat that if the Railway authorities and the planners of that section are not aware of the number of passengers who are going to make use of the train service, it is an absolutely impossible task for any Minister or department to determine how many trains should be provided to convey the stream of Bantu passengers. I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his staff, in spite of the fact that the hon. member for Durban (Point) objects, because if he looks at the statements and the legislation, he ought to be extremely grateful for all the money which is being pumped into Natal by the Railways Administration to make a decent province of Natal as well. Then he should not make a fuss at all, but should only say in gratitude, &#x201C;Thank you for all your trouble and for the communications which you are providing for us.&#x201D; Instead of doing that, he complains and quarrels over petty matters when he has not even checked them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the few remarks made by the hon. member for Vryheid, and I will come back to those remarks presently. I want to deal with clauses 1, 2, 3 and 5 which refer to the pipeline. While we agree to support the Bill it does leave me puzzled as to which pipeline is being discussed in the Bill; in which direction will it flow, in other words where will it lead to and from what point?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>What pipeline are you referring to?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>This is the point. I would like to know what pipeline is referred to in the Bill, and I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us what pipeline the Bill refers to? We know that due to circumstances which could not be foreseen at the time the Act was passed, for petroleum liquids and other liquids to flow through the pipeline, the hon. the Deputy Minister now has seen fit to ask Parliament to amend it to allow solids to flow through the pipeline. He does not mention which pipeline nor the kind of solids. The Bill gives no description, however. Representing an area which has been discussed so often recently, namely the Border area I naturally think in terms of border industries and in particular the third Iscor. I am beginning to wonder whether the reply the hon. the Deputy Minister will give us is not in fact that the third Iscor will be situated in the Border area, on the Berlin Flats. We want the hon. the Deputy Minister to explain to us what solids will flow through the pipeline in question. It is no use saying that he wants an amendment to the Act, allowing pipelines to convey solids. Yesterday one of our Opposition speakers, who was wondering how and what fluids will be used to force the solids through the pipeline, mentioned water as a possibility. I myself have seen brine water being pumped through pipelines where we have large salt pans. When one thinks in terms of brine water being pumped from one pan to another to produce salt, I see no reason why we cannot use sea water to force solids through pipelines. I am looking forward to the reply of the hon. the Deputy Minister in this regard.</p>

<p><span class="col_1939-1940" refersTo="page_0992"/>Clause 4, deals with excess charges on railway fares for passengers, the hon. member for Vryheid endeavoured to reply to my colleague, the hon. member for Durban (Point). He in fact insinuated that there was no discord or disorganization or disorganized traffic on that particular line, the &#x201C;African Mail&#x201D;, running from Vryheid to the coast. Now, I happen to know of another train too which is called the &#x201C;Milk Train&#x201D;. This train runs from Johannesburg to the Transkeian territories and East London. There, too, I know because I speak from personal experience as I have moved through those corridors with some of our conductors, I can assure you I do not envy them their difficult task. I also know that many Bantu jump the train after it has left the station. I also know that some Bantu are transported by these trains to the Transkei and East London without paying a cent&#x2014;let alone excess charges on their rail fare&#x2014;by virtue of the fact that it is very difficult for any ticket examiner to enter a coach while it is in motion, trying to find out who does not hold a ticket. I have been with some of them and I know that it is an unenviable task. This is a very difficult problem, but I would follow the suggestion made by my colleague, the hon. member for Durban (Point), i.e. that we should have &#x201C;access points&#x201D; and in this way we should be able to prevent many of these people from having access to the trains. As the hon. member for Vryheid has said, many of them board the train at a stage when there is no reserve accommodation. I know that this has been done, it has even been done by Whites. But we must find ways and means of circumventing it. Just by passing an amendment to a clause on excess charges, is certainly not going to solve the real problem at all. I can assure the House that we will come back next year and that we will have to pass more amendments in this regard. We still will not have solved the problem, unless you listen to suggestions made by us, from this side. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>In regard to clause 6, the new railway line has already been mentioned here in detail and I do not want to repeat what has already been said. Concerning the construction of the new railway line between Vryheid and Empangeni, i.e. to the Richard&#x2019;s Bay area, I heard the hon. Minister mention last year that he was very impressed with the layout at Richard&#x2019;s Bay; in fact, he said he knew of no better natural harbour on our South African coast. Well, Mr. Speaker, it may be a natural harbour, but we will have to spend vast sums of money before Richard&#x2019;s Bay harbour can be usable to any extent. What worries me is that we have already well-developed harbours on our coasts, which are not operating to the extent that one would like to see them operate. I mention East London in particular. East London harbour seldom operates to full capacity.</p>

<p>Then I come back to Richard&#x2019;s Bay, Mr. Speaker, which obviously is the point in mind, because it so happens to be closer to Johannesburg than any other harbour. But it does surprise me that this large sum of money should be spent on the Richard&#x2019;s Bay-Vryheid line, or the Empangeni-Vryheid line, an amount of R74,759,360, where originally the estimate was R39,809,400.

<p>My remarks will be brief and to the point. I do not wish to labour the points that have already been made, but I would say that the Minister has been at fault, when 12 months ago he asked for R39 million to build a railway line and now he comes forward with a revised Estimate of R74 million. I am quite sure that before it is finished it will cost nearer R100 million. I wonder what would have happened had he come to Parliament last year and asked for R100 million. I believe the great shortcoming of the Government is that the planning and the estimating are not anywhere near as close and as fine as they should be. It is all very well for us to sit here and vote away millions and say, as the hon. member for Vryheid said: &#x201C;Die brug is weggespoel&#x201D;. [Interjection.] The point I am trying to establish is that all these factors must have been known. The Railway staff, the officials and the engineers, know their business very well indeed. I cannot for a moment believe that a specification which must have been drawn up for the construction of this line could have been so faulty as to be only half of what the costs were going to be only 12 months later.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>I accept your ruling, Sir. I should like to touch on this question of the <span class="col_1941-1942" refersTo="page_0993"/>surcharges. I think the psychology of imposing surcharges in this way is at fault and I want to suggest a solution which I think will be a happier one for all concerned. Overseas, especially in Britain and on the Continent, when there are periods of high traffic, efforts are made to accommodate all passengers who wish to travel by a particular train, or other transport. I know that the Minister has difficulties with staff and personnel, but why does he not consider giving a discount, a reduction, to the man who buys his ticket at the station, instead of surcharging the man who gets on and who, through no fault of his own, has got to board the train because he has to get to work. I put it to the Minister that the correct approach to matters of this kind would be better handled psychologically, by offering discounts to do the correct thing, and not by imposing penalties when people get into a train if they simply have to do so. If these people do not get to Johannesburg on time they lose their jobs, and I believe that the Railways has had sufficient experience on this particular route, and others, where the traffic could be more accurately assessed. I think the time is long overdue where, at these stations where this traffic is expected, the installation of ticket machines should be considered and introduced. It is a common custom everywhere else. I often wonder when we are going to arrive at the point in this country when access to railway stations shall be only by way of the purchase of a ticket. Then half the problems with which the Minister is faced will be removed.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize one final point. The conditions under which these third-class passengers travel are such that I firmly believe that the Minister is aggravating and upsetting people who honestly and genuinely want to travel on the railways. It has been said that it is difficult to collect these small amounts, and it is a nuisance. I feel the Minister should realize that third-class passengers, Bantu passengers, are really customers. I think the time is overdue when he should look at it from the angle of doing the job for these people in a way which will make them happy, instead of them being frustrated and annoyed.</p>

<p>Finally, I hope the Minister will give us some indication in regard to the pipe-lines. There is mention of pipe-lines for solids and gases, and I am very interested to know what type of pipe-line will be constructed for the conveyance of solids. If the Minister will satisfy us on these few points, we will be happy to give our approval.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>At the end of his speech the hon. member for Yeoville said that the Railways must be conducted as a business undertaking by the Minister, but now the hon. member for Karoo comes along and suggests that an article which one sells, i.e. a ticket for which a price is fixed, must be sold at a discount. Is this the kind of business which those hon. members want? [Interjections.] Nowhere in any transport system is business conducted in that way. But the hon. members are so unpractical in coming forward, like the hon. member for Durban (Point), and saying that we must have a system of gates where people can obtain their tickets before boarding the train. Surely they know that we have such a system on the large stations. But this excess charge is not something new that is being asked for. This excess charge is in force in terms of section 10 of the Consolidation Act, Act No. 70 of 1957. It has been there all these years, but when the fares were increased, we had to make a new adjustment in respect of what the excess charge should be, and that adjustment has already been made in the tariff book. All that is being asked here is that that adjustment in the tariff book be sanctioned. Do the hon. members want to debate that now? Do they not want the Railways to ask a man who boards the train without a ticket to pay an excess charge? It is a kind of fine for having done so. And now they read into the Bill that it will only apply to Bantu passengers and third class passengers, but it applies to any passenger, except the hon. members sitting here who have free passes. It also applies to a passenger who purchased a ticket up to a certain place and then wants to travel further than that place. Then he must also pay an excess charge, because he purchased the wrong ticket and as a result is burdening the ticket examiner with the extra work of filling in forms, etc. Now the hon. members read into this that it only applies to third class passengers, Bantu. We know that some Bantu adopt this method of waiting until the train is full and then jumping on, and we know what a difficult task the ticket examiners have. But it is not only the Bantu who do so; Whites also do so at times. Do the hon. members now want to debate about that, and do they want to make it more difficult for the ticket examiners to collect this additional excess charge? No, that is not the way to talk about a matter of business.</p>

<p>The hon. members asked certain questions and now I first want to deal with the other matter. Under clause 7 the hon. member for Yeoville said that he would like to know whether these conditions of employment which we now have to sanction were an improvement, because if they were to the detriment of the staff he would not agree to them.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall give the confirmation. They are, for example, in respect of payment to people who work on public holidays. They are, for example, in respect of people going on special leave for defence purposes, so that they may still receive the necessary payment, etc; it is to make provision for &#x201C;special leave on defensive duties&#x201D;. All these conditions of employment which we are asking the House to sanction are for the <span class="col_1943-1944" refersTo="page_0994"/>benefit of the staff. I hope this satisfies hon. members.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with the pipeline story. The hon. members spoke about doing one&#x2019;s homework, but if there are people who did not do their homework, they are all those who spoke about this pipeline. No mention is made in this Bill of a pipeline which is going to be built. The Bill only provides that if the S.A. Railways should find it necessary to construct a pipeline to convey solids, gases or liquids, it may be constructed, as you already have in the Act in respect of the pipeline for the conveyance of oil. Nowhere in the Bill is reference made to specific pipelines or to places where we are going to construct pipelines, and nothing of the kind is being planned at the moment either. Preliminary steps are merely being taken so that we may do so if it should become necessary in the future. I think I have clarified this matter now. Other private bodies can also construct pipelines to convey artificial fertilizers, etc., but one must ensure that the S.A. Railways has the legal authority to do that kind of thing if it wants to. We have no planning up our sleeves at the moment. There is no secret or concealed planning here that we do not want to disclose.</p>

<p>The hon. members all tried to make out a very strong case in respect of the increased cost in respect of the Vryheid-Empangeni line, and then the hon. member for Yeoville almost overstepped the mark in attacking the members of the Railways and Harbours Board by accusing them of incompetence and of inefficient action, etc. He asked what kind of people we appointed. Let us look at the work these people do. In conjunction with the Minister they handle the entire economic structure of the Railways in all its aspects. They handle the problems of the entire staff. In other words, one must have people who are conversant with economics. Dr. Botha has a doctor&#x2019;s degree in economics. I want to ask hon. members on that side who made this accusation so blatantly whether one of them knows more about economics than Dr. Botha does? The other two members of the Railways Board are practical men who were initially elected to this House and were subsequently appointed to the Railways Board because of their knowledge of Railway affairs, staff matters and human relationships. They gave clear evidence of being the proper persons for appointment to the Railways Board. Sir, the hundred thousand Railway workers that we have in the country trust these three members of the Railways and Harbours Board. They are doing excellent work in the interests of the Railways, in the interests of South Africa and in the interests of the staff, and therefore I find it reprehensible that hon. members should question the competence and the integrity of those Board members across the floor of this House.</p>

<p>Hon. members on that side said that they had not done their work, that they had merely engaged in guesswork, and if one does not do one&#x2019;s work, there is something wrong with one&#x2019;s integrity.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this railway was planned initially, it was only intended as an auxiliary service for the overloaded railway line to Durban. When the initial line was planned and submitted to the Railway Board, Richard&#x2019;s Bay had not yet come into prominence as a proposed harbour, and the foundry, which is going to lead to the establishment of a new urban complex there, had not yet come to the attention of the members of the Railway Board and the engineers who planned the initial line. But that is not all. Let us analyse the figures. In regard to the large increase in the number of bridges, which is responsible for an additional amount of about R14 million, I want to inform the House that at the time the original estimate of the cost was made, survey plans were available for only 40 miles (on the scale 3&#x00BD; inches = 1 mile) and the rest of the route was uncharted terrain for which use could only be made of photographs (on the scale 1&#x00BD; inches = 1 mile). In other words, when the Railway Commissioners went to the area by helicopter it was still uncharted.</p>

<p>They had to come to Parliament, because Parliament had to vote their money so that we could continue with the planning and Parliament had to approve the planning. When that amount was submitted to Parliament, it was expressly stated that it was an estimate. I go further. Normally for projects of this nature plans on the scale 12 inches = 1 mile are necessary, and here they had to work out a plan on the scale 1&#x00BD; inches = 1 mile. This gives a totally new picture.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They had to make a submission to Parliament in order to obtain Parliament&#x2019;s approval for the construction of the railway line. In the circumstances the need for the large number of bridges and tunnels could not be determined. I want to point out that eight of the 70 large bridges which are necessary, are situated on the portion between point A on the route map and the junction on the Empangeni-Richard&#x2019;s Bay line, while 30 would have been necessary on the portion between A and Lokoza, i.e. the portion of the line which will no longer be constructed. In other words, here one now has 40 bridges as against 30, and eight bridges over that tremendously large water region. The lack of adequate survey plans which I mentioned here, is also largely responsible for the increase in the cost of earth-works and tunnels, <span class="col_1945-1946" refersTo="page_0995"/>and here one must therefore again add R4 million. In addition the terrain through which the route goes proved to be exceptionally rough, so much so that there is twice as much earth-work and three times as much bridge-work on this line as on the line from Metzi to Kaapmuiden, which also runs through rough terrain. Hon. members themselves know that if one flies over a region to draw up one&#x2019;s provisional route&#x2014;and the members of the Railways Board are not engineers; they are not expected to be engineers&#x2014;one cannot determine all these facts immediately.</p>

<p>Additional important increases that I want to mention are R3&#x00BC; million for additional work on the permanent way which resulted from trade and industry requirements for which provision had not been made initially, i.e. 24 miles longer loops, one additional station and one extra large yard; R2 million and R1.75 million, respectively, for improved signalling and communications contemplated as a result of the findings of the technical mission which we sent overseas in 1966, which equipment will result in trains being carried through more quickly; and a further R5&#x00BD; million in respect of contingencies and interest which automatically arise from the increase in the cost of the railway line.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The statement that the figure of R74.8 million is still an approximation is correct. Until such time as detailed surveys and investigations into foundations have been completed and contracts awarded, the exact costs unfortunately cannot be determined. As a result of the remoteness of the area through which the new line passes and the abundance of work for contractors elsewhere in the country, contract prices tend to be higher than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether this was the final route. Initially the line was to have gone through from Lokoza to Empangeni. Now, as a result of the new development with the foundry and the larger area of Richard&#x2019;s Bay, there is an altogether larger shunting yard and an additional small shunting yard at the foundry, and one must take the line a little more to the north in order to run through the shunting yard. A planning committee, on which the Departments of Planning, Defence and other Departments are represented, made a thorough survey of the entire future development at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. I repeat that when the initial amount was submitted to Parliament by the Railways and Harbours Board, it was an estimated amount, based on the original idea that the line would be an auxiliary one for the overloaded Durban line. No decision had then been taken about the rest of the development. Mr. Speaker, we are not a static Government. If we start off by planning a certain railway line and new developments arise, we do not hide our heads in the sand like an ostrich. We do not continue with the construction of the line as originally planned. We must adjust the planning to the new developments, taking into account the new information which has come to our disposal. This is the reason for this increased amount. I cannot see how hon. members opposite can blame the Railways Board and the Minister. If one considers the work that has been done, it is clear that the Minister, with the valuable assistance of the members of the Railways and Harbours Board and of his staff, is running the Railways purely on business principles. The great problem with hon. members opposite is that they are only sad and jealous that we do not have a greater deficit so that they can make a fuss about it here, and that is why they come forward with statements such as they did.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Sea-shore Act, 1935, empowers the Minister of Agriculture to make regulations for specific purposes in connection with the sea-shore and the sea and also to authorize any local authority to issue such regulations, subject to his approval, in respect of any portion of the sea-shore and the sea within the area of jurisdiction of such a local authority. This includes, <i>inter alia,</i> the use of the sea-shore and of the sea and the prescribing of fees for the doing of any act upon or in or in relation to the sea-shore or the sea.</p>

<p>Existing regulations provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that a local authority may set aside a place or places for the exclusive use of various kinds of boats or for the sole use of boats belonging to members of boat clubs; may prohibit the use or operation of any boat or kind of boat from certain portions of the sea-shore, and may differentiate between boats which belong to or are used by members of boat clubs and those which belong to or are used by persons other than members of such clubs. However, the legal advisors came to the conclusion that the provision in question is invalid in view of the fact that it conflicts with the legal principle that subordinate legislation cannot result in unequal treatment without specific authority.</p>

<p>The Provincial Administrations and local authorities concerned which were consulted in <span class="col_1947-1948" refersTo="page_0996"/>this connection were all agreed that differentiation should be made between (a) boats of different classes, (b) boats used for different purposes, and (c) boats falling under the control of boat clubs and those belonging to outsiders. The object of clause 1 of the Bill is to authorize such differentiation. The second clause provides for the delegation of the Minister&#x2019;s powers in respect of short-term control over the sea-shore, to officers in the service of the State.</p>

<p>The Act also empowers the Minister to let any portion of the sea-shore and the sea for specific purposes and subject to specific conditions, or to permit that any material be removed from or out of the sea or the seashore. Thus, for example, permission is granted under certain circumstances for letting for the purposes of the erection of beach facilities for the public, the construction of quays and landing stages, etc., the erection of buildings or structures and the execution of useful or essential works as well as for the removal of, for example, sea-weed shingle, etc. For the efficient execution of functions of this nature it is necessary that the Minister be empowered to delegate his authority in connection with short-term control over the sea and the seashore to officers of the State. The object of clause 2 of the Bill is therefore to provide for such powers.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister did not give us a very detailed explanation of the Bill. The Bill very clearly provides that distinctions can be made between the different classes, etc, but &#x201C;different classes&#x201D; is a very wide term, and one does not know how widely it may be interpreted. What I have in mind is this: We have apartheid on beaches. Can provision be made under the clause for the admission to beaches of members of another race group? One thinks, for example, of families visiting the beach area and who perhaps need a servant to look after the children. Can provision be made under this clause for such cases or not? It is not clear to me what is meant here by &#x201C;different classes&#x201D;. This term is too wide as it stands here and I hope that the hon. the Minister will enlighten us further in this connection.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens has made a point which I think requires to be cleared up. In the first place the Minister says that the provisions of this Bill apply to classes or kinds of users of the seashore and the sea, including tidal rivers and lagoons, etc., as provided for in the Sea-shore Act itself. I mave made inquiries from the Minister&#x2019;s Department and it seems that there is definitely some confusion as to whether kinds and classes also apply to races. I would like to emphasize the point made by the hon. member for Gardens, and that is that as things are at present, with the reservation of separate amenities on the beaches, there is a considerable amount of confusion as to whether the servants of users of the beaches are entitled to be present on beaches which have been demarcated, for example, for the use of the white race. I think if the Minister can clear this matter up, he will be doing us a service. On the other hand, I personally believe that under section 26 of the Group Areas Act and under the provisions of the Separate Amenities Act, that particular situation is in fact satisfactorily covered, but I would like to get clarity from the Minister on this matter.</p>

<p>Sir, on the question of classes and kinds of users of the beach, I should like to say a few words about the various uses to which our beaches are put at the moment. For the purpose of my discussion I want to divide the users of beaches into two categories. I would give as my first category those whose use is potentially a dangerous use with the possibility of their causing a nuisance to other users of the beach. In this category one thinks of speed-boaters, spear fishermen, surfers, ski-boaters, and yachtsmen, to say nothing of small boat users, catamaran and trimaran users, as well as those who have dinghies with outboard motors. There are obvious dangers attached to the use of a beach by any one of these potentially dangerous users. But I should like to express the hope to-day that the local authorities who are being given extended powers under the new sub-section (8) of section 10 of the Act, will not abuse the powers that are being given to them. It seems to me that many of the local authorities in South Africa are fast asleep when it comes to the potential of our natural amenities and our beaches in particular. They do not appreciate fully the natural assets which have been entrusted to their charge. When given the power to regulate conditions in areas under their control, their first reaction is to ban, and then they think. They seem to me to lack appreciation and imagination. In fact, many of our local authorities are still living in the Victorian age.</p>

<p>Our beaches to-day are used for many purposes, purposes which were not envisaged when local authorities were given control over them by the State. We have launching sites for small boats and ski-boats, etc., on most of our beaches in these parts, and the same applies to Natal and the Eastern Province. There is however a complete absence of small-boat harbours along our coast line, and small boat and ski-boat enthusiasts are forced to launch their craft from our beaches. In particular there seems to be an absence of appreciation at Government level as well as at provincial level, quite apart from local authority level, of the potential of our wonderful coast line and the useful purposes to which it can be put for the recreation of our people. Therefore I make a plea to the Government and to the provinces to appreciate what they administer and to develop their areas in accordance with the requirements of our people.</p>

<p>I think there is another category of users of our beaches, one which is not dangerous, but which can also cause a nuisance. In this respect I refer particularly to the trek netters <span class="col_1949-1950" refersTo="page_0997"/>along our coast line. We have also the perlemoen divers who frequently dump perlemoen when they have taken them out of the water. Then there are the rock lobster catchers with small boats operating from our beaches. The situation at Kommetjie, for instance, is one that is causing concern. There are also the seaweed collectors, to whom the Minister has already referred, as well as bait collectors, not only on the coast but also in the tidal rivers and the lagoons where they collect prawns, worms and other bait.</p>

<p>In so far as this proposed new subsection (8) gives local authorities the power to control unrestricted use of those areas, I think it deserves our support. In so far as it reinforces what I regard as our completely inadequate sea fisheries regulations concerning the collecting of bait, and the preservation of our marine flora and fauna, I think it too deserves our support. I believe that the people of this country have not so far appreciated what riches we have in the form of our long coast line from South-West Africa right around to Mo&#x00E7;ambique. I believe that as a nation we are in our infancy as regards appreciating this heritage. I refer the Minister to a recently published book called &#x201C;Farming the Edge of the Sea". I think that as Deputy Minister of Agriculture he will be quite surprised to see what methods have been employed overseas in exploiting the natural resources which we also have on our coast. With these few words I should like to bless this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. members for Cape Town Gardens and Simonstown touched upon a matter which I previously discussed with the hon. member for South Coast, who has a similar problem in his constituency. I said that we would very much like to help him solve his problems there at Margate, so that there would be certainty as to who was allowed to swim where. Powers have already been granted to the provinces in this regard, and I think the hon. member for Simonstown also mentioned it. There is the Separate Amenities Act of 1953, which grants the local authority or the province authority to determine who may swim where. I concede that there are certain matters which must still be cleared up, and we shall presently give attention to them. Let me assure the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens of that. This measure refers to &#x201C;classes or kinds of users of the sea-shore or the sea &#x2026;&#x201D;, and it might create confusion because hon. members might think that it also has to do with races. However, it has nothing to do with races. I think it was the hon. member for Simonstown who initially asked for this legislation because he had difficulties in his constituency as to who was allowed to surf where, etc.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The purpose of this amendment, which is actually a very minor one, is to amend section 5 (1) of the Wool Act of 1967 so that the names of the bodies who may nominate persons for appointment on the Wool Board are not specifically prescribed in the Act. At present section 5 (1) provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that, firstly, persons dealing in the course of trade with wool products will be represented on the board by one member and that the Associated Chambers of Commerce of South Africa and the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut will nominate that member after mutual consultation, and secondly, that the National Textile Manufacturers&#x2019; Association and The South African Worsted Manufacturers&#x2019; Trade Association will be represented on the board by one person and that the person concerned will also be nominated by the associations concerned after mutual consultation. Because the provisions of section 5 (1) are in this respect restrictive in nature, it means that the Act has to be amended whenever additional organizations demand recognition, as is the case at present, or even when one of the recognized organizations dissolves or changes its name. Therefore, in order to obviate the necessity of amending the Act in the future each time that changes occur, this amendment, as I have said, does away with the recognition given to specific organizations and the section is set out in more general terms.</p>

<p>However, it is not proposed to do away altogether with the existing recognition granted to the organizations concerned, but the Wool Act is merely being brought into line with the Marketing Act, where the discretion to recognize specific bodies as being representative of an industry is left to the Minister. As hon. members can see, this is only a minor amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House would like to support this measure. However, there is certain information which I should like to have from the hon. the Minister. I cannot imagine that there could ever be organizations other than the Associated Chambers of Commerce of South Africa and the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut to represent business interests. I should now like to know from the Minister whether this amendment was introduced merely to make provision for anyone to serve on the board. Does the Minister think that any other body, other than these two bodies, can represent trade? What I have just said is in connection with the first amendment in this Bill.</p>

<p>In connection with the second amendment, i.e. that contained in the new subsection (1) (d), I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that washers and decarbonizers of wool have always been or ought to be members of the National Textile Manufacturers&#x2019; Association. In the regulations in respect of the processing of wool these processes are all defined. If these people want to dissolve their associations every day, to establish a new association, for example an association of washers or combers, the legislation will have to be made so broad that they will all have to be co-ordinated. They will then only be able to nominate one person on the board. One of two things will then happen. Either they will not do so, or the Minister will have the power to consult with whomever he wishes. The hon. the Deputy Minister has not yet given us the assurance that, if the legislation is broadened in this connection, as contemplated, the Minister will consult with all the bodies defined as a result of this amendment. I should like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister if it is the intention with this legislation that all bodies dealing with the manufacturing of wool will be united, so that there will be one joint nomination. In this legislation two bodies are mentioned, but there is a third which has already applied for inclusion. Is the Deputy Minister going to make provision for all other bodies that may be added to be included, so that only one nomination will be made in respect of all those bodies? I have already mentioned other bodies which may still be added. What is the intention with this legislation, because here it is stated that the Minister can ask bodies, which he regards as representative, for nominations.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for East London (City) must not, as a result of this amendment, think that we want to deprive groups that are interested in this wool representation, of any privileges. This proposal actually comes from the Wool Board itself, for purposes of streamlining. The legal draftsmen also say that we should not mention the names of any specific organizations. There are so many bodies that would have to be mentioned. There are so many people who are interested in this that it would be much easier not to mention any names. I want to assure the hon. member for East London (City) that the Minister only acts in these matters as a result of recommendations and representations which he received from the interested groups concerned. No privileges are being taken away. The hon. member&#x2019;s last point was: Suppose another such association is added; must it then also be consulted? In such a case the Minister will be guided by recommendations of recognized organizations in the interest group concerned. If the organization which may originate in this way is so strong and operates so successfully that it deserves recognition, I believe that the Minister will recognize that body after consultation. We do not foresee that something like that will in fact happen, but I am merely mentioning it in case it does. The Minister&#x2019;s standpoint is to make this matter more streamlined. These bodies must still be recognized, but it is not necessary to mention all of them specifically in this Bill.</p>

<heading>MEDICAL, DENTAL AND PHARMACY AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill seeks to effect certain important changes in the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, (Act No. 13 of 1928). Amongst other things it relates to, firstly, the recognition of foreign pharmaceutical qualifications for registration purposes, and, secondly, the training of chemists and druggists in South Africa. Thirdly, it is aimed at transferring from the Medical Council and Pharmacy Board any responsibility in respect of the scheduling of drugs which are poisons, habit-forming drugs and potentially harmful drugs. Fourthly, it seeks to intensify the control of potentially harmful drugs, such as sleeping draughts, sedatives and stimulants. Fifthly, it relates to the supply of certain drugs to midwives. Sixthly, it is aimed at simplifying the procedure relating to the lodging and consideration of complaints in respect of accounts of medical practitioners and dentists. In addition to that provision is being made in the Bill for amendments in respect of several other matters, which, from experience, appear to be advisable as far as the implementation of the Act is concerned.</p>

<p>In all there are 11 aspects which are being covered by this Bill. I shall deal first with the six most important aspects. Firstly, as regards the question of the recognition of foreign pharmaceutical qualifications, section 22 of the Act stipulates that pharmaceutical qualifications obtained in foreign countries may only <span class="col_1953-1954" refersTo="page_0999"/>be recognized for registration purposes in the Republic if persons who are in possession of South African qualifications are allowed to practice in those countries&#x2014;i.e. in countries abroad&#x2014;without any further examinations. In other words, there must be reciprocity between the Republic and such countries in regard to these qualifications. Since the introduction of this Act the Pharmacy Board has never had any success in entering into reciprocal agreements with other countries, except the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The reason for this is not that South African qualifications are considered to be of a lower standard than those of foreign countries, but that those countries already have a sufficient number of qualified chemists and druggists. It is a protective measure for the sake of their own chemists and druggists. Consequently they are not anxious to encourage South African chemists and druggists to emigrate there.</p>

<p>As regards South Africa, the position is the exact opposite. Because of the rapid development and expansion of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in the Republic, there is a considerable shortage of qualified chemists and druggists who are experienced in the field of the manufacturing industry. Owing to the existing reciprocal provisions of the Act, it is not possible to eliminate this shortage by registering immigrants who are highly qualified but obtained their qualifications in countries with which the Republic has not entered into agreements of reciprocity. Owing to the shortage of qualified staff it is at present very difficult to fill vacancies for chemists and druggists at State and provincial hospitals.</p>

<p>The position in regard to the recruitment of foreign chemists and druggists has been aggravated owing to the fact that a year or so ago the British authorities decided to increase the requirements in respect of the academic training of chemists and druggists from three to four years, with a corresponding decrease in the practical aspects of training from two years to one year. In addition to that they decided that chemists and druggists who qualified in other countries, would have to sit for an examination in forensic pharmacy before they would be allowed to register in the United Kingdom. As a result of this the reciprocal agreement between the Republic and the United Kingdom lapsed. Therefore, it is no longer possible to register in this country chemists and druggists who are in possession of British qualifications. In the light of all these circumstances the Pharmacy Board as well as the Department of Immigration have made strong representations to the effect that the provision relating to reciprocity be deleted. To make sure that chemists and druggists who qualified in countries abroad, are conversant with the way this profession is practised in South Africa, the Pharmacy Board has proposed that such persons should pass an additional test before being registered in the Republic. This test will concentrate on forensic pharmacy and the practice of this profession in South Africa. In this regard it is the intention to introduce arrangements whereby prospective immigrant chemists and druggists will be able to sit for these tests at South African embassies abroad. The acceptance of this proposal, for which provision is being made in clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill, will have the effect that the recognition in South Africa of foreign qualifications for registration purposes, will be done purely on merit. However, the Pharmacy Board will not have absolute latitude in this respect, since the present provision, in terms of which no foreign qualification may be prescribed which is not at least equal in standard to recognized South African qualifications, will still apply. In addition to that the regulations in which foreign qualifications are laid down, must be approved by the Minister beforehend. So much as far as the question of reciprocity is concerned.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question of the training of chemists and druggists. There are two alternatives for persons who wish to qualify as chemists and druggists in South Africa. Firstly, they may study for a degree in pharmacy&#x2014;which has been recognized for registration purposes in terms of section 22 of the Act&#x2014;at a university where a pharmacy faculty has been established. This is the first method. In terms of section 25 the duration and minimum requirements of the curriculum, the standard of education and examinations, as well as the nature and duration of the practical training (apprenticeship) are being prescribed by the State President upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy Board. Secondly, a person in South Africa may study for the Pharmacy Board&#x2019;s diploma in pharmacy at a technical college. In terms of section 27 the Pharmacy Board prescribes the curriculum, etc., for this course. It also appoints the examiners. In addition the board may grant exemption from examination in any particular subject to the holder of a degree, diploma or certificate of an examining authority recognized by the board, which, in the opinion of the board, indicates a standing of training and knowledge in that specific subject not less than that required by the board.</p>

<p>The prescribed duration of academic study in regard to both the university degree and the diploma of the board, is three years. In both cases students must apprentice themselves to a chemist and druggist for two years before they will have completed their academic course. With a view to ensuring that the standard of training of chemists and druggists in the Republic is maintained at a level in keeping with modern practice and the requirements of pharmaceutical promotion, the Pharmacy Board, as well as the universities, strongly urged that the academic course be extended from three to four years and that the practical training be reduced from two years to one year. In addition the board wants the practical training to be undertaken after and not before, as is the case at present, the completion of the academic course. I think hon. members <span class="col_1955-1956" refersTo="page_1000"/>will agree with me that this is a sensible step. In this regard the board proposes that apprenticeship as a part of training be deleted and that instead of that, those who have obtained their degree or diploma should work as trainees for a period of 12 months before being registered as chemists and druggists. In order to afford apprentices the opportunity of gaining experience in regard to the responsibilities of a chemist and druggist, the board also proposes that during the last month of their practical training, trainees should be allowed to act as a chemist and druggist in charge of the pharmacy in question. The acceptance of these proposals would bring the training of chemists and druggists in the Republic into line with that which is generally applied in other developed countries. I think hon. members will appreciate that to agree to these amendments, is highly desirable and in the public interest. Provision for the purpose of giving effect to this, is being made in clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill. Consequential amendments are being effected in clauses 2, 8, 11, 12, 24, 25 and 26. These are the most important aspects of the Bill as far as the pharmaceutical profession is concerned.</p>

<p>Now I come to two matters which are related to a certain extent, i.e. the scheduling of certain drugs and the intensification of the control of the sale or supply of potentially harmful drugs. As far as the former matter is concerned, the position is that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Schedules to the Act contain particulars in regard to preparations which, for the purposes of the Act, are regarded as poisons, habit-forming drugs and potentially harmful drugs, respectively. The sale of these preparations is subject to strict control in terms of the Act. That is the present position.</p>

<p>In terms of the relevant provisions of the Act these schedules may only be amended upon the recommendation of the Medical Council supported by the Pharmacy Board, of upon the recommendation of the latter body supported by the Medical Council. As a result of this cumbrous procedure there was considerable delay in the past in amending the schedules. Hon. members can appreciate how serious this is, seen in the light of the large quantities of these drugs on the market nowadays. In view of the spate of new preparations and especially potentially harmful drugs, such as sedatives, which are continuously appearing on the market nowadays, it has become essential in the public interest for arrangements to be introduced whereby new preparations of this nature may be placed on the relevant schedule without delay.</p>

<p>After careful consideration of the matter and in consultation with the Medical Council, the Pharmacy Board and the Drugs Control Council, it was decided to amend the Act in order to exempt the Medical Council and the Pharmacy Board from their functions in respect of the scheduling of drugs, and to transfer the functions in question to the Drugs Control Council.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that the acceptance of this proposal would eliminate any delay in regard to the scheduling of new preparations, the Drugs Control Council, which was established in terms of the Drugs Control Act, has amongst its members experts who have special knowledge of the action and administration of drugs for human use. As hon. members know, this is a very recent development. This is a more suitable body for making recommendations on new preparations which ought to be included in the relevant schedules, more suitable than the Medical Council or the Pharmacy Board, whose main function is to exercise control over the professional activities of medical practitioners and chemists and druggists, respectively. Provision in this regard is being made in clauses 10, 15 and 18 of the Bill.</p>

<p>As regards the question of the control of potentially harmful drugs, i.e. drugs which, although they are not necessarily poisonous or habit-forming, may nevertheless have dangerous effects if used wrongly or injudiciously, the position is that in terms of section 65<i>bis</i> of the Act no person may sell or supply such drugs unless a prescription of a medical practitioner, dentist or authorized veterinarian is produced. However, the Act does not prohibit, and this is important, the possession of potentially harmful drugs which have not been obtained on such a prescription. The result of this is that a person who has obtained such drugs in an unlawful manner, through theft or the black market for instance, cannot be prosecuted on the strength of his being in possession of those drugs. This state of affairs makes it difficult to exercise effective control over the black market in preparations such as stimulants and sedatives.</p>

<p>Regard having been had to all these things, it was decided, upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy Board and the Department of Health, to fill this gap in the Act. Provision in this regard is being made in clause 17. Amendments which are connected with this matter and which seek to bring the measures in respect of the control of potentially harmful drugs into line with those which are applicable to habit-forming drugs, where it appears to be practicable and advisable, are as follows: Firstly, provision for the inspection of prescription books and prescriptions (clauses 13 and 16); secondly, provision for the imposition of penalties for the unlawful possession of potentially harmful drugs and for the confiscation of the drugs in question (clause 19); thirdly, provision for authorized persons to search any person suspected on reasonable grounds of being in unlawful possession of a potentially harmful drug (clause 20); fourthly, provision for the seizure and disposal of unlawful stocks of potentially harmful drugs, as well as for inspections of the records and stocks of such drugs (clause 21), and, fifthly, provision for also making the provisions of section 87 of the Act&#x2014;i.e. in regard to the liability of those who are authorized to sell poisons and <span class="col_1957-1958" refersTo="page_1001"/>habit-forming drugs for unlawful acts on the part of their partners, agents, employees, etc.&#x2014;applicable to those who are authorized to sell potentially harmful drugs (clause 24). The requirement that potentially harmful drugs may only be sold or supplied on prescription, is not applicable to a medical practitioner, a dentist, an authorized veterinarian or a chemist and druggist, or a responsible officer of a hospital or a person or organization authorized in writing by the Secretary for Health to obtain it for scientific research or educational purposes. However, as a result of the proposal to make it an offence to be in possession of potentially harmful drugs which were not obtained in terms of the provisions of the Act, it will be necessary to extend the said exemption in regard to obtaining such drugs without a prescription, with a view to covering organizations such as Bantu authorities which maintain district nursing services and the National Council for the Blind which uses ointments containing potentially harmful drugs for the treatment of trachoma. Consequently provision has been made in the Bill in terms of which these drugs may be supplied, without a prescription being produced, to any person or organization performing a health service who or which has been authorized in writing by the Secretary for Health to acquire such drugs for the performance of such service. This is a practical arrangement which cannot lead to any abuses, and provision is being made for this in clause 16.</p>

<p>Another matter in regard to the acquisition of scheduled drugs, is the supply of certain such drugs to midwives. There are often cases where it is necessary for midwives, in emergency cases where a medical practitioner is not available, to administer to their patients certain drugs, for instance habit-forming drugs or potentially harmful drugs, the acquisition and use of which are not permitted freely. Consequently provision was made, during 1961, in section 72 (f<i>)quat</i> of the Act, in terms of which midwives could obtain and use morphine and pethidine subject to the conditions determined by the Minister by regulation. These are two substances which are being used by midwives to combat pain. The Nursing Council requested that similar provision be made in respect of oxytocin and stilbestrol, which are potentially harmful drugs. Consequent upon this request, which, incidentally, was strongly supported by the Department of Health, it was decided to amend section 72 (f<i>)quat</i> in such a manner that the drugs bought and used by midwives may be determined by regulation. In this manner the necessity of amending the Act every time the inclusion of a new drug is necessitated, will be eliminated. I think hon. members will also agree in this respect that this is merely a practical arrangement and that it will prevent a great number of unnecessary amendments to the Act. Provision is being made for this in clause 21 of the Bill.</p>

<p>The last of the more important provisions of the Bill is the question of complaints in respect of the accounts of medical practitioners and dentists. This matter is being dealt with in section 80<i>bis</i> of the Act, which lays down the procedure to be followed by persons wishing to lodge complaints in the said connection with the Medical Council. Experience has shown that the prescribed procedure is so complicated and cumbrous that as a rule patients decide to pay the account rather than obtaining the assistance of an attorney. In these circumstances it was decided, with the consent of the Medical Council, to amend section 80<i>bis</i> so as to simplify this procedure. In addition to that a proposal of the Medical Council was approved, i.e. that in the said section provision should also be made in terms of which medical practitioners and dentists must in future furnish their patients with specified accounts. According to legal advice taken by the Medical Council, the council does not have the authority, i.e. in terms of section 80<i>bis</i> of the Act, to consider and decide on complaints in regard to accounts in respect of the supply by medical practitioners and dentists of artificial substitutes, such as artificial eyes or artificial teeth, since the supply thereof constitutes a purchase contract and is therefore not a professional service for the purposes of section 80<i>bis.</i> Consequently the council requested that this gap be filled in the Act by providing that the expression &#x201C;professional services&#x201D; in section 80<i>bis</i> shall include the construction or supply of any artificial part for the human body. Provision in regard to the said matters is being made in clause 22 of the Bill.</p>

<p>I have now dealt with the more important provisions. The remaining provisions are connected with a few other matters which I want to mention now. So far I have dealt with six and I shall now deal with another four or five provisions. The first is in regard to the amendment of the Second Schedule to the Act. The Second Schedule to the Act lays down the fees which the Medical Council and the Pharmacy Board may demand in respect of certain matters, such as registration with that body, and various other matters in respect of which provision has been made in the Act. Upon the recommendation of the Medical Council the Second Schedule was amended by proclamation during 1963, i.e. by the insertion of fees in respect of the restoration of the name of a medical practitioner to the register. Subsequent to that it came to light that this step was <i>ultra vires,</i> in view of the fact that specific provision for it had not been made in the Act. The object of clause 9 of the Bill is to put this matter right.</p>

<p>A further matter is the sale of poisonous preparations. Section 82 of the Act makes provision for the way in which poisonous preparations&#x2014;i.e. preparations which, although they do not constitute poisons for the purposes of section 48, are nevertheless dangerous&#x2014;are to be labelled and packed when sold by retail (sulphuric acid, absolute alcohol and disinfectants containing phenols are examples of poisonous preparations). Since the said provisions <span class="col_1959-1960" refersTo="page_1002"/>do not apply to wholesale sales, cases are found where retailers, i.e. chemists and druggists, have to re-label and repack poisonous preparations, which they obtain from manufacturers or other wholesalers, in order to meet the requirements of the Act before such preparations are sold by them. With a view to eliminating unnecessary work, the Pharmacy Board requested that section 82 of the Act be amended so as to make the provisions thereof applicable to the sale of poisonous preparations, irrespective of whether they are sold by retail or otherwise. The Pharmacy Board&#x2019;s request was considered to be a reasonable one. The matter was discussed with a representative of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Association, who indicated that his association would have no objection to that. Provision is being made accordingly in clause 23 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Another matter is the correction of error in section 96. In incorporating, during 1954, provision in Act No. 13 of 1928 for the exercise of control over potentially harmful drugs, a list of such drugs was inserted as the Sixth Schedule and the existing Sixth Schedule, which specified the Acts originally repealed, became the Seventh Schedule. Owing to an oversight a consequential amendment in the definition of the expression &#x201C;scheduled law&#x201D; was not effected.</p>

<p>The next matter which is dealt with in this Bill, is the designation &#x201C;the mandated territory of South-West Africa&#x201D;. While we are amending the Act, we should also like to avail ourselves of the opportunity to substitute the expression &#x201C;the territory of South-West Africa&#x201D; which is being used in our laws at present, for the obsolete expression in regard to this Bill, i.e. &#x201C;the mandated territory of South-West Africa&#x201D;. Clauses 26, 27 and 28 are connected with this matter.</p>

<p>The last matter I wish to mention, is the control over unqualified assistants. In terms of section 37 of the Act, an unqualified assistant&#x2014;i.e. a person who, although he has not been registered as a chemist and druggist, has nevertheless completed the prescribed period of apprenticeship referred to in section 27&#x2014;may, under the supervision of a chemist and druggist, perform certain specified actions, such as the compounding and dispensing of drugs, which are specifically connected with the profession of a chemist and druggist. With a view to the nature of their work, the Pharmacy Board considers it to be advisable and in the public interest that the performance of the actions in question by unqualified assistants be prohibited, unless they have been registered with the board and thus comes under its control. The Department of Health supports the board&#x2019;s views and feels that this is a valid amendment. Provision to give effect to this proposal is being made in section 26 of the Bill.</p>

<p>With the measures incorporated in this Bill, a serious attempt is being made at raising the status of the chemist and druggist and at strengthening the hands of the police as regards the combating of the abuse of dangerous drugs. It is high time that we took these steps, and I believe that they will meet with the approval of every member of this House and that they will be accepted with great joy by the public in general, because the fact remains that in regard to the abuse of dangerous drugs there is a great deal of concern in the hearts of many persons and particularly parents in South Africa. Since the measures embodied in this Bill are in the public interest, I have no doubt that they will enjoy the unanimous support of hon. members.</p>

<p>This Bill is one which has been requested largely by the people most concerned in the carrying out of the Act on which medicine is based, Act No. 13 of 1928, the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, and most of what the hon. the Minister has brought forward has been done at the request of these two institutions, namely the Medical and Dental Council and the Pharmacy Board. I may say that we are very glad that the Minister has brought these provisions forward. They have been hanging fire in the hands of his predecessors for a long time.</p>

<p>The first thing is the improvement in the educational and the professional status of pharmacists. Up to now it has been almost impossible for a pharmacist to have anything but a diploma. He could not in the course of his training take a university degree. Now it has become possible for him to take a degree in his profession and then to do his actual practical training either in the laboratory of a technical college, or as an apprentice to another pharmacist. This will give to the pharmacist a much higher standing. He will have had the benefit of living for three years on the university campus; he will get a better training than he could ever get before merely living in isolation and working in the back of a chemist&#x2019;s shop. It is like David Copperfield. If you think back to the days of Dickens, the training of a pharmacist was something along those lines. The pharmacists are now pleased indeed that they can attain this higher standing which they richly deserve. We in the medical profession have always regarded the apothecary as our colleague who would help us when we were in difficulties, who would provide drugs night or day and who, when we wanted special <span class="col_1961-1962" refersTo="page_1003"/>information which only he could supply, would supply it to us with all the goodwill in the world. We welcome him to this higher status which, as I say, he richly deserves.</p>

<p>The Bill also introduces the trainee pharmacist. This is the man who has done his university training and is now doing his practical training. He will take up a position similar to that of the intern in medicine. The intern in medicine has passed his examinations and he is gradually taken from the irresponsible, carefree life of the student into the hard and worrying life of the doctor. He does this gradually over his first year, and in his last month he is given a great deal of responsibility, so that the break between the irresponsible student and the anxious doctor is gradually brought to his attention. The same thing will happen to the trainee pharmacist. The pharmacist has heavy responsibilities. The ordinary public think he is just a doler out of pills and patent medicine. This is sheer nonsense. The pharmacist is a responsible individual. He has in his charge the handling and the care of poisonous drugs and of habit-forming drugs and he is responsible to the State for every drop and every grain of these habit-forming drugs. People should recognize this fact and appreciate what an important person he is. They should not regard him, as so many people do, as the doler-out of embrocations and similar things.</p>

<p>As the Minister has said, there is still the question of reciprocity. One of our difficulties in pharmacy, with the change-over, was that there was a possibility that some of the overseas countries, who were prepared to accept our pharmacists on an equal basis with their own, might have changed their attitude if we had not adopted this newer method. I am pleased to hear from the hon. the Minister that reciprocity is in no danger whatsoever. Sir, reciprocity is the lifeblood of our knowledge of the medical profession; it is the only standard we have. If we do not have reciprocity we do not know whether we are any good or whether we are average or whether we are very bad. Because of reciprocity we are able to get comparisons with other countries; we are able to know whether other countries think that we are as good as they are; we are able to find out, by comparison with them, by arrangements with them, what standards we work to. It is the only standard we have. We cannot sit here in isolation and work out our own standards. We must have something against which we can measure our standards, and the measure in the health profession is based entirely on the comparison with other countries, and that measure is reciprocity. It is absolutely essential to these professions that they should have that standard of measurement. This new training for the pharmacists will make their training even better than it has been in the past, and on that account I value it.</p>

<p>We then move on to the question of drugs. Last session, or recently at any rate, we passed a Bill in this House called the Drugs Control Bill. Formerly all drugs were controlled either by the Pharmacy Board or by the Medical Council or by the two working together. The control of drugs has now been taken out of the hands of these two bodies&#x2014;and they are glad to be rid of it&#x2014;and handed over entirely to the Drugs Control Council, which is a specialized council. Unfortunately it is a new council. It has a tremendous amount of work to do. Thousands of drugs have to be classified and new classifications have to be created. When I tell you, Sir, that the American Drugs Control Board employs 3,000 people and that it is three years behind with its work, you will understand the problem that faces our Drugs Control Board here. It has the same amount of work to do as the American Drugs Control Board. We are all the same people; there are fewer of us here, but nevertheless the work is the same, and I can assure you, Sir, that this Drugs Control Council is going to be very hard pressed and will need all the assistance that the hon. the Minister can give it, but for years they will have to rely on such information as they can obtain through other countries. I do not think we can expect them to be fitted with the laboratories which the older countries have. Sir, it was pure chance that saved the United States from using thalidomide. Thalidomide is a drug which was invented in Germany. It was boosted and it came into use in Great Britain after about two years. The Germans, who were making a fortune out of this drug, pushed it as hard as they could and they did not listen to any complaints. It was then taken over to America and by pure chance there was a fault in a letter which the Germans had written to the American Drugs Control Council. The Americans said, &#x201C;We will not accept it; we want this error in the letter corrected&#x201D;, so they sent it back to the Germans for correction. In that period, before the letter had been answered, the thalidomide scandal broke; yet two years before the scandal broke a German had pointed out to the Germans themselves the fact that he had noted several deformed children being born in his village. The drug people, however, would not listen, and that is why so many children were born deformed, because the Drugs Control Council in Germany, if they had one, or whoever controls drugs, did not take notice of what they were told. I am sure the House will appreciate that the responsibility which rests on the Drugs Control Council of this country is a very serious one, and with the backlog which they had to overtake in regard to the classification of drugs, which had not been classified before, we should give them every possible assistance. They have a heavy responsibility.</p>

<p>The question of potentially harmful drugs is also dealt with in this Bill. This country has had a very good history in regard to the use of habit-forming drugs. There has not been a great deal of misuse of habit-forming drugs. <span class="col_1963-1964" refersTo="page_1004"/>The pharmacists and the doctors between them have kept control over the so-called H.F.D.&#x2019;s (habit-forming drugs). There have been abuses. Most of these abuses have taken place in hospitals. There have been very few outside the hospitals. A great deal of publicity has been given to the misuse of the &#x201C;purple hearts&#x201D; and such other drugs which can really be classified as potentially harmful drugs. It has always been possible for a pharmacist to give people potentially harmful drugs if he knew them and if he was satisfied that there would be no abuse. But that control has broken down. The hon. the Minister now brings in a form of control which is almost as strong as the control over habit-forming drugs. This means that before a potentially harmful drug can be dispensed by a pharmacist he must have a doctor&#x2019;s prescription. This will bear heavily on the public because they will have to see their doctor every time they want a &#x201C;repeat&#x201D;, unless he gives them a prescription on which he endorses the word &#x201C;repeat&#x201D;. A few doctors will &#x201C;repeat&#x201D; indefinitely; in fact, they should not do so. If the doctor has to be consulted, he has to give a prescription; the patient has to go to the pharmacist to get the prescription and he is going to be put to a lot of extra trouble. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should look carefully into the question whether he should not ask the Drugs Control Council very carefully to check potentially harmful drugs, and to cut down as much as possible the number of potentially harmful drugs so as to ease the burden on the patient and on the pharmacist. There are many drugs on the P.H.D. list which are not harmful but which are merely included for the sake of safety to warn the chemist to be careful. If the hon. the Minister does not do what I have just suggested, then I think the load on the pharmacists, on the doctors and on the patients is going to be intolerable. What was formerly put in sometimes merely on a formula but was not really investigated should now be thoroughly investigated so that no drug which is not really potentially harmful can be included on that list. We do not have the same problem with habit-forming drugs for those are world-wide known. It is really a question which is settled by the U.N.; they tell us what they regard as habit-forming drugs and we follow their advice.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to come to the question of the proposed new section 80<i>bis</i> which affects the doctors. In its wisdom this hon. House in 1928 included a section in the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act which exists in no other country in the world. It put upon the Medical Council the burden of deciding whether or not a doctor&#x2019;s fees were excessive. Nowhere else is this done by this method. The Medical Council has the greatest difficulty in carrying out this duty, and they have tried in many ways to lighten the burden, both for themselves and for the aggrieved patient. Finally they have evolved a system which they hope will work. Originally we had a system which was cluttered up with legal phrases and it involved summonses and subpoenas and many other things, which for the ordinary humble people of the country are frightening. We have at last narrowed it down so that all that was needed was an affidavit. But it was found that even the fact that they have to go to a lawyer or to a police station to swear an affidavit was inclined to deter the humble people of the country who felt that, after all, they had to pay the bill sooner or later, and why should they go and add a lawyer&#x2019;s bill.</p>

<p>The change which is brought about now is a change at the request of the Medical Council itself. An affidavit is now no longer required, in other words, it is enough for the complaining patient to write a letter to the Council. This will help the patient who has complaints and it will not increase to any extent the number of complaints which reach the Council. We see occasionally that the Council holds an inquiry into the conduct of a doctor, but if we add it up these inquiries do not amount to more than eight or ten in a year. We in the Medical Council receive 200 to 300 complaints in a month, but most of them are frivolous in that the patients generally have misunderstood something, they had not completely understood what had been done for them, and when the doctor&#x2019;s side is heard, as is always the case, by the Medical Council, and an explanation is given to these people most of them are satisfied. When it is explained to them what has happened, they are perfectly satisfied and they know they have not had to quarrel with their doctor in order to have justice done.</p>

<p>We in the Medical Council have asked for this and we look forward now to an easier way of handling these complaints. We hope there will be fewer of them, but we do feel we should like the patients to know that they can, without any expense other than the cost of a postage stamp, obtain an explanation or redress. As I say, this side of the House welcomes this Bill.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House naturally welcome the unanimity with which this measure is being accepted by this House. This only goes to prove to us that on that side of the House a measure of good judgment and good sense can still prevail when that is required by circumstances. This measure, as the hon. the Minister rightly remarked, deals with numerous aspects of the practice of pharmacy and medicine. Personally I feel that the extension of the period of the academic training of chemists and druggists most definitely is, as the hon. member for Durban (Central) also remarked, a step in the right direction, and that this once again places the emphasis on the academic training of the chemist and druggist and not so much on his business training. Under the previous system of training chemists and druggists a trainee was required to undergo academic training for one year <span class="col_1965-1966" refersTo="page_1005"/>followed by practical training with an approved chemist and druggist for two years, again followed by academic training for two years. This process interfered with the continuity of the studies of such a trainee, and I believe it also had a detrimental effect on his studies. What is more, this also created the impression that a greater interest was taken in the business aspect of pharmacy than in the academic aspect of the work of a chemist and druggist. Now this new dispensation is once again putting the entire matter in its right perspective and, as regards the training of a chemist and druggist, it is once again placing the emphasis where it ought to be placed.</p>

<p>In the era in which we are living and in which there has been rapid development in the field of chemotherapy, it is being expected more and more of chemists and druggists to have a good academic grounding. More and more demands are being made on a chemist and druggist in respect of his knowledge of his subjects. This statement may sound like an anachronism in view of the fact that at present the preparation of medicines is the full-time occupation of very few chemists and druggists. But with the numerous chemotherapeutic preparations we have on the market to-day, it is absolutely essential for the chemist and druggist to keep himself fully acquainted with what is happening in the field of his profession. In these times the medical practitioner too has to rely more and more on the knowledge of the chemist and druggist as the medical practitioner simply no longer has the time at his disposal for keeping himself well informed on the properties, the contra-indications, the chemical properties, etc., of certain preparations. Consequently he has to depend on the knowledge of the chemist and druggist in this connection. For this reason a sound relationship between the medical practitioner and the chemist and druggist is very essential.</p>

<p>In recent times a development has been taking place in the field of pharmacy which is a source of concern to one, and that is that at present the chemist and druggist is concentrating more and more on the business aspect of his undertaking. We no longer find the old traditional chemist and druggist of earlier days who occupied himself with the preparation of medicines, of different kinds of ointments, etc. To-day one can enter many a pharmacy which looks like a toy shop or a furniture store or a radio shop, because all kinds of commodities are on sale in pharmacies at present. I accept unconditionally that this tendency has been forced by necessity in view of the fact that the supermarkets and the ordinary commercial shops are now entering the field of the chemist and druggist. Whereas the chemist and druggist used to be the sole supplier of toiletries, ordinary household medicines, cough remedies, aspirins, etc., we now find that these commodities can also be obtained from ordinary dealers. I feel the chemist and druggist may claim some protection in this field as well, and probably it will become necessary at some time to give consideration on a high level to these phenomena in the field of pharmacy in order to protect the chemist and druggist against the unfair competition he has to endure from supermarkets, shops, etc. I feel that with this Bill we are restoring the status of the chemist and druggist and that he may also claim protection from this House in this other respect.</p>

<p>In this era in which we are living, the conservative element of our society is seriously concerned about the direction in which the Western civilization is moving at the moment. We have the phenomenon that existing and accepted norms and principles of morality are not being queried but are also being rejected summarily; that those things which have been serving as the cornerstones of our form of civilization and way of life are being rejected summarily. We are living in a time in which an entity such as a permissive community has become a tangible entity, which we must duly take into account. This permissive community is part of our community and it allows the development of cults, including the so-called hippie cult, which claim not only a right of existence but also recognition by society, and last but not least, acceptance by society as normal and as part of a normal pattern and way of life. I am referring to these so-called cults as these people admit flagrantly and without any sense of shame that they do not regard themselves as being bound to social norms and accepted principles and consequently abandon themselves to concepts such as, <i>inter alia,</i> free love and the free use of narcotics, habit-forming drugs, stimulants, etc. It is hardly necessary for me to point out the dangers these things hold for our Western way of life and pattern of civilization. Our children are being undermined spiritually; their disciplinary links to the community are being broken and a community which wants to regard itself as being absolutely free in everything it does, free from any norms or any specific pattern of life, is coming into existence. In other words, we are getting a condition of anarchy and chaos in the place of sound social order.</p>

<p>Already there are unmistakable signs that this tendency towards the uncontrolled use of drugs and the like is taking root more and more every day also in our South African way of life. The tragic aspect is that even public opinion, which always used to be a factor which counteracted these tendencies and one which had to be taken into account, is changing. We are coming to regard these people and these concepts of loose living and free love with more and more sympathy. This can only have the effect that in the end this conservative factor which could still have served as a counter-measure to the uncontrolled use of habit-forming drugs in particular will also disappear. If this factor were to disappear completely, it would be a disastrous day for us. We read even now that even parents supply <span class="col_1967-1968" refersTo="page_1006"/>their children with these drugs. Every day we read in the newspaper about cases of people who are addicted to drugs or narcotics. During the past week-end I read articles on this evil in our society in three Sunday newspapers. I want to read out a few headings of these articles: &#x201C;Drugs: Hundreds of schoolchildren the victims&#x201D;; &#x201C;Take care, your child may already be addicted and you may not be aware of the fact&#x201D;. Every now and then articles like this appear in the newspapers. We must not have any illusions about this evil. It is taking root very rapidly in our South African way of life, and the consequences can only be disastrous to this nation. Day after day we read of minors, even 12-year-olds and 13-year-olds, being caught in youth clubs where they had not only been drinking excessively but had also been taking these drugs with which they had been supplied at these clubs. No so long ago we had the tragic case of a young woman who escaped from an institution. She used to be at university where she had learned to take drugs. She was being treated in the institution. She escaped from the institution and roamed the country for ten days until she was eventually found in a sorry and half-starved state on the beach in Port Elizabeth. The fact that this young woman used to be at university, indicates that she had character and had the drive and will to get somewhere in life, but she had acquired the habit of taking these drugs, most probably through no fault of her own. That undermined her to such an extent spiritually that at the moment she really is a burden to herself and to the community. This, and not so much the habit-forming effect, is the real danger of taking these drugs. Many of these potentially harmful drugs are not habit-forming in their effect but when the individual is under the influence of such drugs, there is virtually no telling what such an individual will do.</p>

<p>In view of the alarming situation which is developing in this country, we welcome this measure with open arms. However, we should not allow this to create illusions for us, because legislation alone will not solve this problem. The education of our youth in particular is of the utmost importance. Some of the measures in this Bill seem to be of a very radical nature, but we are dealing with an evil which demands radical measures. Therefore it is particularly gladdening that the possession of drugs is now also being declared an offence. For <i>bona fide</i> patients there are in fact ways and means of obtaining these drugs in the correct and ethical way. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, however, whether he cannot give consideration to differentiating in clause 9, the penalty clause, between the pedlar, the man who supplies the drugs to our youth and to people who do not need them, and the person who most probably is addicted to drugs. I feel that the pedlar, the person who is responsible for another person taking these drugs, deserves much more severe punishment than the person who has unfortunately become addicted and who in point of fact is the victim of the pedlar&#x2019;s diabolical plans.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, then I also want to suggest whether the hon. the Minister will not consider adding a further provision to these penalty provisions to the effect that if a person is caught in possession of these drugs and it is found that such a person is addicted to these drugs, a condition may be imposed along with his punishment that he is to undergo proper psychiatric treatment as well. I should not like to cloud the unanimity with which this measure has been welcomed by this House, but I should like to refer to clause 22, which substitutes a new section for section 80<i>bis</i> of the principal Act. I have no objections to subsection (1), but I do have some misgivings about the effect of subsection (2), which provides that in future all accounts which medical practitioners and dentists will send to their patients have to be detailed accounts. I accept unconditionally that the principle is a sound one. The hon. member for Durban (Central) pointed out the difficulties which the Medical Council is experiencing in this connection. My objection is not one of principle, but a practical one, especially as far as medical practitioners, and especially one-man practices, are concerned. Sir, we find that these medical practitioners, particularly in our smaller towns, do their own books and send out their own accounts, that as a rule they cannot obtain outside help as this type of help is not readily available in our smaller communities. Now we find that if a medical practitioner is to detail every account he sends out, this will mean an enormous amount of work for him. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he cannot consider making this compulsory only in cases when patients request detailed accounts and not in all cases; because as this clause reads at present, this is compulsory in respect of all accounts. I feel that this is going to hit many of our rural medical practitioners very hard indeed. We should not forget that the mutual confidence between the patient and his medical practitioner is something very precious which serves as the cornerstone in practising this profession in a meaningful manner. This confidence applies not only in respect of the treatment of the patient, but also in respect of the fees the patient expects to pay to his medical practitioner. In the majority of cases the account of the medical practitioner is paid by a happy and satisfied patient without any enquiries or doubt arising about the composition of the account. I feel that if it is going to be expected of the medical practitioner to detail his accounts in every case, this important element of confidence which assists in the relationship between medical practitioner and patient may suffer and may be destroyed.</p>

<p>I am also concerned about the fact that this clause may cause the spotlight to fall on the <span class="col_1969-1970" refersTo="page_1007"/>financial aspect of practising this profession. I am concerned about the fact that lately too much emphasis has been placed on the financial side of the medical profession and too little emphasis on what a medical practitioner has to occupy himself with, namely practising sound medicine. Therefore I want to address a friendly appeal to the hon. the Minister to reconsider this clause and possibly to move an amendment in this regard during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Sir, we welcome this measure as it is affecting important aspects of our society, not only as far as medical practitioners, dentists and chemists and druggists are concerned, but also the public in general. I believe that the clauses contained in this Bill are to the benefit of society and this country.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I very seldom find myself in a position where I can say a sincere &#x2018;thank you&#x2019; and express my appreciation to a member on the opposite side of the House. The hon. the Minister indicated in his Second Reading speech that this was a matter which concerned people as a whole, that it was not being dealt with on a party basis, and that it was in the interests of the public. I believe that that is the approach which is being adopted by both sides of this House.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Cradock for his remarks. I am grateful to him for appreciating the position of the chemists and druggists, and for indicating that the time for protection of chemists and druggists in their professional sphere, is long overdue. He has referred to the competition offered by supermarkets, discount houses and others. He also referred to the fact that it is regrettable that a chemist and druggist is not always able to occupy himself fully with his professional duties. These matters have occupied the minds of chemists and druggists for some time. I know that the plea which the hon. member for Cradock has made, is on the lips and in the hearts of many chemists and druggists in South Africa. But I also feel that in this seeking for the protection which we believe is necessary, in the interests of the public as well, there has not always been the understanding by the department and the hon. the Minister that there should have been.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he gave a clear, concise and detailed exposition of his Bill. But it is not the Bill itself and what it contains that is notable; it is what is omitted from this Bill, because it disregards the major requests which pharmacy, through the voice of the South African Pharmacy Board, has expressed to the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, mainly, for many years. I would like to refer briefly to the Pharmacy Board report, circulated to all registered chemists and druggists, for the period from May to October, 1967. It says:</p>

<block name="quote">Much time was spent on preparation of recommendations to the Minister on amendments to the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act.</block>

<p>Many of these amendments do not see the light of day in this Bill. Now I want to be perfectly fair. I am aware of the Minister&#x2019;s position; that he has taken over relatively recently. I know that he has indicated to organized pharmacy that it is his intention to undertake a complete investigation and examination of the difficulties. I know that he has said that he will consult with the profession. My object in raising this matter is to indicate that there is a growing frustration amid the ranks of chemists and druggists, and I ask the Minister in all seriousness to see that this consideration is given priority.</p>

<p>There has been general praise in respect of this Bill. I must record one discordant note in expressing my sincere disappointment of the fact that this Bill was not proceeded with during the last session of Parliament. I believe that in the interests of the public, primarily, and also in the interests of the profession, it would have been a wise procedure. A great deal has been said both by the hon. the Minister and by the hon. member for Durban (Central) in regard to reciprocity. I realize that this Bill will renew the continuity which existed before the arrangement came to an end, on the 31st March of last year, as a result of a communication from the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. But during this period, which was longer than it need have been by virtue of the delay in the introduction of this Bill, there have been chemists and druggists, who qualified in Great Britain, practised in the countries to the north of us, and decided that South Africa was a better country in which to live. They came down here, expecting to receive recognition of their qualifications. Unfortunately, due to this hiatus which existed, there was a period during which they could not receive that recognition. They could not register, and although they were qualified chemists and druggists, they could not practice as such. I know that this Bill will do away with this situation. I am glad and I hope that it will shortly be on the Statute Book. There has been reference to the question of a four-year course. The five year overall course for pharmacy will be altered so that there will now be a four year academic course and a period of one year&#x2019;s practical training. This is welcomed in certain circles. But it does not solve the problem altogether. It does not solve the problem of a dual qualification, one which organized pharmacy has sought to do away with for many years. This concerns the dual qualification, of a degree and a diploma, which do not receive equal recognition. I believe that if there were one qualification only, pharmacy would be in a better position. In addition to certain universities the bodies which are conducting the training of pharmacy, namely the technical colleges, could be allowed to continue <span class="col_1971-1972" refersTo="page_1008"/>to train chemists and druggists but they should be able to run a degree course through the University of South Africa.</p>

<p>We have a slightly anomalous position at the present moment. We have the position whereby half the chemists and druggists who qualify in the Republic&#x2014;more than half&#x2014;qualify under the diploma course. The others qualify under the degree course. We have the position where the non-White chemists and druggists all qualify under the degree course. We have 50 per cent of our White students who qualify as diplomates finding themselves in an academic cul de sac for the simple reason that their diploma qualification is not recognized at its full value by the universities offering the degree course. If there were one qualification, this difficulty would not arise and I believe that many of those people who may wish to continue their studies would be able to do so without being penalized. Though it is apparently the wish of pharmacy that there should be a four year academic course, I am constrained to ask myself at this present juncture, whether this four year course is really necessary under the circumstances which we know exist and to which the hon. member for Cradock has referred. I believe that the four year course would have been necessary had this Government in its wisdom accepted the recommendations of the Bremer Committee appointed by this Government by a predecessor to the hon. the Minister, to investigate pharmaceutical training as far back as 1951. I should now like to quote briefly from this report, because I think what it says has a great significance. I am now quoting from chapter 5 of the Report of the Committee to enquire into the Training of Chemists and Druggists in South Africa. Chapter 5 is headed &#x201C;Encroachment on the Pharmaceutical Profession&#x201D;. I read the following passage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Committee is of the opinion that steps should be taken to limit the dispensing rights of medical and dental practitioners and veterinarians to the supply of drugs in an emergency only, and to those areas where no pharmacy is available within a distance of two miles. Further, it should be considered whether the licences of general dealers should not be limited similarly in the matter of stocking, and sale of medicines and drugs, when a pharmacist is available.</block>

<p>I realize that. That is the only reason and I appreciate that. I am hoping that this Minister is going to break this bad record and do something about it. I am glad the hon. the Minister made that interjection, because the department under his control is one of my main problems. I have here a problem in regard to district surgeons who fall under the control of the hon. the Minister. I want to refer the hon. the Minister to an advertisement which appeared in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of the 10th January, 1969. In this gazette there appeared an advertisement in regard to vacant part-time district surgeoncies. I examined the list in the gazette and briefly there were 49 vacancies. It was indicated in the advertisement that in respect of 44 of those vacancies, drug allowances of between R48 and R3,600 per year were allowed to the district surgeons. I would be the first person to say that people are entitled to medicine, and if a chemist or druggist is not available, then they must have their medicine and it should be through the district surgeon if necessary. But I examined this list and I found that of the 12 places listed there was a chemist and druggist in respect of each of these places. In all of the 12 cases there were 23 pharmacies. And yet, in those particular areas where the register of pharmacies indicate pharmacies to be present, amounts from R2,400 to R3,600 were given as drug allowances. There may be some explanation for this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will give me the reasons. I am aware of the Government dispensing contract by which it is possible for all people to receive medicines under that contract, at economic rates to the Government. This is one of the aspects which I believe will require the assistance of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of Press publicity in regard to the growing incidence of the use of potentially harmful drugs, such as the &#x201C;purple hearts&#x201D;, the &#x201C;black bombs&#x201D; and other drugs which do not fall within the category of habit forming drugs but which are under fairly strict control. There is no doubt about it that the public is deeply concerned. I was very interested in the Press release of a speech the hon. the Minister made when he attended a dinner of the South African Pharmacy Board on the 4th February, 1969. It said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under existing legislation doctors are permitted according to discretion to prescribe any quantity of potentially harmful drugs and the number of occasions on which the prescriptions may be dispensed. In the interests of the public it would appear that the time has arrived where the quantity per occasion should be limited to a dosage basis, as well as the number of repetitions which are allowed.</block>

<p>I have a copy of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech here. I was also privileged to attend that function and I do not remember the hon. the Minister saying that. I do, however, recollect that in a news broadcast the following morning <span class="col_1973-1974" refersTo="page_1009"/>on the S.A.B.C. reference was made to this particular aspect. This is something which I should imagine would necessitate an amendment to the existing section 65<i>bis.</i> I do not see it here. I would therefore welcome from the hon. the Minister an explanation as to his reason for not proceeding with the suggestion which was embodied in his draft speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask what the suggestion was?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s suggestion in his speech when he said, &#x201C;In the interests of the public it would appear that the time has arrived where the quantity per occasion of potentially harmful drugs should be limited to a dosage basis&#x201D;. I believe that with this public concern and general anxiety concerning the unauthorized use of potentially harmful drugs, that one has to examine the situation as a whole. And I wish to place on record a report of the South African Pharmacy Board which says unequivocally, that illegal supplies from retail chemists and druggists appear to be negligible. I give this further quotation from the board&#x2019;s report of 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board is convinced that nearly all of the drugs found in unlawful circulation are those which have been stolen either in the course of production, the distribution in the wholesale field and from other bulk stores.</block>

<p>Now, when it comes to a question of production I believe that the possibility of the release of drugs from production firms of repute, is on a very small scale. It is more likely that the smaller manufacturers could be responsible for the distribution of drugs to unauthorized sources. I believe that we are faced with a threat and if anybody wishes to read the &#x201C;Black-market in Drugs&#x201D; by Margaret Kreig, which outlines the dangerous position that exists in America, they will realize that this is a position which could develop in South Africa if the position were left unchecked. The S.A. Pharmacy Board has suggested something which could, I believe, improve this position, and that is that there should be a register of premises where poisons or drugs are sold. Here again, I believe that the hon. the Minister will give this his attention, because his predecessor always indicated that he was not prepared to give a ruling on this matter, until he had received the report of the Committee investigating the effect of poisons on man. Now the Minister has told us that, this report has been tabled and I hope that if it is the intention to introduce a register of premises this will not be longer delayed. I believe sincerely that the Drugs Control Council also will play a part in this aspect.</p>

<p>Then mention was made of distribution through the wholesale trade. There again, I believe that reputable firms act in a responsible manner and that the leakage there is negligible. But I want to point out one possible abuse which I believe could have serious proportions. I regret to say so, but this does concern some members of the medical profession. I am referring to those doctors who in terms of the Act are entitled to and in fact do their own dispensing. Many of them do their own dispensing and have their dispensaries, but I believe that this is a real source of supply to the black market in drugs. Just look at it this way. A dispensing doctor has a receptionist. I know that, regrettably sometimes, they are used illegally to help the doctor in dispensing, but if that man or woman acts as a receptionist and the doctor is out on his rounds, that person has the right to ring up and order, in the doctor&#x2019;s name, potentially harmful drugs from a wholesaler. I think if the Minister examines section 65<i>bis</i> he will agree with me that there is nothing to stop that from being done. What actually happens is this. Cases are known where the receptionist rings up and orders bennies, etc., from a wholesale chemist, asks for them to be sent down C.O.D.; the drugs are sent and are paid for and they are immediately handed over to some friend or go-between, who puts them on to the black or the grey market, and the receptionist collects commission. I know that this is happening. There have been cases where it has happened and when one bears in mind that it is estimated that there are some 2,000 dispensing doctors, I think one must accept that this could be an avenue for drugs to reach the black market. As far as the chemist and druggist is concerned, section 77 of the Act lays down clearly, that every pharmacy shall be conducted under the continuous supervision of a qualified chemist and druggist. But as far as I know no such similar provision applies to the dispensing doctors, and when they are out on their rounds, it is obvious, and I know that from experience, that dispensary stock is left accessible to people who are legally not entitled to handle such drugs.</p>

<p>Then the Pharmacy Board made reference to the question of bulk stores. I am satisfied that there have been cases where from hospital bulk stores, there have been thefts which have resulted in large quantities of potentially harmful drugs finding their way into undesirable channels. But I have been assured, and I am satisfied in my own mind, that these avenues have been closed to a large extent, by strict security measures and the possibility of leakage is no longer as great as it was.</p>

<p>There is another important avenue of possible leakage and that is in the distribution of medical samples. Many people who purport to be medical representatives are people without any medical or pharmaceutical qualifications. I believe that their handling, their possession and their distribution of drugs, in <i>bona fide</i> cases possibly, to members of the medical profession, can lead to a great deal of abuse. I am satisfied that it is the intention in the amendment to section 65, to render illegal the unlawful possession of potentially harmful drugs. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister in his reply, to say whether it is <span class="col_1975-1976" refersTo="page_1010"/>his intention to invoke the provisions of this new clause to ensure that representatives who work for manufacturing drug houses and who have no pharmaceutical or medical qualifications will in fact be under rigorous control when it comes to the distribution of these medical samples.</p>

<p>I believe that from all appearances we can say that the professions as such have in the main carried out their responsibilities under the Act in regard to potentially harmful drugs. The record shows that, because during the last three years, from 1966 to 1968, the number of contraventions by medical men, dentists, veterinarians and chemists and druggists has been negligible. But I ask myself the question, whether in inspections the main efforts have not been directed purely against one profession, that of the pharmacist. As far as I can see from the Act and the regulations, equal responsibility is placed both on chemists and druggists and on doctors who dispense in terms of the Act. But I want to quote two cases which indicate that there is a great emphasis placed on the inspection of the records of chemists and druggists, which does not seem to apply, when it comes to the general practitioner. I want to quote the case of my own pharmacy. A reference to my habit-forming drug register would show that I have had 11 inspections of my register since 1963. Sir, I have been in practice since 1935, and I have never been before the court or before the Board for doubtful conduct. But nevertheless, my register has been inspected 11 times since 1963. Then there is the case of a chemist and druggist who practises within 50 miles of Durban and who has been established for six or seven years. During 1967 he dispensed 350 prescriptions, less than one prescription per day. During 1968 he dispensed 501 prescriptions, and the number rose to 1&#x00BD; per day. It is thought that the Medical Schemes Act may have effected this improvement. The interesting thing is that although he is distant from Durban, more than one-third of his prescriptions dispensed were from Durban doctors. In the same village there is a doctor who is entitled by law to dispense and who in fact does not issue prescriptions, but dispenses his own prescriptions. Now this doctor has a White and a non-White practice, and it is estimated that he supplies up to 120 prescriptions a day, but he has never been subjected to the visits of the inspector, who calls on the chemists and druggists in the village. He may be inspected by an official from the department, but I am prepared to vouch that the frequency with which he is inspected is in no way comparable with the inspections carried out on chemists. This particular chemist, whose dispensing practice is almost negligible, found that his register was inspected on 15th January, 1968, the 26th July, 1968, and 16th January, 1969. I believe that this is a case of discrimination which I am sure the Minister will give his attention to.</p>

<p>I want to go further in regard to this question of inspections. It is estimated that there are, roughly, 2,000 doctors who do their own dispensing, while I believe the number of pharmacies is approximately 2,250, but when one analyses the number of inspections which have taken place, we find that the yearly average of the doctors is 133, against the yearly average of inspections of chemists&#x2019; registers of 1,372. So, if we assume that all the inspections effected on doctors are in respect of the dispensing doctors only, which is most unlikely, then the percentage inspected is 6&#x00BD; per cent, whereas the percentage of pharmacies inspected is 56 per cent. Again I ask the hon. the Minister why is there this discrimination?</p>

<p>I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister that clause 13, which amends section 60, and clause 16 which amends section 65<i>bis,</i> to which the Minister has referred already, should be implemented impartially and I hope that this will be done. They both refer to inspections of records and it is my belief that the prescription book of the chemist and druggist is equivalent to the case card of the doctor, because I understand that that is recognized as a prescription book.</p>

<p>I come to another aspect where I must admit the Minister has had the effect of eliminating some of my anxiety, but I am still a little uncertain about this. I want to refer to the broadening of the avenues of supply of potentially harmful drugs and habit-forming drugs. I refer specifically to clause 16 and to clause 21. I know the Minister has said that duly authorized persons or organizations performing a health service, will be able to have access to potentially harmful drugs and I accept the Minister&#x2019;s undertaking that this will be controlled by the Secretary for Health. But it is a widening of the distribution of potentially harmful drugs. We are faced with a problem in regard to potentially harmful drugs, and I hope that when this system is on the Statute Book it will be carried out with a strict eye to the safety of the public. In the second instance, and the Minister has referred to this, he has put my mind at rest, because the amendment itself was broad. It indicated that permission was sought for midwives to receive habit-forming drugs and potentially harmful drugs and that this concession could be operated by regulation. I felt that this was a very big step to take, for Parliament to agree to this. I accept the Minister&#x2019;s promise, that in regard to potentially harmful drugs it applies to only two. But I want to sound a note of warning again. We have registered as midwives over 22,000 people in South Africa. I realize this is not the intention that every midwife should have access to these and that it will be limited, but it leads to more avenues. If one looks at the racial composition, we find there are 12,500 White, 1,400 Coloured and Indian, and 7,000 Bantu midwives, who in terms of this Act could find themselves having access to certain habit-forming drugs and potentially harmful drugs.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate that, but what happens when the permit is returned for renewal? This is a problem I see no answer to. When we have this broadening of the aspect of the distribution of potentially harmful drugs and habit-forming drugs, I find a strange situation, when one bears in mind that the request by the S.A. Pharmacy Board in 1961&#x2014;that is eight years ago, and it stands on record&#x2014;that there should be a relaxation in the provisions under which prescriptions for potentially harmful drugs could be repeated, has still not been acceded to. I know the hon. member for Durban (Central) has referred to this matter. I believe that the time has come for a serious review of the potentially harmful drugs system and I would like to put one suggestion to the Minister if I may. In many sections of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, provision is made that after consultation with the council and the Pharmacy Board, the Minister may make regulations, and in certain cases the State President may make regulations. I submit that for administrative reasons the time has come to consider whether it might not be desirable to lay down the conditions under which potentially harmful drugs can be supplied under the Act, and to make provision by regulation to provide for the manner in which these potentially harmful drugs should be supplied. I do not think, with due respect to this House, that this is the place to decide whether the date should be put on a prescription by the doctor or by the chemist. I believe that these are matters which could be considered jointly by the two statutory bodies and finalized and promulgated by regulations, without the necessity of taking up the valuable time of this House.</p>

<p>Sir, the Minister has referred to the transfer of powers to the Drugs Control Council. On principle no one can quarrel with that practice, but I have certain reservations, and I feel it is only fair to place them before the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister is aware of it but hon. members may not be aware that although the Medical Council and the Pharmacy Board had the right to classify various drugs into the schedules for poisons, the work was in fact done by a conjoint committee consisting of approximately equal representation of both professions. Sir, I know of the frustrating delay which took place, a delay which was detrimental to the public. Because of this delay, drugs which should have been classified in schedules were not classified. I realize that this had to be overcome. I believe sincerely that the Drugs Control Council will be able to overcome this delay so that in future both fourth, fifth, and sixth schedule poisons will be classified by the Drugs Control Council instead of by this joint body. But I would like some assurance from the hon. the Minister, if he can give it, that on the committee or the body which in fact effects this classification, there will at least be equal representation. I believe that this is important. I realize that when it comes to a decision as to the therapeutic value or the danger of the drug, that falls primarily within the scope of the medical practitioners. But I think in fairness, the Minister must appreciate that when it comes to the administrative problem of the distribution of these drugs, this falls mainly on the chemists and druggists, and it is no use legislating for the impossible; it is no use laying down things which will result in frustration to the public and frustration to the chemists and druggists and also leave avenues for abuse. I ask the hon. the Minister please to lay down some ruling to ensure an equality of representation as between medical men and pharmacists on the committee which decides this. I want to point out that at the moment, according to my analysis of the committees appointed to the Drugs Control Council, 55 members have been appointed, 36 of whom are medical professional men in some avenues, and only 9 are chemists and druggists. There is, therefore, an overwhelming majority of medical men and I would like to think that pharmacy is equally represented in the case of classification of drugs.</p>

<p>Sir, I have put these points before the hon. the Minister; I feel that I have the right to do so. I am no longer a member of a statutory body, but I have been active in my profession for over 30 years. I claim to be aware of the problem; I claim to know the increasing concern that is shared by many of my colleagues, and I ask the Minister seriously and sincerely to take notice of these points and to do his best in this Bill and in subsequent legislation to see that some of these wrongs are righted.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, everyone is grateful for the introduction of this Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Amendment Bill. The three aspects dealt with in this Bill are pre-eminently the training of chemists and druggists, the control of drugs and the control of the accounts of medical practitioners. So I first come to the section which deals with the training of chemists and druggists.</p>

<p>To a large extent the retail chemist and druggist merely acts as a distributor, admittedly with certain responsibilities, but in this respect with preciously little use of scientific knowledge. In view of the fact that the preparation of modern medicine is constantly demanding more specialized knowledge, this task has not diminished in importance but has in fact moved away from the retail chemist and druggist to the pharmaceutical industry. What this involves is that the industrial chemist and druggist to-day needs much more knowledge of the preparation of medicines and in reality has to be a specialist in his field. In contrast to this the retail chemist and druggist no longer needs the same amount of knowledge as before of the preparation of the old medicines on the prescription of the medical practitioner. In pharmacy the emphasis has in <span class="col_1979-1980" refersTo="page_1012"/>fact moved to the manufacturing industry. This does not make the training of the chemist and druggist less important; on the contrary, it makes it more important. This Bill does in fact make specific provision for the improvement of the training of the chemist and druggist. We have even been experiencing the problem that England and America have refused to recognize the qualifications of the trained South African chemist and druggist in some cases. I am in favour of the chemist and druggist improving his status by means of better training. Mr. Speaker, any profession progresses only to that extent to which it contributes to its development itself. I do not want to disparage the pharmaceutical profession; far from it, but I am afraid that the pharmaceutical profession in South Africa has really contributed little to the development of medicine in South Africa, to the development and discovery of new drugs. They have not had the opportunity of doing research, and this probably is a result of the fact that their training used to have a fairly old-fashioned basis, i.e. that of apprenticeship in contrast to scientific training. Only in 1957, with the establishment of the first faculty of pharmacy at the Potchefstroom University, have these people been given a real opportunity of continuing their studies, of receiving post-graduate training and of doing research. I think the hon. member for Durban (Berea) made a very good point when he suggested that this dual system of training chemists and druggists should be abandoned. My personal opinion is that this may be one of the biggest problems which has in fact affected the status of the chemist and druggist. If a man wants to raise the status of his profession, he has to see to it that he constantly improves his qualifications. As the profession of the chemist and druggist is really moving in the direction of the pharmaceutical industry in which pharmacology and pharmaceutical chemistry form the basis of a new industry which has also come into existence in South Africa, I personally am in favour of South Africa moving in the direction of training chemists and druggists only at universities. I know that I shall meet with a great deal of opposition in this connection, but I believe that we are doing those young men and young women an injustice in that they are awarded diplomas and are not placed in a position of improving their qualifications to do further research in the field of pharmaceutics. This much, Sir, as regards the training of chemists and druggists. Provision is being made for this in this Bill, and as far as this matter is concerned, we are moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>I also want to make a few remarks on what this Bill is not doing and concerns the constitution of the Medical and Dental Council. At the moment the Medical and Dental Council consists of four medical practitioners, one dentist and two lay members appointed by the hon. the Minister. The medical practitioners are elected by the registered medical practitioners in South Africa and four dentists are elected by the dentists. In addition there are two nurses as well as a representative of each medical faculty and of each faculty of dentistry. To me an obvious shortcoming is the fact that the director-surgeons of the various provinces do not have representation in the council. The hospitals in which all these people work are provided by the provinces. The control, the discipline, of these hospitals falls under the jurisdiction of the provinces, to be specific, under the jurisdiction of the director-surgeon in fact. The interns who have to undergo compulsory medical training at the provincial hospitals for one year, fall directly under the influence and the control of the provincial authorities. To me it seems only logical that the director-surgeons of the various provinces should be members of this council. This much, Sir, as regards the composition of the Medical Council.</p>

<p>I should like to associate myself with my colleague, the hon. member for Cradock, in the plea he delivered in connection with clause 22 of the Bill, which amends section 80<i>bis</i> of the principal Act. I agree with him 100 per cent. In my opinion the proposed new subsection (2) is going to create problems for us. This, i.e. the obligation to send a detailed account to each patient, is going to bring about an enourmous amount of work for a medical practitioner who has a one-man practice. I am not sure either what the position of this medical practitioner is going to be with regard to the ethic code of the Medical Council, i.e. that diagnosis is in fact an intimate matter between the patient and the general practitioner himself. The existing subsection (2) provided that the medical practitioner had to furnish a detailed account to the patient and the further information which the patient might desire with regard to the amount charged, within 14 days of the receipt by him of a written request to that effect. I cannot see how this subsection could have evoked any objections. Therefore I should like to associate myself with the appeal made by the hon. member for Cradock to the hon. the Minister to reconsider this subsection. I cannot quite understand the reason for amending this subsection.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, all of us are very pleased about the third aspect with which this Bill deals, i.e. the question of drugs. To me there are two cardinal points in this connection. The first was raised by the hon. member for Durban (Central) and it concerns the classification of these drugs by the Drugs Control Council. I think the hon. member was quite correct when he said that the success of this classification into the various schedules would depend on the extent to which the Drugs Control Council would be able to limit the number of drugs. The more drugs, the more difficult it becomes to exercise control, but the smaller the number of drugs, the easier it can be controlled. This is one aspect I v/ant to mention.</p>

<p><span class="col_1981-1982" refersTo="page_1013"/>The second aspect is the possession of potentially harmful drugs, and all of us are grateful for the fact that this is now being made a punishable offence. This ought to facilitate the task of the State to obtain a conviction to a large extent. But Mr. Speaker, I want to put it to the hon. the Minister for his consideration that in my opinion this control can be improved. Perhaps one is being naive in that one is concerned about this erosion of human material which is taking place as a result of the terrible danger of drugs. In my own mind I wonder whether we have not reached the stage when it should be made compulsory in terms of the Act to specify the drug content of a prescription when a patient is given a prescription which contains of these drugs. To me it is a source of concern that such a large number of patients become addicted to these drugs accidentally. I feel a patient ought to be given the opportunity of knowing that he is using drugs. Very often a doctor is requested time and again to repeat prescriptions as such prescriptions make the patient feel much better. One asks oneself whether the responsibility for those drugs being taken should not be taken from the shoulders of the doctor and whether the patients should not be made co-responsible as far as the taking of the drugs is concerned. Then I also want to agree with the hon. member for Berea as regards his argument in connection with the inspection of the registers which have to be kept. During the 18 years I have been practising, no-one has ever asked me to see a register of mine. I have even wondered whether the time has not arrived&#x2014;perhaps I am again being naive&#x2014;to amend the regulations or the Act in such a way that medical practitioners will be obliged to register with one specific pharmacy from which he will then have to order all drugs used by him. In other words, purchases should not be made at random from just any pharmacy. It is not my intention to sow suspicion, and I am only voicing this opinion because one wants to try to suggest something in order to restrict to an absolute minimum all possible loopholes for acquiring these drugs which can cause such dreadful tragedies. Mr. Speaker, I thank you, and I gladly give my support to the amendments.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have been interested in what the hon. the Minister and other members of this House have had to say about this Bill and I want to add one or two thoughts about it as well.</p>

<p>My first thought is in regard to the dual methods of qualifications of pharmacists. I feel that those pharmacists who get their diploma should be put into exactly the same position as the doctors who get membership of a college. Those members of the Royal College of Surgeons, and those with a licenciate of the Royal College of Physicians have the right to write an examination with university standards immediately they qualify and I feel that the chemists ought to have the same right. If a chemist has a diploma and he wishes to take a university degree, he should be allowed to do it immediately after attaining that qualification. His thoughts are fresh and he could easily qualify if he put his mind to it. If he has that wish I think the opportunity ought to be given to him.</p>

<p>There are one or two things that have been said here that I am not altogether in agreement with. Firstly, let us talk about the competition that the chemist has with outside interests. The hon. member for Berea expressed his unrest about how difficult it was for a pharmacist to go into competition with the supermarket. I watched what happened recently and I found that the person who goes to a supermarket has not even got the opportunity of asking anybody what he is buying or if it is good for him. These things are displayed on the shelves and the competition that the chemist has is not with the salesman who is unqualified, but with the display counter. There is no go-between in the supermarket, and I think this is a dangerous procedure. There is nobody a customer who goes into a supermarket can ask if something is, for example, good for his stomach or if something else wil relieve his heartburn. He goes up to the shelves and fills up his bag with whatever of these popular remedies are for sale, without any control whatsoever. I am therefore not surprised that the pharmacist must try to go into competition with supermarket type of business and it is for that reason that you find that the dispensing part of a pharmacy to-day is tucked into a corner and that the display counters are in front of the shop with toys, ladies&#x2019; stockings and other goods. I do not think that any pharmacist would prefer to do that sort of business to having a regular pharmacy. The time has come, and I am sure that the hon. the Minister agrees with me, that we must have some control over the free sale of medicines. One case in particular has been brought to my notice, namely the sale of chlorodine. Chlorodine is a simple remedy and standby and it is used by many people, especially those living on the platteland, who use it for all sorts of stomach ailments nad as a pain killer. The use of chlorodine can be abused and it is being sold off the shelves and it is quite easily acquired by persons who are chlorodine habituates. They can purchase dozens of bottles of chlorodine if they so wish.</p>

<p>I have got one case of addiction already.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and I want to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister that I have received representations on this particular point as well. A professional man has landed in Swartkoppies through addiction to chlorodine. He was buying it in wholesale quantities and drinking down bottles at a time. <span class="col_1983-1984" refersTo="page_1014"/>I feel that this sort of thing should be gone into. The Drug Control Council is there to assist the Minister and I think the time has come for the hon. the Minister to take action in this regard. I do not think for one moment that the supermarket is the place for people to buy medicines. If a person wants to buy medicine he should go to a chemist and get it there.</p>

<p>I also want to say a word or two about the abuse of potentially harmful drugs and habit-forming drugs. The potentially harmful drugs, I think, could be more dangerous than the habit-forming drugs, because they are more easily obtained and their distribution is greater. The hon. member for Berea made the point that on occasions it is the fault of doctors, receptionists, and others, that quantities of these drugs are in free supply. I found that, firstly, the source of potentially harmful drugs on the illicit market is theft from wholesalers. I want to know whether it is the intention of the hon. the Minister to have stricter control over the stocks held by wholesalers and whether it is possible for the hon. the Minister to insist on a register being kept of potentially harmful drugs in stock at wholesalers and whether or not it is possible for the inspection to take place at regular intervals and the stocks compared with the sales. From what I understand, and this may be or may not be a fact, most of the drugs on the illicit market to-day come from wholesalers. Then, in a lesser quantity, we find that the provincial hospitals and, to some extent, nursing homes as well, are sources of supply. It is very difficult to exercise control here, but it must be done. Control of the dispensing and checking of stocks has to be done much more frequently than is being done at the moment. In his speech to the Pharmacy Board the hon. the Minister made reference to the fact that it may become necessary for regulations to be made to see that doctors prescribe reasonable quantities in their prescriptions. I have been practising for many years and if such a regulation came into being, I would welcome it, because I feel that over-prescribing is becoming quite rife and because a pharmaceutical company happens to put out a drug in bottles of 50, 50 tablets of that particular drug are prescribed by the doctor. If the pharmacist has to break the package to give less than the packed quantity, he levies an extra charge. I think that extra charge ought to be done away with. I think that the hon. the Minister is on the right track when he says that doctors should have their prescriptions in quantities regulated. I, for one, want to say to the hon. the Minister that I will welcome an investigation and if it is found to be feasible he should adopt it. Over-prescribing from the hospitals has become so bad that we find patients going out with big paper bags full of drugs every time they visit the hospital. It may be the fault of the young physician or the young surgeon on duty, or it may be because of the rush of work. I think it is a very bad way of prescribing. To give a patient enough drugs to last for a long time, sometimes for as long as three months, is, I think, quite a dangerous practice. I know the difficulties of the indigent and similar patient, who has to go from his home to the hospital to get his supply of medicines. We can work that out. I think we have to stop these mass-prescriptions for patients who should only receive a fixed quantity, if possible.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Cradock and I want to join him in his plea for heavier penalties for drug pedlars. I think that is the person who is at the root of all this evil. If we did not have the pedlar, we would not have thefts from hospitals, from nursing homes, from wholesalers, and from chemists. He is the person that carries the drug from place to place and he is the person that stands on the street corners tempting the youngsters to purchase whatever he has for sale. Some of the drugs he tries to sell may be quite harmless, others may be dangerous. I know of a case where a pedlar was selling, I think they were plain aspirins, and he was telling the youngsters he was selling purple hearts. He was selling these aspirins at 10c a time and these children were buying them. This man cannot be charged under the Act, and he cannot be caught under this Bill either, because he is not in possession of a potentially harmful drug. He is, of course cheating these boys and girls and I think fellows like that ought be be fairly severely punished. When they start selling stolen property, it is a double charge, because not only are they selling stolen property&#x2014;the man having no right to possess the article&#x2014;but on top of it they are selling dangerous drugs. I think the hon. the Minister must consult his Cabinet colleagues to see whether we cannot bring in much stricter punishment for these people. They are getting away with too much at the moment.</p>

<p>I want to say just a word or two about the inspection of drug books and the control of medicines. The hon. member who has just sat down suggested that doctors should purchase their drugs from one particular pharmacy or one wholesaler so that a check could be kept, I take it, of their purchases and the amounts used. Well, I do not know if we can go as far as that. I do not think we must limit that because you might have a favourite drug house that you want to deal with, you may have to deal with several different drugs, some of which are sold by one company only and some by another company. But I think perhaps a regulation may be brought in whereby doctors&#x2019; registers should be sent in to a central depot, instead of the Minister having to send an inspector to every doctor in the country who does prescribing or who is using dangerous or habit-forming drugs. Would it not be feasible to <span class="col_1985-1986" refersTo="page_1015"/>ask doctors every quarter to forward their registers for examination?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>How do you check the contents?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>That would be easy, you would see what he had purchased and what he used. There is scarcely a busy doctor in town to-day who is worried about how much he buys and how much he uses, because he knows his practice is clean. He has no fear of any inspection. For instance, he buys a couple of dozen ampules of pethidine, he knows how he uses them up, and anybody with authority can come and have a look at his register. Very rarely, do you find a person in our profession who is a drug addict himself or is selling drugs to patients. I think on the whole you will have no difficulty at all in being able to check up.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am more concerned about the checks that take place in hospital. Where large quantities of drugs are ordered and the wards have many boxes of different kinds of drugs, it is a simple matter for even an unqualified nurse to lay her hands on drugs and take them out of hospitals. If she is interested, she can have a ready field of purchase. I say that every day the ward sister ought to check on her drug book. It should be done, and the trouble is because it is not done these thefts are taking place.</p>

<p>My colleague here tells me that this is done. Well, if it was done the thefts would not take place, but because it is not done, we find quantities are being missed when they are not properly checked. Even when stocks are properly taken we find drugs missing.</p>

<p>A word was said concerning newspaper reports about drugs. I am perturbed by the sensational newspaper reports about prominent persons taking drugs and saying how well they feel on them. That is a problem that I think we have to combat. When I read in the newspapers that actor so and so, or sportsman so and so, has been taking this or that particular drug, it is amazing what effect it has. Immediately many young readers say, &#x201C;Well, if it is good enough for him, I am going to get hold of some of this as well.&#x201D; We find that this attitude is spreading to our adults as well. On more than one occasion I have had a mother come to me and say to me &#x201C;Doctor, will you please prescribe a tranquilliser for my child, he is going to write an examination next week and he is all jittery. Can we have something?&#x201D;</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the father has another remedy for it. This sort of thing is being encouraged, and I think the time has come when we must ask the newspapers to be much more circumspect when they publish news of this kind. It may be popular news, but I say it has a serious effect on our youth and we must try and stop it. Some of us like to joke about these things, but I would be very perturbed if one of my children became a habituee of a den where these things were sold. I would be very perturbed about it because the control over the child which is lost might result in the child being lost permanently. The time to act is right at the beginning when he is starting with this habit. Of course, many of them outgrow the tendency, but, unfortunately, most of them have permanent damage done to their own beings.</p>

<p>With those few remarks I want to say to the Minister we on this side of the House welcome this Bill. There may be one or two matters which we might want to talk about again during the Committee Stage, but I think both sides of the House agree this is a good Bill, it was time that this Bill should come before us, and we wish it a safe passage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for the support they have given to this measure. It is very clear, that in regard to the combating of the evil with which we are concerned here, there is general agreement as well as a great deal of concern. I think the people who are making these preparations available and supplying them, will benefit by taking cognizance of the atmosphere and the spirit in which this aspect was discussed here to-night.</p>

<p>I shall deal briefly with the points raised here by hon. members who took part in the debate, as the particular contributions that were made by each of them covered a very wide range</p>

<p>&#x2020;First of all I wish to deal with the hon. member for Durban (Central). I should like to thank him for his support of this Bill. I must say that as a member of the South African Medical and Dental Council for many years he could and did speak with authority. There, is, however, one remark which he made which I cannot leave unchallenged, and that is when he said these amendments were in the hands of my predecessor for quite a long time. That is true. It has been in the hands of the department, and my predecessor, for quite a long time. Certain interjections in this regard also came from the other side, reflecting on my predecessor. May I point out that only to-day we had discussions with the Pharmacy Board in respect of this Bill and the amendments, and they put forward to-day certain thoughts which they had not put forward before. Therefore, in the delay some good has come forward. Also, this Bill was introduced last year and only because of lack of time did it not go through. Therefore I do not think there can be any question of neglect on the part of my <span class="col_1987-1988" refersTo="page_1016"/>predecessor, and I hope hon. members will accept this from me.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) pointed to the status of a pharmacist, and said this was a very necessary step. I may say it is a great pleasure for me to have introduced this Bill which enhances the status of the pharmacist. But, if I may say so in passing, it is not only the status of the pharmacist outside this House which has been enhanced in recent weeks, because by coming over to this side of the House, the hon. member for Umlazi, who is a pharmacist, has also had his status enhanced in the House. So we are having it from both sides. It is for me a source of pleasure to have shared, and to share, in these changes, both inside and outside this hon. House.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the Drug Control Board and the very heavy burden which rests on their shoulders. That is quite true. I am giving attention at the moment, not only to their difficulties but also to the question of staff. Many aspects of the activities of the Drug Control Board do need our attention, and I should like to mention just one, namely the question of the inspection of drug factories. I should like to give the assurance that I am looking into this matter; as a matter of fact, I had discussions only the week before last with the Chairman and a few members of the Board in an effort to see where I can be of assistance to the Board.</p>

<p>The hon. member also pointed out the importance of the control of habit-forming and potentially harmful drugs, and I think he very aptly illustrated the importance of this question by quoting the thalidomide story in the United States. I think South Africa is in a favoured position in that we have a Drug Control Board, and it is a question of helping this Board to the utmost of our ability to fulfil their functions. He also raised the matter of cutting down the number of potentially harmful drugs. I may say that this is a very valuable thought and I will certainly bring this to the notice of the Drug Control Board, for them to see in what manner they can perhaps give effect to the suggestion.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member stated that the Bill provided for the supply of potentially harmful drugs only on presentation of a doctor&#x2019;s prescription, which for all practical purposes would mean that a patient would have to visit his doctor to get a new prescription each time he requires such medicine. That, of course, as the hon. member knows, is the position to-day unless a repeat prescription is given. This particular Bill will have the effect that the possession of potentially harmful drugs shall also be an offence&#x2014;not so much that it must be obtained on a prescription from a doctor, because that is already the case to-day. What the Bill does is to remedy a flaw in the Act by making the possession of potentially harmful drugs which have not been obtained on a doctor&#x2019;s prescription an offence. I just wanted to make that quite clear.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to doctor&#x2019;s fees and the very difficult and onerous task of the South African Medical and Dental Council in following up complaints in this regard. These amendments are specific endeavours to ease the burden of the Council and also to simplify the procedure, both for the Council and for the public&#x2014;we must never forget the public. I think this greatly simplifies the whole procedure as far as the patient is concerned.</p>

<p>*Then, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Cradock quite rightly placed the emphasis on the academic aspect, and not so much the commercial activities, of the pharmaceutical profession, and pointed out that in this legislation, too, we should place greater emphasis on that aspect. Now I just want to say in passing that we are living in an age of specialization. We have few people who can do specialized work. Whereas these qualifications are now being raised, it would perhaps afford us an opportunity of making better use of chemists and druggists and of utilizing their services more effectively. By that I do not mean at all that a chemist and druggist should take the place of a medical practitioner. The fact of the matter is, as the hon. member indicated, that the function of a chemist and druggist has changed to a large extent. In bygone days the function of the chemist and druggist was in actual fact the compounding and dispensing of medicine. To-day this task forms a very minor part of his function. His task has become so much greater in the sense that he has to be conversant with the thousands of drugs at our disposal. With these raised qualifications he may perhaps be able to render a service to the medical practitioner as well. That is why I am so pleased that the hon. member stressed the sound relationship between the medical practitioner and the chemist and druggist, because the chemist and druggist is the expert on drugs. It would relieve medical practitioners of a major burden if that relationship is of such a nature&#x2014;and in many instances this is in fact the case&#x2014;that this expert may serve the medical practitioner with advice and possibly also the patient who is referred to him by the doctors.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the terrible evil of hippie cult and the dangers which the use of narcotics holds. This is an attempt&#x2014;we shall have to take other steps if these are not sufficient&#x2014;not only to break down this evil, i.e. narcotics, but also to eradicate it as far as possible in South Africa. Our nation simply cannot afford to allow our people to become addicted to these narcotics. It is true that in this sphere we are granting the police more scope for instituting legal proceedings, but in my opinion, however, this is not enough. I want to make a very serious appeal to-night to all bodies in the Republic which handle narcotics in any form, to exercise extreme caution in doing so in order that not one of those preparations may land in the wrong hands, because it could totally destroy the life of a young man or a young woman. I hope that <span class="col_1989-1990" refersTo="page_1017"/>this discussion which we have had will once again convey this message very clearly, i.e. the danger this matter holds, and that we&#x2014;my colleagues in the medical profession, my colleagues in the pharmaceutical profession and all the professions which, in this field, deal with the public every day&#x2014;we shall never tire of carrying on with the process of education in regard to the evils these narctoics hold. The hon. member also referred to the penalties in clause 19. I have sympathy and understanding for his proposal, i.e. that there should be more severe penalties for the smuggler dealing in these narcotics and less severe penalties for the poor addict who is the victim. It is very difficult to draw distinctions as far as this matter is concerned, but I just want to point out to the hon. member that maximum penalties are being prescribed here. I think we may safely leave it to the discretion of the judiciary to impose these maximum penalties according to the circumstances and the person who appears before them.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to clause 22&#x2014;section 80<i>bis</i> of the principal Act&#x2014;which relates to the accounts of medical practitioners which, in terms of this legislation, will have to be specified accounts in future. In this regard the hon. member for Fauresmith associated himself with what the hon. member for Cradock had said. To my mind it is a good thing that this matter was put forward here. It may cause more work; but at the same time hon. members rightly pointed out&#x2014;we should never lose sight of this&#x2014;that most of the patients who are receiving accounts in South Africa to-day, are satisfied patients. The majority of the patients and everybody sitting here are satisfied with the services and also the accounts they receive.</p>

<p>Who is satisfied with an account which is too large?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am merely emphasizing that in South Africa at present and all over the world those who appreciate the services obtained in the sphere of medicine outnumber those who do not have appreciation for them. But now I want to set hon. member&#x2019;s minds at ease by saying that I am convinced that this insertion in regard to specified accounts must remain. Firstly, because this is the current practice in many practises to-day. I have a few examples of this before me&#x2014;to make use of a printed account form which is not so difficult to fill in. Secondly, in many practices this is already being done in the majority of cases, as provision has already been made for this in the Medical Schemes Act and as most practises, especially in the cities, consist for the most part of patients who belong to medical schemes. In this regard I just want to say that clause 22 is actually a monument to Mr. Willie Roodt, who was a member of this House for many years and a lay member of the Medical Council for about 40 years. In passing I want to record our thanks and our appreciation to-night for the tremendous contribution which Mr. Willie Roodt rendered as a member of the Medical and Dental Council for so many years.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Berea also referred to the very wide effects of the use of potentially harmful drugs. I am indebted to him for labouring this point, because after all this legislation will at some time or another benefit every one of us here and every single individual in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member also went on to point to certain omissions in the Bill. He referred to the position of the chemist and druggist, and especially to certain wishes of the Pharmacy Board and of the profession as a whole. I indicated, at the banquet to which the hon. member referred, that I shall look into this matter. But I want to make it quite clear that I am not going to appoint another commission of inquiry. I do feel that the Pharmacy Board and the Department of Health are, in a joint effort, quite capable of doing the best that can be done for the profession. One must also never forget that the question of the recognition of diplomas, etc., must also be looked into. Other members, for example the hon. member for Rosettenville, also raised this point.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the Bremmer Report. He made out quite a good case from his point of view.</p>

</speech>

<p>I am glad the hon. member interrupted me. I shall certainly go a long way in trying to implement all the recommendations contained in the Bremmer report, if the hon. member for Berea will assure me that in this House the hon. member for Transkei will also vote for me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I shall do my best.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one must be quite realistic about this matter. It is a question of different interests being affected and represented in this House. That has been the bar against putting the recommendations of that report into full operation. After all, we need the sanction of this House in such matters. As I have said, all aspects and all interests are being looked after by the different members of this House.</p>

<p>The question of a quantity per occasion being limited to a dosage basis was also raised by the hon. member for Berea. I think the furthest I can go at this stage is perhaps to indicate specifically to doctors how important it is to give effect to this particular suggestion of the hon. member. I think that this will go a long way towards solving the problem. The hon. member also raised the question of the registering of premises. Let me be quite frank. I have not considered this aspect as yet, but I shall consider it as soon as I have the time.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the inspection <span class="col_1991-1992" refersTo="page_1018"/>of registers and records. He pointed out how adequate the inspection is, especially in his own case. This is not a case of a big brother watching the hon. member, but I want to give the assurance that there will be no discrimination whatsoever in the inspection of the records and registers of pharmacists on the one hand and those of doctors on the other hand. I think the hon. member will also agree with me that pharmacists are handling many more drugs every day than the doctors. I should like to mention the practice which is followed to a large extent. I do not know whether this is not the reason why hon. members have had so many visits from the inspectors. We usually ascertain from the wholesalers where the large quantities of these drugs are going. The inspections are then carried out more regularly and at more frequent intervals at those particular places to which large quantities of drugs are being sent.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked for the ratio of pharmacists to medical men on the committee to be made more equal. I shall certainly look into this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>That is only in the case of classification.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but let me just point to this one aspect. To be able to classify, important clinical considerations must be taken into account. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why medical men are represented in larger numbers than the pharmacists.</p>

<p>*Now I come to the hon. member for Fauresmith. I think the hon. member very strikingly pointed out to us the change and shift in accent that had taken place in regard to the function of the pharmaceutical profession. The hon. member pointed out that to a large extent chemists and druggists find themselves in the manufacturing industry at present. I agree wholeheartedly that the work they are doing to-day is perhaps more important than the work they did in the past when they only had to compound and dispense medicines. That is why it is so essential that we should in fact introduce these improved qualifications in South Africa, as we are doing now.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member raised the question of the constitution of the Medical Council. He expressed the thought that the directors of the hospital services of the various provinces should perhaps be included in the Medical and Dental Council. At the moment I do not want to give a decisive answer in this regard, but I want to tell the hon. member that the matter he raised is an important one, because the constitution of this council is to my mind no longer suited to the development that has taken place in recent years. This is particularly true when one has regard to the very extensive representation which the steadily increasing number of medical schools have on this council.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the destructive effects of narcotics and the task of the Drugs Control Board. He raised the point that when a prescription is issued to a patient, the prescription should indicate that the drug concerned is a drug of that nature. I think that what the hon. member had in mind, was that such a notice should not only appear on the prescription, but that it should actually appear on the container itself. I shall have to give more thought to it, because to call, in such a pointed manner, the attention of the public to the fact that such a drug is a narcotic, would also hold certain dangers. This may give certain people an incentive or make them aware that this is an opportunity for abusing such a drug, people who would otherwise not have known this.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Rosettenville referred to the competition between the pharmacists and the supermarkets. I do not think that he put the case quite correctly, because the difficulty to-day is not so much one of the pharmacist being in competition with a display shelf. That competition we have had over the years. The point is, however, that in the supermarket we find a pharmacy shop with a pharmacist in charge.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Departmental stores have that, not the supermarkets.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but in the supermarkets we have had that position all along. That is the very question which the hon. member for Berea raised. This question has been dealt with in the Bremmer report.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about stricter control of stocks of wholesalers, hospitals and nursing homes. As far as that is concerned, we have the difficulty of the shortage of staff to carry out these inspections. The hon. member then made the suggestion that the registers should be sent to a central point. I do not think that that will be feasible at all, because after all the inspection has to be made not only of the records, but also of the amounts of stock carried by the doctor, pharmacist, wholesaler or hospital.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I want to thank hon. members once again for their support and for the constructive debate we have had. I hope that, especially outside this House, the greatest measure of cognizance will be taken of the concern that prevails, particularly in regard to narcotics, and that we shall see the necessary effect, apart from the effect of the implementation of this legislation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to revert to the discussion we had in the Committee Stage when an amendment was proposed by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. We thought it was a reasonable amendment. It was implicit in that amendment that the Minister, in making appointments to councils and boards which are provided for in this Bill, would recognize the bilingual character of our South African people&#x2014;our white people, of course, because the Bill provides for the promotion of the culture of the white population of South Africa. The Minister seemed to think that provided the members appointed were bilingual South Africans, that would be sufficient. Sir, that is hardly in accordance with the views that have been expressed on occasion by the hon. the Prime Minister. He has told us, and he has told us very earnestly, that we have two separate cultures, two groups of people, but we have one common loyalty to South Africa, and we are very much in earnest about this loyalty. In other words, he recognizes that there are two groups in the population. We felt that it was not sufficient to provide for bilingualism alone, because apart from bilingualism we are accustomed to saying that South Africans are Afrikaans-speaking people and English-speaking people. Sometimes it is very difficult to say what a man is because he belongs to that common group that the hon. the Minister had in mind. We felt that in these appointments to boards, the Minister ought to have made provision for both sections of the population. I call them &#x201C;sections&#x201D; but I think &#x201C;groups&#x201D; is a better word. I am sorry to say that the hon. the Minister seemed to be annoyed. He suggested that his intentions were good and that we were not prepared to accept his good intentions. That was not our feeling at all. We did not feel that way. What we wished to emphasize was that both groups should be well represented. The hon. the Minister and I have had differences of opinion in the past on this subject. I do not wish to revert to those now, but I should like to mention at this Third Reading stage that we had that in mind and that we are disappointed that he was not prepared to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<p>I said very clearly and explicitly yesterday that the amendment which was moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and which was rejected during the Committee Stage, definitely meant that I would have been able to appoint unilingual Afrikaans-speaking persons and unilingual English-speaking persons on the Cultural Council. I still maintain that when a cultural council is established, it is absolutely essential that the members of the council should in the first place be bilingual, and should in the second place have a reasonable knowledge of both cultures in order to be able to appreciate them. I fully endorse what the Prime Minister said, i.e. that we have two cultures and that two languages are being used at present. Under this legislation we are placing it all under one cultural council, and therefore it should be possible to have mutual appreciation. I also said it would be a foolish and stupid Minister who did not appoint bilingual Afrikaans-speaking persons and bilingual English-speaking persons on the council in the correct ratio if he could get them. What the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, as well as what the hon. member for Kensington said a moment ago, is wrong. It would be fatal to appoint unilingual persons, from whichever language group, to such an important council.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate on this Bill we <span class="col_1995-1996" refersTo="page_1020"/>raised certain matters on which we did not receive satisfactory replies. Under clause 1, for example, we raised the question of water supplies, the use of water, the possibility of the use of sea water, etc. I particularly raised the question of the pipeline terminal in the sea, to which the hon. the Minister did not reply at all. I asked him whether the Administration intended to establish such terminals in the sea, in particular at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. Under other clauses we put similar questions. I am now standing up to indicate that we on this side of the House do not intend to take all these points further at the Committee Stage because we shall have the opportunity next week to discuss these matters on a broader basis. I can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister that when the Railway Budget debate takes place next week we shall once more raise some of the points which we raised during the Second Reading debate and to which he did not reply. They link up with other points which we also want to raise. Therefore this side will at this stage not discuss this measure any further, but we shall definitely take these matters further next week.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have no quarrel with the hon. the Minister about the amendment which he has now moved, but I have a difficulty in respect of which he may perhaps help me. That is with regard to the wording of subsection (a) (i). The provision reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board may grant a diploma or certificate &#x2026; to any person &#x2026; who satisfies the board that he is a person of good character and that he was on the first day of January, 1969&#x2014;which has now become 1970&#x2014;undergoing a prescribed course of study and training at an institution recognized by the board or was at that date serving as an indentured apprentice to a chemist and druggist within the Republic or the Territory;.</block>

<p>My problem is the following. This is to make provision for the existing system to carry on until the end of this year. Under this system a student did his first year at a university or a college. He wrote his examination. Thereafter he did a two-year apprenticeship and continued with his academic studies after that. On the first day of January it seems to me, that he may be in neither of those positions. He would have concluded his term as a student, I assume, when he writes his examination and when the term for that particular course closes and the training institution closes down for the year. He need not necessarily be apprenticed at that date, because he is awaiting the result of the examination before he can really approach a would-be master to accept an apprenticeship agreement. There might be some legal explanation or interpretation which will cover this problem, but as I see it, there could be a gap when a man is no longer a student because he has finished his studies and he is not yet an apprentice because his apprenticeship has not commenced. If the hon. the Minister can clear this up, I will be grateful.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he will define the term &#x201C;good character&#x201D;, because this clause is putting it in afresh. It was not there before. This phrase was removed or negated in Act No. 13 of 1928 after a lawsuit here in Cape Town in which a certain very well-known doctor from England was refused registration by the Medical Council on the grounds that he was not of good character. The court ruled that they could not define good character and they ordered the Medical Council to register this man. I therefore cannot understand why the phrase has suddenly been brought into this clause. I want to move an amendment that these words be omitted. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us what his reaction is to the arguments put up by the hon. member for Durban (Central), because he raised a very valid point. If a court is unable to say what is meant by &#x201C;good character&#x201D; can the hon. the Minister tell us how it is defined now and how the court will be able to interpret it now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to begin with I should like to reply to the question the hon. member for Berea asked in connection with the date of 1st January, 1970. His problem is that at that moment a student may not know exactly to which group he will belong. Yesterday and the day before yesterday I had the executive council of the Pharmacy Board here and they pointed out to me that the first day of January, 1969, is of course a problematic date. However, they had considered all the aspects, also those raised by the hon. member for Berea a moment ago, and they are quite satisfied that, if the date is 1st January. 1970, it will not cause them any problems. It is therefore specifically at the request of and after consideration by the advisory council of the Pharmacy Board that this amendment is being made to this clause.</p>

<p>As regards the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (Central) I am rather surprised at his moving something like that, and I am sure the hon. member will not insist upon it. The hon. member has been a member of the Medical and Dental Council for many years. I am no lawyer, and a case such as the hon. member mentioned may have occurred in previous years. However, the fact of the matter is that if I accepted the amendment moved by the hon. member, I would place the Pharmacy Board in a much worse position than they are in at present. If it should prove to be difficult to interpret this particular phrase &#x201C;of good character&#x201D; in the courts, it is still no reason why this should be removed from the powers the Board has at present. Moreover, I am informed that from a legal point of view there is no other way of putting this matter. I therefore put it to the hon. member that we should not deprive the Pharmacy Board of this power simply because on one occasion there was some difficulty in interpreting it. On the other hand, there may be cases <span class="col_1999-2000" refersTo="page_1022"/>where it is very clear that a person is not of good character, and where this may even be proved in court. I therefore should not like to place the Pharmacy Board in a worse position than they are by removing this provision.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>The point at issue is not the jurisdiction over a person before he is registered. The point is that the board has jurisdiction over its own actions. It can, for instance, refuse to register such a person. Before he is so registered, he is just not registered. It is not then for the board to take the person concerned to court but for this person to take the board to court.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I must, with due respect, disagree with the hon. the Minister once more. If a person fulfils certain conditions, conditions unconnected with the question of his character, the board must register him. They have no option but to do that. If a person meets the academic and practical qualifications laid down, then the board cannot refuse to register him, except then where he has a bad character. But for this purpose they have to define what a &#x201C;bad character&#x201D; entails. Furthermore, they must be able to explain why a person is from their point of view a bad character, because the man can take them to court. And as I have said before, the Supreme Court here in Cape Town held in the medical case, the case of <i>G. D. Reid</i> v. <i>S.A. Medical Council,</i> that as the board has no jurisdiction over a person until such time as he is registered, they cannot refuse to register him. The same applies here and it is for that reason that I have moved the deletion of these lines. As a matter of fact, I think it will be well for the Minister to leave out these words, because they are meaningless in any case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>I am not prepared to omit these words. I should just like to explain one point. The board need not explain or define what considerations they took into account in arriving at the decision that a person has no good character, unless of course they are taken to court. Let me refer the hon. member to the Afrikaans text.</p>

<p>*The phrase &#x201C;iemand van goeie sedelike ge-drag&#x201D; is used in the Afrikaans text. As I have said, I am not prepared to omit these words, and I do not think the hon. member really wants them to be omitted either. However, I undertake to go into the matter to see whether we cannot word it more strongly in the English text as well. Then I can make an amendment in the Other Place. The English word for &#x201C;sedelik&#x201D; is &#x201C;moral&#x201D;, but I do not want to make the amendment right now, because I first want to make sure what is the strongest way in which we can put it.</p>

<p>Last night, during the Second-Reading debate, we accepted as a principle, contained in this and in subsequent clauses, that the classification of drugs would in future be handled by the Drugs Control Council. I am in favour of this principle. However, as I indicated last night, I have certain problems and reservations about the constitution of the body which will be called upon to make decisions on classifications.

<p>I have already said, for the information of the hon. member, that the Drugs Control Council is governed by a separate Act. Unfortunately that Act is not under discussion at present. As the hon. member quite rightly remarked, there is a preponderance of medical representation <span class="col_2001-2002" refersTo="page_1023"/>on that council, because an important function of that council is to provide security as regards the clinical application of the registered remedies. As this function will now be transferred from the Medical Council and the Pharmaceutical Board to the Drugs Control Council, however, I intend consulting the first-mentioned bodies in that connection when the latter council is constituted again. This is the only undertaking I can give at the moment. I do not think the hon. member can, in dealing with this Bill, expect me to discuss the constitution of a body which is constituted under another Act.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Here again I have no quarrel with the amendment moved by the hon. the Minister, but I want to raise a matter in respect of the new subsection (3) contained in clause 16, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person by whom a prescription referred to in subsection (1) is dispensed for the last time in accordance with the provisions of subsection (l)<i>bis</i>, shall retain such prescription for a period of not less than three years as from the date on which it is so dispensed for the last time and shall produce it during that period upon demand for inspection by the registrar of the board or by any member of the police force of or above the rank of sergeant or by any person authorized thereto in writing by the Minister or by the registrar.</block>

<p>I have no objection to this and I was very gratified last night when the Minister, in his reply to the Second Reading, indicated that he was prepared to see that there would be no discrimination in the inspection of records <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> doctors and chemists and druggists. But as I read this, when a prescription has been dispensed for the last time, this particular phrase to my mind refers not only to the chemist who dispenses it for the last time, but also to a doctor who does his own dispensing. When he decides in his wisdom that that particular item will be supplied for the last time, I should imagine that there would be some record, not in a prescription book, but in his case card. Now I want to ask the Minister whether it is the intention, as I read this clause, that the Registrar of the board or any member of the Police of or above the rank of sergeant will now be in the position to call upon that general practitioner and ask to inspect his prescription records, because that is how I see the matter as it stands in terms of this amendment.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. the Minister for his explanation and I am very grateful to have it recorded in Hansard. Now the hon. the Minister has moved an amendment to the proposed section 65<i>bis</i> (4) (e) in which he has changed the word &#x201C;drugs&#x201D; to &#x201C;drug&#x201D;, and I wish to move a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 3, page 12, after &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after consultation with the board&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I do this because this clause is now giving authority at the discretion of the Secretary for Health, for bodies and organizations to handle certain potentially harmful drugs. I believe that the amendment the Minister has made in limiting the word &#x201C;drugs&#x201D; to the singular, &#x201C;drug&#x201D;, will to a certain extent restrict the position and also allay a certain amount of anxiety which has existed in pharmaceutical circles. In the light of the Minister&#x2019;s explanation during the Second Reading, that it is the intention to allow the S.A. Council for the Blind and certain Bantu nursing services to handle these drugs, I must admit that I have no objection to it; I think it is reasonable, but I feel that before the scope is extended to any further bodies or organizations, there should be some consultation with the S.A. Pharmacy Board which I believe, representing the chemists of the country, has a direct interest in this matter. I do not ask for this amendment lightheartedly, but I do so because I believe that there is a precedent, and if the Minister <span class="col_2003-2004" refersTo="page_1024"/>will refer to another clause in the Bill which was also dealt with last night, i.e. the clause which by registration allows midwives to handle potentially harmful drugs and habit-forming drugs, he will find that the enabling power for that particular amendment comes from section 72 of the Act, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister, after consulting the Council and the Board, may make regulations &#x2026;</block>

<p>In the light of that, I believe it is reasonable, since potentially harmful drugs are causing a great deal of concern to many people throughout the country and since the leakage of potentially harmful drugs can be a menace to health, to ask that before further avenues are left open for their distribution, consultation should take place with the board. That is the sole purpose of my amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the sentiments of the hon. member in endeavouring to make quite sure that potentially harmful drugs will not get into the hands of persons who might not be as careful with these drugs as one would expect them to be. The hon. member has referred to section 72 in terms of which the Minister may make regulations after consultation with the board. The position here is not quite the same because, after all, regulations made by the Minister under section 72 are regulations affecting the board and its members. In this particular instance the board and its members are not affected at all. It is the public that we are concerned about and that the hon. member is particularly concerned about. I think we can say without fear of contradiction that the Secretary for Health would be very, very careful indeed in issuing these permits. That is the first point. Secondly, there would be a big delay in issuing such permits if on every occasion the Secretary has to go to the board. For practical reasons, therefore, I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment, but I do think that we can fully trust the Secretary for Health, in his wisdom, to be constantly on his guard in this respect, as indeed the board would be if they were consulted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I understand what the hon. the Minister has said. I rise only to make one point clear. It was not my intention that every single application for a permit should have to be considered by the board. My suggestion was this: If an organization like Santa, for example, wished to distribute to certain tuberculosis sufferers a drug which fell in the sixth schedule and it was felt in the wisdom of the Secretary for Health that Santa should receive authority to do that, then I believe, when it comes to granting permission to a new body such as that, that it would be right and proper for the Secretary to consult with the Board, I did not mean that each individual case under the Bantu nursing services should be handled in that way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I should like the hon. the Minister to clarify one further point, please. The proposed new section 65<i>ter</i> provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall possess potentially harmful drugs unless he has acquired such drugs in pursuance of a sale or supply which is permitted by the provisions of this Act.</block>

<p>I am sure that this enjoys the wholehearted support of everybody in this House. But there is one problem that I have in regard to the implimentation of this section. Last night I pointed out to the Minister that it was a considered opinion that medical representatives, who were neither registered with the Medical Council as medical men nor with the Pharmacy Board as chemists and druggists, often find themselves in the course of their business, in possession of samples of potentially harmful drugs. I know that there are many firms of high repute who employ individuals of integrity who may not be qualified, but who fall without the control of either the Council or the Board.</p>

<p>I believe there are also people who are not of such high integrity and firms which may not have the same standards to which I have previously referred and where there may be abuses. These people carry drugs about, potentially dangerous and harmful drugs; they do not exercise sufficient care in handling them, and may leave them in their briefcases in the boot or in an unlocked car. These drugs are then liable to be stolen. What is more, there can also be indiscriminate distribution at the discretion of a person who is not really qualified to handle them. There are cases where some representatives have, out of the goodness of their hearts, offered anti-biotics and potentially harmful drugs to people who, in their opinion, were in need of these drugs. This is something which should not be permitted. I should like to hear from the Minister whether it is intended that this clause should cover such a loophole, and I seek his assurance on this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. member knows, this clause prohibits the possession of potentially harmful drugs which have not been acquired in terms of the provisions of the Act. This clause seeks to cover a loophole in the Act whereby control over potentially harmful drugs will be intensified. It is not a question of there being no control; we simply want to intensify the control. As I see the matter, the specific case mentioned by the hon. member is not being <span class="col_2005-2006" refersTo="page_1025"/>covered by this clause. I am also fully aware, like the hon. member, that what he mentioned is a danger and constitutes a problem which we have to combat. On the other hand, however, we would be creating major problems for the people who have to bring these drugs to the attention of medical practitioners and other bodies and persons, because by whom should that then be done? I shall give further consideration to this matter, however, and I want to give the hon. member the assurance that if there is any way of intensifying the control even more, I shall most definitely do so with due regard being had to our practical problems. At the moment, however, neither the hon. member nor I have an amendment before us in terms of which this can be done.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Official Opposition during the Second Reading stage indicated its opposition to the abolition of trial by jury. We stated a very clear case for maintaining this form of trial, which is recognized as one of the hallmarks of the democratic system. However, the House, in its wisdom, decided to accept the principle of the Bill and we now have the Committee Stage of this Bill before us. There is nothing we can do in the Committee Stage. We can move no amendments which will bring back trial by jury. The principle has been accepted. The fundamental clause is clause 2. That, in fact, is the clause which abolishes trial by jury.

<p>Clause 2 (Contd.):</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when you reported progress and asked for leave to sit again just over a week ago, I was replying to the speeches of the hon. member for Green Point and the hon. member for Wynberg. What I had pointed out in the short time at my disposal at that time was that there in point of fact was a basic difference between this side and that side of this House. This basic difference is that we should like to attach a high value to South African citizenship. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point is an indication to me that he does not attach such a high value to South African citizenship as we should like such citizenship to have. [Interjection.] I shall prove this now. The hon. member says this is nonsense, but he obviously does not know what we are dealing with at the moment. In the course of the few remarks I am going to make, I shall indicate that it forms part of our considerations to regard it as essential that a high value should be attached to South African citizenship. In the first place it should be remembered that to be issued with a passport is not a right or something which can be claimed automatically. Nobody can claim to be issued with a passport automatically. This is neither the position here in South Africa nor in any other part of the world, as far as I know. In other words, passports are under the control of the State and the departments concerned. A passport as travelling document is either issued or withheld, according to the consideration of all the merits which may be applicable to the person applying for such a passport. It often happens that passports are not issued to certain people who apply for passports. There may be various good reasons for doing so. For the purposes of our argument we have to accept that those reasons are in fact good ones, because this discussion does not afford us an opportunity of arguing whether or not the reasons are good ones. But the fact of the matter is that a passport is refused under certain circumstances. It then happens that some persons decide, in spite of the fact that they have been refused passports, to leave the country all the same. They then apply for permanent exit permits. An exit permit cannot be refused. It must be granted. But, Sir, there are far-reaching implications for a person who applies for such an exit permit. I assume that anybody who makes use of an exit permit after he has been refused a passport, knows what implications that has</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the technical aspects of the various clauses here. But before doing so, I should like to indicate that to a large extent this is what hon. members on that side of the House object to. Our attitude is that when a person cannot obtain a passport or travelling document and leaves the country permanently in spite of the refusal of such a document and in conflict with the wishes or decisions of the Government, such a person, who leaves the country on a permanent exit permit, is no longer entitled to the protection and the facilities he would otherwise have enjoyed as a South African citizen. I should like to explain a few of the technical aspects of this matter. Section 6 of Act No. 34 of 1955, as substituted by section 8 of Act No. 23 of 1964, provides that a person who leaves the country permanently on an exit permit will be regarded as a prohibited person for the purposes of Act No. 22 of 1913, i.e. the Admission of Persons to the Republic of South Africa Act. When a person makes use of such an exit permit, the only deduction one can make is that it is no longer his intention to travel under the protection of a South African passport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Not necessarily.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Under those circumstances it is so. It cannot be otherwise. Such a person wants to leave South Africa and for that reason, in spite of all the far-reaching implications that has for him, he makes use of an exit permit to leave South Africa. In that case the only deduction one can make is that that person no longer intends being a South African. In that case his intention is to leave South Africa permanently and to cease being a South African. In fact, the Act I have just mentioned, provides that such a person shall then be regarded as a prohibited person for the purposes of Act No. 22 of 1913. But section 15 (c) of the South African Citizenship Act (Act No. 44 of 1949), provides that prohibited persons shall cease to be South African citizens. In other words, if a person makes use of such an exit permit he becomes a prohibited person in terms of the first legal provision I have mentioned. In addition he also loses his citizenship in terms of section 15 (c): of the South African Citizenship Act.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from><span class="col_2009-2010" refersTo="page_1027"/>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>What does he become then? Stateless?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That may be the position, but not necessarily. The hon. member for East London (City) says such a person will become stateless, but this is not necessarily so. Such a person may adopt the citizenship of another country, which does in fact happen in many cases. These are the people that we keep in mind. It is people like this, people who become citizens of foreign states, who, according to us, are not entitled to return to South Africa. The hon. members for Green Point and Wynberg obviously want these people to retain the right to return to South Africa. We do not accept this. We say that if such a person adopts the citizenship of another state, he should no longer enjoy that right.</p>

<p>But I proceed. Section 4 of Act No. 22 of 1913 gives a lengthy exposition of what persons are to be regarded as prohibited persons to the Republic, and then we have the next section, section 5 of the same Act, which provides what persons are not prohibited persons for the purposes of section 4. But section 5 makes no mention of section 24 of the same Act. Section 24 makes provision for the issue of passports and visas, and it provides that anybody who does not have a passport or a visa is a prohibited person. As a result of that, the explicit implication surely is, and there could have been no other intention, that if a person has become a prohibited person because he has used an exit permit as a result of which he has lost his South African citizenship and can no longer obtain a South African passport, he is a prohibited person in terms of section 24 of Act No. 22 of 1913. That is the case which is being covered here. But what is more, as I have just said, some of these people adopt foreign citizenship. Some of them travel on foreign travelling documents, on the passports of another country. In such cases we issue one or two warnings to these people in advance that they may not travel on foreign passports. Hon. members will probably agree with me that if a South African citizen does not make use of a South African passport&#x2014;if a South African passport is not good enough for him to travel on&#x2014;and wants to avail himself of the facility to use a foreign passport as a travelling document, he most certainly no longer deserves the treatment to which an ordinary. South African citizen is entitled.</p>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member will, from the nature of the case, water down the whole intention of this legislation, and because of that I regret that I cannot accept this amendment. I want to emphasize the fact&#x2014;I think I have mentioned this before&#x2014;that we are nevertheless, in spite of everything, obliged in terms of the Hague Convention to take these people back. If these people are not acceptable to the country in which they find themselves and if they are stateless, we are obliged in terms of the International Convention to take them back if they are returned to South Africa. The hon. member for Green Point spoke of &#x201C;in the glory of his isolation&#x201D;. The hon. member knows enough about the administration to know that this is not so. The position is not that I sit there, have a document placed in front of me, and that I then have to pass judgment.</p>

<p>The decision is yours.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, now the hon. member is explaining it better. I have to accept responsibility in this Parliament. Hon. members opposite have the opportunity of criticizing me, and my Department through me, when we come to the discussion of the Vote or on some other occasion. That is quite correct, but the hon. member knows that when a decision is being taken I do not sit in the isolation of my office without any information at my disposal and take a decision based on my opinion of the man&#x2019;s appearance. Decisions are not taken on those grounds. The hon. member knows that the entire Department of the Interior, with highly trained people who are experienced and have the necessary information, are at my disposal to make recommendations. The hon. member also knows that in cases where there is any doubt, further information which has been obtained from the police or from other sources, is taken into consideration. These are the circumstances under which we take decisions in connection with passports and other travelling documents.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg spoke of the deposits we ask for. I am afraid that these deposits have nothing to do with this clause. I think the discussion of the Interior Vote will provide a better opportunity for discussing this matter. It is so that we do ask for deposits in certain cases, but I do not want to elaborate on that now because this is not the right opportunity for doing so. I should like to explain to the hon. member under what circumstances we ask for deposits as well as everything we take into consideration in connection with deposits and guarantees, but I think it would be better to do so during the discussion of the Vote.</p>

<p>The other side of the picture is this. When somebody applies for South African citizenship, high requirements have to be met before such a person can obtain South African citizenship, and I think that when people are indifferent towards South African citizenship, we should ask them to meet the same high requirements as those which people have to meet when they want to obtain South African citizenship. In the light of these circumstances this amendment will merely be a watering down of the intention of the legislator, and consequently I cannot accept it.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I unfortunately missed the previous discussions on this Bill through circumstances beyond my control, but I have done my best to follow the discussions from newspaper reports, and also I have listened now to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation of <span class="col_2011-2012" refersTo="page_1028"/>the very severe action, which he is taking in this amending Bill. If one has not had previous experience of what happens with the refusals of the Minister of the Interior&#x2014;not necessarily this Minister, but certainly his predecessors&#x2014;in regard to the issue of passports, one might have been more inclined to accept ministerial assurances and explanations more readily; but unfortunately my experience in the cases that have been brought to my notice is that there have been many completely unreasonable refusals of passports, that people have been compelled to take exit permits as a result and therefore the Minister&#x2019;s explanations this afternoon do not carry any weight with me. People who have been refused passports are not given the opportunity of appearing before the Minister and giving an explanation, or at least being given the opportunity of defending themselves against whatever accusations have been made against them by the Security Branch or by any other sources of information that the Minister has at his disposal. Therefore it seems to me to be a tremendously punitive action the Minister is taking here against people who never know what the charges are against them and who are given no opportunity of having a confrontation with the Minister and explaining their point of view and perhaps of asking him to give some explanation as to the action taken against them. That is the one thing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg has mentioned the case of many of the Coloured people who wish to leave South Africa and take jobs in Canada and in other countries where opportunities for their economic advancement appear to them to be much greater than they are in South Africa, and also because they feel that there is little future for their children in this country under the disabilities they suffer. Many of these people have to leave on exit permits because they have not been allowed passports. They really did not wish to abandon their South African citizenship and the privileges attaching to it, but circumstances have forced these things upon them, and therefore I think this is a very unfair measure indeed.</p>

<p>The other instance the hon. the Minister mentioned was that of people using passports of other countries instead of South African passports. I should like a little clarity as to whether the policy of the Government has changed in this regard. To the best of my knowledge, over the past few years the Government has turned a blind eye and indeed has actually given permission to large numbers of people to travel on British and other passports for commercial purposes, people who wish to open markets for South Africa and who are unable to go to certain countries using a South African passport, particularly to other countries on the Continent of Africa. I believe some of these people have attempted to make sure that they are not jeopardizing their position as South African citizens by using the passports they are entitled to, by virtue of the dual citizenship allowed them by the other countries, such as people for instance who were born in Britain but have become South African citizens and who are always at any time entitled to take out a British passport, or people whose fathers were born in Britain. They are always allowed to revert to the privilege of obtaining a British passport. In the past, to the best of my knowledge, there have been many such cases of persons travelling in Africa and elsewhere using British or other passports, with the connivance or the knowledge of the Government and its approval in order that South Africa&#x2019;s export trade may be increased.</p>

<p>Yes, very often with their approval; or where they have heard of it perchance, certainly no punitive steps have been taken against people in that regard. It is specific people who are singled out for this punishment, people who are on the political list of the Government, people on whom the Security Branch has files. These are the people who suffer if they happen as South Africans to use the passport of another country even though their journeys, I might say, are perfectly innocent. They may be travelling simply as tourists for pleasure and not for any subversive purpose whatsoever. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell this Committee whether the Government has changed its policy and is now adopting an overall policy towards people who use the passports of other countries while they have South African passports as well.</p>

The hon. member made specific reference to one group of people, i.e. certain Coloured people, as she called them, who left this country to seek better prospects in other countries. Sir, if these people decide that South Africa is no longer good enough for them and that there is not enough room for them and their children to make a livelihood and they bid South Africa farewell fully aware of the fact that they are taking a risk in leaving this country on an exit permit but nevertheless prepared to go to another country where the grass seems to be greener to them, and if they eventually find that things are not so good there and that South Africa is a better place, it is thei: just desert that they should remain where they are.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I have never left this country with the intention of not returning. Sir, let us now really come to the essence of this clause. The Act now provides that any person who does not have the elementary travelling <span class="col_2013-2014" refersTo="page_1029"/>documents, i.e. a passport or a visa, is a prohibited person. Such a prohibited person does not have the right of appeal. Hon. members on that side now want certain persons to be exempted from these provisions of the Act simply because they were born here in South Africa; for that reason they should now be treated differently to all other prohibited persons and should be allowed the right of appeal without their being in possession of the elementary travelling documents, which any person must have to travel in the international world. Let us go into the details. Who are the people for whom the hon. member for Houghton and hon. members of the Opposition have been acting as champions here today? There are three groups of people. The first group consists of those who have left the country on an exit permit, who have shaken the dust of South Africa from their feet. After the authorities concerned had decided that these people should not obtain passports or travelling documents, they said that they were not prepared to accept the decision of the authorities. They do not want to accept the decision of the Government of South Africa and they nevertheless wish to leave South Africa of their own free will without a passport or visa but merely on an exit permit. This is the first group of people on whose behalf hon. members opposite want to take up the cudgels. The other group consists of people who travel about in the world under a different nationality than the South African nationality, who repudiate South African citizenship in the international world as soon as they are out of our sight, and then, when it suits them to return, when it is convenient for them to return, we should be good enough to throw our doors open to them and to make an exception in their case simply because they were born in South Africa. Mr. Chairman, there are many of their kind in the world. We say &#x201C;good riddance&#x201D; to them. We do not want to have them back in South Africa ever again.</p>

<p>There is a third group for whom the hon. member and her henchmen are acting here as champions, and they are the people who travel abroad, not on South African passports&#x2014;I do not know whether they are ashamed to do so&#x2014;but on the passports of other countries, people who renounce South Africa openly of their own free will, and after they have done so, hon. members expect us to make ourselves cheap by making special concessions to these people by exempting them from the provisions of the existing Act. We are not in fact introducing a new principle here. The principle is that if a person does not have a passport and a visa, he cannot return to South Africa; in that case he is a prohibited person, and these hon. members now want us to allow these people, who have openly renounced South Africa, who have decided to ignore the Government of South Africa and its civil administration by disregarding its decision, to return when it suits them to do so, when they deem it fit to return to South Africa&#x2014;and that will be the day!</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the hon. member for Parow did not get his facts sorted out before he attempted to present an argument to this House. He referred to those prohibited immigrants under the Act who are now deprived of the right of appeal. They never had South African citizenship. They are aliens only. We are discussing under this particular clause persons who have lost their South African citizenship. Secondly, the hon. member for Parow talks about people who travel on a passport other than a South African passport as though it is a grave offence. Does the hon. member not know that of 492 applications made to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, or to his predecessor, all but 38 were approved? Permission was granted to all but 38 to travel on foreign passports! It is not a crime to travel on the passport of another country. The department itself approved of all but 38 of 492 applications to travel on the passport of another country; so there are good reasons, as I am sure the hon. the Minister will appreciate. But this particular provision means that if any of the 38 remaining applicants choose to disagree with the Minister and his department &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; then they must lose their citizenship, and the hon. member for Parow says, &#x201C;that is the point&#x201D;. Sir, I submit that we have not yet reached a stage of dictatorship in this country. The Minister is quite right, a passport is not a right; it is in the prerogative of the Executive to grant it or not to grant it; it is a grace and favour which is exercised by the Minister on behalf of the Executive. But that right to exercise that grace and favour is not fettered in any way. There are no laws which say on what grounds a passport can be refused. There is no means whereby a person who is refused a passport can go to a court to test whether he should have it or not. If an application for a passport is refused by the Minister&#x2014;I concede, after consultation with the Special Branch or anybody else he wishes to consult&#x2014;then that applicant must sit down and in a docile manner accept the Minister&#x2019;s decision or run the perils which are now provided for here. The hon. member for Parow nods his head. I wonder whether everyone in South Africa is prepared to acquiesce in having no right to query the judgment of one person which determines their whole future in this country. I want to tell the hon. the Minister, who comes and makes this allegation by means of a tortuous and round-about argument that we do not value citizenship, that it is because we value citizenship that we do not wish to see this power concentrated in the hands of one person, the power to decide whether or not a <span class="col_2015-2016" refersTo="page_1030"/>person should retain his citizenship. That is the value of it. I want to ask the hon. the Minister this question, and I hope he will be frank with us. Has there ever been a case where he had to change his mind and grant a passport which he refused to grant in the first instance? Can he tell us that there has never been such an instance? Perhaps I can remind him of one&#x2014;the case of Dr. Van der Ross. He was in the first place refused a passport, but then, suddenly, that decision was changed. Where, then, is the infallibility we are expected to accept about the hon. the Minister or about any future Minister? If there had been provision for a procedure whereby an unfortunate applicant could have the decision against him reviewed, the position would be different. But that is certainly not the position at the moment. I have mentioned that there are cases where the Minister, exercising this prerogative on behalf of the Executive, found it necessary to change his mind. Now, why would he change his mind? Because he may have heard representations on behalf of the aggrieved person? But the aggrieved party has no right to be heard. The Minister can close the door and tell him that he is not prepared to hear him; that he is not prepared to hear him on the question of whether or not he should get a passport.</p>

<p>I submit that we are jeopardizing the value of citizenship by proceeding on the lines laid down in this Bill. The true position is exactly the reverse of what the hon. the Minister tried to accuse this side of the House. It is because we value citizenship that we are not prepared to agree that the power to grant or remove it should be in the hands of only one person.</p>

<p>The other matter I would like to raise is the question of exit permits. It would be interesting if the hon. the Minister could indicate to us how many of these unfortunate people there are. I say &#x201C;unfortunate&#x201D; because of the consequences to them of the fact that they have to take an exit permit. How many of these unfortunate persons are there who have no option, because of the conditions with which they are confronted by the Minister, but to accept an exit permit? I refer to conditions such as conditions in regard to deposits. But not only this. Also where there is a blank refusal to grant a passport, the man being told that he and his family can go, but on a permanent exit visa only. The Minister knows that is being done. The person, consequently, is left with no other option. Hon. members talk about looking for green pastures elsewhere. Personally I should prefer to see a person returning to South Africa disillusioned by what he has seen elsewhere, than have him confined and kept here grumbling and disillusioned because the Minister would not permit him to go and see the outside world in order to compare it with his own country.</p>

<p>The stupid interjection of the hon. member for Parow shows how futile the argument is which hon. members are trying to put up against our approach. We are not dealing here with a man who is convicted; we are not dealing with a man who can be dealt with under the Suppression of Communism Act or as a prohibited immigrant. For these people there is legislation in terms of which they can be dealt with. There is power in other legislation to punish such people. The hon. member for Parow can think of two names of people who should come back. There are many young South African students who have left this country on exit visas only who, I hope, will return to South Africa, because they can be very good citizens. Many of them who have gone overseas to take up bursaries are very good citizens and we may still live to see their value to this country if they are allowed to return. Why did these have to leave the country on exit visas? Because of the decision of one man, however much he may have consulted. These people have no right of appeal, neither to the Minister, nor to anybody else. They have no right to go to the Minister and tell him that they have a right to see him and that they demand to see him. If the Minister or his department does agree to see such a person, it is only because they are doing him a favour.</p>

<p>Sir, I can see no justification at all for the presence of this provision in the Bill and, consequently, I hope that the Minister may even at this stage be prepared to accept its deletion.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can hardly believe that the Opposition will be able, with a view to the coming election, to build up for itself the image of being a South African, bilingual and patriotic party by persevering in a debate such as this to act as the champions of those people who have abandoned their South African citizenship in this way. This is what the hon. member for Green Point, the hon. member for Wynberg, and obviously the hon. member for Houghton, have been trying to do all along in this debate. Young students, or anybody else, who leave South Africa on a one way permit, do so of their own accord. Not one of them is forced to do so. When this does happen, it usually happens in a blaze of publicity in which South Africa is besmirched. The Press of the Opposition Parties uses this in a way which puts South Africa in a bad light everywhere in the world. Now they are coming up for these people, they are acting as the champions of those people, and, what is more, they want those people to be able to return to South Africa without any further problems. Surely this cannot happen. I believe that if there are some of them who want to return to South Africa, their applications will be considered with the necessary care. The fact that so many South African citizens have been allowed to travel on foreign passports is indicative of the circumspection being exercised in dealing with these cases. There must have been good reasons <span class="col_2017-2018" refersTo="page_1031"/>for that otherwise it would not have been allowed. The fact that a mere 38 of such a large number of applications were refused, confirms this. We accept that those 38 applications were refused for very good reasons. The Opposition is interceding here for people who do not deserve the protection of South African citizenship. The people who have abandoned South Africa, have forfeited their passports. The argument here concerns people who want to return to South Africa under the Immigration Act of 1913. I want to support the hon. the Minister in his attitude in this connection, because the issue here is people who first have to prove themselves again through the attitude they adopt towards South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>It is not sob-stuff at all and the hon. member for Parow knows that perfectly well. The hon. the Minister, who happens to be an old friend of ours, because we were together in the Cape Provincial Council in the old days, has repeated a statement which he made last week when this debate was adjourned. According to him, people who left this country on exit permits, and have done so over the last few year, did not value their South African citizenship. Let us cut out all the ordinary generalizations over this issue and get down to a few facts. Very often, as the Minister knows, people who want to go elsewhere have no option except to go out on exit permits; otherwise their careers or study opportunities or their hope of greater training are affected. Frequently there is nothing wrong with their characters, with their political activities or anything else. However, the Government, for one reason or another, does not wish them to have these documents.</p>

<p>I have a whole bundle of cases in my file, and the Minister is welcome to see them any day he likes. I want to speak about a particular case which I have in my file here to-day. It concerns a family consisting of a father, a mother, and two children. In September, 1968, they applied for travel documents to Australia because this man has virtually reached the top of his profession here in Cape Town. He is not a professional man, he is not in the teaching profession or anything like that. He is employed by one of the most reputable travel and indent agents in Cape Town. He applied for travel documents in the ordinary way to go to Australia, not necessarily leaving South Africa for good, but in order to improve his position. He was offered a better job there with better pay, and he also wanted more experience. The fact of the matter is that this man might very well under normal circumstances have returned to South Africa after staying in Australia for four or five years, whilst obtaining a great deal of additional experience there. He could have come back and been an extremely useful administrative leader amongst the Coloured people in South Africa. He cannot get any higher in his present job, he cannot obtain an executive position here where he exercises authority over white persons in this country because of our way of life. He can get no further promotion in this firm. He was offered a job in Australia and in due course he applied for passports for his family. He received an evasive reply from the department, saying he must put down a deposit for him and his family of R900, or a banker&#x2019;s guarantee for that amount. At the present moment this man&#x2019;s salary is R250 per month, higher than the salaries of a great many white working folk in South Africa. He has not the slightest interest in political activities of any description, he has no character defects, as far as I can make out from his firm, which consists entirely of reputable Cape Town citizens. He owns his own house and the piece of land upon which the house is situated. The interesting part about this case is this. In April and May of 1968, the Minister&#x2019;s department quite happily permitted this man to travel on South African travel documents, a passport and everything, to Germany and Sweden on behalf of his firm here in Cape Town. They considered him to be a good advertisement for South Africa. He is a Coloured man. I want to know why he was considered suitable to travel on a South African passport to visit overseas countries for his firm in 1968, and yet he and his family are now summarily refused travel documents, when he accepts a post in Australia in order to gain greater experience in the field in which he works. This man has a letter of acceptance from the Australian Government, so there is no phoney business attached to that side of it either.</p>

<p>He informed the department that he was sorry that he was unable to put down R900 deposit, because, in order to pay the passages of himself, his wife, and their two children, and possibly keep a little money in reserve, he had to sell his house and the land. What he is doing is, of course, for him a big step. When I tried to pin the Minister down and asked whether a refusal to pay this type of deposit was in itself valid reason for refusing travel documents, he wrote the following to me in a letter dated the 14th January, 1969: &#x201C;The inability of an applicant to satisfy the department that he will be able to return to the Republic without official assistance, is considered as sufficient reason to refuse a passport.&#x201D; I have the letter here, the Minister knows it quite well, he was quite honest with me about it. But this raises another issue <span class="col_2019-2020" refersTo="page_1032"/>which was started by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>So many of these people want to come back to South Africa. As I said, this man has a decent salary, he earns R250 per month. He can pay for their passages, they are not being paid for by the Australian government. He is not an emigrant in that sense, he is an independent man who wants to improve his position. The Minister has refused him the documents without giving any reasons for the refusal, as he is entitled to do. They are leaving on exit permits and now they will be told they are bad South African citizens. I say there was no need for them ever to have been put into such a category. This man&#x2019;s financial position is very sound. His salary in this country is R250 per month. He would not take up the overseas post if he did not have an offer of better pay. He would be more than likely, with the money paid in this good post, to pay his own way back to South Africa. He could have come back on proper travel documents and made his contribution here like a student or a businessman or anybody else in this field. But he was refused the necessary documents. He was depressed and asked me to make representations to the Minister. I tried and finally I got a little letter with three lines, saying, &#x201C;Your representations have been rejected&#x201D;. The man concerned wrote to me on the 10th February this year telling me he had given up his efforts to obtain passports and they were now going away on exit permits. This means that if these people return to South Africa they will in effect be aliens in the land of their birth. I say this is punitive action which is not justified at all. The loss of this type of South African citizen, be he White or Coloured or whatever the case may be, is very grave indeed.</p>

<p>When the Minister replied to the debate last week he said it was clear there were persons who were previously South African citizens, or even Union citizens, who lost their South African citizenship because they gave it up of their own free will by taking out these exit permits. But many of them did not take out these permits of their own free will. I have many people coming to me with this sort of case, for one reason or another; perhaps they think a woman has got a softer heart than some of the hon. members opposite. They come to me, they are worried, and I have many of them with whom I have to deal.</p>

<p>The serious aspect of this whole situation is this. If they come back, in terms of this clause, they come back as aliens, and I wonder whether the Minister is really taking the right step in dealing with people of this category in this way. Let me say in conclusion that forcing people to leave the country, which the Minister is doing, I maintain, very often for purely ideological reasons of policy is bad enough. But there is something which is worse. I maintain the Government is making every effort as far as the Coloured community is concerned, including a subtle form of official intimidation, to force them to remain in the country, very largely for purely ideological reasons also flowing from policies explicable only to this Government. That is infinitely worse. To be logical if they are not considered suitable citizens, why should we make them remain here? [Time expired.]</p>

<p>It might be the truth, but let us analyse it. The fact of the matter is that the Minister has the right to refuse someone a passport without giving any reasons. We should not want to argue about that. That has always been the position and hon. members opposite have always been satisfied with it. Then the Department has the right to demand a deposit from certain people who wish to go overseas. That, too, is quite justified. People who go overseas might possibly be repatriated to this country at South Africa&#x2019;s expense. The Department must then be in a position to recover those expenses from the deposit paid. There is no injustice in a case like that. If, in spite of his inability to pay the required deposit, a person obtains permission to leave the country on a one-way permit, he does so with his eyes open. The whole point is that such a person is not forced to leave the country. He has a choice. If he does it with his eyes open, it means that he simply does not rate his citizenship highly enough. In that case he only has himself to blame if he loses that citizenship. Then the hon. member for Wynberg cannot come forward with a sob story to the effect that the Government is unjust, i.e. when a person has so little regard for his citizenship that he is prepared to risk it.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a moment ago the hon. the Minister spoke about the citizenship of persons who leave the country on an exit permit. The hon. member for Prinshof has now referred to the &#x201C;sob story&#x201D; of the hon. member for Wynberg. This makes me think that the Minister and other hon. members feel that every person who leaves the country on an exit permit is a criminal or a potential criminal; as if there are no circumstances in which a person has no alternative but to go overseas on an exit permit, because he is not allowed to travel on his passport in certain given circumstances.</p>

<p>I want to mention such cases. If a father wants to give his son, who wants to go to Australia or some other country, part of his inheritance, and the rate of exchange control authorities refuse to allow him to take that amount out of the country, then the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department will only let him go on condition that he travels on an exit permit. From that moment that person is stateless. It <span class="col_2021-2022" refersTo="page_1033"/>is terrible to be stateless. He can obviously not get citizenship immediately from the country to which he goes. No Western state grants citizenship before one has resided in that country for two years. In the meantime he might realize that he has made a mistake. It need not necessarily be that he is a bad citizen or, as the hon. member for Prinshof said, that he did not value his citizenship. It might be a lad of 23 or 24 years who thought that the facilities in other countries were better than they are here. A great many people who have already left the country on exit permits, would like to come back but cannot, because they cannot <i>ipso facto</i> be re-invested with their citizenship. He must follow the normal procedure and re-apply for citizenship, and in the meantime he remains stateless. A person who leaves the country without his passport, i.e. on an exit permit, is stateless until such time as he acquires citizenship of another country. But he is still not in a position to return to his fatherland. However much he values his passport and would like to retain it if he could, he cannot do so under those circumstances. I know of the son of a very good farming family who went to Australia. The Department said, &#x201C;Yes, but if the father wants to give him such a large amount of money, instead of only R4,000, he can only leave the country on an exit permit&#x201D;. He duly did so, and is now stateless. He is neither a citizen of Australia nor a South African citizen. He is an asset to South Africa, but he does not have citizenship. My argument is that if the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, it is its duty and its job to make provision in the Other Place to the effect that these people will not be declared stateless on the strength of the fact that they have left the country on an exit permit. They are not potential criminals or criminals. They may have left the country through ignorance or other circumstances and would like to come back to South Africa and have their citizenship restored.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I feel I must rise to reply to the hon. member for Prinshof. The stories, as told by the hon. member for Wynberg and others, are not sob stories; they are hard, actual facts. They indicate, display and show to us the total disregard of the hon. the Minister with regard to Coloured people and their interests. He discriminates against them in no uncertain terms. I say to him across the floor of this House that the only reason he is stipulating this large sum of money which these people are required to put up by way of guarantee, is to keep them in the country and prevent them from going out. The best people among the Coloured community are heartily sick of the situation and want to get away and shake the dust of the country off their feet. The Minister is creating in this country something similar to the Berlin wall. He is building barriers between these people and ourselves. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I asked the hon. the Minister some time ago, how many people are repatriated under the requirements of these guarantees. The answer was most unsatisfactory. Last year I had a case similar to that of the hon. member for Wynberg, where a young man of 19 wanted to go and study overseas. He was refused a passport. He went with an exit permit. I made it my business to investigate the matter. The concern that was sponsoring him in England is 100 per cent aboveboard, a legally registered and wealthy organization. The Minister had no ground whatsoever for refusing to grant that person a valid passport. He had to leave with an exit permit. What other choice do they have? Now the hon. the Minister says that these people will in future be treated as aliens and will have to go through the processes of being taken into the country once again as a citizen.</p>

<p>I say that the time has come when the public of this country should know that the arbitrary methods of the Department of the Interior, and this Minister in particular, are reprehensible in the highest possible degree.</p>

But, Sir, over the 11 years during which I have been a member of this House, I have at least gained a little experience of the matters which have been discussed to-day. The hon. member for Wynberg spoke of the person, for whom I have sympathy, who could not pay the deposit. The hon. member for Karoo also spoke about the same matter. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Karoo the following question: In the time during which he has been the Coloured representative for the Karoo constituency, for how many students has he signed security to go overseas, instead of their paying up themselves?

<p>Fine, Mr. Chairman, then I shall leave it at that.

In such a case the South African Government has to pay the expenses. They require either the money or security. In that way I have already assisted at least seven students who have gone overseas; not in cash, but in another way. That is what it amounts to. [Interjections.] What guarantee can any member of this House furnish <span class="col_2023-2024" refersTo="page_1034"/>to the effect that any person who applies for a passport to study in the United States, Britain or Germany, would not perhaps get into trouble on account of which he would have to be deported to South Africa?

I want to say this much for the hon. the Prime Minister, i.e. that what I saw in his office while he was still Minister of Justice, convinced me&#x2014;although I had very strong feelings about the matter&#x2014;that, if we make a fuss here because a passport was refused or because immediate permission for the issue of such a passport or travel documents was not granted, we are speaking as laymen and we do not know what information the Department has at its disposal. I saw it with my own eyes and, unfortunately, I cannot let it out here, for I gave my word of honour &#x2026;</p>

<p>I saw it with my own eyes, and my word of honour is just as good as that hon. member&#x2019;s. The hon. member for Wynberg mentioned a specific case here. I am sympathetic towards that case, because I myself came across such cases where I did not see my way clear to being of assistance. They did not have the money, nor did they intend to get hold of the money or security, in spite of the fact that they owned property. The case of Dr. Van der Ross&#x2019;s passport was also raised here. I may be wrong, but I only know of one case where Dr. Van der Ross was involved in a passport matter, and that was when he was refused an endorsement for Basutoland. He had a passport in his possession.</p>

On this occasion Dr. Van der Ross&#x2019;s endorsement was refused when he wanted to go to Basutoland to be interviewed for the purpose of being appointed to a position at the University of Roma. At that stage it was felt that this Coloured&#x2019;s ability in the field of education was worth more to South Africa than it would be to Basutoland.</p>

<p>Yes, and it was right to do so; the hon. member might do well to look at the office he holds to-day and what he is doing for Coloured education. I am not concerned with the education of the Basuto, because the Basuto Government can look after that. However, if I could have Dr. Van der Ross here in the position he holds to-day in respect of Coloured education, then I agree whole-heartedly that he should be kept here in South Africa.</p>

<p>I could illustrate cases to you which would make your hair stand on end, if you have any, if you hear what information the Department has at its disposal. Mr. Chairman, I just feel that we should not kick up too much of a fuss when the Department takes action in regard to such cases. Through its contacts and the combination of circumstances the Department has information which the layman in the street does not have, and until we have satisfied ourselves that the Department has done the necessary as a result of the information it has at its disposal, we should not kick up too much of a fuss here and level accusations and charges which we cannot prove.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before the hon. the Minister gets up to deal with what has been raised, I want to put two specific questions to him which I will be grateful if he would answer.</p>

<p><span class="col_2025-2026" refersTo="page_1035"/>The first question arises from the speech delivered by the hon. member for Outeniqua who appeared to speak with authority after discussion with members of the department he sees so frequently. I would like the hon. the Minister to indicate to us quite clearly, and I am sure he will be frank with us, if his policy in regard to the issue of passports to Coloured people is dictated by the desire to retain them here in South Africa, in other words, that conditions are made as difficult as possible, as has been suggested by the hon. member for Outeniqua.</p>

<p>The second point I want to raise with the hon. the Minister is that it appears that the difficulty that many of these people, and Coloured people particularly, get into is that not being in possession of funds they cannot get a passport and that they then take an exit permit and leave the country without having made a deposit. It has been suggested that these are people who should not be encouraged to come back at all and that they are bad citizens. I take it that before there is a request for a deposit from the department the hon. the Minister is satisfied that those people are good enough citizens to warrant them getting a passport so that if they bring the money they will get a passport. It is therefore merely the fact that they are unable, or that they refuse to make the deposit, that the steps they then take to continue with their journey deprive them of their South African citizenship. I would like the hon. the Minister to answer these two questions.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. This matter arises out of what was said by the hon. member for East London (City). The hon. the Minister must concede that this clause which is now before us, must and will hit good innocent South African citizens. If that is so, and I see it is inevitable that it must happen, is the hon. the Minister prepared even at this stage, even if he will not accept the elimination of this clause, to give us an undertaking in this House that he will consider ways and means whereby justifiable cases of former citizens who genuinely want to come back to this country can be accommodated within these provisions. The provision, as it is now, closes the door completely. A South African, who has lost his citizenship, and who comes back to South Africa is regarded as an alien for all purposes of re-entry into South Africa. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to deal with the aspects I have mentioned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton said, &#x201C;The Minister&#x2019;s explanation does not carry any weight with me&#x201D;. That does not astonish me, because in regard to these matters we hold completely different views. As regards the issue of passports, the hon. member will appreciate that from the nature of the case the refusal to issue a passport and the reasons connected with it are matters which should be kept secret. For that reason it is not possible for me to discuss reasons here.</p>

<p>It is not possible for me to discuss reasons, especially not in regard to these specific cases. The hon. member for Houghton now wants to ask me specific questions, but she knows that I cannot take her into my confidence; how can I furnish her with confidential information? But apart from that, the hon. member for Wynberg mentioned a case here which is perhaps a pitiable case, but merely in general I want to tell her that for the one case she mentioned in respect of which it might be desirable to decide differently, there are scores of cases in respect of which it is essential to decide differently. It is precisely in respect of those other cases that we want to take these precautionary measures.</p>

But hon. members will appreciate that I am also under certain obligations to my country and to Parliament. It is for the very reason that I am under those obligations that I sometimes have to do certain things which are not popular with everybody. Hon. members opposite never made any mention of the scores and scores of people who left South Africa on exit permits and who went and joined our greatest enemies abroad. Why do they not refer to those people?</p>

<p>I could mention numerous names of such people, and I am making this premise, i.e. that if there is a person who really values his country and his citizenship, and who knows what implications they have for him, he would think ten times, irrespective of the circumstances, before leaving this country on an exit permit, knowing that he would then be a forbidden immigrant and would lose his South African citizenship.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point asked a very fair question. He wanted to know whether I would perhaps inquire into the possibility of granting assistance to people who had left the country in all innocence and who had most probably behaved themselves very well in the countries to which they had gone, and whose actions over there had been satisfactory as far as South Africa was concerned, and whether it was perhaps desirable to allow them to return, in spite of the fact that they had lost their citizenship. I shall undertake this for the hon. member. I do not know what ways and means we can find for doing so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I doubt whether it can be done here, because it is a complicated matter. The fact of the matter is that the present position is such that we can only receive back those who are forced upon us by the countries to which they went. We are obliged to receive them, as I indicated a moment ago, in terms of The Hague Convention. But I do not think that I can say that the others are lost to South Africa, because in by far and away the majority of cases we are probably better off without them than we would be with them. I do not have the slightest doubt about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg wanted to know what our policy was in regard to foreign passports, and the hon. member for Houghton also wanted to know this. I have already said that we are warning South African citizens not to travel on foreign passports, because they may lose their citizenship. Then the hon. member went further and said that there were cases where we granted permission to people to use foreign passports. That is quite correct, but one cannot make that a rule. We want loyal citizens of South Africa in this country, and we do not want people who walk about with two or three foreign passports and travel on them.</p>

<p>I want to be a little more specific in this regard. The standing rule is&#x2014;and people know this because they are being warned&#x2014;that they should not travel on foreign passports. We are warning South African citizens that they are running the risk of having their South African citizenship withdrawn if they do so. It so happens that there are cases where people may want to travel to countries in which they would be completely unwelcome with a South African passport, and in such a case they approach us for our permission, and if circumstances justify it, we grant that permission. This is the simple answer to the question put by the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>In no country can one have rigid rules. If that were the case, I would probably not have been necessary there, nor the heads of my Department. In that case we could merely have appointed people to work out little calculations, and perhaps this could have been done by machines. But this is being done precisely because we must have a discretionary power in order to adapt to various circumstances.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it is necessary for me to go into very great detail in dealing further with this discussion. In regard to these deposits we require, or the guarantees, I just want to point out to hon. members, and particularly to the hon. member for Wynberg, that from 1st April, 1968 to 30th November, 1968, we had already spent an amount of R5,712 on repatriation, and in 1967 this amounted to R6,338. When we realize that a person wants to leave the country, whether on a passport or by whatever other means, and that he may be a potential repatriation case, then, surely, it is our duty to see to it that we do not burden the State with that expense and that we make provision for it. Surely, hon. members know that in by far and away the majority of cases we do not require that deposit. We most certainly did not require that from the hon. member for Yeoville when he went abroad last year.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to tell the hon. the Minister that we are extremely grateful for his assurance this afternoon that, if not in terms of this Bill which we understand it would be difficult for him at this stage to re-draft in order to deal with the situation, he at least undertakes not to penalize those people who are forced out on exit permits, particularly those who behave well overseas and want to come back, and who left on exit permits because they were not able to furnish money for their repatriation. If the Minister carries out his policy on those lines, I think we are very grateful to him for this assurance he has given.</p>

<p>I just want to make one or two more points. The Minister said that I was slightly confused about the demand for a deposit, but I would like to tell him that I do not think I am confused. It is quite correct, and in fairness to the Government it should be said, that I am talking particularly about Coloured people but it does apply to Whites as well. I have been in touch with the officials of the Minister&#x2019;s Department, and they will verify any statement. A deposit is asked for because it will cost the Government a great deal if they cannot come back and they have to be sent back to South Africa, and then the Government has to pay for their repatriation. In many cases people who have paid the deposit or, if they have not paid, have given a banker&#x2019;s guarantee, have been given South African passports on which to travel. I think it would be quite unfair not to state that fact. But what <span class="col_2029-2030" refersTo="page_1037"/>worries me a little is the question of students, and I am not here concerned with students who are interested in creating trouble. I am talking about <i>bona fide</i> students who want to go overseas to study. Many of these youngsters do not necessarily go to academic institutions for purposes of study. A lot of them are youngsters who do not go to the universities at all, but they are journalists or musicians and they go overseas to work and to study and to gain experience. The Minister knows perfectly well that the parents of many of these people were formerly citizens of the United Kingdom. I deal with the United Kingdom specifically because the Minister&#x2019;s figures given to me in the House the other day show that by far the larger number are in that category. The Minister also knows that none of our youngsters can go to work in the United Kingdom without permission from the Labour Office of the United Kingdom here, and they can go from here to one specific job and there they have to stay. Now I had a very interesting experience over this with the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, who gave me, in each case when my two sons went overseas, a special letter of dispensation allowing them to have a British passport which enabled them to work in the United Kingdom, because one was going as a journalist and the other as a musician. In both those two categories of work you have to move about; you cannot sit in one place or else you do not learn what you go over to learn. But may I tell the Minister that his predecessor, when I first made application for one of my sons, wrote me a letter saying that under no circumstances would he allow him to take out a British passport as well as a South African one. He happened to be born in the United Kingdom, Sir, because my husband was serving in the Forces over there and they had to be where their mother was when they were born. [Laughter.] The Minister&#x2019;s predecessor wrote me a letter in which he said he took the greatest exception to my application for my sons to travel on the passport of a foreign country; they ought to be proud of their South African citizenship, particularly with me doing the kind of work I am doing. I was so angry that I called the Minister out to come and have a chat with me one day, which he was kind enough to do, and when I explained the position he wrote me a letter the next day and put it right. But there must be lots of cases where people are not as privileged to know the law as well as we happen to know it here. I would therefore ask the Minister to let the public generally, particularly where these youngsters are concerned, know by whatever means he has at his disposal, what the position is. If they go and climb Kilimanjaro as a bunch of students in the university vacation for instance and the Kenyan Government will not accept a South African passport&#x2014;I have some friends who did it this recess&#x2014;when those children come back, will they have their citizenship removed and be made aliens in this country? It is ridiculous. I would ask the Minister as regards youngsters who go overseas to work, or to gain experience, and can only move around on the basis of a different passport, he will give them the same consideration even if they were not aware of the law before they left, as I was fortunate enough to be given.</p>

<p>Amendment put and negatived.</p>

<p>Clause, as printed, put and agreed to (Mrs. H. Suzman dissenting).</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I trust that the sweet reasonableness which eventually emanated from the hon. the Minister when we dealt with the previous clause, will again be evident when we deal with this one&#x2014;at least reasonableness to the extent that he was able to concede that there was some substance in what we had been trying to drive home to him. This clause provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the decision of the Minister in regard to the question whether the removal from the Republic of a person referred to in paragraph (a) of the proposed new subsection (3) of section 22 is or is not in the public interest shall not be subject to appeal to or review by any court of law. Sir, in the course of the Second Reading we indicated to the hon. the Minister our basic reasons for objecting to this particular amendment. The hon. the Minister indicated to us that there were reasons, which he felt to be valid reasons, why it was undesirable that the information which motivated the Minister in coming to his decision should be placed before a court. It might disclose the source of the information. Sir, I do not think that deals completely with our objection. What concerns us here is exactly what has concerned us in regard to other aspects of this Bill, and that is that there is a final decision in the hands of one person, namely the Minister, and when the Minister makes his decision on such information as is placed before him, there is no means whereby that decision can be tested. The Minister himself has indicated that he does not accept, as some of his predecessors have done, some air of infallibility about his decisions, and it is undoubtedly as sure as one is sitting in this House to-day that there will be occasions when decisions are taken which are based on facts which have not been correctly represented to the Minister or on complaints which have arisen through malice. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that it is absolutely essential to have a safety clause which gives some right of review of his decision.</p>

<p>I am sure that the Minister as a legal practitioner would welcome some form of review of his decision so as not to make it final and binding to the extent that it is now and to the extent that it affects the life and the livelihood of persons. It appears to us on this side of the House that it would be quite easy for the Minister to establish some machinery of review. We agree and we accept that there may <span class="col_2031-2032" refersTo="page_1038"/>well be cases where it is undesirable to disclose this information in a public court, but there is no reason why this review cannot be entrusted to a panel of Judges sitting <i>in camera</i> to decide on the particular issue. The position at the moment is simply that if false information is placed before the Department and comes before the Minister, there is no means whereby the person concerned, except as an act of charity or an act of indulgence on the part of the Minister, can become aware of the grounds on which the Minister based his decision, or can even have a discussion with the Minister and can contest the validity of the grounds on which he has based his decision. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that it is not too late to establish some form of tribunal&#x2014;this is not a new conception&#x2014;consisting of a Judge or two Judges who can sit <i>in camera</i> to deal with appeals of this nature. That would meet the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty and it would certainly satisfy our objection to the fact that the whole decision is left in the hands of one person without some form of review. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will give consideration to that type of amendment which could possibly be inserted in the Bill, not now, but when it is dealt with in the Other Place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to add a word or two to what has been said by the hon. member for Green Point on this particular clause. We find these powers draconian, to say the least of it. Surely there should be some kind of review for this type of case. I would agree that the Minister is quite entitled to keep the source of his information secret. That is something that we understand and accept. We would not ask him to divulge the source of his information, but the crisp point is that the reason the charge (if any), which causes doubt in the mind of the public if nothing is ever said, let alone in the mind of the person concerned, and which leads to the person&#x2019;s deportation, should at least be made apparent even if the matter is dealt with <i>in camera</i> as the hon. member for Green Point has suggested. There is quite a difference between the source of the Minister&#x2019;s information, which is one thing and could lead to consequences of which we are quite aware, and the reasons which he gives to the persons concerned for the need for them to be removed under a deportation order. Sir, let us admit that in this country as much as in any other, this sort of power invites people&#x2014;and we have unpleasant people in every country&#x2014;such as informers to pass on information which could be false. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s judgment and his sources of information are not infallible. The information could be only partly true or it could be information given in a spirit of vindictiveness, for one reason or another. After all, smear campaigns and character assassinations are by no means unknown in our own political life, as the verkramptes will tell you. The point I wish to make is that the hon. the Minister could so easily in these issues be misled or even falsely persuaded. I would suggest therefore that we make a clear distinction between the source of his information which remains confidential, and the reason which could and should be given to the person concerned who should have the right to be heard before some body which will give him a fair hearing.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will appreciate that in other cases of removal appeals may be lodged; it is only in this case, where it is in the public interest, that there is no right of appeal. This has become necessary now since the real intention of the legislature at the time has not been carried out in practice. I should like to quote a few excerpts from speeches made here by Dr. D&#x04E7;nges when he handled this legislation as Minister of the Interior, but before doing so, I should first like to make the statement here that the legislature never intended that there should be a right of appeal. In other words, this is not a case of our removing a right of appeal which was provided for by the legislature. The legislature&#x2019;s intention was that there should be no right of appeal, but since it was explicitly stated in the legislation that there was no right of appeal, the courts interpreted it as though there should be a right of appeal. I also want to make this further statement: The power under this clause is only used in isolated cases, but it is nevertheless used, and if I am forced to go to court in cases of this nature and to furnish reasons for having arrived at such a decision, then the proper implementation of this clause would be rendered quite impossible for me. All that we are in fact doing here&#x2014;and I think this settles the matter&#x2014;is to adhere to the intention of the legislature as laid down in 1956. I should like to quote now what was said by hon. members at the time. I am first of all quoting what was said by Dr. D&#x04E7;nges (Hansard, Volume 92, col. 5936/7)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cases may arise, and have in fact arisen, where an alien is lawfully admitted to the Union and then engages in activities or is guilty of conduct which is prejudicial to the State on moral grounds, grounds of security or other grounds.</block>

<p>I am only making excerpts here and there which I find illuminating&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Various Western countries, in various different forms; countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada; some not exactly in the same form as we are giving it, others in almost exactly the same terminology as we are using &#x2026; there may be cases of drug addicts, or alcoholics, or sexual perverts who have been able to remain outside the pale of the criminal law, who have not fallen foul of the law yet, who, on security grounds or on moral grounds, are undesirable inhabitants of South Africa.</block>

<p><span class="col_2033-2034" refersTo="page_1039"/>I am reading only these excerpts, without advancing any arguments in connection therewith, to make it clear to hon. members what the intention was at the time. Dr. D&#x04E7;nges went on to say the following (col. 6283)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to say at once that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) is quite correct in saying that, although this is a new principle in South African law, it is no new principle in the law of other democratic countries.</block>

<p>Further on, in the same column, he referred to the &#x201C;aliens order&#x201D; in the United Kingdom and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not necessary to repeat it annually. With regard to the &#x201C;aliens order&#x201D; of 1953, the hon. member for Rondebosch (Colonel Jordan) is correct in saying that the new provisions which correspond most closely to those we are proposing here were all introduced after the war, apparently because post-war circumstances revealed the necessity for such powers. I just want to quote this to the hon. member for Johannesburg (City), because he said the Home Secretary in England did not have these powers. I just want to quote section 20 of the 1952 Aliens Order:</block>

<block name="quote">A deportation order may be made in the case of an alien in the following circumstances: (a) If any court certifies to the Secretary of State that the alien has been convicted either by that court or by an inferior court to which the case of the alien has been referred for sentence or brought by way of appeal, for any of the offences specified in the fourth schedule to this order, and the court recommends that a deportation order be made in this case; or (b) if the Secretary of State deems it to be conducive to the public good to make a deportation order against the alien.</block>

<p>My purpose in quoting this is to show that these circumstances also exist in the United Kingdom.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I cannot say for certain that they have no specific right of appeal. I should also like to quote the words used during the Second Reading: In column 6360 Dr. D&#x04E7;nges said the following:</p>

<p>If you have to be specific and show what the real reason is, you have to disclose the sources of information, and if you do that, you make it impossible to use those sources again.</p>

<p>Dr. D&#x04E7;nges and this House gave consideration to these same factors at that time. Now I should like to quote what Col. Jordan said in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But to make my position and that of this side of the House quite clear, we recognize the claim and we are not prepared to move an amendment which might have the effect of destroying the efficacy of the powers which we concede are necessary. But I want to put this to the hon. the Minister: The amendment that I drafted may not meet the situation at all. The hon. the Minister has the whole machinery of his Department available to him and, of course, he not only has his own experience but he has the benefit of highly experienced officials at his disposal. Would the hon. the Minister be prepared between now and the time that this matter goes to the Other Place for consideration to direct his mind to the possibility of some such curb as I have suggested, while I accept that for the reasons he has advanced mine is not a practical solution to the problem.</block>

<p>I do not want to burden you unnecessarily, but this is very illuminating. Later on he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that without that assurance the hon. the Minister will probably go into the question as to whether anything is possible. If in the end he comes to the conclusion that nothing is possible, then as far as I am concerned, I am prepared to accept that nothing is possible and now, with the leave of the Committee, I should like to withdraw my amendment.</block>

<p>This is the spirit in which the discussion was held at the time. There is no doubt, and if you will take the trouble of reading the Hansard of the time in more detail, particularly if you look at the amendment moved at the time, and subsequently withdrawn, by Col. Jordan, then you will see that this House had no doubt that the Minister has the sole right to decide in these matters and that there should be no right of appeal.</p>

<p>What was his amendment?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have not brought it with me, but the hon. member would do well to look it up. The hon. member would come to the conclusion that this House accepted at the time that this is a decision to be taken by the Minister and that for the reasons given by the Minister at the time, which in fact prove tc be the same as those discussed by us, it is not possible to make a decision of this kind subject to appeal. The hon. member for Green Point told me that he just did not want such a decision to be taken by one person. The hon. member suggested that we consider the possibility of perhaps appointing only one judge <i>in camera</i> or a tribunal. There will then perhaps be two or three persons serving on a <span class="col_2035-2036" refersTo="page_1040"/>tribunal of this kind. The fact of the matter, however, is that in the light of the experience of cases of which I have already become aware in my short term in this Department, I must give the House the assurance that in most of the cases made use of in the public interest&#x2014;in probably by far the most of these cases&#x2014;it is not possible for me to furnish the reasons for my doing this. And if I cannot furnish reasons, then I will not be able to defend myself on appeal. As a result I am afraid that we will have to leave the clause as it is at present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I regret that the hon. the Minister does not see fit to agree to the suggestion from this side of the House. We felt that it was a way in which we could to some extent by legislation meet a difficulty which the Minister tells the House exists. The hon. the Minister has quoted at length from a debate which took place in this House on an amendment which we do not have before us and which was withdrawn. But if my memory serves me correctly, and I may be at fault, the matter which was then under discussion was the making of the first decision, namely that it was in the public interest that a certain deportation order should be issued&#x2014;who should make that decision. It was felt at the time that that decision should be made eventually&#x2014;as indicated by the hon. the Minister in the passages he read out to us&#x2014;by the Minister after he had consulted with his officials and others who could furnish him with information. But we are not discussing that issue now. That is net before us, namely the question that the Minister could make that decision as was decided at the time of the debate to which he has referred. It had nothing to do with the question of appeal. Not one word of what the hon. the Minister has read has dealt with anything of an appeal. It was a matter of what should happen antecedent to a decision being taken. It was not a question of what rights a person had after the decision had been taken to have that decision queried. The hon. the Minister knows that what has happened is that the courts have accepted jurisdiction to handle appeals. This matter is before us today because the courts have said that they cannot finalize an appeal unless they know the information upon which the hon. the Minister has come to his decision. And the clause which is now before us is to emasculate the right of appeal which a person has at the present time by restricting it only to virtually a review on the grounds of <i>mala fides</i> or irregularities. And even that is now out as far as this particular aspect is concerned, namely whether it is in the public interest. The hon. the Minister himself has indicated as he did in referring to the previous debate and which he obviously quoted with approval, that we are dealing with persons here who have not fallen foul of the law. We have no quarrel about the person who has been convicted. There is no question but that it is in the public interest to get rid of an alien who has been convicted of crimes in this country. But here we are dealing with a person who has not fallen foul of the law. We cannot accept that that person should be subjected to a decision of this nature without an appeal. For that reason we will oppose this clause.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has not seen fit to accept the recommendation and request of my hon. colleague. In his reply he alluded once again to the question as to when this is &#x201C;in the public interest&#x201D;. As my colleague has pointed out our objection is to the fact that only one person, in this case the hon. the Minister, would be the one who will decide whether or not it is &#x201C;in the public interest&#x201D;. I should like him to understand that in referring to the hon. the Minister, I do so in the light of the fact that he is the present incumbent of that post. But he is not always going to be the incumbent. He has not always been the incumbent. Any remarks that I might make do not refer to him personally but to the incumbent of a position. The hon. the Minister quoted from speeches in Hansard made by the late Dr. D&#x04E7;nges who referred to people who indulged in activities prejudicial to the State. Where these are subversive there is recourse to law and the courts, and as has been pointed out by my hon. colleague we have no objection to the repatriation of people once they have been convicted. But, a tendency has developed of late in this country of certain members of the governing party to equate their party, the Nationalist Party, with the State. And, the position can arise here where the person in control can decide that somebody who has been critical of the Nationalist Party or of the ruling party, should be removed. Now, he has no right of appeal. All that need happen is that the relative Minister need merely allege that it is not in the public interest to divulge the details. And this person has no right of appeal whatsoever. He has no right of review. We have also had the position recently of certain clergymen who have come into this country&#x2014;not South African citizens&#x2014;who have been removed. They have been removed for various reasons. It can arise here too, that the hon. the Minister, not this hon. Minister in person, but the Minister concerned, can decide that in the public interest it is better for these clergymen to be removed. This could perhaps have happened over such incidents as Limehill that we had last year.</p>

This is another one of the reasons why we have asked the Minister for this undertaking, which undertaking he has declined to give my colleague.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it seems to me as if hon. members opposite are losing sight of the fact that this subsection is applicable to persons who are not South African citizens. In other words, it is not a case of an injustice being done to somebody when he is refused recourse to the courts in this case, because, surely, every country has the right to open or close its doors to whomsoever it wishes. If we should, for example, tell a person at one of the places of entry into the country that we do not like the looks of him, it is our right to be able to say so and we are not doing him an injustice by doing so. If a person from a foreign country arrives here and he is sent back by us, we are not doing him an injustice. In what way has an injustice been done to him? This provision only applies in cases where people are refused entry in the public interest. In the first place, this clause affects somebody who is not a South African citizen and who enjoys no so-called rights here and who has no claim to South Africa and, in the second instance, it will relate to cases where the Minister actually has information which causes him to make such a decision in the public interest.</p>

<p>Can he prove it? That is the point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>What is at issue here is not whether he can prove it or not. In the first place, what is at issue here is that, according to the responsible opinion of the Minister, it is in the public interest to tell an alien that he is no longer welcome in South Africa and that he should go back to his country of origin. He is not done an injustice. All that happens here, is that the person is able to waste time in this way when he appeals or does something of this kind. There are people who abuse the process of law to enable them to stay for a longer period in a country in which they are not welcome. According to the experience I have had, this court procedure may be protracted for more than a year. While this is happening the person stays in the country contrary to the public interest, and while he is here he tries to whip up the Press in his favour, and so forth. He has neither any right to be here nor any claim to South Africa. We have to accept that the hon. the Minister is not going to refuse entry in an arbitrary manner. Surely, he will exercise his responsible discretion in a case such as this; surely, he will to the best of his ability test the facts laid before him against the truth before making such a decision. For that reason I cannot see how we shall do any aliens any injustice in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to the hon. member for Prinshof, I wish to say it was not necessary for him to point out to us that this refers only to aliens, because we are fully aware of the fact. We are also fully aware of the fact that the hon. the Minister in his Second Reading speech made the point quite clear that as far as he and this Government were concerned, aliens do not have a right of residence in this country. We accept all that. But this goes further. This refers to someone who has been given a right to remain in this country for a while, a person with a certificate of permanent residence.</p>

<p>What is the position of an alien who comes into this country with the intention of taking out South African citizenship and who is still in the process of living here for five years to qualify for South African citizenship? What happens when, for no rhyme or reason, he is advised by the Minister he is no longer welcome?</p>

To be extreme, as I said before, there is this tendency to equate the Nationalist Party with the country. To be extreme, if it comes to the notice of the Minister that the person concerned will vote against the Nationalist Party when he gets citizenship, the Minister can turn around and say, &#x201C;Oh, we have cancelled your certificate; you must leave&#x201D;.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following amendment standing in my name as printed on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 30, to omit &#x201C;may&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;shall forthwith&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I wish it to be made obligatory that certain steps should be taken when once a person entering the Republic without authority has been arrested. There should, I submit, be an investigation of his position. At the moment subsection (2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever a police officer or any person or member of a class of persons authorized thereto in writing by the Minister suspects on reasonable grounds that a person is not a South African citizen, he may require such person to produce to him proof that he is entitled to be in the Union, and if such a person fails to satisfy such officer, person or member that he is so entitled, such officer, person or member may take him into custody without a warrant and &#x2026; may &#x2026; bring him before a passport control officer for examination in terms of section 19 (1) (d).</block>

<p>I raised this point during the Second Reading debate on this Bill and the Minister then said he would go into the matter. It seems to me that with the permissive &#x201C;may&#x201D; in this subsection the arrested individual is left in the air, because there is no responsibility whatever on the person detaining him to take any action. I believe it to be desirable that the person detained &#x201C;shall &#x2026;&#x201D; be brought &#x201C;before a passport control officer for examination &#x2026;&#x201D;. I understand that the reason why the decision or examination cannot be done by the person who effects the arrest is because the arrest may occur in some remote corner of the Republic and the person effecting the arrest may not be a passport control officer as defined in the Act. One does not want to stipulate a period in which it must be done, because there may be difficulties in getting the detained person to a passport control officer within say 12 or 24 hours, but I do believe it should be obligatory for the detained person to be brought before the officer for the examination referred to, so that his status can be determined.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, both the hon. member for Green Point and I are lawyers and I think we may come to a settlement in respect of this little matter&#x2014;we probably need not fight it out in court. I want to express my appreciation to the hon. member for having brought this little point to my attention, because upon maturer consideration it seems to me as if it would be better if a certain measure of obligation was placed on the person doing the arrest to bring the arrested person before a passport control officer. As I said during the Second Reading debate, however, there are certain practical problems involved. I just want to mention a few of them briefly. The arrested person may be ill. It may be a woman who is expecting a child. The passport control officer before whom the arrested person has to be brought may not be at hand, it may not be possible for him to bring the person before a passport control officer immediately, as is requested by the hon. member for Green Point in his amendment. There is also the possibility of long distances being involved. Such a person may be arrested at a place which is situated at some distance from a passport control officer. We realized these practical problems and that is why the clause has been worded in this way. We realize full well that the arrest is made for the purpose of bringing such a person before a passport control officer. The only difficulty is the practical problems involved. As I said, under the circumstances I should like to suggest something on the basis of which we may come to a settlement on the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I therefore move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>I would like the hon. the Minister to give me some enlightenment on paragraph (b), if I may use that misused term, Sir. It may be that I misunderstand this paragraph, because I have not followed the discussions on this Bill previously, but it seems to me that the very wide powers, which have been conferred on the hon. the Minister by the Act itself, are now going to be transferred &#x201C;to any passport control officer or to any class of passport control officers such powers or duties as to the carrying out of this Act, other than powers&#x201D; that require the consent of a board. The Minister has very wide powers, indeed, under the original Act. Of course, this amending Bill is giving him even further powers, such as the ones that we discussed earlier this afternoon. It does seem to me that one perhaps may have some confidence that the hon. the Minister is going to exercise very responsible control over his powers and that he is going to give every matter that comes before him due consideration. But I have my doubts even as to this, as I have expressed to him. I am not doubting that he will give it his consideration, but that the conclusions he will reach will be necessarily ones which reasonable people would approve of. Are we not going very far in handing over these responsibilities to any passport control officer? Perhaps the hon. the Minister would set my mind at rest with regard to this question.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members will remember that the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act, 1963 (Act No. 91 of 1963), was amended during 1967, firstly, to afford a member absolute protection in respect of anything he may say in Parliament or any committee, whether as a member or as a witness, and to provide that no proceedings can be instituted against him outside Parliament; and, secondly, to leave it to the discretion of the presiding officer to issue a certificate to any witness before Parliament or a committee to protect him against prosecution or civil proceedings.</p>

<p>In order to refresh the memories of hon. members, I may just mention once more for the information of the House that the first amendment removed the uncertainty which existed as to whether a member appearing before Parliament or a committee as a witness was protected or not, and rectified the position. As far as the second amendment is concerned, it may be mentioned that the discretion was previously vested in the Committee, and that, in terms of the amendment, it was transferred to the presiding officer. Amendment Act No. 62 of 1967 was passed the year before last. In the 1967 report of the Secretary to the House of Assembly he also referred to it. On page 9 he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of the amendments contained in the above-mentioned legislation, the position to-day briefly is that a member of the Senate or the House of Assembly enjoys full and absolute protection in respect of anything he may say in or before Parliament or a Committee, whether as a member or witness, and no action can be taken against him outside Parliament. If a witness in the opinion of the presiding officer answers fully and faithfully all the questions put to him and his replies are relevant to such questions he will be entitled on application to a certificate which will protect him against any civil or criminal proceedings for anything said by him in his evidence or for any act or thing done by him before that time and revealed by his evidence.</block>

<p>The Provincial Councils of the four provinces of the Republic are all agreed that similar protection is necessary and justified for Members of Provincial Councils, and they accordingly recommend to the Government that the necessary amending legislation in this connection be introduced in the House of Assembly.</p>

<p>The object of the Bill under discussion is, therefore, to provide freedom of speech to Provincial Councillors who appear as witnesses before a provincial council or a committee thereof, and the Bill contains an amendment to section 6 of the Powers and Privileges of Provincial Councils Act, 1948 (Act No. 16 of 1948), and of section 75 in that portion of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961 (Act No. 32 of 1961), which deals with the functions of provincial councils.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while the required amendments to the law were being prepared, the Chief Law Adviser pointed out that, while the general provisions relating to freedom of speech in Parliament appear in section 2 of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act (Act No. 91 of 1963), the relevant provision in respect of provincial councils is contained in section 75 of the Constitution. No one can explain why this is so, but in order to rectify the position the provisions of section 75, as now amended, are also being transferred in the Bill that we are dealing with at present, to the Powers and Privileges of Provincial Councils Act (Act No. 16 of 1948). In this connection hon. members are referred to clause 1 of the Bill, which they have all probably read already, wondering why it was there. The gap caused in the Constitution by the above-mentioned transfer of the provisions of section 75, is now being filled in a suitable manner by the insertion of a new section 75, which is contained in clause 4 of the Bill now before this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there ought to be no opposition or objections to this Bill, and I therefore move that it be now read a second time.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s anticipation that there will be no objection to this Bill is a correct one. This side of the House supports it and we note that it has come to this House after consultation with the Provincial Councils and at their request.

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill is a very important measure, and it is with great pleasure that I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is very important in this sense that it is an event of great movement in the history of the University College of Fort Hare; it is also important because it marks a further milestone along the road of development of the Xhosa nation; it is important because it testifies to the fact that Fort Hare has been developed with great success under the auspices of the Department of Bantu Education and the University of South Africa; it is also important because it proves that Fort Hare and its staff have succeeded in maintaining satisfactory academic standards, and lastly it is important because it is clear testimony to the fact that the Government&#x2019;s intention with its policy has always been an honest one and that it is faithfully implementing its postulated objectives. This Bill is also important in another respect, i.e. in that it has given the lie to the prophets of 1959 and has so irrefutably proved them wrong.</p>

<p>For Hare is the oldest university for non-Whites in the Republic, and has during the more than 20 years of its existence received the enjoyed wide recognition. It is also fitting therefore that since we are dealing in this Session with legislation which is aimed at granting the non-White university colleges greater academic independence, Fort Hare should be the first, as is being done here today. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to burden this House with the entire history of Fort Hare since its establishment. The history is general knowledge and those who are not acquainted with it can look it up in Fort Hare&#x2019;s yearbook. However, I must go back a bit, as far as 1959 in fact, so that the measure we have before us can be seen in better perspective.</p>

<p>With the passing of the University College of Fort Hare Transfer Act 1959, Fort Hare was brought into line with the Government&#x2019;s policy as laid down in the Extension of Universities Training Act, 1959, i.e. to supply the Bantu and other non-Whites with all adequate and more efficient university training by means of the establishment of separate university colleges for the various races and population groups. As you know, Fort Hare was then designated as being the university college which would, for the most part, serve members of the Xhosa ethnic unit. One of the most important principles which was laid down at that time in the University College of Fort Hare Transfer Act, was contained in Sections 21 (1) and 22 of that Act. Section 21 (1) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Until Parliament otherwise provides by law, the examinations of the University College for degrees, diplomas and certificates shall be the examinations of the University of South Africa.</block>

<p>Section 22 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The degrees, diplomas and certificates for which students at the University College may be prepared shall, until Parliament otherwise provides by law, be those of the University of South Africa.</block>

<p>There were of course many other principles which were also laid down, and important principles at that, but I am mentioning this question of examination and the conferring of degrees and diplomas by the University of South Africa because it is the pivot around which everything in this Bill principally revolves. It was, in other words, the fundamental motive which led to the Government&#x2019;s decision that greater academic independence would have to be granted to Fort Hare and the other university colleges, and that is why I want to dwell for a moment on this topic. I shall return later to the expression &#x201C;greater academic independence&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In 1959 the Government, with the take-over of Fort Hare and the establishment of other university colleges, envisaged that these institutions would have to grow under the academic sponsorship of the University of South Africa, and would have to be developed gradually towards academic maturity. At the same time this arrangement supplied the necessary guarantee for academic standards. This period of academic dependence on the University of South Africa was of great value, and I am glad to be able to say that Fort Hare has up to now experienced only the best cooperation from the University of South Africa. From the nature of circumstances certain problems cropped up from time to time, problems which arose as a result of these ties with the University of South Africa. However, both sides had great regard for the other, and this was principally attributable to the fact that it was possible to solve most of the problems, even though the solution was not always a permanent one.</p>

<p>Because Fort Hare&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) could draw for nine years with beneficial results on the rich academic experience and traditions of the University of South Africa,</li>

<li>(2) was fully supported by the State as to its finances,</li>

<li>(3) enjoyed unprecedented support from the general Bantu public and the interest of students,</li>

<li>(4) built up a sound nucleus of experienced lecturers, who are well-acquainted with the academic management of a university, and</li>

<li><span class="col_2045-2046" refersTo="page_1045"/>(5) began to feel a need for degree and post-graduate training which is not offered by the University of South Africa,</li>

</ol>

<p>it gradually became increasingly evident that this statutory dependence on the academic organization of the University of South Africa would have to be terminated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Since 1960 Fort Hare has been developed into an institution for higher education of which any nation can feel justly proud, and I can assure you that the Xhosa nation are very proud of their university. It would be a good idea therefore to see how Fort Hare is faring to-day and how matters stand with the staff, and then draw comparisons here and there with the state of affairs in 1960 when the takeover took place.</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Buildings, equipment and library: Since 1960 new buildings, (excluding residences) to the value of R1,065,200 have been erected at For Hare. This includes various academic buildings, hostels, laboratories and a library with a surface area of 30,000 square feet, which was provided at a cost of R220,000. This library is exceptionally well-equipped and has almost 70,000 books at its disposal. It was planned to comply with the most modern requirements of a university library. For the immediate future a building for the agricultural faculty, various lecture halls and the construction of a dining-hall for 1,000 students are envisaged at an estimated cost of R248,000.</li>

<li>(b) Faculties and departments: When the take-over took place in 1960 For Hare had two faculties and 18 departments. In 1968 there were already seven faculties with 40 departments.</li>

<li>(c) Students: The following figures are also interesting and indicate the increase since 1960 in the number of students. Initially there was a decrease in numbers because Coloureds, Indians and students from other Bantu nations were channelized to their own institutions: 1960, 360; 1963, 239; 1966, 402; and 1968 451.</li>

<li>(d) Degrees conferred: From 1960 to 1967 the following degrees and diplomas were conferred: diplomas, 136; post-graduate diplomas 81; degrees 278; honours degrees, 45; masters degrees, 3.</li>

<li>(e) Number of staff: In 1960, lecturing 38, other 21; in 1968, lecturing 84, other 49. The respective totals 59 and 133. This also gives an idea of the expansion.</li>

</ol>

<p>During the past few years the University of South Africa has granted lecturers of Fort Hare a greater measure of freedom in the interpretation of syllabi, and this concession was exercised with the responsibility by the college lecturers. The heads of departments and some senior lecturers have been serving for a number of years on the study committees, and deacons on faculty councils, of the University of South Africa (Unisa) and have gained a wealth of experience in the drawing up and interpretation of syllabi. Most lecturers at Fort Hare have also been acting for several years as first examiners, while lecturers from Unisa act as co-examiners. In this way the closest co-operation between Fort Hare and Unisa has been established, and Fort Hare was able to have the privilege of sharing in the extensive and rich experience of Unisa.</p>

<p>Some of the larger independent universities are already appointing lecturers of Fort Hare as co-examiners, up to the level of doctors&#x2019; degrees. White lecturers from Fort Hare have also been appointed to autonomous universities in the same or in a higher capacity than the one they filled at Fort Hare. The minimum requirements set for appointment are very high and the selection of candidates very strict. Consequently the staff in general possesses the necessary ability, sense of responsibility and dedication. Of course, Fort Hare also has the power, with the approval of the Minister, to determine syllabi itself and to hold examinations, as well as to introduce and allocate diplomas and certificates, i.e. degrees excluded, in any prescribed subject or course not offered by Unisa. This power has been exercised by Fort Hare for quite some time, and the academic standards which are being maintained in such courses, compare favourably with courses offered under the patronage of Unisa.</p>

<p>It is clear therefore that the staff of Fort Hare are very well equipped to control and manage the institution as an academically independent university, and to help it develop.</p>

<ol>

<li>(f) The research aspect is also interesting. During the past few years a number of research projects have been carried to a successful conclusion. In their own departments and individually, lecturers are continually engaged on research with a view to expanding the knowledge of the various disciplines. The National Bureau for Educational and Social Research, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and the Transkeian Government have already approached Fort Hare to undertake research in various fields.</li>

<li>(g) Post-graduate work is regarded by Fort Hare as being of great importance and everything possible is being done to encourage and to promote it. The number of students presenting themselves for post-graduate study is gradually increasing and praiseworthy results have already been achieved in this section of the work.</li>

<li><span class="col_2047-2048" refersTo="page_1046"/>(h) I also want to say a few things in respect of the needs for training which is not being offered by the University of South Africa. A need is already beginning to arise for the degree and postgraduate training which is not offered by Unisa, for example agriculture, which is perhaps the most striking example. Arrangements in this respect were made, by means of which a faculty of another university, i.e. the University of the Oange Free State, acts as a faculty of Unisa for academic purposes. Although the need for training in faculties which have not yet been established is still small, there are already indications that can increase in the near future, for example, in regard to engineering. With the subsequent establishment of such faculties, however, further utilization of existing faculties at autonomous universities on this agency basis can become too complicated and unpractical.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have just indicated to you that (a) For Hare has extensive and well-equipped buildings and facilities, (b) the academic services which the institutions can render is of great value, (c) the number of students, including post-graduate students is increasing year by year, (d) Fort Hare has capable and dedicated staff with rich academic experience, (e) Fort Hare has already made its mark in the field of research, and is equipped for greater achievements, and (f) that Fort Hare is on the verge of expansion in important fields of study which cannot be offered by Unisa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these criteria and motives did in fact apply when the Government decided that the time was ripe that Fort Hare should and could be separated academically from the University of South Africa, and that it should enter the next phase of its development towards ultimate autonomy with university status and greater academic responsibility.</p>

<p>With the granting of greater academic independence to Fort Hare, it thus acquires the right to make provision for its own syllabuses, the training of students, the holding of examinations, the introduction of courses for degrees, diplomas and certificates, and for the conferring of its own degrees, diplomas and certificates.</p>

<p>Academic separation from Unisa also entails (a) that the academic powers and capabilities which the Unisa Council has had and exercised up to now in respect of Fort Hare lapse, (b) that the council and the senate of the University of Fort Hare should be invested with more or less the same academic powers with which the council and senate of Unisa was formerly invested, (c) that the Council of Fort Hare, in comparison with the old college council, should have a greater share in the control and management of the internal affairs of the university which is traditionally associated with academic independence, (d) that provision would have to be made for the appointment of chancellor and a vice-chancellor in order to bring the constitution of the university into line with that of university institutions which are responsible for their own academic affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have dwelt for some time on this question of &#x201C;the academic ties with the University of South Africa&#x201D;, and &#x201C;the granting of greater academic independence&#x201D; to Fort Hare, but I have done so because, as I have already said before, it is the pivot around which this Bill revolves. I have also done so because this matter is in fact the only basically important principle in this Bill which, as far as Fort Hare is concerned, is in fact new as compared with the existing legislation.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that the acquisition of greater academic independence by Fort Hare and the accompanying increased powers and competence of the council and the senate, is the only real new principle with which we are dealing. All the other principles which are embodied in the Bill have already been applicable in respect of Fort Hare since 1960, and occur in the existing Fort Hare Act.</p>

<p>Since Fort Hare is now on the verge of becoming academically independent of the University of South Africa, I want to avail myself of this opportunity of thanking the University of South Africa on behalf of the Government, the University College of Fort Hare and the Department of Bantu Education for the great service and assistance it has rendered Fort Hare and its students, and I hope their co-operation, where necessary, will continue to be available.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I come to a few other important principles, I want to emphasize that the granting of greater academic independence is in fact not taking place completely unconditionally. The Government has laid down as a requirement that there should be a guarantee for the maintenance of academic standards. Consequently provision has been made in the Bill for the appointment of persons who have to be professors in corresponding faculties at other university institutions as members of the senate. These persons will also serve on faculty councils, but will only be able to participate in those proceedings of the senate which relate to the syllabi, the contents of syllabi, examination standards and the appointment of external examiners and moderators. (Clause 10 (2) (a) and (b).)</p>

<p>If the hon. member did not see it in the Bill, then he perhaps read it at a late hour when he was not concentrating properly, which is what also happens to me under such circumstances, and then I have to read the Bill again the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in addition provision is also being made in the Bill to the effect that Fort Hare can make use of external examiners or moderators, as provided in clause 30. These arrangements ought to eliminate all doubt in regard to academic standards. However, it is foreseen that Fort Hare will subsequently be able to reach a stage of academic development and maturity, as has in fact been the case with the independent universities, which will then make this arrangement unnecessary. That is why provision is being made in the relevant clauses, namely clauses 10 (2) (a) and 30, to the effect that the Minister can subsequently terminate this practice when and to such an extent as he may deem necessary. With the staffing of the Senate use of necessity will have to be made of professors of the independent universities. The Committee of University Principals was consequently approached in this connection and the Committee indicated that it had no objection in principle to such an arrangement. However, the various councils of the universities concerned will still have to be approached individually on this matter when the time comes when some of their lecturers are needed.</p>

<p>As far as the financing of Fort Hare in its new form is concerned, I want to say at once that for the present no change is being envisaged. The Bantu, with their growing but still limited economic potential, are still by no means capable of making any appreciable contribution to the financing of their own universities. The State, as the guardian of the Bantu, will therefore have to continue to bear this financial responsibility for an unspecified time. Because that is the case, it is necessary that the State should still retain a measure of control over certain university matters. The appointment of members of the council (except two members selected by the senate itself) the advisory council and the rector will, as in the past, still be vested in the Minister (as representative of the State), while the determination of, the conditions of service of staff, the appointment and dismissal of staff, and the admission of students of other non-White nations, will be vested in the council of the university of Fort Hare, but will be subject to the Minister&#x2019;s approval. However, the Minister is being invested with discretionary power, as far as the appointment and dismissal of staff is concerned, so that he can subsequently leave the appointment, dismissal, etc., of staff entirely in the hands of the council, if he thinks fit.</p>

<p>In addition the Minister also retains direct control over matters which hold financial implications for the State. Examples of these are&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) allowances payable to members of the council, the advisory council and committees;</li>

<li>(b) financial assistance to students;</li>

<li>(c) fees payable by students;</li>

<li>(d) introduction of new faculties and departments;</li>

<li>(e) establishment of institutes;</li>

<li>(f) purchase of and control over stores and equipment; and</li>

<li>(g) the determination of the establishment.</li>

</ol>

<p>Financing will, as in the past, be undertaken from the Bantu Education Account. The Government has been, for a number of years already, providing an additional amount for this purpose out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

<p>In this Bill the &#x201C;double posts system&#x201D;, namely council and Government posts, which has up to now been in use at Fort Hare, is being abolished. Since the take-over of Fort Hare this institution has been satisfactorily established also as far as the staff are concerned. No difficulty is being experienced in obtaining competent and highly qualified staff.</p>

<p>In the interim the university college was also, as with all other institutions of this nature (including the independent universities) declared to be an associated institution for pension purposes. The result of this is that all new staff members who are appointed are required to become a member of this scheme. Under these circumstances the further retention of Government posts is regarded as obsolete, and all staff members become employees of the university.</p>

<p>The advisory council and the advisory senate are being retained in the new dispensation.</p>

<p>All kinds of alleged authorities were quoted in 1959 to prove that the Government was on the wrong track in this respect. Fortunately, the Government had no doubts in regard to this matter, and the necessary Statutory machinery was established which made the establishment of these separate bodies for White and Bantu possible. The Government made its point in <span class="col_2051-2052" refersTo="page_1048"/>regard to such bodies very clear; that is why I am not going into this at any great length again to-day, except to say that the same standpoint of that time is still being maintained and has in the meantime been proved to be correct and sensible.</p>

<p>These advisory bodies serve as good training schools for the Bantu in order to train them and to give them an insight into the complex control and management of a university institution, and ensure Bantu participation in the control and management of their own university institution.</p>

<p>The experience gained during the past nine years at the three institutions of my Department has taught us that the university college, taking into consideration the present level of development of the Bantu, cannot proceed normally without the advisory council. I shall return in a moment to the advisory senate.</p>

<p>Exceptionally good progress has been made with the training of the advisory council and this body has already proved beyond all doubt its value to the council and the university college, particularly in difficult times.</p>

<p>In practice the advisory council is already dealing with the various matters, <i>inter alia,</i> study loans and bursaries, disciplinary matters in regard to students, the interests of the Bantu staff, etc., and are also making miscellaneous recommendations to the council. The relations and co-operation between the council and the advisory council are good, and in its representations to the council the advisory council is definitely candid. I should also like to point out that quite a good few provisions which have over the years and up to the present been included in regulations which were promulgated, are now being included in this Bill as statutory provisions.</p>

<p>Something which is also of great importance is the fact that the advisory council (a) can speak on behalf of the Xhosa nation; (b) can state more or less what the parents are thinking and can negotiate on behalf of parents; (c) has already shown that it is in favour of stricter discipline than the council itself in respect of the misbehaviour of students, and (d) conveyed a message to the Bantu outside who would like to know what is taking place at the University College.</p>

<p>However, experience has shown that the Bantu cannot take over the control and management of such a complex institution as a university in a responsible way unless they have been fully trained in the essential approach and the problems, and this training will still continue for a considerable time.</p>

<p>As far as the constitution of the advisory senate is concerned, we have not up to now perhaps been equally successful. The reason for that is that a sufficient number of Bantu lecturers with the required qualifications do not become available for appointment to senior lecturing posts. The shortage of adequate senior Bantu lecturers has, in other words, up to now prevented the satisfactory constitution of the advisory senate. However, as the position improves, this matter will in due course be rectified as well. That is also the reason why the advisory senate is not taken to be the <i>sine qua non</i> for the constitution of the university, but is included in a permissive sense in the Bill. If it could in fact be taken to be the <i>sine qua non,</i> it could happen that the university does not, owing to shortage of senior Bantu lecturers, comply with such statutory constitutional requirement, and cannot as a result of that function legally.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with this I have dealt with the most important, and particularly the new principles, in this Bill and I wish to express the hope that we will receive the support of all the members of this House for this measure which is aimed at affording Fort Hare greater academic independence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I find it is a great honour and a privilege to be able to take part in this debate. The hon. the Minister in his introductory remarks, I am glad to say, briefly sketched the history of Fort Hare and the history of the take-over of Fort Hare by the Government. I was associated with the take-over of Fort Hare. I was a member of the Select Committee appointed by this House. I was also a member of the Select Committee appointed on separate universities, to which the hon. the Minister has referred. That Select Committee later became a commission. This commission sat for quite a long time and eventually a report was drafted. We drafted a minority report. Of the members of that commission and the members of the Fort Hare Select Committee I am the only survivor on this side of the House. There is one survivor on the other side of the House, the hon. the Minister of Health. We are the only two survivors of both the commission and the select committee. Sir, I can speak with some authority on Fort Hare. I want to say that when we drafted our minority report&#x2014;not on Fort Hare but on the principle of separate university colleges&#x2014;we drafted our report on the evidence submitted to us by leading Afrikaans-speaking intellectuals and university men of South Africa, and in the report we quote men from the University of Stellenbosch, the University of Pretoria and the University of Potchefstroom. We also had similar evidence from representatives of the English-language universities, but we did not quote them. We were hoping to convince the Government of the day that here we had a good case. But, of course, the Department of Bantu Affairs was adamant; they insisted on a report of their own. Here are the nine points of our report; we drafted the report on that basis and I was one of the two members who did the drafting. Sir, I want to make this clear at the beginning so that our position to-day will be consistent and so that hon. members will know that we have not changed our ground: We said that we rejected the idea of a council and an advisory council for a university institution, whether it <span class="col_2053-2054" refersTo="page_1049"/>was a college or a university. We rejected completely the suggestion of a senate and an advisory senate. We said that the council should be a body corporate, with power to sue and to be sued and so on. We said that the council should have representatives other than those nominated by the Minister. We rejected exclusive ethnic divisions. We said we should not have a college of this kind, a tribal college as they are called, for one ethnic group. We said that if a Bantu college wishes to admit students who are not, in this case, Xhosa, that is if they wish to admit Zulus, they should be allowed to do so. That was our view. We completely rejected the drawing of finance from the Bantu Education Account. We said that it should come from the General Revenue Account. We also said that there should be an association of these individual colleges with our existing universities. This was our plan. Fort Hare would be intimately associated with Rhodes, a university with which it had been associated for many years. We said that the University College of the North should be associated with two universities, namely Pretoria and the University of the Witwatersrand. We said that the College of Zululand should be associated with the University of Natal. We also said that the Government should postpone the closing of the open universities for 10 years. Hon. members who think more radically than I do might want to know why we did not object to it altogether? It is because our Select Committee was appointed after the Second Reading and after the principle had been accepted. Therefore, we had to accept the principle of separate institutions. But we said that the open universities should be kept open for 10 years&#x2014;and how right we were! The Coloured students are still there. Why are they still there? It is because the hon. the Minister sends them there. These colleges have no facilities for training doctors, engineers, architects or members of other professions that are necessary to carry out the Government&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>We also said that the Minister for these Colleges should be the Minister of Education, Arts and Science, as it was then, that there should be one Minister of Higher Education. Now we have a Minister of National Education. We think that higher education should come under that Minister.</p>

<p>What did the hon. the Minister say in introducing his Bill? He speaks of the history of Fort Hare. In 1959 Fort Hare was a university college of 43 years&#x2019; standing and had a brilliant career built up. It had the co-operation of three churches and also the co-operation of the Xhosa people themselves. Great names like Jabavu were associated with it. That great South African citizen, Professor Matthews&#x2014;what a great man he was!&#x2014;was the acting principal of Fort Hare at that time. The name of Dr. Kerr was also associated with Fort Hare. These men had built up a great institution. What did we do? To-day the hon. the Minister speaks of how Fort Hare was taken over, but I described it at that time as the rape and the destruction of Fort Hare. They destroyed all that had been done in 43 years in order to build an ethnic college and to confine it to one section of the community. At that time there were 500 students at Fort Hare. Now the hon. the Minister is boasting of the enrolment at Fort Hare.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member should come back to the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I may say so, I am following the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s example. The hon. the Minister has been outlining the history. I have the notes here, and I am following on that.</p>

<p>Let us look at the position in Fort Hare. Year after year I have asked certain questions to find out what progress is being made. The reason why I have done it is because the reports of the Bantu Education Department is given rather late, not because of a fault of the department, but because it is such a big department. I presume it is difficult for them to assemble the information, but when we ask questions we get the information. Therefore, I should like to pay tribute to that department. I have said that when the department took over 10 years ago, the enrolment was 500. At the end of 1968 the figure was 426, while at the end of 1967 it was 10 more. Thus one can say that the figure remained more or less stable. The hon. the Minister told us about the progress they were making in appointing staff. If I look at my questions to find out about the progress that they are making in appointing staff, I see there were 97 members on the staff for this number of students. That works out at 4.5 students per member of the staff. For matriculated students, not only those who enrolled for diploma courses, there are three students to a member of the staff. It is no wonder that the staff is increasing. The number of students has decreased over the years. That is the position, Sir. And what about the costs? From the 1966-&#x2019;67 report of the Auditor-General, I have worked out that the cost to educate a matriculated student is R2,600 per annum. For the total number including diploma students who are being trained as teachers and various other professions, the cost even then comes to R1,700, which is five or six times as much as it costs for a White student. The hon. the Minister is proud of the fact that there are more people on the staff.</p>

<p>I shall have a great deal to say about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s talk about autonomy, and academic freedom, because I wish to take a very careful look at the Bill. I wish to say this in conclusion about the history of Fort Hare. It was a great blow to the alumni of Fort Hare, men not only of South Africa, but also of the Territories that are now independent <span class="col_2055-2056" refersTo="page_1050"/>states and even from farther north, from Zambia and Tanzania who had come to this centre of culture, namely Fort Hare, when they received news that we had destroyed it to make of it a Xhosa group college.</p>

<p>I have said a word about the cost and I now want to say what one ought to look for in a university, because the hon. the Minister tells us that we are going to create a university. I have jotted down what I think one should have. First of all, one should ask what the status of the institution should be. The hon. the Minister has spoken about the status of the institution. He said that it is even better than it used to be and that we are now going to have a measure of autonomy. Clause 3 gives that and I shall come to it. The next thing we should discuss is how a university is normally constituted and how the university is constituted under this Bill. We shall discuss the constitution and the powers of the council which is being dealt with in clause 8. Also to be discussed is the constitution and the powers of the senate which the Minister has referred to. That is being dealt with in clause 10. The staff of the university and the method of financing are also being dealt with and at the end of the Bill we come to the chancellor and the rector. I should like to say a word about each of those because that is what the constitution of the university is, as given to us by the Minister. Let us, firstly, deal with the status of the university, which is defined in clause 3. Clause 3 has four subsections of which subsection 1 is quite a good one. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The university shall be a body corporate capable in law of suing and being sued in its own name. &#x2026;</block>

<p>We know what all that means. Let us go to subclause (2) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The university shall not without the approval of the Minister let, sell, exchange or otherwise alienate its immovable property or grant to any person any real right therein or servitude thereon.</block>

<p>The university is free to do this, provided they get the permission of the hon. the Minister! In terms of clause 3 (3) &#x201C;The University may with the approval of the Minister receive money or property by way of donation. &#x2026;&#x201D;. That means they cannot have donors without the approval of the Minister. That is fine autonomy, isn&#x2019;t it? If the Chamber of Mines should say, &#x201C;We have had Xhosas coming to the mines now for generations and we should like to make a contribution,&#x201D; they could not do it without the permission of the Minister. Subsection (4) says the Minister may acquire for the University&#x2019;s use stores and equipment; he will buy it, &#x201C;in such manner and on such conditions, as the Minister may determine.&#x201D; He will tell them what they should have. Paragraph (b) of this subsection says &#x201C;Such stores and equipment shall be controlled in a manner to be determined by the Minister&#x201D;. This will be the status of the University! I do not know if hon. members are old enough to remember a very famous cartoon in South Africa called &#x201C;The higher status&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Verhoogde Status&#x201D;. It was the famous cartoon by Boonzaaier of a baboon atop a pole. Here we have the higher status. Well, so much for the status.</p>

<p>Let us come to the constitution of the University. What does the constitution of an ordinary university consist of? We have a chancellor, a rector, and the most important body of all, namely the council, the senate, professors, lecturers, students, the registrar and his staff, convocation, which I regard as exceedingly important, and at the Witwatersrand University they recognize as part of their constitution the Students&#x2019; Representative Council. In Fort Hare they will have some of these, but their constitution will also contain two items which one will find in no other university constitution, namely an advisory council and an advisory senate. I do not know whether there is another university in the world that has such a thing. We had it in the College Constitution and now we have it here. I shall have a word to say about it in a moment.</p>

<p>I now come to the constitution of the council of the University, which is dealt with in clause 8. The constitution and the power of the council are the most important items in this proposal that we have for a university. What is the usual constitution of the council? I have jotted down here what one usually gets in the constitution of a council. You get the rector or the principal or the vice-chancellor, whatever you wish to call the senior executive officer. He sits on all committees. Then you have two representatives of the senate, which is the position here, as the Minister says. Then you have representatives of the donors who subscribe money to the institution. Then you have representatives of convocation. Those are the men who have graduated from the college, and Fort Hare has had them over a period of 50 years. They are always represented. And then, of course, the Government nominates members as well. In addition to that we have certain local bodies. If hon. members wish, I can read to them the constitutions of Stellenbosch University or the Witwatersrand or Cape Town. These are the three I can quote because they all had consolidating Bills in 1959, which was the vintage year for university legislation. We find them all in volume 1; they are all there. That is what we usually expect at a university. Let us now take a look at this proposal of the Minister.</p>

<p>What is the Minister going to give them, what is the constitution of this proposed university of the Minister? There will be a team of 11. One will be the rector, two will be representatives of the Senate, and eight will be nominated by the Minister. That is fine autonomy, isn&#x2019;t it? That is the proposal for this university! Eight of them will be <span class="col_2057-2058" refersTo="page_1051"/>representatives of the Government. That makes eleven all told. I do not know whether it will be like the present college where it is a &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I said when I gave the outline that you would have representatives of the Government. You have them at Stellenbosch and Cape Town, at every university, because the taxpayer, through the Government, is the biggest subscriber. They have to have representation. But let me say this, that in two of the universities here, the representation of the Government is less than the representation of convocation. They are only a section in any real modem university.</p>

<p>I do not want to say what the constitution should be, but I will give the Minister one or two suggestions. I suggest there should be representatives of the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei. Why not? Do you remember the legislation of 1963, six years ago? In this legislation we said&#x2014;I quote from Act No. 48 of 1963&#x2014;&#x201C;And whereas the Transkeian Territorial Authority has requested that more comprehensive powers of self-government be entrusted to the Bantu of the Transkei &#x2026; and whereas it is desirable to grant further powers &#x2026;&#x201D; This Act also said they &#x201C;will protect and develop their own culture &#x2026; &#x201D;, this university culture. They have a Minister of Education in the Transkei. Must this Minister in this House dominate the whole situation in the Transkei?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>They are in the advisory council.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>That is one suggestion I can make. What about the Ciskei Territorial Authority? Shouldn&#x2019;t they have representation? Shouldn&#x2019;t convocation? I put that to the Minister. Convocation must be represented. The men who have passed through Fort Hare and are graduates should be represented there, too. I can suggest others. One whom I think you should have is a representative of Rhodes University because of their historical association. I do not know about donors, I do not know what donors there are. But it is customary in all universities to have representatives of donors. This council of the Minister, because it is not the council of a university, may suit his university college.</p>

<p>Now I come to this advisory council, dealt with in clause 9. They have had this body from the beginning. Why is there an advisory council? Because under the policy of apartheid or separate development or separate freedom, or parallel development, whatever you like to call it, a Black man cannot sit on the council with White men! They can be on the same staff but they cannot sit on the same council. Afrikaans-speaking professors from their universities gave our Commission the following point of view. They said if a man was not prepared to sit with a non-White representative, with a Xhosa from the Transkei, then he should not offer himself, he should not accept appointment. He should be free to decline. But if a man wishes to serve, as they served for 43 years, why shouldn&#x2019;t he? Why does the Minister want an advisory council to advise? It is humiliating for these people to be told, &#x201C;You cannot sit on the council of your own university; you must sit in an &#x2018;advisory&#x2019; body.&#x201D; That is the Minister&#x2019;s idea of an advisory council. The Minister told us how very useful it was, what a great asset it was. Four years ago I raised in this House the question of an African lecturer of that college who had been dealt with under the disciplinary regulations. He was charged: an inquiry was held, and he was dismissed. The Minister of Bantu Education, after a good deal of pressure, gave me a report of the proceedings which I have never used in the House because we thought at the time the case was <i>sub judice.</i> I asked the Minister of Bantu Education whether the advisory council had been consulted, and his reply was, &#x201C;They were informed.&#x201D; Subsequently, on the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, I came back to it again and I asked him, &#x201C;Why was this advisory council not consulted?&#x201D; He replied and said because the advisory council was not in session. But, Sir, neither was the council in session: they sent down representatives of the council. In other words, on a most important issue, on the question of discipline applied to an African lecturer, and there are not many of them there, the advisory council was not even consulted. I do not think very much of that. I think the whole idea of an advisory council in this case of the Fort Hare College is humiliating to those people.</p>

<p>I now come to the senate, dealt with in clause 10. The senate is the academic body of the university. What is the customary constitution of the senate of a university? We have professors and the heads of the departments, where there is not a professor at the head of a department. To preserve this liaison with the council there are usually two representatives of the council. And, of course, there is the rector or the principal; he always sits there. Let us now look at clause 10 (1) (c) that the Minister referred to, where we had a little altercation for a moment or two. Listen to what they have there. They have the usual people, the rector of the university, two people from the council, and then we find in paragraph (c)&#x2014;&#x201C;such professors and senior lecturers of the University as the council may from time to time designate for the purpose &#x2026;&#x201D;. Do we get the picture, Mr. Speaker? The Minister appoints the council, and the council appoints the senate. Yet he says this is autonomy! This is the autonomy of an African college! Let us go on. I asked the Minister about clause 10 (2), but I will deal with that when we come to the Committee Stage. That is the position we are in at present.</p>

<p><span class="col_2059-2060" refersTo="page_1052"/>Now we come to the figurehead of the university, and we have some very fine men in this office in this country; that is the chancellor. You know, Disraeli said once, Mr. Speaker, looking across at the government benches, that the Ministers he saw in the government benches were like &#x201C;a row of extinct volcanoes.&#x201D; Well, there is nothing like that about the front bench over there. I see a row of volcanic active chancellors. Let us take them from right to left. I see the chancellor of Potchefstroom University, then I see the chancellor of Port Elizabeth University, the chancellor of Stellenbosch University, the chancellor of the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit, and there I see the chancellor of Pretoria University, too. Now we are going to have three more for the three Bantu universities. We have a Minister and two Deputy Ministers. So what chance do people here like myself have?</p>

<p>How should a chancellor be elected? How is he elected at Stellenbosch? We have Stellenbosch graduates here and they know. How is he elected at U.C.T.? How is he elected on the Witwatersrand? All in the same way, namely by convocation.</p>

<p>The MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION. And at Potchefstroom?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I said at the beginning that when quoting from universities&#x2019; constitutions I am going to quote from those I have consulted to check what I am saying, and I mentioned three universities. Potchefstroom is unique among our universities, as we know. If hon. members had been here when we were discussing the Potchefstroom University Bill and had heard the argument here on Christian National Education, they would know. I do not know what the position is like at Pretoria; probably it is the same as the others. These men who have passed through a university have the tradition of the university, and they decide who is going to be the chancellor, who is going to be the head. So much for the chancellor.</p>

<p>Now I come to the rector. I think we pall him the rector here, or the principal, and so on. There is no doubt about who is going to choose the rector. Not even the council this time, but the hon. the Minister. Let us get the picture complete. The Minister will appoint the council; the council will select the senate; the Minister will also appoint the rector. Therefore, how the Minister to any extent has divested himself of his authority, I cannot see. I think he will now have a firmer grip on the whole thing than ever.</p>

<p>We are going to have a very good time during the Committee Stage. There will be a little bit of in-fighting, because we will have a lot to say.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I come to the question of the advisory senate. Nothing in any university&#x2019;s organization can be absurd as this. Here we have white men and black men on the same staff. Black men may be professors, but they can only be in the advisory senate. You may have white lecturers who are heads of the department. This principle is laid down as a rule, but when the hon. the Minister replied to a question of mine this week he said that there were not enough black people who qualify for the advisory senate. An advisory senate is not only a humiliation for these members of the academic staff, but the whole idea is farcical. To say to a man who is a professor at a university, a learned and an educated man, that he cannot sit in the senate of his own university&#x2014;I cannot find a word better than &#x201C;farcical&#x201D; to describe it. The sooner we get rid of this the better. I think the hon. the Minister is getting rid of it because he said very clearly that there will be an advisory senate only if he thinks it necessary. Nowhere in the Bill is it mentioned that the advisory senate or the advisory council will be black and that the others will be white, but it was mentioned during the original debate. When we discussed it during the debate&#x2014;and I have it all here if anyone wants it quoted&#x2014;we were told that this was necessary in order to preserve the sacred cow, apartheid. It was said that there must be apartheid and that white and black could not sit together. They cannot sit together in an African college, that is the story.</p>

<p>I will now go on to the question of the rector. I have told the House what my thoughts are in connection with this, but what occurs to me now is what we should do with this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill is of a kind we have never had before us before. When we had similar Bills ten years ago, hon. members on both sides of the House said they would like to have more information, and that they would like to meet people who could assist them. Representatives from all the universities were then met and in the case of Fort Hare we met members of their council and members of their staff. We also met professors from other universities. It was a most interesting experience. Before we take the step to say that Fort Hare will become a university with a handful of students, and considering the great sums of money that have been spent for the little that has been achieved, we want a further investigation. In this regard I should like hon. members on this side of the House to assist me. Let us go from this House to meet the people who are concerned. I, personally, would like to hear what the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei has to say, and especially the Minister <span class="col_2061-2062" refersTo="page_1053"/>of Education. I should also like to know what the territorial authority of the Ciskei has to say. I should like to know what these professors, whom the hon. the Minister has nominated to the council (because the council is a council, broadly speaking, consisting of Afrikaans-language professors), have to say because there are some very fine men amongst them. I can mention names of men who have assisted us in the past. One of them from Potchefstroom is a man I regard as one of the greatest educationists I have known in South Africa. The name of this person is Professor Chris Coetzee. As I have said, I should like to meet these people. I do not know how the hon. the Minister feels, but is there any reason why we should not? Should we not say that we should like to know what they think about this university college and the improvements we can make? I have never been there since the days of the old Fort Hare. I was there when I served on the Select Committee, but I have never been there since. I should like to go again to see the changes, but I have never been invited. (Laughter). One can say &#x201C;This university college Bill is not a university Bill. Throw it out.&#x201D; What would happen if we were to do that? That would be saying, &#x201C;We do not want anything to do with it.&#x201D;, &#x201C;We want to wash our hands of the whole thing.&#x201D; I cannot persuade myself to do this. I find this Bill difficult to accept as it is; I know we shall try to improve it in the Committee Stage, but what is the obvious answer? There is only one answer, i.e. this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee before the Second Reading. I should like to be with the same colleagues as I have been serving with on the Select Committee on the Teachers&#x2019; Training Bill. In such a Select Committee I would again meet them. Therefore, I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the order for the Second Reading of the University of Fort Hare Bill be discharged and that the subject of the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report, the Committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers and to have leave to bring up an amended Bill&#x201D;.</block>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that we listened very attentively to the very clear explanation of the hon. the Minister in his comprehensive Second-Reading speech. I thought all by myself that there would not be one Opposition member who would not be sufficiently alert to listen attentively to and take in to good effect the Minister&#x2019;s words and his fine explanation. But in spite of my high expectations the Opposition nevertheless did not listen attentively!</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Kensington&#x2019;s speech is concerned, there is only one point on which I agree with him, but further I differ from him throughout. Where, at the end of his speech, the hon. member referred to Professor Chris Coetzee as a great educationist, I agree with him, because I also knew Professor Chris Coetzee as such, and I still know him personally.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington ranged far and wide and went very deeply into the matter of the historic background of the minority report prior to the passing of the Extension of University Education Bill in 1959. As far as that aspect was concerned, the hon. member for Kensington could just as well have made the same speech he made in 1959. The hon. member is opposing this legislation on precisely the same grounds as the Opposition did at that time. They must, of course, be consistent and that is why he does it. The hon. member referred here to the fact that no provision was made for certain fields of study at the University College of Fort Hare; he referred here to the medical faculty and others. This is fortunately not the point of discussion to-day, but I refer to it because the hon. member did so. But that portion of the 1959 Act remains&#x2014;it is not necessary for me to enlighten my old teacher on this point. The hon. member ought to know why non-Whites are still admitted to certain universities in respect of certain fields of study. But it is only done under certain conditions and circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member became very technical in the last half of his speech and I am of the opinion that he could just as well have made that last part of his speech during the Committee Stage, because he dealt with virtually each clause here. You know, there is an old saying that one is never too old to learn, but I, as an ex-pupil, must now say that my exteacher&#x2014;he was a mathematics teacher&#x2014;has really become too old to learn anything more. In the course of the years he closed his eyes and his ears to what was actually taking place. Therefore I want to say to-day that the United Party&#x2019;s approach to this matter, through the mouth of the hon. member for Kensington, is actually negative, unrealistic and once more biased. I want to state that the attitude of the Opposition, through the mouth of the hon. member for Kensington, is really anachronistic and that its judgment is still politically coloured and ill-considered. Mr. Speaker, you know that ten years ago, i.e. on 26th February, 1959, the Opposition opposed permission to introduce the Extension of University Education Bill. The same hon. member was one of the most important speakers on that occasion. At the Second-Reading Debate the Opposition also moved an amendment&#x2014;an amendment which, in certain facets and principles, boiled down to what the hon. member now proposed. On 8th April, 1959, the Opposition moved&#x2014;I only quote from the portion which has a bearing on our debate to-day:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the proposed institutions for higher education for non-White persons will not have the standing of universities, nor will they enjoy the academic freedom traditionally associated with a university.</block>

<p><span class="col_2063-2064" refersTo="page_1054"/>In essence this is the same as what the hon. member is now requesting. On the one hand the establishment of such institutions was opposed, and on the other hand concern was expressed about the status and the much-vaunted so-called academic freedom of the university colleges that were to be established. Basically, through the mouth of the hon. member for Kensington, the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude is still the same. Now, after a lapse of ten years, the Opposition has not yet accepted Bantu university colleges, as dealt with in this connection. In their speeches in public and in the House&#x2014;during the period in which it has been my privilege to sit here&#x2014;they have merely raised destructive criticism throughout. They did not want to afford these university colleges an opportunity of proving themselves; they did not want these university colleges to be a success. Throughout the years, outside and inside this House, they have suspiciously and scornfully spoken of &#x201C;tribal colleges&#x201D;&#x2014;at the present moment they still talk of &#x201C;colleges of the bush&#x201D;, &#x201C;ethnic non-White colleges&#x201D;, or indoctrinated colleges.</p>

<p>The United Party reminds me of an expression which I read in connection with the history of the French Bourbons. I hope I quote it correctly. It was said of Bourbon kings: &#x201C;They forgot nothing, but they also learnt nothing.&#x201D; This is also the case with the United Party. In the course of the past few years they have become none the wiser in respect of the higher education of the non-White peoples in South Africa. In the course of the years the United Party has adjusted its attitude towards the Bantu university colleges to, and brought it into line with, the prejudice with which they were obsessed in 1959. They are still engaged in this type of destructive criticism which they already expressed presumptuously at that time. The Act is made to serve an ideology, according to what the Opposition said then and still says now. They then said&#x2014;and they apparently still do, because the hon. member referred to apartheid in his speech&#x2014;that the colleges are actually trying to comply with the aims of the Government. They maintained that the Government has established the colleges in order to implement its policy, and to satisfy its ideological aims. It was then also maintained, and it is now being done again, that if the principle of autonomy of the colleges were to be deviated from, it would merely create suspicion among the non-Whites. They believe that suspicion will be created because the non-Whites will think that they are being discriminated against.</p>

<p>The Opposition&#x2019;s main speaker on these matters maintained recently, according to a report which I read, that these Bills did indeed appear to be university legislation, but that there was no sign in them of the elements which makes a university an autonomous body. This is also what the hon. member conveyed in his speech to-day. I want to say that it is altogether a Rip van Winkel view. It is an altogether obdurate view, because even if we compare this Bill with the Bill of the Rand Afrikaans University, and of the University of Port Elizabeth, we note that there are elements in this Bill which are in complete agreement with those in respect of the new White universities.</p>

<p>But I should like to indicate a conspicuous new facet which appears in this legislation. I regard it as very important. The academic detachment of the University of South Africa is being brought about by this legislation. Now the universities can draw up their own syllabuses. They can even conduct their own examinations and issue certificates. This in itself is an important and a tremendous step forward. I now ask those hon. members whether they do not agree with me. The syllabuses of these colleges, and also of Fort Hare, have up to now been seen through the eyes of the Whites. The syllabuses were drawn up by the University of South Africa. But the University of South Africa did, after all, also ensure and agree that adjustments be made. This is what is now taking place progressively. We know that the syllabuses can now be adjusted to the population groups&#x2019; own identity and national needs. In other words, the syllabuses of Fort Hare and also the other colleges can be more nationally orientated.</p>

<p>But in addition to that the Opposition is of the opinion that there is an underminig of autonomy. Sir, an attempt is surely not being made to break down academic standards. On the contrary, a special attempt is being made to guarantee academic standards. Since the Opposition have, in the past, specifically alleged that academic standards would be lowered, here now is a guarantee. Since the hon. member referred so frequently to clauses, I just want to quote one of these clauses. This is also the only clause which I shall quote in my speech. Clause 30, <i>inter alia,</i> reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">An examination or other test of the university shall be conducted under the control of the senate and subject to the provision of the statute: Provided that &#x2026; the services of external examiners or moderators appointed by the council on the recommendation of the senate shall be utilized.</block>

<p>I now ask whether the Opposition is opposed to that. The Opposition prophesied at the time, and the hon. member now referred to it again, that these Bantu university colleges, <i>inter alia</i> Fort Hare, would not be able to be filled. In other words, they prophesied that there would not be sufficient students. In addition they prophesied that the standards would be lowered, by comparison with the standards at the White universities. This same Opposition, which was so continually concerned about the standards, must, if it wants to be at all consistent, now praise this guarantee. It is not a curtailment of the so-called autonomy. I believe that the staff of this university, and also of Fort Hare, yes, even the White lecturers there, welcome this measure. Every lecturer and professor will surely want to subject his examination and work standards to the <span class="col_2065-2066" refersTo="page_1055"/>objective judgments of persons connected with the independent universities. Such persons will be able to serve as external examiners and moderators. They will specifically see these persons as helpers, and not so much as critics and controllers.</p>

<p>The Opposition also prophesied that there would not be progress as far as numbers were concerned. It is striking that they were such hopeless prophets. I now want to quote some statistics in dealing with the matter of the numbers of students. It is interesting to note that in the 11 years from 1948 to 1959, before this Act in respect of the Bantu university colleges came into force, the number of Bantu students who registered at both White residential universities, to which they were admitted, and the University of Fort Hare, increased from 365 to 619. This was an increase of about 70 per cent. It represents an average annual growth rate of about 6.4 per cent. By comparison with this, the number of Bantu students who are still admitted to White universities, plus students at Fort Hare and the other two university colleges, increased from 1959 to 1966 from 619 to 1,302. This is an increase of 683, and it represents an increase of about 109 per cent over seven years, which is a growth rate of about 15.6 per cent annually. I may just say that in 1967, 1,313 Bantu registered at the various Bantu university colleges. In 1968 the number of students of the three Bantu university colleges was 1,431. Now I just want to make this observation. The number of students at present at Fort Hare perhaps appears to be less than it was at that time, i.e. in 1959, but we must remember, and it is very important to know this, that at that time Fort Hare also admitted Coloured students as well as Indian students. As a result of the establishment of the non-White university colleges for each population group, those numbers naturally decreased. Therefore it does appear as if there was a decline. However, there was a tremendous increase in numbers from 1959 to the present moment.</p>
